<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely love this gel!! Within 1 week my fine line under my eyes were smoothed out! Great product, great price! I also bought the serum which is awesome too! Next the moisturzer.</li>
    <li> Good product. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> It is a non irritating, moisturizing , firming gel that works very well indeed.  I like this product  a lot.  And it is far less expensive than other products out there which have chemicals added; chemicals which can irritate more than work!  This product is without chemical additives. That is rare to find.  It is very much worth your trying!  Also, it lasts long in the bottle.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I had these bags and creases under my eyes.  They are gone after 4 days of use!!! So happy!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Noticed a subtle difference after just a few days, which is great in comparison to other products I&#x27;ve tried. Have already recommended to friends.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, does tighten and smooth out wrinkles</li>
    <li> Small for the price. I used one pump a day, lasted less than a month. Worked OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty much anything I have tried works well if I am consistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked as well as a collagen creme which is about 6$ for a 3 month supply that I can really use generously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you really care about organic it might be worth it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find it works as well has the Philosophy cream, but it does moisturize. Most gels dry out the under eye from my experience, just because it&#x27;s trying so hard to tighten it. This doesn&#x27;t do that, but it doesn&#x27;t really get rid of dark circles or fill the minor line under it. It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m seeing a very nice firming of the skin around my eyes.  The gel also feels great when I&#x27;m applying it.  I plan to continue using this product.</li>
    <li> I did not noticed any improvement on my eyes after using the entire bottle of cream</li>
    <li> This is my second order of this product.  I love the feel and the scent.  A little goes a long ways.  The under eye darkness may be a little improved, and it really does improve fine lines and wrinkles and makes your skin feel soft and silky.  Much better product than much more expensive designer boutique products I have tried.  It is very light, not sticky at all and I love the way my face and eye area feels afterwards - soft and silky.  I feel it also moisturizes well.  If you have not tried it, it is worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Product does what it says it will.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I give it 4 stars because the details state you can see the difference the first day. ..well I didn&#x27;t I have been using it for a month and I really see the different. I love it and I will buy another one after I finish this one.</li>
    <li> So I used this for about 6wks, I didnt really notice any changes around my eyes. I dont think this product worked for me. Maybe, I was expecting miracles to happen based off the other reviews. For reference, Latin Olive skin and 39 years young. I dont recommend if your looking to reduce fine lines, as for the dark circles, mine look the same, as for the puffiness, didnt notice any difference either. Its kind of sticky too, so I felt like my skin around my eyes was sticking together. Might work better on more youthful skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that would help with the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness. I believe that this product is just what I have been searching for. I have only been using it for a few days but I have already noticed a difference in how under my eyes is starting to look. It doesn&#x27;t even take a whole pump to do under both eyes, which is a plus because it means that my product will last me longer. It is so easy to apply and dries very quickly. There isn&#x27;t any sticky residue left behind either. I can apply makeup soon after putting the AI was looking for a product that would help with the dark circles under my eyes and the puffiness. I believe that this product is just what I have been searching for. I have only been using it for a few days but I have already noticed a difference in how under my eyes is starting to look. It doesn&#x27;t even take a whole pump to do under both eyes, which is a plus because it means that my product will last me longer. It is so easy to apply and dries very quickly. There isn&#x27;t any sticky residue left behind either. dont be discouraged if the tender area under your eyes feels unconfortable right after application, it will get better within a minute or so.</li>
    <li> I am a mother of two that do not sleep threw the night yet.  I always wake up with bags .  I have tried other eye creams before and had to discontinue use as it burned.  This did not thankfully.  It does help the appearance of my bags as I apply it every morning and am happy to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I tested this by using it on one eye and not the other.  When I got  up in the morning I could definately tell the difference. I have to be very careful to not use to much and waste the prooduct.</li>
    <li> This eye gel has been wonderful as I get little sleep with my newborn.  I love that it is a gel instead of a cream as it seems to work better and keep my the puffiness at bay after long nights.</li>
    <li> After using this item for a few weeks I can say it was worth getting so far. No smelly cream on my face but a cool, pleasant, non sticky gel. My eyes are more vibrant and my husband noticed that there were less. Circles already!</li>
    <li> This eye repair gel is helping to alleviate the dark circles under my eyes.  I am noticing the wrinkles a little bit more and am excited that I found something that will help with both dark circles and wrinkles.  It goes on nice and cool and smooth.  Dries quickly to allow me to put on my make up and head out the door.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product and so far I love it. Only set back I would say is that you do not need a full pump takes only the slightest press and so much comes out.  Very smooth and applies easily. My eyes are looking more and more awake and not so dark. I will report back in a few weeks!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! My under eye circles have cleared dramatically. I would highly recommend this serum to anyone with&lt;br /&gt;Dark under eye problems. There is little to no smell. I begin to notice results within 10 days. I use my other cosmetics right on top of it with no problem</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care how good this is, it practically has nothing in the bottle since it is such a small size!&lt;br /&gt;how can you have an opinion about a product that has no decent amount to put on for even for a week?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s funny because after using this, my bags and wrinkles were noticeable. Before using this product, I did not have wrinkles!</li>
    <li> This product work great!  You can use it anytimeof the day.</li>
    <li> This eye gel feels rich without being heavy. I just started using so I can&#x27;t attest to it working long term but it felt so good to put on with a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive eyes. I have used several different products for the eye area that have either rubbed into my eye later in the day or &amp;#34;sweated&amp;#34; into my eyes because of the heat &amp; have all stung my eyes. Because of that, I usually don&#x27;t use eye repair products.  I am pleased to say that the Amara Organics Total Repair Eye Gel has not caused my eyes any pain! Yay!!! Of course, I am not putting it directly in my eyes, but I have purposefully rubbed my eyes a lot to see if there was any issues and there have not been. The lines around my eyes have started to fill in a bit since using it. There&#x27;s a slight, natural scent that doesn&#x27;t linger very long. The gel is nice &amp; thick. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves no stickiness behind.</li>
    <li> I seem to be doing more Christmas shopping online every year.  I purchased this product for grandma&#x27;s Christmas stocking.  I hope she likes it!</li>
    <li> Thank you for a speedy delivery. I have been using the Amara Moisturizer and serum together with this amazing eye gel. I am 63 years old and I am very careful what I apply on my skin, especially around my eyes, the most sensitive area of my face. I have wrinkles on my lids and around the corners of my eyes. I also have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have tried many very expensive eye creams but none has shown improvement like the Amara Eye Gel. First of all, I like the pump. It disperses just enough gel without wasting it and it goes a long way. It glides on my eyes very smoothing and it leaves my eyes with a very refreshing and cooling sensation. I like that its very light and that it is 100% natural unlike other expensive gels that are full of chemicals and toxins that only irritate your skin. I have been using this gel now for two weeks and already the puffiness has improved. I use it at night and in the morning before makeup. I can&#x27;t wait to see what more improvement I will show after one month. i received an email with tips on how to apply the gel which was extremely helpful. Thank you for your great customer service. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything under the sun to lighten them up! This is the first eye gel that I can see an improvement. I have only been using it for a few weeks now and have already started to notice a difference. Also, a little bit goes a long way. The bottle is very small and when I first opened the package I thought I would use it all up in no time. It only takes about 1/2 a pump to cover under both my eyes so I feel the bottle will last! I recommend anyone who has dark circles under their eyes to try it out! Also, it smells great too!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is fantastic!  It goes on so smoothly, the gel makes it nice and cool on my skin.  It goes on very easily and the pump works nicely, not having to stick your hand in a jar is lovely.  It spreads well and dries quickly and without being sticky!  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet to see results but I am really hopeful as I love how it feels!</li>
    <li> This eye gel is nice and lightweight and cooling! It feels great on my tired eyes (mom of 2 boys :) ) it has no fragrance and does not irritate my eyes or contact lenses. I will say, watch the pump. It will squirt out way more than you need, if you put out a full pump. I also love that it is made in the U.S. and animal cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I will definitely repurchase! This gel is amazing. It really helps with dark circles and lines. I have been searching for months for an effective eye cream and I&#x27;ve finally found something really effective.</li>
    <li> I got this Total Repair Eye Gel by Amara Organics for my fiance to go along with the Facial Cream. She&#x27;s given her glowing opinion of both products. For this specific Eye Gel, she loves it because she says since she uses a couple things for her eyes (eye shadow and her normal base makeup), she wants something that she can put on to help rejuvenate under her eyes. According to her, she loves the pump because she can control how much she uses (she says it&#x27;s thick so pumping it out is easier to control than squeezing her old cream). It doesn&#x27;t make her skin feel too oily (she has oily skin as it is, so other products from like Walgreens have made her skin oilier). Five Stars from my beautiful fiance :)</li>
    <li> I rarely believe that a cosmetic product will do what it claims to do...but this eye gel has greatly reduced the dark circles around my eyes enough that my boyfriend, who didn&#x27;t know I was using it, told me that I looked good, the dark circles under my eyes were much better! Now I don&#x27;t cringe when I look in the mirror! I was really bothered by how dark the circles were and now there is actually a light glow where there was once darkness! It takes at least a month to show up so be patient....it&#x27;s worth it. I have given it to a few friends of mine who have started using it.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give it four and a half stars....only didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it is not totally perfect, they aren&#x27;t completely gone. But maybe more time will make the difference. If so I will come back and say so!</li>
    <li> My eyes seemed to be wrinkly after use, but maybe I needed to use it longer. I was scared to though so I stopped.</li>
    <li> it works better than high priced eye creams that&#x27;s in the market. I am allergic to mostly everything that&#x27;s out there I break into hives&lt;br /&gt;this year I decided to switch to organics so far it seems to work. I love it no more hives.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for my dark circles or my puffy eyes.  Also haven&#x27;t seen any difference in any &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; around my eyes.</li>
    <li> i am happy with my total repair eye gel-eye cream for dark circles and puffiness by amara organics. I have only used this product for several days, but I have noticed the area around my eyes improving. I was also impressed with the followup email by amara organics standing behind the quality of their product..</li>
    <li> I was very hopeful about this product, but unfortunately it did not perform the way I was hoping. I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about a month now, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel good. I can feel it tightening the skin under my eyes, but that is all it does. The gel is sticky and actually doesn&#x27;t feel soothing at all. It makes the skin under my eyes stick together and burns a little bit. Overall, I&#x27;m not too satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is by far the BEST eye cream I have ever used!  I am a tired mom of 5 and always seem to have puffy bags under my eyes which dramatically ages me.  This cream is light weight yet so &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34;.  My eyes are looking more refreshed, like I actually got enough sleep, and it has not caused any irritation to my super sensitive acne prone skin.  One pump will be way too much cream so I&#x27;d recommend 1/2 or 1/4 pumps instead.  I have used this eye cream around my eyes and on my neck because that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m aging. I have used this in combination with the Amara Organics face moisturizer (which I also highly recommend).  This will most definitely be a repeat order!</li>
    <li> This has been a go to product for puffy eyes.  I use it every morning.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and has a nice light scent of cucumber.  The bottle is small, but you only need a tiny bit and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I like Dr. Oz&#x27;s product better</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with this eye gel. I used it daily for a month and I honestly see an improvement in the lines and dark circles under my eyes. The company does a great follow up to ensure you are happy and answer any questions. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Updated - I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day, every day for nine months now.  I still have really dark circles.  So I&#x27;m downgrading from 4 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after 24 hours.  My under eye circles went from dark black to grey.  After using this product twice a day for a few months, I haven&#x27;t noticed much more of a major difference.  I still have my circles, but a little lighter.  I still apply a concealer.  It&#x27;s better than any other eye product that I have used, but I would say that I only have a 30% improvement.  But I had very black circles due to allergies.</li>
    <li> So far I can see improve in my skin n the bags under my eyes are getting&lt;br /&gt; small and a couple of my girlfriends asked what I did. I showed them the&lt;br /&gt; gel and are to order it this week. For me I will buy one for my mom.&lt;br /&gt; It really works. Congratulation for such good gel.&lt;br /&gt; Charles Martinez.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing for me and three others that I know who tried it.  Anthony B.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good under eye cream for 15 years and This has been my favorite one ever. Thanks so much! I will be recommending this to all the females in my family that have our genetically bad under eye bags :)</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Been only using it for 5 days and I cannot believe the difference. I&#x27;m using it not only around eyes but also under chin and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again!</li>
    <li> Price is right. Feels good, and helps some- feels and looks little firmer around eye, not sure of final results as not used long enough. Am continuing to use. Moisturizer is needed following.</li>
    <li> I have used many eye creams that advertise they work and then they don&#x27;t. This one does and I saw results in a short period of time. I have noticed an improvement in the appearance of dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. As soon as you apply the gel, you immediately feel the cool feel of the gel and a light tightening in the eye area. The reason I like the gel as opposed to creams is because creams tend to migrate into my eye and cause irritation. I have had none of that with this product. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I been using this for over a month now, but i don&#x27;t see any changes on eye bags. I just wish that there is a better one out there.</li>
    <li> Nice product, noticeable results.</li>
    <li> just started to use this and already it has reduced my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> You can find my review about the Vitamin C Serum. Ditto here.</li>
    <li> Great, as I have sensitive skin, this lotion does not just sit on skin it goes in and eye skin feels moist and comfortable.  Puffiness immediately feels treated.  I will order again.  Thank you for your working product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. This dark circle battle is ongoing since I am in school and work full time with a little one but I do see some benefit already and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d see more if I could get a little more sleep. I will purchase again and give another review at that time. The benefit I see it less puffy eyes and diminishing dark circles, and also eye area feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> I am very careful what i apply to my eyes because i wear contacts and sometimes find i touch my eyes. This gel is called pure rejuvenation and it really is! First off the price is awesome! The last eye gel i bought was way more and a smaller container plus it did not feel as good. When i got a chance to review this product i was all for that. The products that are in this gel is made up of is 75% organic and 100% natural and i am all for that. I have used it for a few days and have to say i love it. My eyes feel firmer and less puffy. A little bit goes a long way. It comes in a pump bottle and i love how much comes out per pump. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it actually works.  No noticeable improvements.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It feels cool to the touch, and had a tightening effect in the skin around my eyes. Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but really felt compelled to do so with Amara Organics products. This eye gel has quickly become one of my favorite products. A little goes such a long way, it is very cooling and soothing around the eye and visibly reduces puffiness. I believe my dark circles are starting to lighten up as well. I LOVE this stuff, loving the Vitamin C Serum and Moisturizer as well and will definitely re-purchase. It feels great to be using such a wonderful product on my face. Great customer service as well, very prompt and extremely helpful.</li>
    <li> amazing only one use and my skin feels amazing</li>
    <li> I am a 51 year old male who recently ended a relationship and realized how much of a toll that stress has taken on my appearance. When I looked at pictures of myself, I did not like how my eyes looked. I looked tired and run down, even when I was feeling pretty good. I was looking for something that would renew some of the youth of my skin, so I decided to try Total Repair Eye Gel. I saw positive results within a few days and I had several people compliment how less stressed I looked. I am reordering it today.</li>
    <li> Feels good and I like it!  Helps with puffiness!</li>
    <li> BUY.THIS.TODAY. I&#x27;ve tried other under eye creams with no luck. This is the only one that&#x27;s ever diminished my dark under eye coloring! And it feels so good. I use it with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin and my skin&#x27;s never looked or felt better! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The eye gel arrived when promised and is a GREAT product! No complaints at all. It&#x27;s soothing and I can feel/see results after just a few days. The only thing is I&#x27;ll run out quickly as I&#x27;ve started to apply it to my whole face!</li>
    <li> Great product! Make sure you give it time to work.  Read instructions before use</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. When applied, it did have a cooling effect the first day and appeared to make the puffy look of my eyes less puffy. However, I did notice some tingling the first day, and by the second day, I had an almost immediate full-blown burning reaction to this product, so much so I had to quickly wash the product off to calm the reaction, and still it took a day for the redness to pass. I think I may be allergic to something in the ingredient list, which is unusual as I don&#x27;t usually have eyes that are that sensitive. It may work for others, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to discourage others from trying, it&#x27;s just not the right product for me. Had to return product.</li>
    <li> I have used for 4 nights now, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes from this product.  Maybe with time, it will improve.  Still using this product, but find that the 24K facial mask and eye mask&#x27;s work better for the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I like this cream!  I does help with puffiness around the eyes!  I put it on every morning for the last 2 weeks - - and it helps get rid of it after a couple hours.  My skin around my eyes feels nice and soft!  I would order again!</li>
    <li> Amara Eye Cream is very hydrating.  I was having severe dryness under my eye area and this has taken care of the problem.  My dark circles are hereditary so there isn&#x27;t much it can do for those.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The texture of this product is much better than any others I&#x27;ve used!  Most eye creams are slimy, but since this is a gel it goes on smooth and absorbs nicely.  I used it for the first time after two nights of very little sleep and I noticed a decrease in puffiness the first day!  Be careful when you push down the pump because a lot will come out - you only need a little!  This bottle is going to last me a long time!</li>
    <li> Love Ellie! Learned many things watching her programs.!</li>
    <li> one of the most wonderful natural products I have used on my face;clean, organic, wonderful fragrance. I recomend it very highly and the owners are really concerned about our satisfaction.</li>
    <li> it often stings the skin around my eyes. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, either.</li>
    <li> I’ve been experimenting with different face creams and serums. Total Repair Eye Gel by Amara Organics is a lightweight gel formula is packed with powerful ingredients to address all eye area concerns. It contains cooling cucumber which instantly soothes and awakens puffy eyes. Hyaluronic Acid plumps and hydrates while peptides and plant stem cells rejuvenate skin on a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powerful anti-aging formula works great as an all over face and neck treatment. Excellent to use on the forehead, around the lips, laugh lines, and neck to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, plump, firm, and hydrate skin. Also great for hands to slow aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Gel has the consistency of Aloe and smells like cucumbers. I really like it. A little goes a long way, so apply it gingerly. As it dries it made my skin feel a little tight, but shortly there after I didn’t notice it as much so there was no discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product Complimentary for evaluation purposes. All opinions expressed are still 100% my own.

    <li> This right here i been looking for it preety good and make your area smooth</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in Feb, 2015 and am happy with the results thus far. I&#x27;ve had dark circles my whole life and have spent a significant amount of money trying to make them go away. While this product has not completely eliminated them; the are not as apparent as they use to be. I have come to accept there probably is not a single product on the market that will truly eliminate dark circles, but I am going to continue using this product because it does more than just lighten dark circles. I have fine lines under my eyes and I have noticed a drastic change in them to the point where they are almost non-existent. I apply a small amount every morning before applying my concealer. I give it some time to dry and it does not interfere with how the concealer sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoy that this product is natural and organic and made in the USA!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice -- I have bad dark circles -- doesn&#x27;t really help that as much as I would like, but has improved texture and tone of lids and under eye areas.  Smells nice too.  I like this product.</li>
    <li> It reduced my dark eye circles quite a bit.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have proved brands like chanel, image, dermalogica and for my own experience i can say this product for my eyes is better than those other brands.  It is refreshing, you can feel it in the moment you apply it.  I would buy it again. I recommend it 100%. I am 42 years old, i am White and my skin is sensitive. I hope my experience helps you.</li>
    <li> My first thoughts/opinions on this product is that it feels very nice/cooling/gentle when applied around the eyes. It makes my eyes feel more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;. After being applied, the skin around my eyes feels tighter/smoother, but not in an uncomfortable way. I can not state if this reduces wrinkles, fine lines or under eye bags yet because I have only been using this product for a few days. However, my immediate review is that it is a very good and high quality product, at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I am just about out so I just re-ordered (along with the moisturizer).  I battle w/ insomnia so I tend to have dark circles under my eyes - which doesn&#x27;t bother me that much because my makeup can disguise them.  It is the puffiness I don&#x27;t like.  I never expect quick fixes with these over the counter products but I do have to say that my puffy eyes not only looked instantly better, they felt better.  The dark circles improved in about 4 days and in about week two I did see less wrinkles (don&#x27;t have a lot to start with but nice not to hardly see them at all).</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!  I was very pleased that this product did as described.  I did not have dark circles, but I did have the puffiness and I was quite surprised that it worked.  I use it at night when I go to bed and the puffiness was minimized and then I use it in the morning before I put my makeup on and the puffiness subsided.  I will reorder.</li>
    <li> I use this around my eyes and I also apply it to the fine lines on my forehead. It’s moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I only use a small dab and it spreads easily. The refreshing feeling it gives my eyes is enough for me to keep using it, but I’ve also seen an improvement in dark circles and puffiness. I look forward to more results with continued use.</li>
    <li> I used it for 3 weeks but didn&#x27;t see the result I wanted but they gave money back</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now.  From the very first application, the area under my eyes felt so rejuvenated.  Even right now I see the darkness lightening up.  The gel is very light and easy to apply.  I believe it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Works great even after only a few applications</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, my eyelids are getting sagging, I have no wrinkles around my eyes, but I&#x27;m having that problem already, this product is a light gel, when you apply it feels so refreshing, I feel the skin around my eyes more firm and hydrated. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic. I felt and could see a difference after the first use. Easy to put on and takes only a very small amount. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> great eye cream, goes on nicely and absorbs well, does not gum up on you if put on under other makeup, refreshing.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff for my husband, who has trouble with purple circles and puffiness, and have noticed a pretty big difference in his under eye area since he started using.  After a late night recently, I woke up with extremely puffy eyes so I decided to try it myself.  Within minutes of applying, my eyes looked completely normal!  I was really surprised by how quickly it worked, and how gentle and soothing it feels.  Great product.</li>
    <li> if used everyday you see the difference around your eyes.  dark circles almost gone.</li>
    <li> excellent product for dark circles!!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is amazing! I never thought I would find a product that would reduce the dark circles under my eyes. It did just that. I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and every night for almost a month now and I see a difference. It comes in a small bottle but it&#x27;s enough; you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot under each eye so it does last a while. Would buy again! :)</li>
    <li> I now use all of Amara Organics products.&lt;br /&gt;These products are CLEAN and have everything needed for healthy skin - especially as you are aging.  Who would have thought that the ingredients such as hyraulic acid, peptides, Vit C, Matryxl, etc. could be put into products without all the bad ingredients that high end costly skin care products have?&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this line a little over 4 weeks now and it works much faster and is more effective than the high end products - I believe the lack of added chemicals is the reason.</li>
    <li> I tried this product because I am trying to change to healthier options. I am looking forward to trying your other products.  I had stopped using makeup and creams for several months and noticed a significant improvement in fine lines. The eye gel is very gental on the eye area and my dark circles are improving.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quick. The packaging was sufficient. The product has a great texture and keeps my eye area moisturize specially since I live in a dry mountainous claima item arrived quick. The packaging was sufficient. The product has a great texture and keeps my eye area moisturize especially since I live in a dry mountainous climate. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week but I do notice that my eyes arm well moisturize climate. I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for about a week but I do notice that The area around my eyes are better moisturized. I like how the product is organic</li>
    <li> Made my skin tight &amp; dry, wrinkles were more noticeable. Dark circles became more noticeable, too. Went back to other amino-peptide eye cream I was using, saw immediate improvement.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and it moisturizes without making my face feel greasy BUT unfortunately it has not helped lighten my dark circles at all.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is the easiest way to kiss those dark circles or splotches good-bye (and I don&#x27;t just mean around your eyes). From a bad night&#x27;s rest to an unsightly bruise, this cream is fantastic! Pump the bottle, dab on the affected area, and rub in a gentle upward circular motion. Watch: It&#x27;s like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure; the ingredients aren&#x27;t all organic like other formulas, but this one also doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg either. This eye gel does what it promises without unfortunate odor or side-effects, so I think it is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quality-tested this product for the manufacturer. I have no financial stake in the product or the manufacturer&#x27;s success. I hope my review helped you with your purchasing decision.</li>
    <li> Great eye gel for dry and mature skins. If you have allergies and need something soothing for your eye area, this us a great eye gel! The fragrance is wonderful and it instantly calms your skin. It also helps minimize fine lines and makes your eye area look a lot brighter.</li>
    <li> I have to tell you that I&#x27;m very impressed with this  product.&lt;br /&gt;I work long hours in the film industry it take a toll on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The bags under my eyes were starting to look horrible and it was making me very unhappy. I used a few other products with no good results. I searched Amazon and I found your highly rated product.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use of Total Repair Eye Gel And the bags under my eyes were gone! I&#x27;m super happy and very impressed!! I will be definitely be back for more when supply runs out. I will also add a review to the Amazon page too! Finally a product that lives up to it&#x27;s reviews!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;MG</li>
    <li> I started using this about 3 monthes ago in place of olay eye gel..  Wow I love this product no irritation makeup goes over it smoothly..  It absorbs so nice and has made a difference on my 44 year old eyes!  Love the company as well!  Thank you Amara organics!</li>
    <li> The best eye gel I&#x27;ve found so far. Using with other Amara products and very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Good cream, I like it very much, less wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any diference</li>
    <li> Great texture, not too heavy or sticky.  Feels great on, very soothing.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work well.  Has a nice balanced texture (not too oily or too dry).  SOME lotions leave you with a vague sense of their presence on your skin.  This one does not, which is nice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream with the hopes of it reducing the eye bags and wrinkles under my eyes.  It&#x27;s been two months now and I see no significant improvement.  Even though they said give it 3 to 6 months for it to &amp;#34;work its magic&amp;#34;, I have seen absolutely no indication of an improvement happening.  I gave it 3 stars because I believe the hyaluronic acid has helped in hydrating and plumping my face, but other than that, based on other reviews I have read, it has done nothing for my under eye puffiness and wrinkles.  I don&#x27;t think I will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Very good product and generates good results!</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Love how it feels under my eyes!</li>
    <li> Love this eye cream, felt light around eye area, not heavy or greasy. Love that it is all natural. Looking forward to continued use, and hopefully quick results.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is wonderful. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, so I can use it both at night and in the morning before applying my makeup. I have very fair skin that shows dark circles any time I&#x27;m tired. This drastically reduced the dark circles. I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I have adopted a vegan lifestyle (for life!)&lt;br /&gt;and are more particularly sure to use only plant-based, cruelty free&lt;br /&gt;products everywhere in my life and I was excited to find your product.&lt;br /&gt;It has really exceeded my expectations, honestly.  I think my healthier&lt;br /&gt;choices INCLUDING using your eye product have helped improve the aging&lt;br /&gt;effects on my face.  I will be ordering consistently with Amara Organics as&lt;br /&gt;long as you continue to provide these cruelty-free, super quality natural&lt;br /&gt;products!</li>
    <li> Great product and their customer service is fantastic. Very light (though moisturizes very well) and excellent for sensitive eye area. I have dark circles and very sensitive,  dry skin prone to inflammations and wrinkles so I absolutely loved it. They actually send me an email with instructions on how to use it properly to maximize the effect. Will try their other products.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the cream and it makes my face feel refreshed</li>
    <li> Good gel. Little goes a long way and consistency is nice.</li>
    <li> I bought this to reduce puffiness and dark circles. I also happened to have a small skin tag right under the eye that I figured I would have to go to a dermatologist to remove if it got bigger. After applying this product for a couple weeks, the skin around my eyes seemed brighter. Also, to my surprise, the skin tag under my eye disappeared!</li>
    <li> This is really nice, it works great. I do not need to use much, just a dab around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This  product has some affect to skin but it not to be amazed about results are not that good.</li>
    <li> I started noticing results in a litte as a week, the bags under my eyes starting being less noticeable and eventually non existant. Also a remarkable improvement in brightness around the eyes, no longer look tired &amp; exhausted, crows feet are also less noticeable than before.  You will not be disappointed with this product, the best all-in-one eye cream I have tried.</li>
    <li> Love it! Will order again</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for 4 months. I dont see a difference. My suggestion is to drink at least 64oz of water a day and get around 8 hours of sleep.</li>
    <li> I felt the difference immediately.  I&#x27;ve used many eye cream products in the past, and never saw results as quickly as with this.  I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this did not bother my skin at all or make it red.  I highly recommend the product for those who need some help with under the eyes.  Seller also sent me an email with directions on the best way to use this product for the most noticeable results.</li>
    <li> My eyes are less Buffy and dry</li>
    <li> I use the eye gel in the evening because it is rather viscous, and I like lighter treatments in the morning before I go out.</li>
    <li> love it. very effective and work great on me.</li>
    <li> This is a great eye gel that I put on before I go to bed - I wake up with a refreshed face! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered my second jar.  I really DO love it!  Two squtiches (what do you call a pump of stuff??) is enough for my whole face.  It seems to tighten things up without feeling tight or mask-y. Without the sags under my eyes the dark circles aren&#x27;t so noticeable.  I&#x27;m sure there will be more in my future!  XO!</li>
    <li> Wow! This stuff is wonderful! What&#x27;s not to love?? Organic, feels good going on and best of all it decreases under eye puffiness and even decreases fine lines around the eyes!! And you can use it on your forehead, around your mouth, on your neck and your decolletage! LOVE!</li>
    <li> No benefit for puffiness or dark circles</li>
    <li> I have used this for over 3 weeks now. Have not seen any improvement for my eye bags. It does seem to tighten the skin a little.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing in one month took dark circle away .is works very good I will recommend it for every body</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer but it doesn&#x27;t help with lines or dark circles around eyes. Goes on smooth. Feels refreshing but it hasn&#x27;t helped with bags under eyes either. I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Talk about game changing. I wish I took proper before/after photos because there is an obvious difference after a week of use. My eyes are much much less puffy and my dark circles don&#x27;t bother me at all. I follow up this with the Amara serum and then the moisturizer. My skin LOVES this stuff. About to be 30 and my skin looks like I turned back a little time. Gentle so far. No clogged pores, no breakouts, and the bottle is a perfect size. Can&#x27;t sing the praises enough.</li>
    <li> This eye gel works quickly to smooth the wrinkles. The first time I put it on I could feel it&#x27;s tightening effect. There is no odor at all. It also pairs well with the Anti-aging face cream moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel.  I got it along with the moisturizer and the two together make a great pair.  I have always had dark circles around my eyes and it has made me self conscious so when I saw this eye gel and saw that it was all natural and organic I knew I had to try it, I am glad that I did.  After only a couple of weeks I am already noticing a difference.  I love that the scent is not overwhelming and that the feel of it is light and airy and not greasy or sticky. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> love it! feels good going on, lightens darks spots, for puffiness  around eyes,and makes your skin feel great!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Not only does it not work, it made my skin break out in a red burning rash.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for the puffiness or the dark circles.  I&#x27;m happy for those who got good results...I certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Let me say first of all I have only left a four star rating instead of five for the simple fact that I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to tell how well it works in the long run.  I&#x27;ve only been using the Amara Organics for a little over a week.  It feels velvety on the skin and already seems to be smoothing the areas where I have been applying it. So in time it may prove to be a 5 star rating that it truly deserves, but for now I&#x27;ll say  it&#x27;s off to a very good start.&lt;br /&gt; What I like is the purity of Amara products,  and without any added fragrance, which is of high importance to me. My family insists that Skin should smell clean, and this product is keeping that intact while nourishing and improving my skin. It&#x27;s a great combination, a wonderful product, and I plan to try out their other products in the near future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a new eye cream. I like that this is a gel and can help suck in the bags under my eyes.  I just started using so I hope to see good results.  Lightweight feeling.</li>
    <li> I have had dark eye circles since I was a kid and am always looking for a good way to minimize them.  But I also won&#x27;t put toxic stuff on my skin.  I&#x27;m really happy with the ingredients in this product.  I started using it a few days ago around my eyes and I&#x27;m happy with how it&#x27;s working so far.  A tiny drop goes a long way so this bottle will last quite some time.  i&#x27;m hoping over the coming weeks/months, I&#x27;ll see even better results on my dark circles but for now I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a few days in using this and so far so good. Feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t irritate it. I&#x27;m the mother of a infant so this is MUCH needed!</li>
    <li> This eye gel works very well for my dark circles in the morning and for the puffiness that comes with those.  This line of Organics is very nice and works well.  It has a pleasant smell and I can see the results that it has given me.  I recommend this eye cream to anyone who needs to have some help with those unsightly​ dark circles and who needs an eye lift.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is totally working! I use it under me eyes, my forehead, and side eye. My puffiness under my eyes are WAY less and my dark circles have even diminished. This gel is think and a little goes a long way :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week. Not a lot of time, but I&#x27;ve already noticed a reduction in the purple circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve dealt with them pretty much my whole life and I figured it was time to start doing something about it. Already seeing results fills me with great hope that they will be a thing of the past very shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel rubs in easily and isn&#x27;t at all greasy. You don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your whole eye area so it will last quite a while. I love that it is plant-based and made in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way, nor promised any future promotions. I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review. All thoughts are my own and have not been influenced.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. It comes in a nice size little bottle that&#x27;s easy to pump. One pump is enough to use on both of my eyes. I like to use it morning and night. It goes on clear and smooth with no residue or smell. It feels like it tightens the skin area immediately.</li>
    <li> This eye gel makes me feel like I&#x27;ve gotten Botox! It dries really fast and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy...perfect! As soon as I put it on I feel my skin to be much tighter around my eyes. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results of long term use. :) Very satisfied so far!</li>
    <li> Holy cow, what a difference! I love Amara Organics, and this product does not disappoint! My eyes are puffy every morning. I have the worst allergies and I refuse to take meds everyday for them. This eye gel has been a life saver. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works - I look rested now when I go to work! A little goes a long way - you only need a half a pump at most for both eyes. This sized bottle will last a very long time! It&#x27;s very cooling and I&#x27;ve found it causes no burning like some other eye gels I&#x27;ve used. This one takes the cake!</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this eye gel works.  I always have bags under my eyes when I get up in the morning.  Especially noticed as I get older.  I started using this gel and after about the 3rd application I started noticing a difference.  I have a lot less puffiness and my skin feels tighter under my eyes.  Very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully for my skin.  It goes on nice and it&#x27;s light.  I will keep buying this Amara eye Gel!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see that much of a difference</li>
    <li> I love Amara Organics ! I use the Vit C Serum, the moisturizer , and now I&#x27;m using the eye gel.. I feel they are an excellent product for the money...and my skin really looks great ... I&#x27;ve used more expensive products with the same , and some , not quite the same results... These products are top grade..</li>
    <li> I have begun to develop fine lines around my eyes, 2014 was a rough year for me!  You need very little of this product to take care of both eye areas. I find it to be light and gel like. I have used this product faithfully for a month and I have noticed that my fine lines look less noticeable. I haven&#x27;t asked for 2nd opinions from my husband or 6 year old but I did take before pics so if and when I can take their harsh feedback I&#x27;ll show them, but I know that this eye gel is working.</li>
    <li> Lately, I have been having problems with puffy eyes and dark circles when I wake up. I started using this eye gel religiously and after a week, I started noticing a significant change. My eyes aren&#x27;t crazy puffy when I wake up and the dark circles have become less of a bother. I also noticed that the dry spots on the corner of my eyes are gone! I use this gel on the fine lines I have on the sides of my nose and I am very impressed with the results that I have been getting. This product is organic and I appreciate the fact that I have a full understanding of the ingredients used for this eye gel. It&#x27;s very well priced and I must say that it&#x27;s worth purchasing, as it delivers what it promises to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> I, literally, noticed a difference after one night of using it. I washed my face and applied it before I went to sleep. In the morning I noticed my lines in my forehead were dramatically less noticeable.  It also makes your skin very soft. Fabulous product I decided to purchase on a whim. Will be back to buy more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I saw a noticeable reduction in the dark area under my eyes after only a few days use. The puffiness is also gone.</li>
    <li> 15ml small bottle but you do need a lot to put on. I only use two little drops for both of my eyes in the morning. I love the ingredients because it is organic. I am very careful when it comes to eye products. I am liking it so far. The light gel texture is non greasy, which i really like. Good product.</li>
    <li> I like that this absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting on my sensitive skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed improvement of my dark circles yet because I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days.  I&#x27;ve been testing out quite a few products lately and this is one of the better ones.</li>
    <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product but with inherited eye baggage was willing to give it a shot. So far, I am very impressed with the results of this eye gel. You really and truly can feel it tightening the skin where it&#x27;s used. I also love that there&#x27;s no scent as I have very sensitive skin. One tiny little pump on the tip of my fourth finger is enough for both of my eyes and I could not be more thrilled to say that the baggage underneath them has visibly lessened!!</li>
    <li> This has been working out great for me. First off I love the smell it reminds me of being at the spa with cucumbers on my face and it feels so luxurious. I can feel my eyes reducing right after I put it on. One thing I really love it that you can use it on the whole eye area even the lids. They list all of the ingredients right on their site and most of them I can read and understand them. I think this makes a difference right off the bad as someone who was dark veins under my eyes it is had to make them look reduces even more so with the puffy eyes This really helps to make me look more awake and ready for the day. I love this and I will continue to use it. You only need about half a pump for both eyes and it will again last me all over my eyes. This product is even great to use on your body such as your neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for review purposes. My opinions are honest and I was not paid.</li>
    <li> I am so bummed. Doesn&#x27;t work on my under eye circles and hasn&#x27;t really improved any of my fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* This seller was true to their word and refunded my purchase.</li>
    <li> Noticed results immediately.  Not too harsh, pleasant fresh smell, use every morning and every evening.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if perhaps I haven&#x27;t given this product enough time yet, it&#x27;s been about 3 week of use I think, but I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in either my lines or dark circles. I put it on twice daily, morning and night. I love its smell and consistency, but so far I haven&#x27;t seen any results. As of right now, I will not be reordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the customer service team reached out to me (I know right? ) today inquiring about my experience with this product. As I told them it didn&#x27;t work out for me, they didn&#x27;t hesitate to offer me a refund right away. Whaaaaat? That was pretty astonishing and it&#x27;s great to see that this company actually really cares about the effectiveness of their products. I was blown away by their courtesy and I hope to find something else in their product line that works for my horrible dark circles.</li>
    <li> It feels great going on but don&#x27;t expect miracles.  If you are in your 20s - 40&#x27;s it may be different.</li>
    <li> As with their face cream, this is a lovely product. I keep mine in the &#x27;fridge and that only amplifies it&#x27;s ability to reduce any puffiness and is really quite refreshing. This company, and it&#x27;s products, is new to me. I&#x27;m glad I happened upon them. It&#x27;s a quality product at a reasonable price. In addition to the product itself being excellent I must bring attention to their outstanding customer service and follow-up, as well as follow-through. I&#x27;m impressed by their overall standards and I really appreciate their genuine attention to the little things.</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel.  I can already see a difference already (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month).  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more once this supply runs out. It&#x27;s nice and smooth, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy when I put it on and it dries quickly.  Great product and I love it even more that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I am starting to see a big difference in the darkness and wrinkles. I have been using this product for well over a month and, this is better than any expensive store product you can purchase, and organic as well. I will highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought I was ordering an eye moisturizer - turns out this is serum and it&#x27;s WAY better than just using a moisturizer.  Who knew?  It feels great going on - just let it dry for a couple of minutes - then put on your eye moisturizer.  I liked it so much I bought their vitamin C serum - between the 2 products, I started getting compliments on my skin within a week or two!  Also like that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I just started to use this eye gel I have horrible dark circles and puffiness from allergies and lack of sleep I am hoping this is going to help my problem areas! It does not leave a heavy icky feeling after applying so that is wonderful!</li>
    <li> When I opened this package, I was surprised at the consistency. It&#x27;s thick and almost like . . . Preparation H! I&#x27;m sure they love be saying that about them, but anyone who has experience with make-up primer hacks knows Prep H is go-to for low cost facial base. It&#x27;s very smooth and makes your face look and feel soft. These type of products are especially good at disguising wrinkles. This eye gel will repair you right up in a matter of seconds. Get it and don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> Just received the Total Repair Eye Gel the other day, so therefore I can only give it 4 stars because I have not used it long enough to see if it works.  I can comment on the scent, there is none, and it goes on nicely and has a nice consistency.  Looking forward to see if it works!</li>
    <li> This is a great cream for wrinkles and puffy eyes. I noticed immediate results on my puffy eyes. Great consistency, a little thicker,so easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is heaven sent! I have three young kids. Sleep can be sparse. Yet, it really amazes me after I apply this eye gel. My skin looks more toned and smooth, instead of puffy and saggy. It&#x27;s like a mini eye lift for me. After applying it&#x27;s comfortable to wear. I forget it&#x27;s there. I highly recommend this eye gel. A little goes a long way, too, so you know you are also getting your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this eye gel is organic. Goes on smoothly and is not oily. I have only been using this for a short time but can already notice improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using for the last couple of weeks and the formula is light and goes on smooth and I noticed it reduced puffiness. You only need about half a pump per application for both eyes so this bottle is going to last a very long time. I like that this is very light weight and spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t have an odor or sticky feeling.  It absorbs fast so I am able to apply my normal make up right over the gel. Going to keep using to see if it will fade the dark circles more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried eye creams before because, whether I&#x27;m genetically predisposed to dark circles or just have a habit of not sleeping enough, I&#x27;ve always struggled with dark circles under my eyes. I have fair, sensitive skin so many eye creams in the past have either burned or felt too heavy or sticky on my skin. This formula is light and goes on smooth and I noticed it reduced puffiness the very first day. I found I only need about half a pump per application so this bottle is going to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> Smooth and gentle gel for around the sensitive eye area. Very moisturizing and helps reduce the look of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I  use this soothing, lightweight gel under my eyes for treatment of dark circles and puffiness. I can see a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;  at the outer corners of my eyes AND in the tiny lines around my lips. I use this a.m. and p.m. for best results. Again, pleasant fragrance, no heavy gunky feel, and does not irritate my eyes.  Another winner from Amara Organics!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a month and am very happy with it. Creamy not greasy, absorbs quickly. Has helped my crows feet and that is the main reason I wanted to try it. Recommend to others with the same issues.</li>
    <li> Wow! This is a fabulous product. I use it on my whole face. Plumps wrinkles like none other. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this and a few more products from this line in.The women in my family tend to get very thin, tissue like skin as we age and I have looked for a good eye serum for a while now. This serum has made a big difference. I combine it with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and the Face Moisturizer and the changes have been so good! My eyes are already more firm and less saggy! I have not changed anything but the use of these products and I have been getting soo many comments and compliments about the quality of my skin, that I have a glow, that my face looks great- it has been wonderful! It is light weight and not greasy at all! There is no scent and it helps so much with the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. I am so glad I got this!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Amara products for a couple of weeks now.  I like them all.  They are quick drying and very moisturizing.  I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.  I woudl recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Quick, noticeable results!</li>
    <li> its amazing. My eye bags are pretty much gone :) it feels nice on my skin. (I have sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> It is easy on the skin, doesn&#x27;t sting and soaks in very quickly.  It also is very moisturizing.  I don&#x27;t feel like I need anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using the eye gel for a month now and can tell a huge difference. My eyes are not as puffy and the fine lines are diminishing some.</li>
    <li> Within a week of using this product, my dark puffy circles were noticeably better. With continued use, the circles and puffiness have gone. I am now on my second bottle and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I got this product to use on the dark circles under my eyes. I used it 1-2 times a day for about two weeks with no results. Other reviews say that it works great for puffiness, and some say it has worked on their dark circles, so maybe it is just me and my skin but it did not work at all for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to note that the product itself is very pleasant to use. The pump dispenser if very nice and clean looks and pumps out the perfect amount (as long as you don&#x27;t push to hard). The serum itself is very smooth and actually has a cooling effect. It also has a very subtle maybe cucumber smell, which is actually very pleasant. Overall, the product was very pleasant to use, I just wish it worked for me. I would say that it is worth giving a try since it seems to work for some people and is a very pleasant product to use (smooth, cooling, nice subtle smell).</li>
    <li> Love it!! Has a cool feeling and smells good.  Don&#x27;t start my day without it!</li>
    <li> Good product and also very helpful and caring support team, who offered to answer any questions and provided detailed instructions for use to get the best results.</li>
    <li> Did not agree with my skin but the maker gave me a complete refund and didn&#x27;t even request the items be returned. My highest rating to the business ethics of the AMARA organization.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product !!! This eye cream is a must have beauty item.</li>
    <li> Customer service can&#x27;t be beat.  Love the eye gel, very soothing.  Thank you;-)</li>
    <li> I honestly have never &amp;#34;loved&amp;#34; any eye cream I bought, all that I have just keep my eyes soft and ok looking but this eye cream I honestly saw my dark circles disappear almost overnight and the whole discolored spots I have are verily noticeable, I have no idea what&#x27;s in this but my very sensitive eyes love it and I even got a compliment the next day for my husband saying your eyes are so beautiful and I know it was from this cause I had no makeup on and I know how my eyes usually look in the morning... Love it and will never be without again.. After 37 years of my life I finally found an eye cream that works</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;m going to love this product.  You just need a partial (one-third) a pump.  Works great for dehydrated eye skin.</li>
    <li> Hi. I love this product. It has helped a lot with the bags under my eyes. The gel feels so light and refreshing. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love this product I can actually feel it tightening the eye tissue and yes it lessens my dark circles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with all Amara products - this is no exception</li>
    <li> This is the first product I have used from Amara Organics and I am very impressed.  I love the way it smells...so refreshing.  It really helps with my puffy eyes and hydrates around my eyes as well.  If I don&#x27;t get around my eyes really hydrated then my make-up goes on looking dry in that area and my fine lines really show up, which is something I obviously don&#x27;t want...so I really like the hydration factor as well as the help with the puffiness.  As soon as I put it on I feel the skin around my eyes start to tighten up...I love that feeling.  (If only I could get that feeling in my abs as well.  Ha!).  I love the pump on the bottle so I don&#x27;t have to contaminate the product with my fingers.  One thing I find interesting about this product is that it is NOT JUST FOR YOUR EYES... it can be used all over your face and neck to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, plump, firm, and hydrate skin.  I&#x27;m impressed! Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Really like this eye gel. The pump is easy to control to get out the exact amount you want to use. And the gel absorbs easily. I *think* my eye area looks healthier. Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This did not improve dark circles at all, or fine lines.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, twice a day.</li>
    <li> Does great to reduce puffiness for a fraction of the cost of some more expensive products I use.</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle worker! No joke! It literally erased the laugh lines around my eyes and creases along my forehead. Wow, I thought there was no hope except for plastic surgery until I tried this product. If it weren&#x27;t for Amazon and product reviews, I would have never given this a try. I am happier than I&#x27;ve ever been since chemo left my skin dehydrated. Now I look youthful again :)</li>
    <li> This eye cream is excellent for the eyes, it helps remove under eye puffiness and fine lines.  I also use it around my mouth to help eliminate fine lines there.</li>
    <li> Having ordered this product based solely on Amazon reviews (something I almost never do), I am surprised how well it works. I have been using Pur Minerals Tone UP Total Eye Fitness for about 3 years and it was fine. Allergies and age combined to darken the circles under my eyes so I feel I need a product to target this. I will not purchase products with parabens or other toxic chemicals so my choices tend to be more limited. To say I was skeptical of this product is an understatement, but after looking into the product and company a bit I had a good feeling and went with my gut (I rarely believe reviews on Amazon anymore). I have been using it for about a month now, and wasn&#x27;t too sure at first because it feels a little tight when it dries under my eyes, however, it has really decreased the dark circles and fine lines. The container feels weirdly light, almost like there was no product in it but there seems to be plenty. It is however, difficult to tell how much is left and I do not want to run out so I am reordering today just to be sure. I mostly use it at night, but some mornings as well if I need extra help after a bad night sleep, and it really makes a difference. Makeup goes on easily over it without creasing. I also use it to soften the lines between my brows and lips and feel like it is making a difference, but will keep using to see if it gets even better over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciated receiving an email with instructions right after I received the product. They seem to really care about customer service and satisfaction. Definitely recommend and am ordering more right now.</li>
    <li> I was on Amazon to purchase other organic products and actually saw that other customers bought this item along with the other items I was purchasing.  I decided to try it because of the price and the great reviews it received.  I am so glad I bought this.  I usually use Estee Lauder total repair eye and loved it, but I have now been converted. This stuff is great and a little does go a long way.  I was a bit skeptical because it is all organic, but this stuff is so great.  It has cleared up the crepiness, dark circles, and has tightened and smoothed up my eye area.  I have been using this for 2 weeks and I am very pleased with the results.  I have not worn concealer in 10 days and I look well rested. Thank you so much Amara Organics for making such a great product and offering it at a great price.  You have converted me and I am happy to say I look forward to being a loyal customer for a long time.</li>
    <li> When you pump out a tiny bit of the eye cream and rub it under your eyes, or anywhere else on your face, there is a tugging sensation. A mini face lift! Oh I like!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel morning and at night. I was so excited at first, that I&#x27;d practically wrap my eyes in it before I went to sleep. That method actually did not work at all. If you put the eye gel too close to your actual eye, when the gel expands in the night, it&#x27;ll go into your eye and you&#x27;ll wake up with puffier than before. Bad news. So.. make sure you rub it into your eye socket bone and underneath your eyebrow for best effects.&lt;br /&gt;Love it though, love the naturalness of it and the lovely tug tug. Will be getting more!</li>
    <li> Incredible, natural product that works!</li>
    <li> This was my 1st order.  I loved it, it was absorbed fast, and skin felt smooth.  I will for sure continue using it.</li>
    <li> soft and smooth very nice product I&#x27;m very happy with this products took me a very long time before I found something that I was happy and impress with, and AMARA made me happy, thank you for this product I love them</li>
    <li> I love this product line, and have had fair-ish results with this product as well.  I did receive this product from the manufacturer as part of a promotion, but only in trade for a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a no nonesense mom who doesn&#x27;t have time for a long make up routine.  This takes seconds to put on, makes my under eye area feel smooth.  it&#x27;s cool on the skin and is relaxing to put on.  I&#x27;ve been using the product fairly consistently for about 30 days now and have seen some improvement.  Nothing drastic, but from what I have researched I didn&#x27;t expect to see anything to drastic.  I have fair, thin skin and am an over tired mother of two small kids.  I don&#x27;t think that there is a product out there that would make my dark circles go away at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, the product is to expensive for the minimal results that I have seen, but I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m at a time in my life where this product would be used in the manner specified.  I hoped that having my hands on such a nice product would entice me to take better care of my face.  But once the kids go to sleep, I&#x27;m lucky if I take a baby wipe and clean my make up off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive and not-so-expensive eye creams. This is the only one that has ever actually visibly diminished the dark circles I have under my eyes. Nice fragrance and cool feeling when you apply it are nice little pluses too. I will definitely be a regular customer. And the company&#x27;s customer service is super.</li>
    <li> I love the way this fresh gel feels on my skin, havent used it long enough to see a change</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I am using it for about 2 months and it did improve the looks around my eyes. I am not saying is a miracle transformation, as my age and health are the culprit, but it rid of my horrible puffiness, and it significantly lightened the dark circles. Improvement also came a little slow, after 6 weeks, but better later than never. Amara Organics have also a great customer service who are checking on me once in a while to make sure that the product works, and is not bothering my skin. Thank you, Amara Organics, your product is the kindest to my skin.</li>
    <li> My family genes (among other things) gave me very dark circles under my eyes even at a young age.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that claimed they would fix them, but, they made literally no difference at all.  My only option had been makeup to cover the dark circles until I found this product.  After a week using the gel, I noticed that the majority of dark had diminished, and I didn&#x27;t need to &#x27;spakle&#x27; the dark circles to cover them.  I realize that because my dark circles are partly genetic, I&#x27;ll never be able to get them completely gone, but, this eye gel definitely makes a difference I can see, and I&#x27;ll bet anyone with dark circles under their eyes could see an improvement using this.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Wow it really works!!! I didn&#x27;t think the eye gel would work but thought i would give it a try. I thought just like the rest of the products i have use that it would not work. Boy was i wrong. It really does help with dark circles under your eyes. And i love the pump so easy to use. And it does not take much, goes on very smooth and feels good. I have problems with some products being to strong but this Eye Gel is wonderful no problems at all. Most of the time i get a rash or it burns my skin. But i really like this Eye Gel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye gel for a solid week now. I use it in the morning, and at bed time. I can feel an improvement in the hydration of my skin 100%. A little of this gel goes a long way! I made the mistake of using too much the first time, so I am more careful now to make sure that I only use a little bit as it coats your eye area quite well. It is light and smooth. Not sticky or tacky at all, which has not been my experience with other products. I am hoping that as the weeks go on, I will see a decrease in my circles and puffiness. I think it&#x27;s too early at this point, but I can feel the difference for sure.</li>
    <li> Ok, I know I leave a lot of 5-Star reviews but I do my research before even ordering certain products so I pretty much already know the odds are good I will like it but just have to try first to confirm.  Well, Amara Organics is hands down the best eye cream I have found to date and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;3)  The price.  For the ingredients and generous size, it is a bargain.  You can&#x27;t find an eye gel with these ingredients for under $40.  It is also a generous size and will last a long time. WIN WIN!&lt;br /&gt;2)  The ingredients.  Natural &amp; organic.  Nothing bad at all, which is a MUST for me.  Bet you can&#x27;t say that about the super pricey high end department store brands.  Also, has my top priority ingredients-  PEPTIDES, Vit E, Hyaluronic Acid, and Matrixyl 3000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  MOST IMPORTANT!  It WORKS excellent!  I bought some eye gel a couple years ago that Dr Oz recommended.  It was almost $40 UGH.  It tightened your delicate under-eye area so tight that it looked wrinkled, and left a yucky white film.  It is still sitting un-used in my drawer.  The Amara Organics eye gel goes on smooth, and makes your eye area look fresh and renewed.  Due to this product working so well I came up with this idea when I want to look extra fresh and dewy:  after putting on the eye gel (and my Amara Organics moisturizer and Hyaluronic Acid Serum- those reviews yet to come!), make-up, and concealer, I dab a little more Amara eye gel under my eyes before heading out the door.  Also, I like to dab a little more during an especially long day to freshen up my tired, over-worked eyes.  It definitely helps with puffiness too.  i don&#x27;t get puffy that often but recently I had huge bags under my eyes and Amara did the trick to make me look presentable for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m a fan.  I will buy it again.  Not much else to say :-)</li>
    <li> Love this eye gel! I just need to press the pump lightly :-)</li>
    <li> Did not see any improvement in eye area</li>
    <li> This eye gel is absolutely fantastic! After I clean my face every night, I gently apply this eye gel around my eyes especially the skin under my eyes and where my laugh lines are. It feels so nice and cool when I put it on. This soothing gel seems to tighten the areas around my eyes. It also lessens the puffiness under my eyes that I sometimes get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this eye gel contains cucumber, hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells and peptides- all natural ingredients. I am also glad that they do not use alcohol or parabens in their products and it is manufactured in the USA. Something very important to me is animal testing. I&#x27;m really glad that Amara Organics does not do any animal testing on their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this eye gel for anyone that wants to give relief to their eye&#x27;s puffiness and to look younger. Great product!</li>
    <li> This feels great... it has to be good.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with this product, it made my eyes more puffy and for some reason very tired and red. What you pay is what you get I guess not good it all I&#x27;m better off with my tea bags on my eyes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Total Repair Eye Gel from Amara Organics. I have tried so many brand name products which seem to have little or no real value, but cost a lot. The first time I tried this product my under eye area felt better and by the next morning even looked better. As an allergy sufferer, I tend to get dark circles, which get worse during allergy attacks. I have continued to be pleased with this product for several weeks. A plus is for a pump bottle, the product comes out in gentle stream, which means less waste. I will be return customer.</li>
    <li> I will be re ordering this eye gel...I love it...it is very light &amp; not greasy, does not run your makeup. I live in a very dry climate, and amazingly enough this light gel does the job of moisturizing under my eye very well!  ALso my concealer glides tight over it and its a great makeup base also!  I have very, very sensitive skin &amp; the eye gel does not bother my eyes either!  I am very happy with this product!  I have not used it long enough to comment on the reduction of dark circles, but I use concealer anyway so to me moisturizing is more of a concern for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> No matter your age it&#x27;s always the perfect time to start using eye gel. I&#x27;m in my twenties and started noticing dark circles being more pronounced. I also saw that my eyes didn&#x27;t look as bright anymore. I haven&#x27;t noticed any lines or wrinkles but I want to combat them so they don&#x27;t start showing up anytime soon. To do that I have been using an eye gel every night. I wanted one that would help with dark circles and help my eyes look brighter in the morning. I&#x27;ve been using this Amara Organics Total Repair for a while now.&lt;br /&gt;You can feel this eye gel work from the moment you put it on. Just the smallest half pump will be enough for both eyes. It immediately leaves your eyes feeling hydrating and brightened. It has a great blend of rejuvenating ingredients. Including collagen, vitamin e &amp; hyaluronic acid. Has a light cucumber spa scent. It&#x27;s natural, vegan, and cruelty free. Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks and truthfully don&#x27;t see much of an improvement over those heavily chemical-ed eye creams. I just prefer a more natural solution that close to an open orifice. I&#x27;ll keep trying this as long as those eye bags and wrinkles stay away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this almost every night before bed and every morning when I wake up. I probably have only missed 4 times in 3 weeks or so. It has had almost no effect on my eyes and the circles underneath them. I took pictures my first day using it and now and there has been no change. I really hoped it would have helped more but I will have to keep trying new products until one works for me. I contacted Amara and they were very helpful and gave me a full refund.</li>
