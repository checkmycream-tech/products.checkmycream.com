<li> Your hair will never get hard or stiffen up from this product and it lasts about 2 months if used every day.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t get hard or greasy feeling.</li>

    <li> I like it and I like the smell, but rather than giving texture and hold, it kind of gives my hair an oily feel.</li>
    <li> I use this when I&#x27;m going out or looking for a stiffer style than just using hairspray.  Dab a little on my fingers and run thru top of hair starting at roots thru to the ends.  Then use a little more on my sides/back to keep my &amp;#34;flips&amp;#34; cuz I have such fine hair, it goes limp without doing this.</li>

    <li> This is a great product for eyebrow grooming.  That is not its intended purpose, but a bonus use of this product.</li>
