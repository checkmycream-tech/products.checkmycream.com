      <li>It is better for the environment.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to go plastic-free as much as possible, and this works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>And more than that, it has proven to be much better for my teeth.  </li>
      <li>But I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>love this floss.  </li>
      <li>I love that this floss is biodegradable and plastic-free.</li>
      <li>love the packaging.  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best floss I have ever used and is worth every penny!</li>
      <li>-&amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and thinner than most waxy/plastic dental floss&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely strong and does not fray easily&lt;</li>
      <li>Not only is it good for your health, it is good for Mother Earth&#x27;s as well.</li>
      <li>It is strong and does not shred or break.</li>
      <li>It is strong, comfortable, and does the job.  </li>
      <li>This is the best flossing with pure anti-bacterial essential oils.</li>
      <li>free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw a listing which included three floss holders in one package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very economical as well.</li>
      <li>Why get non-eco friendly floss when you can get this one?</li>
      <li>Eco Friendly and Lots of Floss...</li>
      <li>I love the natural/herbal concept of this dental floss and it does indeed provide a &#x27;gentle&#x27; flossing to my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted to have found such a product!</li>
      <li>Super fast delivery of a great little product.</li>
      <li>It does a better job in those tight spaces because of being more substantial.  </li>
      <li>I know toothbrushes don&#x27;t waste that much landfill space relative to a lot of our stuff, but it is always nice when you can support a good cause.</li>
      <li>The Gentle Floss is a HUGE roll, so sometimes I need to use some up first, but it&#x27;s better to have too much than not enough!  </li>
      <li>(i think it&#x27;s oral b) and was/am really satisfied with that, I only wanted to change based on the packaging.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>I could feel the difference after the first use.</li>
      <li>and it has a kind of sharp feel on my gums.</li>
      <li>ultimately I just thought it was cheap floss...</li>
      <li>And it actually works, unlike some of those plastic ones that are way too smooth to do anything.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this product because I love the minimal plastic used in the container as well as the vegan wax.</li>
      <li>love that it does not have bees wax or other animal products in it</li>
      <li>The box is sturdy, the blade sharp, and I like what seems to be super-thin floss much better than others.  </li>
      <li>I used to get Oral B Ultra Floss, but this floss does a better job and much less packaging.</li>
      <li>It is more substantial than Glide but still gets into the tight spaces.  </li>
      <li>I like the simple packaging and for me the floss is just the right width.  </li>
      <li>No heavy scent.</li>
      <li>I think it will last for a very loooong time</li>
      <li>I have never used a natural floss until I found Eco-dent.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Great tasting floss with a minimal amount of materials and packaging, definitely worth the order.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on it</li>
      <li>(maybe I&#x27;ve just gotten used to the satin, but if you are only used to super thin floss or don&#x27;t have a preference, then the feel would be fine)...</li>
      <li>The large amount that comes in the package lasts a  long time.</li>
      <li>They need a thinner version because it&#x27;s tough to work in between most of my teeth.</li>
      <li>I was always careful to wiggle my Glide around to work the space as much as it could, but I never received as rave a review on my oral care from my hygenist as I did after using EcoDent.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s hard to see how much floss is left since you can&#x27;t see through the box (that&#x27;s the same with most other floss</li>
      <li>So for me, trying any other brand was a real gamble.  </li>
      <li>Gets into those tight teeth contacts and cleaned very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s slightly thicker, and with a small bit of texture to it, which is good for snagging the small bits of food/buildup between my teeth.</li>

    <li> The perfect floss for those of us choosing animal product free floss. Not too thick, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> -&amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and thinner than most waxy/plastic dental floss&lt;br /&gt;-Extremely strong and does not fray easily&lt;br /&gt;-More painful on my gums than most floss due to being very thin. Can also hurt your fingers if you wrap it too tightly.&lt;br /&gt;-The paper packaging is just as functional as plastic&lt;br /&gt;-Mint scent is not strong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews of this stuff seem to contradict one another. This was my take on it.</li>
    <li> Yes, the packaging isn&#x27;t hardcore, but I just bought a different floss &amp; transferred this one over.  The Gentle Floss is a HUGE roll, so sometimes I need to use some up first, but it&#x27;s better to have too much than not enough!  There are just enough oils on it to be effective, without making it taste bad.  And it actually works, unlike some of those plastic ones that are way too smooth to do anything.</li>
    <li> I have used this vegan floss before and it is still the best. Gets into those tight teeth contacts and cleaned very well.</li>
    <li> I just tried using this with a floss handle. It worked pretty well. The name of the product I got was: &amp;#34;Flossaid Dental Floss Holder-Single Handle&amp;#34;. It only cost $3.32, and came with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also saw a listing which included three floss holders in one package&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured that they made handles like that based on the single use flossers with a plastic handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it makes it a lot easier to floss when one has a handle of some kind.</li>
    <li> I love that this floss is biodegradable and plastic-free. One packages lasts me a long time. My husband who has tight junctures doesnt like it though.</li>
    <li> Very good. Great to have oils in it. Only reason not 5 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t glide between teeth, but that&#x27;s the price to pay when eliminating teflon coated floss. Nice packaging. No need for fancy package.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery of a great little product.</li>
    <li> I have 2 crowns, I have to floss every day else my gum gets irritated. But my teeth are close together, I can&#x27;t use those thick floss. I used to get Oral B Ultra Floss, but this floss does a better job and much less packaging.</li>
    <li> I like the simple packaging and for me the floss is just the right width.  Gets through the teeth but not so thick as to get stuck between them.  No heavy scent.</li>
    <li> I tried it for about a week.. didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It&#x27;s too thin. It&#x27;s difficult to get a good grip on it and it has a kind of sharp feel on my gums. It shreds and leaves pieces stuck between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Its floss. What else should i say?</li>
    <li> My mouth is notorious among the local dental hygenists for being small and having tight spaces.  For years I did not floss at all because I simply could not get the floss my family used in between my teeth.  It was a physical impossibility.  Of course, like so many in my situation, I eventually learned about Glide floss and was happy for that.  So for me, trying any other brand was a real gamble.  But I am so glad I did.  Ecodent leaves my mouth feeling fresh, whereas mint Glide just left my mouth feeling uncomfortably numb and chemically.  It is better for the environment.  And more than that, it has proven to be much better for my teeth.  It is more substantial than Glide but still gets into the tight spaces.  It does a better job in those tight spaces because of being more substantial.  I was always careful to wiggle my Glide around to work the space as much as it could, but I never received as rave a review on my oral care from my hygenist as I did after using EcoDent.  I also like the EcoDent replaceable head toothbrushes.  I know toothbrushes don&#x27;t waste that much landfill space relative to a lot of our stuff, but it is always nice when you can support a good cause.</li>
    <li> I have never used a natural floss until I found Eco-dent. I could feel the difference after the first use. This is the best flossing with pure anti-bacterial essential oils. It is very economical as well. I think it will last for a very loooong time</li>
    <li> love this floss.  love the packaging.  superior product that is not in plastic makes me very happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to go plastic-free as much as possible, and this works perfectly.  The box is sturdy, the blade sharp, and I like what seems to be super-thin floss much better than others.  It is strong, comfortable, and does the job.  I wish that the floss itself were not encased in a small plastic bag, but perhaps that is needed to keep it sanitary?  Would prefer paper if that could be made to work. I&#x27;m delighted to have found such a product!</li>
    <li> Responsibly packaged, excellent dental floss.</li>
    <li> I love the natural/herbal concept of this dental floss and it does indeed provide a &#x27;gentle&#x27; flossing to my teeth.

    <li> This is great floss- great quality and the price is right for how much floss is in the box.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product because I love the minimal plastic used in the container as well as the vegan wax. I honestly thought  &amp;#34;it&#x27;s floss, it&#x27;ll be fine&amp;#34;...i was previously using the satin floss from oral b (i think it&#x27;s oral b) and was/am really satisfied with that, I only wanted to change based on the packaging. However, the floss was mailed to me in a giant, thick plastic bag- so whatever plastic packaging that was saved by the cardboard container was made moot...additionally, it is too thin for comfort (maybe I&#x27;ve just gotten used to the satin, but if you are only used to super thin floss or don&#x27;t have a preference, then the feel would be fine)...ultimately I just thought it was cheap floss...too bad bc I really wanted to minimalize my plastic consumption :(</li>
    <li> Eco Friendly and Lots of Floss...&lt;br /&gt;Great tasting floss with a minimal amount of materials and packaging, definitely worth the order.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too thick for my teeth, other than that I like the product and I prefer it to the synthetic chemical laden stuff.  They need a thinner version because it&#x27;s tough to work in between most of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Why get non-eco friendly floss when you can get this one? This works just as well any other floss. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best floss I have ever used and is worth every penny!</li>
