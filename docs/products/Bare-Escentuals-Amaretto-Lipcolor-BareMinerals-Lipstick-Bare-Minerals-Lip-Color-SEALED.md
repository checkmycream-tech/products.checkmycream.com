      <li>This is perfect!</li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>I get a nice tint on my lips by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>works great but has a funny smell</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>A bit waxy, but happy that it is natural.</li>
      <li>I like the color and the application was easy</li>
      <li>Fabulous color.  </li>
      <li>Not too dark...not too light.</li>
      <li>and it did not apply smoothly.</li>
      <li>Totally love the brand, however, this was my first time buying their lipstick online.</li>
      <li>Lipstick: Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>LOVE this lip color and formula that is no longer available through Bare Escentuals!</li>
      <li>I ordered the Amaretto expecting a beigy or light brownish tint, and what I got was very orangey--not at all what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I want to encourage companies to ditch the harmful, poisonous ingredients found in most large cosmetics corporations&#x27; products, so I buy different brands when I can.</li>
      <li>This is just barely darker than my natural lips, so I really love the way it looks on.</li>

      <li>More red than expected.</li>
      <li>I never like wearing make-up because I prefer a more natural look, but in the winter time, my lips get so pale.</li>
      <li>it does not fade completely</li>
      <li>This product was old.</li>
      <li>There are plenty of natural and organic lipsticks out there that do not have this problem.</li>
      <li>This is an old product, don&#x27;t buy the leftovers.</li>
      <li>It was old and tasted rotten</li>
      <li>Old and smelled old when you unwrapped pkg.</li>
      <li>Wish they would just give me a refund instead of making more go to the trouble of sending it back.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was this particular stick, but this stick was definitely rancid smelling</li>
      <li>do not dry the lips</li>
      <li>Normally like BE lipsticks, but this one smells &amp;#34;stale,&amp;#34; and is very dry in texture.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly the same in texture and application as the little lip sticks in a toddlers &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; case.</li>
      <li>Dry and old.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the color! You cannot beat the price!</li>
    <li> A bit waxy, but happy that it is natural. The color is lighter than what was pictured and what was suggested by the name &amp;#34;Amaretto&amp;#34;. But, I can make it work at this price.</li>
    <li> Not good at all!  Very disappointed in this seller!  Old and smelled old when you unwrapped pkg. very dry and chalky if you can get past the bad smell from product being out of date apparently!</li>
    <li> I like the color and the application was easy however, it has a odor that&#x27;s not very pleasant. Also, why the plastic wrap around it? It was difficult to get into and I hate packaging that&#x27;s hard to get into so I only gave four stars.</li>
    <li> More red than expected.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, is obviously old lipstick. Goes on rough. Throwing it away. Seller does not respond when asked for refund.</li>

    <li> The lipstick was hard to apply, tasted funny and smelled rancid - I am returning it - all I can say is YUCK!!!!</li>

    <li> Very dry and unusable.  Returned by Amazon label.  Defective!</li>
    <li> Lipstick: Arrived quickly. Product was exactly as when purchased thru Bare Minerals...but $5. less.&lt;br /&gt;Great Deal, will definately order product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this particular stick, but this stick was definitely rancid smelling and it did not apply smoothly.</li>
    <li> I just wish there was a smaller tester size so I could actually try and see for myself what I was putting on.  Not knowing about the color amaretto, I just went by the picture displayed but found the color slightly different than the picture.</li>
    <li> works great but has a funny smell</li>
    <li> This came and it STUNK! It was definitely outdated. Packaging outdated as well. DRY and crumbly. I could not wear it the smell was so horrible.</li>
    <li> Feels, looks, and wears great!</li>
    <li> This is just barely darker than my natural lips, so I really love the way it looks on. I never like wearing make-up because I prefer a more natural look, but in the winter time, my lips get so pale. This is perfect! My friends can&#x27;t tell that I am wearing anything at all, but it adds just enough color that my lips are not invisible. This will definitely be ordered again!</li>
    <li> It was too dry did like how it felt on my lips</li>
    <li> Fabulous color.  Not too dark...not too light.</li>
    <li> I want to encourage companies to ditch the harmful, poisonous ingredients found in most large cosmetics corporations&#x27; products, so I buy different brands when I can.

    <li> Just what I was expecting</li>
    <li> Dry and old. This is an old product, don&#x27;t buy the leftovers.</li>
    <li> I love the color it is moist do not dry the lips it does not fade completely I get a nice tint on my lips by the end of the day.I am only buying those lipsticks from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Danielle</li>
    <li> This product was old. It had a petroleum smell and crumbled when I tried to apply it.</li>
    <li> This is the worst &amp;#34;lip stick&amp;#34; I have ever used or seen. It is exactly the same in texture and application as the little lip sticks in a toddlers &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; case. Actually a crayon. Returned within 30 minutes of opening the package. Thank God purchased through amazon.</li>
    <li> Normally like BE lipsticks, but this one smells &amp;#34;stale,&amp;#34; and is very dry in texture.  What happened to quality control?</li>
