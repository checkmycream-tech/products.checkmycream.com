    <li> I love this cream and have used it for years. It is always on my wish list. As I didn&#x27;t get any for Christmas this year, I ordered some myself. I was dismayed when I found out the shipping costs were almost as high and the cost of the 2 tubes I ordered- $9.98 for 2 tubes in an envelope?? I am sure it is available locally and will shop locally in the future. I will only pay this high a price if I can&#x27;t find it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  Besides giving a nice shine to the hair it also adds a bit of control like a hairspray.</li>
