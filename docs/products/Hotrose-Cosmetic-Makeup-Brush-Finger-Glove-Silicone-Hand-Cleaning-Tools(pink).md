      <li>I love this cosmetic makeup  brush finger glove.</li>
      <li>very cool product.</li>
      <li>Happy makeup junkie 😊 and this light pink color is just gorgeous.</li>
      <li>This little doohickey is perfect for cleaning makeup brushes!</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...</li>
      <li>Works well for  cleaning my brushes, nothing special but works fine</li>
      <li>I love how it works great for small brushes.</li>
      <li>Smaller than I thought it would be but work super good</li>
      <li>Took awhile to get here however, the wait was well worth it.</li>
      <li>It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  </li>
      <li>Really helps clean my brushes a lot faster.</li>
      <li>Great for small brushes</li>
      <li>it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  </li>
      <li>Really does cut the time it takes to cleam brushes!</li>
      <li>Great small item, does the job to scrub makeup brushes!</li>
      <li>I has made cleaning my makeup brushes real easy and cuts the time in half.</li>
      <li>I used the E.L.F. Daily makeup cleaner along with it and it made my brushes (which I use on a consistent basis without ever cleaning them) super clean, like basically brand new.</li>
      <li>I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  </li>
      <li>This is a good small makeup brush cleaner but its not that great for big foundation brushes because it&#x27;s so small.</li>
      <li>so I can clean my smaller brushes easier!</li>
      <li>Nice product though, just small.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kawaii color, very solid make, and a useful tool for cleaning makeup brushes.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
      <li>I love that it has the small bristles</li>
      <li>I will red buy again only if a bigger size is available.  </li>
      <li>I would give five stars if it is a little larger, but that&#x27;s only because I have many big brushes.  </li>
      <li>But it can clean a small hair brush well.</li>

    <li> Sturdy and makes brush cleaning a breeze! Happy makeup junkie 😊 and this light pink color is just gorgeous. I&#x27;ll definitely be gifting these out in the future.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works great for brushes and for pretreatment of stains in clothes too.</li>
    <li> Love this brush cleaner. Does what it needs to do. Price was a steal compared to what sephora has them at.</li>
    <li> Small size &amp; works as promised.  Really glad to have a design to work better than the palm of my hand. Good show!</li>

    <li> This is a good small makeup brush cleaner but its not that great for big foundation brushes because it&#x27;s so small. I have skinny fingers and only my thumb can keep it sturdy enough to scrub my brushes.</li>
    <li> I like this thing, but it&#x27;s so small. It doesn&#x27;t work well with big hair brushes at all. But it can clean a small hair brush well. I will red buy again only if a bigger size is available.  Nice product though, just small.</li>
    <li> I love this brush cleaner, since it&#x27;s not expensive and it works great.</li>
    <li> Really does cut the time it takes to cleam brushes!</li>
    <li> Great small item, does the job to scrub makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> I had NO idea that there was an invention to help wash makeup brushes until I received one of these with a makeup brush that I ordered!  NOW I wonder how I ever lived without it.  It absolutely cuts the times it takes to clean a brush (thoroughly and deeply) in half...or more!  I used to just wash them over and over and over until the water ran clean, but you can see that the round knobbies and straight lines across this item gets between the brush hairs and clean them in no time!  I am very impressed and very happy!  I highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This does NOT do an excellent job deep cleaning large brushes...it does much, much better with the smaller brushes.  On the other hand, it does well cleaning the tips of large brushes and then I deep clean the large brushes as always.</li>
    <li> very cool product. it is helpful with brush cleaning</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought it would be but work super good</li>
    <li> This little doohickey is perfect for cleaning makeup brushes! I also have the e.l.f. shampoo, and they are a match made in heaven. I&#x27;m in no way advertising for the shampoo, but will say that the two of them together got ALL of the makeup off my brush. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> Works well. It does get the brushes cleaner than when I just use my fingers. I am not sure why this works with such small nubs, but it does.</li>
