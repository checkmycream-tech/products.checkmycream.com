<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> HAVENT NOTICED ANY RESULTS YET! but i still have faith</li>
    <li> Works okay ! Smells wonderful !</li>
    <li> I seen a difference in 2 weeks it really work and if you wear a butt lifter while using cream it make your butt fat and rounder. I love this product eeven after I stop wearing the lifter my butt was lifted round and fat</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. I use it twice a day once in the morning and once at night after getting out the shower. It has actually made my butt more rounder and fuller. I also use a daily supplement which helps increase the size of the butt. So not only has it became more rounder and fuller it has also became more bigger and wider. That is exactly what I was searching for.</li>
    <li> I did not feel any heat or I did not sweat when I put on under the belt. I did not feel working.</li>
    <li> Smells good but did nothing except smooth my skin.</li>
    <li> Love it! I do my squat regiment as well as add the lotion. The results are real! If you need some uplifting and firmness this product fits you!</li>
    <li> I bough this thinking it was actually cellulite gel but it wasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s more supposed to increase the size of whatever you rub it on. I don&#x27;t need any extra inches anywhere thank you. I threw it out</li>
    <li> Got a lot of compliments or more ppl noticing my bigger backside!</li>
    <li> Been using the product for three days now. It smells amazing my skin is super soft and I&#x27;m hoping to see more results very soon.</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but I do see results with exercise.  Great smell!!!!</li>
    <li> I think it work. I have been using this on and off for abut a year now. And I can really tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a while.</li>
    <li> My whole life I have always been made fun of for having no booty.. Even by my own mom &#x3D;\ well iv been using this twice a day for about a month now and it actually works really gd.. I&#x27;m surprised because iv tryed several products and this is the only 1 I saw results after only a few days .. A must try!</li>
    <li> Did not do any of what was advertised. I continued my usual pilates/vinyasa 4-5 a week regimen and basically this is just a moisturizer. It does make your butt soft, though.</li>
    <li> It has only been a couple of days but I believe it is the beginning to a beautiful relationship.</li>
    <li> Using this product has given me noticeable results. It met my expectations - I was not expecting it to make me lose weight or work miracles. The skin on my butt became tighter, smoother, and softer, and gave my butt in general a more lifted and taught appearance. I was starting a cut in my diet and upped my cardio regimen, and though I did lose some excess fat my butt still felt overly jiggly. This product gave me the extra boost I needed that diet and exercise couldn&#x27;t quite achieve. I applied it every night, working it in in circular motions, waited for it to absorb/dry, and after about a week I definitely started to see an improvement in the texture and appearance of the area I was using it on. I used a pretty generous amount so only two weeks later I&#x27;m almost out, and am definitely planning on ordering more. It smells nice, feels pleasant, and in my experience, works. I don&#x27;t recommend you buy it if you think you&#x27;re going to go from a saggy behind to a tight supermodel as simply from using a lotion. If you want a BIGGER butt, you&#x27;re going to have to either get FAT (then you&#x27;ll just be fat), get more muscular (by doing weight training) or get ass implants. If you think a lotion will add mass to your butt, I hope you learn soon enough that that is IMPOSSIBLE.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome I tried it for myself and I got an amazing results, I had a flat ass before and I decided to try something new.wish I could post pics the before and after but didn&#x27;t take any pics. overall im happy with my results.</li>
    <li> Already seeing improvement and I&#x27;ve only been using for a little over a week</li>
    <li> this did absolutely nothing for me</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I had really dry skin in my bum area and it worked like a charm. I love it. I use it on my hips and legs too</li>
    <li> to sloww to see the result</li>
    <li> Smells so yummy and goes on so sof anf smooth my skin feels softer just after 4 days!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product - I actually saw the difference. Needs consistent application. The best results when you combine it with exercise.</li>
    <li> Ive only used this for a week but im already noticing it has helped with cellulite reduction and softening, but lifting or size change.</li>
    <li> They came on time but I&#x27;m still in an early process and don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working yet</li>
    <li> Definitely firmed up butt but not a rounder effect. It&#x27;s been 6 weeks and I have some left. Hopefully, the results so farm will change.</li>
    <li> It seems that my hip fat shrunk rather than improved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest to go use your $15 on fish oil supplements high in DHA and a few gallons of milk if you want your curves to improve! After all, we all know that Marilyn ate pretty much a Paleo diet to get her curves. Much healthier than a bottle packed with parabens and unknown, unscientific ingredients...</li>
    <li> I been using it for about two weeks and sometimes I forget to put it on but I can really notice the change. My booty is now bigger and got really round and dangggggg, I look good in a dress. I will use this for the rest of my life👌</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!! My butt feels Juicier Firm and tight, I&#x27;ve noticed a change within a week. I will be making more purchases from this seller</li>
    <li> I Looooove dis product!!! It really really works. When u&#x27;r man can see d different baby u best 2 recognize.</li>
    <li> I am on my second order of this lotion and it does seem to work. I can tell a slight difference. I will keep on using this to see if I get even better results.</li>
    <li> it did its job. by lifting and rounding the buttocks.</li>
    <li> I definitely felt some lifting, and felt like I had a little junk in the trunk in just a matter of days.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product don&#x27;t know yet if it&#x27;s working but does make my skin soft</li>
    <li> this didnt work for me</li>
    <li> Does nothing.....very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Everybody is trying to figure out my secerte for a bigger Butt but I don&#x27;t tell them! I get a lot of compliments and it do work! I just bought my 3rd bottle ! I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this really works! It may take a while to see results but it&#x27;s worth the wait!</li>
    <li> Wow I can&#x27;t believe how great my sister looks right now. I bought this product for her my sisters birthday and I told her to use this. Now even i can&#x27;t believe how great and slim she looks.</li>
    <li> &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;BIG BUMM WOMEN PLEASE READ!&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of using this product, it has made my butt shape change, but not in a desired way.&lt;br /&gt;I had curves already, but who doesn&#x27;t want to enhance what they already have? After using this, it has gave me a push-up, however, the shape is more triangular than round. It you already have a butt, and want to GO BIGGER, do not use this, it will cause a weird shape, because it is pushing the fat up, from your thighs, and not forming a bubble butt, but a more compacted shape!&lt;br /&gt;In other words, for the big butt woman, its similar to the look in tight jeans, and not the curved look in leggings.&lt;br /&gt; THIS PRODUCT DOES WORK, 100% HOWEVER PLEASE QUESTION YOUR DESIRED RESULT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and I think I see some increase in size. It will not make you huge, but maybe an inch increased so far.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make a lot of difference but I love the smell and it makes my skin feel good........ Try it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great just started on my three days</li>
    <li> Great product , love how my Skin feel after !!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing. It helps with moisturizing, but did not help with lifting or cellulite reduction. I feel like it was too expensive for no results.  A regular lotion could moisturize your skin but not for $20 its a Scam and I&#x27;m dissappointed at the results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about. This product did nothing but waist my time. That&#x27;s what I get for cheating. Get squatting ladies to see real results. .</li>
    <li> Have seen small gains, but overall, product leaves butt feeling smooth and it smells great! Will definitely purchase again. Great!</li>
    <li> This works very well, my butt has lifted 2 inches in 2 weeks. And I&#x27;ve only applied it 6 times. You are suppose to apply twice a day.I generally don&#x27;t do that but I have applied once a day every other day because I wanted to see the results And if there were any.</li>
    <li> I doubt this stuff works, but my booty is too soft lol.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item two separate times because it works. I have read tons of reviews, even the bad ones and I just can&#x27;t see anyone not loving this product. It works immediately and not just for my butt it lifts and firms anywhere you put it. Yes for best results use combined with exercise, but even without, people notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Its okay.. The trick is that you have to work out which I do anyway. when you do squats, you can see results.. it makes your skin soft ....</li>
    <li> it made my ass look tighter and higher when using it with 30 day squat challenge (my experience )</li>
    <li> I noticed a BIG DIFFERENCE. practically everyone around me has too, I can really see the difference in dresses and leggings. It&#x27;s been a little over a month and I don&#x27;t plan on stop using it, MUST BE CONSISTENT to see the big difference.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much. Rubbed it on every night after my workout. Seen a bit of results after 2 weeks &amp; was excited! Then I lost it.. So I&#x27;m gonna order more soon. It made my butt really soft and it has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> another joke of an item in my opinion</li>
    <li> Considering the fact that i have been using this line of products for quite sometime now, i am quite positive that this will work for me..I am thankful that it arrived earlier than i expected, and the seller left a personal note..I feel good already, just got it today, and i am excited to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3d serum for my boobs worked well for me, which is why i bought this too...The seller is definitely going to be one of the reasons i shall return to their store, for more products...I gave three stars for starters, will update when i start seeing results..</li>
    <li> Day three of using it morning and night and my skin is so incredibly soft it&#x27;s amazing. I didn&#x27;t take before pictures, and I was very skeptical are first, but I can honesty say my butt is looking so perky and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks with continued use. Will definitely be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Love it it works just don&#x27;t know if it will last or I will have to keep on buying the product which will become very expensive</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never did a review for anything until now. I&#x27;ve always wanted a bigger booty but just didn&#x27;t know where to start. I would recommend this creme to anyone who needs a push with growing their booty. All u have to do is apply it everyday (I applied it after showering) and squat/booty weight train on the regular and you&#x27;re on your way. Best/safest $12.99 I&#x27;ve spent thus far. P.s. I will be buying more products from this line soon... Good luck :)</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes by butt feel soft but it does nothing of what it says. Waste of time.</li>
    <li> SMELLS AMAAAAAAAZING !!😁</li>
    <li> After a month of using this Serum it appears that my butt was getting flatter. OH what a big disappointment! But, before applying the initial Serum to my Butt, I took measurements. My butt was much firmer and thicker and I wanted a little more lift. I was highly disappointed to say the least, after working so hard to keep a firm tight fit butt to go to a droopy flat butt!  The words SLIM means exactly that. Product description is a JOKE!  •LIFTS BUTTOCKS •PERFECTLY SHAPES, FIRMS AND FILLS. Do not buy into this bull! It does not deserves a single STAR!</li>
    <li> I will admit, this is a decent cream. I have exercised along with usage of the product. I would suggest not expecting miracles, creams don&#x27;t really work. It may be tightening and improving the skin, which makes results seem nicer :-). I would recommend it</li>
    <li> This product lifted my butt up and I am very happy!</li>
    <li> i like it a lot. it really working on me.</li>
    <li> If u use it as directed it helps reduce look of cellulite</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works, but I love the way it smells and how it feels on your skin, my buttocks is smoother  but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s lifted.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I don&#x27;t see any results!</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of money, I give a 1 for softer skin. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> It actually works I was surprised! It fills things out and isn&#x27;t greasy, absorbs nice. There is a pleasant smell also.</li>
    <li> This is Amazing!!!  I could see a difference after just applying 1 time.  Definitely stocking up!!</li>
    <li> Um...yes please! Another product that I want to have on hand always!!!</li>
    <li> Love how cheap it is, and it works! I saw results in a week along with working out. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s first clarify that I&#x27;m far from flat I actually get compliments on my butt quit often. I purchased this accidently I was seeking more of a skin tightening/firmer. I can say I do like the smell and a little goes a long way. Now I do feel that my butt sits up more and feels softer than usual. My husband , family &amp; close friends say my butt is getting bigger as well. I agree being that my clothes have sized up. I don&#x27;t use this anymore again because I&#x27;m not flat I just wanted to firm what I have a little more. It is a good product in my opinion for anyone who wants to enchance the appearance of their backside you may get a little something something hope this helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 9 days to date. I received it along with the Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum for abdomen and buttocks. I use the T A S 1st , then apply this one, and I use then both together 2x daily. After my morning shower and before going to bed. I can&#x27;t say which to blame but my cellulite in my thigh and buttock area is not as noticeable and my skin does appear to be firming because its starting to feel smooth and tight. I like the way this smells too, it has a &amp;#34;clean/pretty&amp;#34; smell to it. This one is a cream and the T A S is a gellied formula, that has a semi grapefruit smell to me. I will keep using them both and do a 2nd review when I do some measurements or something. I work in a medical office where I&#x27;m constantly up walking and moving around so I&#x27;m sure using the both I should shed something, at least from the T A S because it made me sweat really good when I walked the  treadmill for about 30 mintes and this was about a half hour after I applied them both. I noticed the first &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; sensation about 5-7 minutes after applying them each time. This cream has no thermo effect just the firming and can&#x27;t say if I&#x27;ve noticed any lifting in buttock area yet but definitely the tighting; maybe I aught to lQQk at my own A** a little closer. I&#x27;ll wait til my bf says something first cause he&#x27;s always lQQking!! I&#x27;ll pretend not to notice cause he has no clue that this is what he got out the mailbox last week. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have more good stuff to say about it when I do a 2nd review.</li>
    <li> To early to see complete results, but I&#x27;m skin is softer</li>
    <li> I love it works really good</li>
    <li> Working like a charm. It took a few weeks for my husband to notice but he noticed. He didn&#x27;t know I was trying this product at first.</li>
    <li> This product had celebrity men complimenting and singing about my booty to my face at a meet and greet and works! :-)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work waste of money</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews and looking over some other products I finally decided to order it. I got it and started using it every night and every other morning. I didn&#x27;t have much hope for this product but I think I&#x27;m starting to see results. My butt feels a little bigger so I&#x27;m pretty sure its helping! Smells great and I will definitely be buying more when mine is gone!</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but I thought I should try it out. This really works! You have to use it consistently day and night everyday. Despite the size the tube will actually last. It does not burn my skin, or become intensely hot. ( African-American) female. I have noticed a significant change with my butt and I love it. This really does work and it is natural. !</li>
    <li> I chose this item bcuz I wanted that firmness back into my buttocks to give it that look that I had a long time ago without the exercises....</li>
    <li> I love the smell, not sure if it is slimming anything down but I have ingrown hair problems which make my skin bumpy... this cream makes my skin really soft. I plan on buying more of this just because of the softness and I have worked this into my daily hygiene regimen.</li>
    <li> Love it still using it for results will keep you updated on this product so hope I see something soon</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, been using a couple months and it actually does visibly lift. I&#x27;m very happy and will buy again</li>
    <li> I love it. Just after a week of using this product I have seen great improvements. my butt looks rounder and smooth. I also use the bust cream. works great</li>
    <li> Smells great. Been using for almost a month and I have seen an increase in size. I will continue to use this and I want to try another product from this line.</li>
    <li> ive been using this stuff for about two months and it lifts and it made my skin very smooth and clear</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk</li>
    <li> I been using this for about a week or so and I been starting to see changes , it DOESNT actually do the job for you and &amp;#34;lifts&amp;#34; your butt , but if you use it as a toner right after a workout or shower you&#x27;ll start seeing results . The smell is so nice and it&#x27;s not Oily it absorbs in minutes .I would absolutely recommend it !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month already and the only thing I noticed was it got more soft and it also lifted. I&#x27;m very petite so it did not fill in my glutes nor did it make it round, probably because I don&#x27;t have alot of body fat but above all it lifted and my skin is very smooth! Because of its smoothness I put it on my dry areas on my face (before I apply make up) and also have been putting this on my breast and wow it feels so soft and firm!!! Like seriously atleast something increased in size haha! But anyways I have been working out with lunges and squats with some weights for 2 months (before I bought this cream) and although my thighs increased in size I needa get this butt of mine to get that also thats why I bought this cream, judging by the reviews. But, oh well, I guess it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but the smoothness is definitely no lie ;)</li>
    <li> I love the smell and moisture of this product.  I got it because it had many of the same ingredients for a leading maker that sold a cream to build up tissues on your hand.  I got it for my elderly Mom whose hands are quite thin.  I&#x27;m not gonna say she has the hands of a 40yr old by now, but the texture and nice fragrance keep her reminded to put it on and it might be that her hands are just well moisturized for a change, but they do look better.  I never bought this to build up a bootie, so have no idea how many tubes that would take!  My next project.... Mommmm???!!  &#x3D; )</li>
    <li> This product really does work. I am still using  the first one I bought from amazon and it really does work and it has been over 2 months.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would not work and there was awesome results in a week !! I apply this lotion do my 50 squats and 50 lunges and walk my 4 miles everyday there is truly results</li>
    <li> do squats they work better! no changes</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, used it for awhile an did absolutely nothing for me,&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> not working at alll i put two bottles on my hips every day for 2 months i didnt see any change</li>
    <li> It most definitely works for shaping . My ass was completely flat until I started using this now I have a lil sum sum lol .</li>
    <li> 7/24/2014: This is my 2nd review. I absolutely love this stuff, I immeditately noticed the difference in my skin smoothing out since I have  (had) dimples and stretch marks on my butt, but NOW 2 weeks later, I can confidently say i&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the shape of my bum, but not just me, My female co-worker commented that my butt looked bigger- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bigger just firmer, rounder and lifted...of course I&#x27;ve also been doing Tae-bo as well, which I think REALLY helped my results. Exercise with this is the perfect 1,2 punch. LOVE THIS STUFF.  It does what it says. IT WORKS.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! Saw results instantly!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that needs too see physical affect from products, and I read so many good reviews on this product and must say Indeed do I love this product, my husband says it looks like I had over night surgery, I will be using this product over and over! It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> This my second time purchasing this product. .. its ok but could have worked better but I don&#x27;t think would buy again.</li>
    <li> Did not take away the streach marks at all ..and I personaly didint see a big difference -.-</li>
    <li> Best product I ever purchased and very fast shipping it don&#x27;t get no better then that!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks😄</li>
    <li> its working!! you have to use it like it saids and workout! i love will be ordering more. satisfied customer</li>
    <li> It takes a while to see the results so when I start seeing them I will get back to you.</li>
    <li> It takes time you really got to use it twice a day and add some squats and/or lunges to help it work but I feel it did work for me and I didn&#x27;t work out</li>
    <li> They sent me the bust serum not the buttock. I would love to give this product more stars but its hard If you recieve the wrong item and you cant try it. Thats Bad business!!&lt;br /&gt;If I get the product I paid for I&#x27;ll leave another review.</li>
    <li> Instant effects after using this product is amazing. I give this 4 stars because you don&#x27;t get a bigger butt, but a toned and well rounded one, and that is really seductive for me and for all the men out there!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It smells fantastic its very smooth and doesnt leave you sticky all day. It works well within days I could see an feel the difference, and my skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> I cannot give a 5 stars to this product because I have not finished the first one.  I could not even say I saw a small result because I have a perky butt. already. I do not want to enhance it but firm it  more so let us wait to seethe results. May be it will do the job</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while.... i had been hoping so much that this would work, bt i can&#x27;t say it did... :( i used it twice a day religiously but didn&#x27;t exercise. Maybe that was the missing factor? But i gave it two stars because it smells really good!!</li>
    <li> But but feels firm but, I&#x27;m still waiting on the cream to do more.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. I have noticed a very big change. My butt is firmer, rounder, and has lifted a bit. I really don&#x27;t do squats that often, with or without squats YOU WILL NOTICE RESULTS!! A MUST have!!!</li>
    <li> Really works&lt;br /&gt;The stretch marks on my breast are less visible</li>
    <li> I use it as directed and it did not do a thing... I have a booty, gravity has taken over a bit, but this creame was the waste of my money.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaping cream ever....definitely performs what it promises!!!!</li>
    <li> i honestly can&#x27;t even believe the results from this. the first day I tried this, i already noticed a small difference. I never thought it would make my butt bigger (paired with very few squats) I barley have to do any squats anymore! I wasn&#x27;t really skeptic about this I just thought it would help even out the shape, but now I&#x27;m blown away by the results and it&#x27;s only been a week! I was seriously about to buy a similar product but for about $50 and in a tiny little jar! this is seriously worth the 15 bucks. and to be honest, I&#x27;ve been feeling so much more confident about my body and my butt feels and looks so much nicer. it also firms it but keeps the skin soft and squishable still. I just ordered some other Eveline creams and this product line is just amazing!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product. Did not see result until about 6 weeks. I have lost 20 lbs and seem like my butt left with the weight but after using for 8 weeks and excise my butt seem firmer and round. Received product in a timmely manner and in good condition</li>
    <li> Works great now I already have some fat on my butt so I notice the pumping up a lot quicker because of this more then likely as for helping with strvh marks and I didn&#x27;t see them go away but my butt is baby soft</li>
    <li> Omg I&#x27;m in love with this product. Hopefully it does not stop working for me. I seen a difference the next day..... yes but I also have been taking the dime curve pills twice a day and rubbing this cream twice a day of course along with exercise ( squats). Get this this asap</li>
    <li> Not much results  in lifting but it seems to firm and soften that&#x27;s all. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> smells really nice and it makes your butt soft nothing more</li>
    <li> I cant say if this helps plump your buttocks but I have been using it for the creases/lines under my eyes and its a miracle. It has helped diminish the appearance of those pesky lines under my eyes helping me to look more youthful and rested. I am satisfied with it if that&#x27;s all it does.</li>
    <li> After using it for two weeks straight measured my buttocks.  No change after then and I was using the serum three times per day.  I am sending them back.  Yes I brought more then one.</li>
    <li> It worked for me. I feel my buttocks bigger and softer. I will reorder it.</li>
    <li> Actually works!! Love it!! Skin smooth?? Mmmmmmm naw. Ass rounder?? ABSOLUTELY!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I have seen a little change in my glute&#x27;s. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using, there is no complains regarding this product, once this item is finished then I will possible order more.</li>
    <li> I used it for a month now and it works. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker but if you control your diet and do a bit of walking - u will notice a change.</li>
    <li> I like this it does plump your booty in round it but the results not permanent</li>
    <li> Never noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week and a day now. And I  can already see results.. My ass it&#x27;s rounder and whenever I feel it, it feels fuller and it&#x27;s gradually lifting up.. It&#x27;s not a significantly obvious change but for that change in a week?, it&#x27;s something.. I even received a compliment from a guy in my class, he asked what I was doin to make it bigger. Lol.. I can&#x27;t wait to finish using it. If I see an obvious result causing even a change in d size if my skirts n pants, I&#x27;ll order more. I use it twice a day, morning/night after I have had my bath, so my skin pores would be clean and the cream can be absorbed maximally</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see no difference</li>
    <li> I gave it one star because it don&#x27;t work at all my butt is not firm or tighter I do not recommend this to nobody I am sorry I bought it</li>
    <li> If something doesnt work Id be the first to say so. I hate spendig money on BS and fake promises. But added this to my breast and butt concoction cream and from my before and progress pictures I can tell I am adding to the areas where it is applied. My breast especially have gone up a half a cup size with massage and this stuff. This is my 2nd time purchasing. Love it.</li>
    <li> I can truly say that this cream works you, you have to be consistent  and it also makes your butt baby smooth and soft OMG!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all just my buttocks smooth</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this and it really firmed and tighten (made my booty bigger by an inch) I HIGHLY recommend this</li>
    <li> Not certain this is lifting anything. It hydrates! Not too wild about the waxy smell. I need another month to give it an accurate review.</li>
    <li> Does not work! I decided to get it because the reviews were so great! Can&#x27;t run away what the good Lord gave me. Sadly, this was a waste of time and money!</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for my somewhat saggy butt, but have been using this on my breasts as well, and I have to say, THIS IS AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTLE &amp; CLAIMS: What may not be in the description (though I believe it should be on here) is that this is for a &amp;#34;PUSH-UP appearance&amp;#34; - when I first read this on the bottle I went &amp;#34;Oh.. this only *enhances* the appearance, not necessarily make it &amp;#34;fatter&amp;#34; (excuse the term) or bigger&amp;#34;, and I have been so far right. For those with very little actual fat tissue in the buttocks area, I doubt this could help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONTENT: One of the first things you&#x27;ll notice when firs lathering it on is the strong, amazing scent this lotion has. I mean, I could even smell it before opening it!! It is that strong of a smell, and thankfully it is pleasant. Within a few hours of wear I noticed how ridiculously soft my butt and my breasts were. I mean they were SOFT. Initially I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference, other than having really soft private areas!! However, within a week or two I started noticing a bit of a fuller-looking butt, sideways, which had never been like before!! &amp; then I looked to my breasts and noticed the same. It seemed the slopes of both had increased significantly. All of a sudden the tops of my breasts and butt seemed so much fuller and both looked so much rounder!! Note: I had been doing butt/leg workouts before and while using the serum, however the serum seemed to make the effect of the workouts much greater!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it as often within a week after that, mostly using it sometimes once a week, sometimes none at all. And I also noticed my butt going back to its sloppy, saggy self again, along with my breasts - so I think this &amp;#34;push-up&amp;#34; effect may be TEMPORARY, rather then permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product, for the scent alone, and it seems to do what it claims, which is PUSH-UP your butt, not make it bigger. I rate it 4 stars onlybecause the effect is temporary, would love this if it were a bit more permanent!! Would I purchase again? Only if I had another $13 to spare ... which I don&#x27;t often.</li>
    <li> Well this was a waste of my Money. It did not work for me i have been using it for almost a month now and i see no Difference. It smells Ok.It Goes on well but i just did not see a difference. Maybe not good for African american skin?</li>
    <li> I dnt c the results i thought i wud c but im still usein every morin &amp; every nite i hv a nice butt i jus wnted it lift a lil more it look the same</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about a month and a half now. I apply it in the morning before dressing, and after a shower at night. DO THIS EVERY DAY and you will get results. I noticed first my butt got really smooth and soft - like seriously. My boyfriend noticed right away and commented on it. After a few weeks I noticed it was toning, making it less uh.. cellulite-y and more firm/large. Don&#x27;t expect it to get huge, but it defiantly makes it better. Combine this cream with some squats and exercise and you&#x27;re golden. I will probably buy this product for a long time, even just for the softness. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Your skin will definitely be moisturized, soft and smooth. I make sure I apply it twice a day and have since I received the tube. At the end of two weeks I started to see a difference. Not a dramatic one but definitely a difference. It didn&#x27;t feel firmer but it appears to be a little rounder.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this product and I have been using it for about a week now. I have seen slight improvements. I know its not enough time to really say it works 100% but it has helped with cellulite and the softness. I will continue to use to see if it makes a difference in size. I do include some squats with this lotion to tone your booty more.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for your money. It&#x27;s too soon to know if it works but the price is reasonable enough to give it a try. I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight so I&#x27;m trying to keep my behind firm.</li>
    <li> Been using it about 1 week and I can see results already, love the smell!</li>
    <li> well i just got it but i gave it four stars because i love the smell, sooo fresh ,maybe within a week or so i&#x27;ll update on the product&#x27;s performance but loving it so far...</li>
    <li> Horriable ! It gave me rashes and when I tryed to get my money back I never did</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, I started using this product only one day and I already see results. Just hoping the results are permanent.</li>
    <li> Only after two weeks of using this product I could see a difference in my booty. It was already big but looked lifted, i will be purchasing another bottle. It also made it extrem</li>
    <li> Good and nice smell but it won&#x27;t work miracles so if you really want to shape your bottom you just have to start working out</li>
    <li> This lotion smells really good, and it will give you the appearance of being more lifted, but I saw no increase in size. I actually think I was getting smaller, to test this I started applying he lotion to my breasts (because I can afford to lose mass more in that area) and sure enough after a week they too appeared slightly lifted but were smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line it smells good and will lift you but if you are looking for an increase in size (like I am) I would stay away.</li>
    <li> Been using it for almost a week and it actually makes my butt look fuller, can&#x27;t give 5 stars yet</li>
    <li> I love this product so far. I must live like in the same state as the seller cause even with standard delivery it got here in 3 days. It smells wonderful makes skin silky smootb and most importantly added giggle to my wiggle will purchase when i run out. If its not broke dont fix it</li>
    <li> it sucked it made it smaller garbage and mad sticky</li>
    <li> One tube almost finished and I still can&#x27;t tell....I have high hopes but for now just soft skin.</li>
    <li> After just 3 days of use I can already see &amp; tell the difference! My butt is now more softer &amp; looks bigger then before..... Not to mention when I order in stead of 2 for the price of one! So far I&#x27;m happy with my results &amp; I will order more from this company!</li>
    <li> I am glad I purchased this. I will keep using it. My friemds can tell a difference in my size. I would recommend this product to those who wants to go up a size</li>
    <li> This stuff works if u follow the instructions as stated on the bottle. It makes your skin soft and smooth,  and it helps to lift and lessens the appearance of celulite. I will definitely purchase again after my first bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> Not good smells great</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Bought this product and I immediately started using it. Although i work most of the time, i dont really have much time to apply it but i try everytime i can, sometimes two times a day or one. Its been like 2 weeks ever since im using it and i feel like its working, its doing what its supposed to do. Ive seen a little difference in my butt. Overall, im happy with this product, its not the BEST but its not like its doing nothing at all.</li>
    <li> This product works in time..but I also think that doing some buttocks exercises increases its effect. My buttocks actually got rounder.</li>
    <li> In all honesty i noticed a change within 4 days of using it but i do recommend if you have a lot of allergies to things then do not buy this. This brought out a horrible rash now that i do not know how to get rid of let alone hope it doesn&#x27;t scar. The people shipped it fast not damaged it was great customer service. But sadly i guess its just my body who did not like the ingredients that were in the lotion itself. But i do recommend it if you do not have a lot of allergies.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and i see results!</li>
    <li> This cream has worked really well for me but keep in mind it works better and faster when you exercise. Use it and do squats etc and the results will be great presently on my second tube and I will continue to use this product. No side effects however everyone is different. Nice scent and it moisturizes the skin I have got many compliments on my butt for the past 6 weeks I have been using this product. For best results apply in the morning and evening.</li>
    <li> It works but not as dramatic as some of the other reviews  betrayed.</li>
    <li> great smell and it makes your skin very smooth. works very well keeping your skin moist throughout the day. the only disappointment is there still has been no change in size or shape. I am going to continue to purchase this product to see the long term outcome.</li>
    <li> It works and i can definitely see a diference on my butt it makes it fuller and rounder and tighter too! you need to use it twice  a day and do some squats too.!!!</li>
    <li> Well, I purchased this cream to make my butt bigger. It didn&#x27;t make my butt all that big, but it did make my hips A LOT bigger. I started using this product on March 20th. Sometimes I forget to put it on, and I don&#x27;t do exercise. But this works!! It really filled out my &#x27;hip dips&#x27; if you guys know what that is. I&#x27;m going to start putting this on my thighs, and I WILL BE DEFINITELY PURCHASING THIS AGAIN!! (-:</li>
    <li> I will never buy maca root or slim extreme buttocks shaping serum again...neither worked at all....slim extrerpme just smell good and maca root had me sick...i want a refund....so serious..</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, I BEEN USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS AND I AM ON MY 2ND ORDER, I AM TOTALLY IMPRESS LOVE IT</li>
    <li> It really works! My butt is fuller and firmer. I&#x27;ve noticed it and so does everyone around me. I work out as well so you may have to. I do leg press and use the glute machine.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 4 months and i was working out as well.it did make quite a difference ; makes buttocks firmer, rounder and plumper and also makes the skin so soft!i really liked the smell and the fact that the skin absorbs it fast. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker though. As the other reviewers sayed, you have best results if you combine it with exercise and if you exfoliate once in a while.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend can see the difference, but has no idea I&#x27;m using it! Might get more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some changes in my butt area but not to much ,honestly i don&#x27;t even know if its from this product or if its because ive been working out everyday</li>
    <li> This product received a single star because it was unsuccessful. I&#x27;m convince that only working out and diet will affect the shape of a person&#x27;s buttocks or any other part of the body.</li>
    <li> I am still using it. I already have a nicely shaped buttocks, so I am waiting to see significant results in about three more weeks. This product is a great hydrant though.</li>
    <li> have had this product for a week smells really good but have not yet notices any change!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!! 😡👎👎👎😡</li>
    <li> So this thing is INCREDIBLE.  When I finished the first container nothing happened. lol I&#x27;m a model so I wasn&#x27;t trying to get  a huge butt, just nice and firm. Butt it didn&#x27;t look like anything was happening. So I kept using it but took my mind away but got a second one cause I was how my butt felt. I SWEAR OUT OF NOWHERE THE FIRMNESS APPEARED lol. What makes this product great is that, it&#x27;s not magic, you have to work with it. I had to stop doing squats for a while because my ass was so round and bouncy lol. IF YOU DON&#x27;T EXERCISE while using this, you&#x27;ll only get a smoother butt but not round and firm.. I do 100 squats daily... my waist is thinner and my butt rounder... I LOVE IT!! Will definitely be ordering more</li>
    <li> I love this product it does exactly what it says gives your tush a firm lifted appearance Thank you slim extreme</li>
    <li> i havent even been doig squats and this cream still lifted my behind.  I can actually feel a difference when im putting on pants. my back side is slightly plumper rounder and lifted! super sexy. my boyfriend said my bottom is super soft and he cant get enough of the extra jiggle. ive only been using this product for 3 weeks and sometimes i only applied it once a day . im going to try squats while using the slim 3d extreme cream and see how far i can go with this product. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Very nice I love the smell basically have my body feeling soft an smooth normally I use it after my showers before I relax for bed</li>
    <li> i dont see it working yet its only my 2nd week</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Ive been using it for 4weeks and I have not seen any results. My butt is the same and flat as ever.</li>
    <li> I had already have nice ample bottom. I just wanted to define the &amp;#34;curve&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hook&amp;#34; where the back of the thigh and glutes meet.  This does work very well.  I use it without exercise and saw great results used it with exercise even better results. My results are lasting because I do exercise daily.</li>
    <li> im a repeat customer I love this products really works shipping was really fast,i  will continue to reorder</li>
    <li> Product does not do what it claims. I have no lifting, shaping or enlargement of my buttocks. Product does have a nice scent and leaves your skin soft but so does almost any lotion and for a far cheaper price. Bottom line it doesn&#x27;t work so don&#x27;t waste your time or money......</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first to try it, but I am proud to say that after about a year and a half ( maybe more ) I have been hooked on this amazing product !!!!! It&#x27;s given me lift and tone , supple skin &amp; firmness , even with squats &amp; after a baby ! I have NO CELLULITE or stretch marks on my bottom thanks to this . It&#x27;s really awesome stuff !!!!</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of reviews on this I decided to try it out for myself, most of the reviews were positive so I figured &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;. But maybe its just not for me because I have seen no change at all n have been using it daily like it says on the instructions for about a month n some. Kinda disappointed</li>
    <li> It really works , I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in the lifting and it has created a fuller look and it&#x27;s only been Alittle over a week .</li>
    <li> Def see a different in about two wks u see a change</li>
    <li> As with the serum for Abdomen &amp; Buttocks, this did not work for me. I loved the smell, however, I never saw results</li>
    <li> This serum smells great and I see a little improvement I think. I would recommend to anyone looking for a little boost in that area.</li>
    <li> If I were brave enough to have taken a before and after picture ,not sure if I would have been brave enough to share. On that note lol.... I am in need of some significant amount of weight loss and have been doing ok.  Decided to add some creams to my regimen. Well I know they are working on my cellulite and smoothing my skin. And of course my husband is my big cheering squad. The biggggg deal is when my daughter told me... My butt was higher without any questions from me ,my jaw dropped. She had no clue I was using any cream. We were just hanging out and she just started talking about my butt. Ok ,so ladies if my daughter noticed and commented....it is a go...oh yeah...silence is her compliment and she is quick to point out &amp;#34;not so good mom&amp;#34;. I was sooo excited as she just kept talking, calmly describing the changes lol. I tried to be cool also. But on the inside...could not wait to go order some more lol.</li>
    <li> Great product smell really  good also</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and the smell is awesome I have been using this product for over a week and have noticed the difference, my butt is rounder and fuller..I out it on 2 times daily in the morning and after a nice hot shower, will be purchasing this product again..Thank you</li>
    <li> I actually havent been using it that long just to be clear&lt;br /&gt; i got it because its one of the few products that have shi mu in it, i read about shi mu from the Natural Curve Enhancement Guide and how it can really aid in your butt growing journey.&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference already in the week its been, but i feel like the results i see may be temporary. since i just recently started trying to grow my ass i dont want to get too excited and expect growth like this every week. but would it  be so wrong not to? lol</li>
    <li> I used this product for a month as directed on the bottle and I saw results n so did my friends and a lot of my guy friends lol I will be buying this again</li>
    <li> Ordered this and received it very quick which was great! Just started using this product this week so haven&#x27;t really had a chance to see how well it works... I will be sure to update again as to what my thoughts are on it in the next couple weeks. I can say I love the smell and it makes my skin nice and soft!!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do nothing to my booty n I run do squats and work out but na... I&#x27;ll say the squating did most the work.. I&#x27;ll get another see how it goes</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received the cream in the mail as I was eager to try it after reading all the great reviews. Well, its been three weeks now (maybe four) since I&#x27;ve been using the product and I honestly didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference. At least not in a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; way. I used the product twice a day as recommended and I absolutely loved the smell. It did make my skin incredibly soft which was nice, and it did seem to tighten up my butt because I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t as round as before and did seem to be more lifted. But I didnt like that at all. I thought with it helping tighten and lifting my butt, that it would make it appear fuller and more round and it did the complete opposite and made it less round and less full looking. I honestly don&#x27;t even know how thats possible. So I decided to start using it once a day instead. After a while I kinda gave up on it because I just did not like the results I was seeing. If you want to tone and tighten your butt, then this may work for you. But if you are looking for a more round and fuller butt as this states like I was, then I would not recommend this product. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it three stars is because it did seem to lift my butt and I really enjoyed the smell. but for the price and the results I got, it wasn&#x27;t worth the money. I&#x27;ve had better results using firming creams for way cheaper at target and such.</li>
    <li> I saw a difference the first few days. I enjoy the product and will try other products from slim extreme.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t hard tell butt area supposed to be the best way to grow. Don&#x27;t know how can tell butt bun lol....</li>
    <li> Gained 2 inches on my hips and .5 of booty</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m just going to say that I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been one day, and I can somewhat see a difference in my booty!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never really had a large bottom, but it&#x27;s not flat.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanted something to round it out and make it more firm.&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I will suggest, that you do squats. The first 5 minutes within using the product was non-noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;But I did a few sets of squats and I could feel a little bit of a tingle. My thighs were sore, but my bottom felt nice.&lt;br /&gt;I will give it 4 stars for now until I actually see a difference with the product.&lt;br /&gt;But this is definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s simple came on time and it&#x27;s working i can feel it and see some difference</li>
    <li> It worked great I gained 3inches on my hips I&#x27;m 2 months</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders, with exercise I eliminated all the cellulite from my butt and thighs (with help from the 4D slim extreme on my thighs) I was amazed how fast it works. My skin is tighter and softer!</li>
    <li> Product great for a firm butt. I did minor work outs and I went up a size in jeans. Very happy with quick results</li>
    <li> Used this for a whole month didn&#x27;t see a difference.  Maybe I should have used it longer... fast shipping though.</li>
    <li> Smell good but did not do nothing for me.</li>
    <li> This sucks big time I still ain&#x27;t seen nothing happen to my butt or my legs what kind of stuff y&#x27;all out here selling cause this is trash!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, save your money</li>
    <li> I seen no improvement but to each their own you have to try it for yourself</li>
    <li> It did not lift my butt or add any fullness. I have used it faithfully twice a day and nothing. It smells good and makes my skin soft after I apply it but thats about it. I would not buy it again.</li>
</ol>
