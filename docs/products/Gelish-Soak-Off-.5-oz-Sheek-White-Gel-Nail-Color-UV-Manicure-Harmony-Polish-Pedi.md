### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great coverage</li>
      <li>Great polish.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look good until you put it on in a couple coats.</li>
      <li>Winning!</li>
      <li>I brought the gelish system so I could do my nails on my own without paying someone else.  </li>
      <li>Love it when that happens</li>
      <li>and I still love the price and quantity.</li>
      <li>It came and it looks more orange then anything else.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and stay on forever.</li>
      <li>Great with a French manicure I bet.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible but would look great.</li>
      <li>Great French tip with the long-lasting benefits of gel.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Perfect white for French manicure!</li>
      <li>The white color is perfect to do french manicures!</li>
      <li>With a bit of practice &amp; the right product (smoothing foundation, gel polish, white polish for the tips, brush to make the smile lines, top coat, rubbing alcohol &amp; acetone, curing light, DONE!)</li>
      <li>This combined with a nice pink like pretty princess is great for a french.</li>
      <li>Doing my own french manicures &amp; avoiding nail salon drama!  </li>
      <li>Gelish stays on til you take it off if you do it right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m right handed</li>
      <li>But with gelish just wipe off your mistakes and repeat until it&#x27;s right.</li>
      <li>I love this white.</li>
      <li>I use it with the entire gelish line...foundation and top coat.</li>
      <li>Looks so natural and clean.  </li>
      <li>great for my french tips and is very white and doesn&#x27;t yellow.</li>
      <li>Love it, white on white.  </li>
      <li>For whatever reason, this product comes off more sheer than white.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Loved the price and the amount that comes in the bottle (compared to lots of other brands with 1/2-1/3 of the amount and $5 more expensive.</li>
      <li>and it took time to hold the brush and get the white on just right.  </li>
      <li>The only problem was my right hand.  </li>
      <li>This white is bright white, looks great over &amp;#34;taffeta&amp;#34; polish (very subtle pink, looks like my natural nail bed with a tiny shimmer).  </li>
      <li>Came early!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest a different color if you want a true white color.</li>
      <li>Makes your nail stand out and look like a professional person did them.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that because the brush is larger than the other smaller bottle gel brushes, it&#x27;s really hard not to get too much polish on the nail (which means the polish is more likely to peel off).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gentle white not stark white.</li>
      <li>Generally I like Gelish products, but this nail polish is a pain in the neck.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve got a gel manicure that lasts for at least 2 weeks, right from my home!  </li>

<li> Excellent-order arrived earlier than expected.</li>
<li> I have several other Gelish polishes and they don&#x27;t act this way.</li>
<li> and she called me next day saying that half... HALF of the nail polish peeled off already.</li>
<li> It tends to split phases all the time and no matter how hard you mix it back together - it will peel off.</li>
<li> I used two coats, and it looks just like the picture with two coats; one coat was too thin, as other reviews cited, but I never use just one coat.  </li>
<li> Disappointing.</li>
<li> I am really disappointed with this color and will not order it again.  </li>

    <li> Came early! Love it when that happens</li>
    <li> Excellent-order arrived earlier than expected. Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> Generally I like Gelish products, but this nail polish is a pain in the neck. It tends to split phases all the time and no matter how hard you mix it back together - it will peel off. What a shame it was when I made french for friend of mine before testing this on myself and she called me next day saying that half... HALF of the nail polish peeled off already. I have several other Gelish polishes and they don&#x27;t act this way.</li>
    <li> Love it, white on white.  Great polish.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, this product comes off more sheer than white. Almost like it needs to be shaken. But shaking it doesn&#x27;t help. You have to so several coats or it to appear white. Disappointing. I&#x27;d suggest a different color if you want a true white color.</li>
    <li> This color is all about summer.  Looks so natural and clean.  Makes your nail stand out and look like a professional person did them.</li>
    <li> I like to use this for the french tips and do not add the use of the pink for the nail bed. This covers well with just two coats. I do like this polish.</li>
    <li> I used two coats, and it looks just like the picture with two coats; one coat was too thin, as other reviews cited, but I never use just one coat.  Great French tip with the long-lasting benefits of gel.</li>
    <li> Sheek White.........I do not like!  😜  it isn&#x27;t the color I don&#x27;t like it is the fact that it peels off.  My Artic Freeze doesn&#x27;t do that.  I am really disappointed with this color and will not order it again.  It is back to Artic White for me.  Now to figure out a way to get rid of the Sheek White.</li>
    <li> I looked at this color in probably 6 different website examples.  It came and it looks more orange then anything else. Not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this white. It doesn&#x27;t look good until you put it on in a couple coats. It&#x27;s a gentle white not stark white. Great with a French manicure I bet. Don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible but would look great. Price a little high I think.</li>
    <li> The white color is perfect to do french manicures! I use it with the entire gelish line...foundation and top coat.</li>
    <li> Gelish stays on til you take it off if you do it right. This combined with a nice pink like pretty princess is great for a french. Easy to apply and stay on forever.</li>
    <li> I brought the gelish system so I could do my nails on my own without paying someone else.  I use the sheek white to do the french manicure.  My nails look like a professinal did them.  The only problem was my right hand.  I&#x27;m right handed and it took time to hold the brush and get the white on just right.  But with gelish just wipe off your mistakes and repeat until it&#x27;s right.</li>
    <li> Doing my own french manicures &amp; avoiding nail salon drama!  With a bit of practice &amp; the right product (smoothing foundation, gel polish, white polish for the tips, brush to make the smile lines, top coat, rubbing alcohol &amp; acetone, curing light, DONE!), I&#x27;ve got a gel manicure that lasts for at least 2 weeks, right from my home!  This white is bright white, looks great over &amp;#34;taffeta&amp;#34; polish (very subtle pink, looks like my natural nail bed with a tiny shimmer).  Winning!</li>
    <li> Loved the price and the amount that comes in the bottle (compared to lots of other brands with 1/2-1/3 of the amount and $5 more expensive. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is that because the brush is larger than the other smaller bottle gel brushes, it&#x27;s really hard not to get too much polish on the nail (which means the polish is more likely to peel off). But I&#x27;d still buy it again. Great coverage and I still love the price and quantity.</li>
    <li> Perfect white for French manicure!</li>
    <li> great for my french tips and is very white and doesn&#x27;t yellow.</li>
