### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is hands-down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I also brought it on a 2 week hiking trip and it was flawless.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I think this is the best deodorant on Earth!</li>
      <li>It smells great and is very effective!  </li>
      <li>The combo of lemon and Tom&#x27;s works great all day.</li>
      <li>Great idea.</li>
      <li>This has worked great.</li>
      <li>Love this product!!  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing!</li>
      <li>It smells good.</li>
      <li>Lafe&#x27;s stick deodorant is a good alternative.</li>
      <li>Like the smell, and it seemed to work good for me.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell, great for women.</li>
      <li>You can either wear a T-shirt, if it is a really nice shirt, as I do when I wear a shirt with a tie or a colored T-shirt when I wear a nice Tommy Bahama silk shirt.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees products are generally good, and I have given them many times as gifts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, but so strong that I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m filling a room</li>
      <li>Although it does wash out easily with a good detergent.</li>
      <li>The smell is just like cleaning products, like Pine Sol or something, and is very strong.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve smelled good, and kept my shirts clean.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant, my stepdaughter introduced it to me, I am a woman not guy wearing it, can&#x27;t use anti perspirant any more, love the smell, and lasts more than 24 hrs drying out smell!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-toxic unlike most underarm deodorants, and it also helps provide lubrication against chafing.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Would not recommend, my shirts were only undershirts ruined, wouldn&#x27;t e happy if they were my good shirts.</li>
      <li>Smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>After using it for about a week, I immediately purchased two more for reserve.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, love the effectiveness, and I have never had an issue with clothes in the wash.</li>
      <li>I also love the scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found it overwhelming and cloying after a while.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>If you have experienced irreversable damage from this product I highly recommend contacting the company ASAP and explaining your situation.  </li>
      <li>The Burt&#x27;s Bees men&#x27;s natural line smells great.</li>
      <li>It was just what I was looking for: all truly natural ingredients, an attractive bergamot smell, and a somewhat affordable price.  </li>
      <li>For me, this is a bit of an overly strong scent.</li>
      <li>And if you don&#x27;t sweat it works fine.</li>
      <li>My dress shirts are all fine.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic product.</li>
      <li>It smells OK, albeit pretty strong.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to like this product, because it&#x27;s all natural, and while the odor is a strong one, I liked it...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a solid non-toxic and refreshing deodorant for some time, so as you could imagine I was thrilled when I found this product.</li>
      <li>Although a bit strong on the scent, it leaves you feeling fresh and clean clean (pun pun).</li>
      <li>Here is the full body of the response I received to my complaint:&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Loved the smell but after two days use I had an allergic reaction akin to several mosquito bites in each pit.</li>
      <li>Also, if you use a mild soap like me, you&#x27;ll have to wash your armpits like three times to feel like you got this stuff off.</li>
      <li>This product is awesome: The only coconut oil based deodorant that stays solid as a stick.</li>
      <li>I liked this product just OK initially even though after applying it to your pits, it would turn into a bit of a foamy lather (even after applying it very conservatively).  </li>
      <li>It has an extremely strong citronella candle smell and any odor protection it offers fades very quickly.  </li>
      <li>So, if you enjoy sporting stained armpits, or if you are just looking for an excuse to spend your time and money at the dry cleaners, this product may be perfect for you.  </li>
      <li>The Tom&#x27;s brand worked fine but didn&#x27;t last for more than about 6 hours (on cool days).</li>
      <li>it time to work though as most people who are accustomed to using anti perspirant may need to time for their pits to clear</li>
      <li>love Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff, but stay far away from this product.</li>
      <li>However, after a weeks worth of use, I did my laundry, and every shirt I wore after using this deodorant has been ruined...  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, which is a good thing, so if you&#x27;re active you will still sweat.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would strongly recommend this product for people looking to free themselves from the chemically-enhanced mainstream brands.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees generally.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product at a local organic market and liked it enough to see if I could get a better price online.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Burts Bee&#x27;s Deodorant for a while - it smells great, no doubt, but I can only apply the most miniscule amount other wise is stains my shirts - - there must be some kind of oil in it that causes the stains - really disappointing -</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is cocoa butter (most of the other ingredients are oils too), which is fine for maintaining moisture elsewhere on your body, but putting it in your armpits every day feels kind of gross.</li>
      <li>And the smell in this is very strong, so unless you, your significant other and your co-workers all REALLY like the smell, it&#x27;s going to be a problem.</li>
      <li>I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees might send their apologies along with a semi-condescending gesture such as a coupon towards the purchase of more of their products.  </li>
      <li>Great long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>Oh and it might feel wierd at first since the texture is a bit waxy, sort of like lip balm.</li>
      <li>Though the pits were a little musty, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>But as far as protection goes, Its a cool weather</li>
      <li>Taking advantage of a good brand -- lazy product.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really last all day when I&#x27;m really active.  </li>
      <li>It is my armpits that I have to wash daily as the BO does get strong, even when inactive.</li>
      <li>It would, however, make a fine armpit wax, should such a thing ever be needed.</li>
      <li>and this really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because I like Burt&#x27;s company as a whole...</li>
      <li>Your results may vary, but as&lt;br /&gt; much as I like burts bees, I don&#x27;t see myself using this again.</li>
      <li>Works all day when I&#x27;m not moving around much though.</li>
      <li>Fearing that I may be interrupting the air space of others, I cut my time at the store short and went back to my car where I had a backup stick of Speed Stick deodorant for just this kind of circumstance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most important though..no dubious ingredients like aluminum and other stuff that could potentially be harmful.</li>
      <li>While it is the last ingredient, so there is very little, GMOs can be called \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; and is deceptive advertising IMO, which Burt&#x27;s proudly displays on it&#x27;s label.</li>
      <li>While it is the last ingredient, so there is very little, GMOs can be called \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; and is deceptive advertising IMO, which Burt&#x27;s proudly displays on it&#x27;s label.</li>
      <li>Bought for my dad who is very allergic to normal deoderant.</li>
      <li>The bigger reason I won&#x27;t buy it again is that it is super greasy and gooey.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to those who have allergies as well as those who don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve decided to give up, trash the several affected tees (which are many as I had this deodorant for several weeks) and just buy new ones, as I can&#x27;t stand the smell any longer.</li>
      <li>In the mean time, until I come across something better, I recommend this product, as it smells good,lasts quite some time for me and is still a better alternative to the other products I was using; Mennen Speed Stick and Crystal (Aum Salt).</li>
      <li>In the mean time, until I come across something better, I recommend this product, as it smells good,lasts quite some time for me and is still a better alternative to the other products I was using; Mennen Speed Stick and Crystal (Aum Salt).</li>
      <li>There are three other options if one is worrying more about the shirt than the toxins going into the body, either use the less desirable deodorants on those special occasions, go au natural or try another</li>
      <li>Fortunately, as I have mentioned, it was a dark</li>
      <li>It is strong smelling, so a little goes</li>
      <li>About 3 hours later as I was leaning down to reach an item on the bottom shelf of a store I was in, I was struck with a potent smell of body odor.</li>
      <li>If neither of these applies to you, I suggest you steer clear of this deodorant.</li>
      <li>whose parent company (Clorox) is anything but natural.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, we can recommend a few ways to remove any staining.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>All natural and organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given this product five stars</li>
      <li>Product is very greasy and very yellow.</li>
      <li>far as the product, there are two things to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Has a masculine scent without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>They claim it&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>After searching for a natural, environmentally-friendly, socially responsible deodorant on several websites and the goodguide.com&#x27;s smartphone web application, I discovered Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Deodorant for Men.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it just isn&#x27;t good.</li>
      <li>Again, it is strong, so a little goes a long way.he body, either use the less desirable deodorants on those special occasions, go au natural or try another product.    </li>
      <li>only product!&lt;br /&gt;Heavy labor or high heat rendered its protection null and void!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Chafing may not be a problem if you live somewhere with low humidity, but I live in Oklahoma where the humidity is 80-100% regularly, and this helps a lot.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my old routine, which is natural, and because it works: Cut out a lemon wedge, rub it on my underarms after I get out of the shower, and then put Tom&#x27;s on.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t really last all day when I&#x27;m really active.  Works all day when I&#x27;m not moving around much though.</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees men&#x27;s natural line smells great. It&#x27;s a citrusy cedary manly smelling fragrance. Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s like rubbing manly scented hand salve in your pits. Doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, and only slightly masks the smell of body odor. And the smell in this is very strong, so unless you, your significant other and your co-workers all REALLY like the smell, it&#x27;s going to be a problem. I found it overwhelming and cloying after a while. Product is very greasy and very yellow. Don&#x27;t plan on wearing white shirts. This will stain them. Even darker shirts will get grease stains from the essential oils in this. Great idea. Terrible execution.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant. Great long lasting scent. Most important though..no dubious ingredients like aluminum and other stuff that could potentially be harmful. All natural and organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given this product five stars, only issue though is it&#x27;s a bit thick..so it does take a little longer to dry out and leaves some residue when you sweat.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Burts Bee&#x27;s Deodorant for a while - it smells great, no doubt, but I can only apply the most miniscule amount other wise is stains my shirts - - there must be some kind of oil in it that causes the stains - really disappointing - I would look for a different product</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, because it&#x27;s all natural, and while the odor is a strong one, I liked it...  However, after a weeks worth of use, I did my laundry, and every shirt I wore after using this deodorant has been ruined...  I&#x27;ve tried using Zout, Shout, and OxyClean stain removers to remove these stains, but nothing works...  I will be going after Burt&#x27;s Bees for the replacement of seven shirts...  Avoid this product at all costs...</li>
    <li> Love this product!!  Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Taking advantage of a good brand -- lazy product. I specifically came to write a review not realizing others had shared my problems. Although my shirts have been fine upon dry cleaning unlike other reviewers, my main complaint: it lasts less than 4 hours.</li>
    <li> My 11 year old son has a horrible allergy to deodorant and anti-perspirant.  This is the only one of all the 20 or so that we tried that he did not have a reaction to.  It smells great and is very effective!  Highly recommend to those who have allergies as well as those who don&#x27;t.  I think this is the best deodorant on Earth!</li>
    <li> This product is a real disappointment. I gave this deodorant a try, and will never use it again. The smell is strong and unpleasant, (to my nose anyway). As mentioned by other customer posts, it WILL also stain your clothing. Burt&#x27;s Bees products are generally good, and I have given them many times as gifts. This one they should take this one out of their product line and retool. Lafe&#x27;s stick deodorant is a good alternative.</li>
    <li> I have no clue what anyone is talking about when they say this product \\&quot;ruined their shirts\\&quot; that&#x27;s ridiculous, I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for like 7 months now (and it did last that long) and I&#x27;ve smelled good, and kept my shirts clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff because I switched from \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot; deodorant several months ago. The Tom&#x27;s brand worked fine but didn&#x27;t last for more than about 6 hours (on cool days). I&#x27;m also a fan of the scents they offer. I bought Tom&#x27;s because it was a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this stuff smells like patchouli and rosemary, seems to give out almost instantly, and quite tacky on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to my old routine, which is natural, and because it works: Cut out a lemon wedge, rub it on my underarms after I get out of the shower, and then put Tom&#x27;s on. The combo of lemon and Tom&#x27;s works great all day. I usually have to reapply a lemon wedge every 3-5 days, depending on the weather and what I&#x27;ve been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this garbage.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I love the smell, great for women. It also lasts all day. As an athletic female I needed a product like this. Bought 4 of them!!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s face it, \\&quot;aluminum\\&quot; deodorant products are bad for ones health, but they work - that&#x27;s the unfortunate thing! This product has promise because it hasn&#x27;t any aluminum or artificial ingredients, it smells  masculine, but it falls short because although the ingredients initially smell great, the body odors eventually come through and in the end the product doesn&#x27;t work too well. Since this product doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum ingredients to kill the funky body smells, you will have that funky hippie or European underarm smell at the end of the day, and applying more of the product isn&#x27;t going to help you a bit because it will probably make the condition worse! Maybe Burt can add some type of alcohol or menthol or tea tree solution to combat that \\&quot;Woodstock\\&quot; hippie or that \\&quot;Europeans who don&#x27;t like to wash too much\\&quot; odor? And there&#x27;s also now this issue with the shirt staining. Back to the drawing boards on this one Burt!</li>
    <li> As some of the other reviewers, I too wanted to like this product. After searching for a natural, environmentally-friendly, socially responsible deodorant on several websites and the goodguide.com&#x27;s smartphone web application, I discovered Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Deodorant for Men. It was just what I was looking for: all truly natural ingredients, an attractive bergamot smell, and a somewhat affordable price.  I purchased it thinking that this would be the only deodorant I would ever need again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I applied it, however, I had my doubts, as the product is very thick and waxy. It felt similar to putting a mix of petroleum jelly and melted candles under my arms.  This led to immediate suspicions about it&#x27;s effects on clothing.  Wearing a dark colored t-shirt that wouldn&#x27;t show deodorant stains, I left to run some errands.  About 3 hours later as I was leaning down to reach an item on the bottom shelf of a store I was in, I was struck with a potent smell of body odor. As I am a thin man who doesn&#x27;t sweat very much--Speed Stick Regular deodorant (non-antiperspirant) is all I have ever needed--I was shocked that I smelled as if I had just finished a boxing match.  Fearing that I may be interrupting the air space of others, I cut my time at the store short and went back to my car where I had a backup stick of Speed Stick deodorant for just this kind of circumstance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home, I examined the shirt I was wearing and as I suspected, it had a layer of waxy residue under the sleeves that looks like it will be very difficult to remove.  Fortunately, as I have mentioned, it was a dark shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this product is expensive, ineffectual, and damaging to clothes. It would, however, make a fine armpit wax, should such a thing ever be needed.</li>
    <li> Smells ok, but doesn&#x27;t work.  I tried Tom&#x27;s and got my underarms chemically burned.  Burt&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t burn my pits but it doesn&#x27;t keep the smell away. It will stain your shirts!! I&#x27;m trying jungleman next.  If that doesn&#x27;t work I guess I&#x27;m going back to old spice.  I&#x27;m giving 2 stars because I like Burt&#x27;s company as a whole... just not this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at a local organic market and liked it enough to see if I could get a better price online. I paid about $3 less at the store, so I&#x27;ll continue to buy it locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product, there are two things to know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is strong smelling, so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You only want to swipe it one time. Unlike a Mennen speed stick where you rub it back and forth a few times, this stuff is not super hard and doesn&#x27;t have the slippery propylene glycol (anti-freeze) in it, so it goes on thick. Again, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I don&#x27;t shower every day when I am not going into town, usually every other day. It is my armpits that I have to wash daily as the BO does get strong, even when inactive. I try to avoid using deodorant when I can, because of health reasons; various intestinal issues, caused in part by toxins introduced into my system over the years. Anyway, I put this on the other morning, after a shower, and two days later my armpits still smelled reasonably like this deodorant&#x27;s bergamot and other citrus oils. Though the pits were a little musty, I am very pleased with this product. I did not do any major physical exercise, though I did haul up some firewood from below and started some minor spring cleanup outside, it was not any activity that broke a noticeable sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the stained shirt issue, I think some people might have put on too much product, and because it is made with coconut oil, sesame oil, beeswax and other oils, it would be no different than getting grease/olive oil on the front of a shirt while eating or cooking. You can either wear a T-shirt, if it is a really nice shirt, as I do when I wear a shirt with a tie or a colored T-shirt when I wear a nice Tommy Bahama silk shirt. You can also hit the shirt(s) with some Spray and Wash before tossing in the laundry or use something similar. There are three other options if one is worrying more about the shirt than the toxins going into the body, either use the less desirable deodorants on those special occasions, go au natural or try another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor complaint about this product is that it is not organic and for the price, perhaps it could be, especially since one of the ingredients is canola oil, which is certainly GMO. While it is the last ingredient, so there is very little, GMOs can be called \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; and is deceptive advertising IMO, which Burt&#x27;s proudly displays on it&#x27;s label. I personally find nothing natural about Genetically Engineered products. In the mean time, until I come across something better, I recommend this product, as it smells good,lasts quite some time for me and is still a better alternative to the other products I was using; Mennen Speed Stick and Crystal (Aum Salt). Again, it is strong, so a little goes a long way.he body, either use the less desirable deodorants on those special occasions, go au natural or try another product.

    <li> While I have not experienced any issues with shirts being ruined, I do not care for this product what-so-ever.  It has an extremely strong citronella candle smell and any odor protection it offers fades very quickly.  This deodorant doesn&#x27;t even last 12 hours and I have a desk job.  In addition to these issues, the prices is just ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> it ruins shirts in one application! :( Do not buy !</li>
    <li> If only I had checked reviews prior to my purchase!  This leaves a waxy mess that ruins shirts the first time it&#x27;s worn.</li>
    <li> Been buying this product at a local store and they have stopped stocking it.  So I came here to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only natural product I have found that worked for an entire day.  Others stopped working a quarter or half way through the day.  I also love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no clue about what others are saying about ruined shirts.  My dress shirts are all fine.  Just double checked the one I will launder today and I cannot see anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.</li>
    <li> I like the scent, and the fact that there are no chemicals. But as far as protection goes, Its a cool weather only product!&lt;br /&gt;Heavy labor or high heat rendered its protection null and void!&lt;br /&gt;Now this may be a quirk of my personal body chemistry, or my environment, or the highly physical level of work I do. Your results may vary, but as&lt;br /&gt; much as I like burts bees, I don&#x27;t see myself using this again.</li>
    <li> If large dark stains under the armpits of all your shirts is the look you are going for, by all means purchase this deodorant.  I purchased it for my teenage son, and now his back-to-school shirts all need to be replaced.  I am not generally one to write in complaint to a company.  However considering the money I had lost on this overpriced product, the ruined shirts, and the multiple stain removers I subsequently purchased, I wanted to communicate my frustration.  I thought Burt&#x27;s Bees might send their apologies along with a semi-condescending gesture such as a coupon towards the purchase of more of their products.  I was wrong; they were fully condescending.  Here is the full body of the response I received to my complaint:&lt;br /&gt;  \\&quot;Thank you for contacting us. We are very sorry to hear our Burt&#x27;s Bees Mens Deodorant stained your clothing. Fortunately, we can recommend a few ways to remove any staining.&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak clothing in hot water with dishwashing liquid detergent for at least 1 hour. Repeat if necessary until the stain is removed.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply dishwashing liquid directly to stain on wet clothing and let it sit for at least an hour, then wash as usual, before drying check to make sure the stain is removed.&lt;br /&gt;3. Try an \\&quot;oxygen cleaner\\&quot; or dry cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your continued loyalty to Burt&#x27;s Bees and please do not hesitate to contact us in the future. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all of their suggestions other than the dry cleaning--none of them removed the dark stains.  So, if you enjoy sporting stained armpits, or if you are just looking for an excuse to spend your time and money at the dry cleaners, this product may be perfect for you.  Or perhaps you like having your money go towards a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product from the Burt&#x27;s Bees brand whose parent company (Clorox) is anything but natural.  If neither of these applies to you, I suggest you steer clear of this deodorant.</li>
    <li> For me, this is a bit of an overly strong scent. It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, but so strong that I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;m filling a room and it actually bugs my nasal allergies a bit. The bigger reason I won&#x27;t buy it again is that it is super greasy and gooey. The main ingredient is cocoa butter (most of the other ingredients are oils too), which is fine for maintaining moisture elsewhere on your body, but putting it in your armpits every day feels kind of gross. Also, if you use a mild soap like me, you&#x27;ll have to wash your armpits like three times to feel like you got this stuff off. Bleh...</li>
    <li> While ironing, I found that MULTIPLE shirts are ruined with stains.  I purchased this deodorant for my husband about a month ago and I cannot even begin to calculate the cost of the ruined shirts.  I will be contacting the company and expect compensation for this loss.  STAY AWAY from this product unless you want to ruin your shirts!!  This is unacceptable and should have been caught during quality control / assurance.  Note: my husband is not an excessive sweater at all - I read another review elsewhere stating that excessive sweat + the formula could cause the stains.  Not likely in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Loved the smell but after two days use I had an allergic reaction akin to several mosquito bites in each pit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t rate products often, and I purchased this at a local store, but was totally surprised to see the bad reviews.  This is hands-down the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.  While a little waxy, it wasn&#x27;t a negative and it really works.  I ride a bicycle to work everyday and can&#x27;t shower and this really does the trick.  I also brought it on a 2 week hiking trip and it was flawless.  Love the smell, love the effectiveness, and I have never had an issue with clothes in the wash.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome: The only coconut oil based deodorant that stays solid as a stick. Has a masculine scent without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> They claim it&#x27;s natural and I might just believe them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake you will sweat when using this but there won&#x27;t be any odor.  At least not in my experience. I&#x27;ve used this for almost a month, working 8 hours a day on a very physical job. I sweat but I don&#x27;t smell. The only smell coming from me is the citrus scent this deodorant has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it time to work though as most people who are accustomed to using anti perspirant may need to time for their pits to clear out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful when using it with white shirts at it may stain depending on how much you use. Although it does wash out easily with a good detergent. Oh and it might feel wierd at first since the texture is a bit waxy, sort of like lip balm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a solid non-toxic and refreshing deodorant for some time, so as you could imagine I was thrilled when I found this product. After using it for about a week, I immediately purchased two more for reserve. Although a bit strong on the scent, it leaves you feeling fresh and clean clean (pun pun). It&#x27;s not an antiperspirant, which is a good thing, so if you&#x27;re active you will still sweat. Some of reviews I&#x27;ve read say it &amp;#34;ruins shirts&amp;#34; which leads me to believe some individuals are caking this stuff on, which isn&#x27;t needed. Overall, I would strongly recommend this product for people looking to free themselves from the chemically-enhanced mainstream brands.</li>
    <li> Stained and ruined 2 brand new, dark brown shirts of mine.  What a terrible product!  Machine washing, followed by handwashing, removed only about 50% of the oily residue.  DO NOT BUY THIS DEODORANT UNLESS YOU GO SHIRTLESS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I contacted Burts Bees about the damage and they told me to handwash the shirts with liquid dish soap.  Well, tried that twice for each and it took out only a tiny amount of the stains.  They are stained and look like the have wet spots.  Contacted Burts Bees again and was eventually sent a check for the cost of the deodorant + the cost of the shirts.  If you have experienced irreversable damage from this product I highly recommend contacting the company ASAP and explaining your situation.  The product is crap but at least they take some responsibility. Too bad for my shirts though.  R.I.P.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS DEODORANT. It will ruin your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried EVERYTHING to get out the stains that are created by this deodorant, from vinegar soaks to Oxyclean washes, and nothing works. They&#x27;re so bad that I am actually contacting the company in an attempt to get recompensed for my damaged clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Burt&#x27;s Bees stuff, but stay far away from this product.</li>
    <li> Love this deodorant, my stepdaughter introduced it to me, I am a woman not guy wearing it, can&#x27;t use anti perspirant any more, love the smell, and lasts more than 24 hrs drying out smell!</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this product. It will ruin your shirts. Nothing works to get the stains out. I can&#x27;t believe Burt&#x27;s bees is still selling this crap!</li>
    <li> Bought for my dad who is very allergic to normal deoderant. He loves this stuff! It keeps him from smelling and he hasn&#x27;t broke out in a rash since he&#x27;s started using it!</li>
    <li> I cannot comment on the effectiveness of this, as my husband and son wouldn&#x27;t wear it past day 1. The smell is just like cleaning products, like Pine Sol or something, and is very strong.</li>
    <li> Like the smell, and it seemed to work good for me.  But it started to turn my shirts a dark color where the deodorant was applied. Would not recommend, my shirts were only undershirts ruined, wouldn&#x27;t e happy if they were my good shirts.</li>
    <li> I liked this product just OK initially even though after applying it to your pits, it would turn into a bit of a foamy lather (even after applying it very conservatively).  It smells OK, albeit pretty strong.  It takes a long time for me to stink, so by the end of the day I didn&#x27;t have a BO smell like others reported - but thats just my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after the BB deodorant was done and I moved on (to unscented other brand, mind you) I noticed that all my undershirts and a few of my tee shirts had a remaining odor in the arm pit area.  After several washings, the odor remains, and has not faded at all - despite washing with extra detergent, Borax, etc.  I can smell the remaining odor through my woven shirts!  The odor is like a old stale version of the original scent. Its awful, and frankly overpowering.  I&#x27;ve decided to give up, trash the several affected tees (which are many as I had this deodorant for several weeks) and just buy new ones, as I can&#x27;t stand the smell any longer. This product &#x3D; FAIL.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees generally. So I enthusiastically bought this product. Unfortunately, it just isn&#x27;t good. It smells good. And if you don&#x27;t sweat it works fine. But if you sweat it creates a bad smell. Very bad. Worse than if you weren&#x27;t wearing any deodorant.  Don&#x27;t buy this product if you sweat.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It&#x27;s non-toxic unlike most underarm deodorants, and it also helps provide lubrication against chafing.  Chafing may not be a problem if you live somewhere with low humidity, but I live in Oklahoma where the humidity is 80-100% regularly, and this helps a lot.</li>
    <li> I love it. No irritation. Seems to work for quite a while. I have had trouble finding deodorant that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This has worked great.</li>
</ol>
