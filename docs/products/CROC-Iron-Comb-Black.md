<li> I just couldn&#x27;t keep any brush before the flat iron and felt like I need a third hand or just taking my head off for styling!   </li>

<li> At first it was a little hard to do</li>

<li> However, this little tool helps me do it without all the cursing that traditionally has been part of my morning ritual.</li>
<li> It did not work as I expected it.</li>
<li> my issue was, i used the plastic thing to keep the comb closed but that ripped and it wasnt meant to be kept i believe, just for shipping precautions.</li>
<li> not what i expected never used and threw it away</li>
<li> I had purchased a cheaper brand from WalMart in the past at a local store.  </li>
<li> a lot of hair, thick and long.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m new to using flat iron, and I had a major problem doing the top/front part of my head, like the fringe (even though I don&#x27;t technically have one, this is the part). I just couldn&#x27;t keep any brush before the flat iron and felt like I need a third hand or just taking my head off for styling!   So this one solves it for me. It&#x27;s true it&#x27;s very fine and you need to brush your hair very well prior to using it. I also use it only for the part of my head I mentioned, and do the back with a regular brush. But still - I feel like I couldn&#x27;t do without it. Also, it feels sturdy, and after seeing cheaper options with not as good reviews, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this one.   Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I have used a Chi iron for many years now.  Now that I have the CROC heat resistant tension comb, I can now achieve a salon result to smoothing my hair.  The gripping action of the CROC comb allows for easy use of the comb immediately preceding the iron that was not possible for me with a regular comb.  It also allows for easier shaping of the hair while it is ironed for a smooth finish.  I love this comb and will probably give some as gifts at the holidays.</li>
    <li> I love this comb. I use it inconjunction with my croc flat iron and my hair comes out straight and healthy looking!</li>
    <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s the same way everyone says it is:  It&#x27;s just a fancy-looking comb that only tugs on your hair.  I thought I would get one just to see if it worked.  Neh, no luck.  It looks nice and is relatively sturdy, but doesn&#x27;t straighten hair.  Maybe if one used it with a hair dryer?</li>
    <li> The Croc iron comb works very well with my flat iron. No more twisted, melted plastic combs! This is worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> this thing, i dont even know how i lived without it! it makes it so easy to straighten my hair, it hasnt melted at all. my issue was, i used the plastic thing to keep the comb closed but that ripped and it wasnt meant to be kept i believe, just for shipping precautions. well after that broke, i broke 2 teeth off because its wide open all the time. I wish a strap came with it to store it since i store it in a drawer, i still love it.</li>
    <li> This comb is the Bomb. At first it was a little hard to do but I kept with it and now I Never straighten my hair without it. I have oily hair, so I bought this comb to keep me from putting my hands in my hair adding extra oil to it. Absolutely LOVE it.</li>
    <li> to hard to use on your own hair but great fit doing someone elses</li>
    <li> I love that this tool is very durable I purchased it almost a year ago and it looks the same as when I first bought it, and its very gentle to my hair too I use it all the time..</li>
    <li> Awesome. Holds hair straight when flat ironing to get that flawless finish. Would be cool if it had a pik on the clamp side to section faster! But always get compliments when I use this.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift and she loves it! it seperates the hair and she is able to do small pieces and get her hair super straight!</li>
    <li> Must have for anyone using a flat iron!  Makes it faster, easier, and less painful!  I bought one for my mom too!</li>
    <li> Let me say that the actual product works just fine. It&#x27;s just that it does not make flat ironing my hair any easier. It&#x27;s too cumbersome to handle the iron and this thing at the same time. If ur more coordinated than I, u should love it.</li>
    <li> While a wonderful concept it takes a lot of maneuvering to use this styling aid while holding an 450 degree flat iron. Nough said</li>
    <li> I use this comb daily. It works great!  Straightens better and cleaner, more thoroughly, than a regular comb. I had purchased a cheaper brand from WalMart in the past at a local store.  It melted from the heat of the flat iron on one side and then a section of the teeth also came out of the comb. The Croc comb is much better made. A lot stronger and doesn&#x27;t seem  to want to melt at all. I am very pleased with this product and very glad I bought an extra one to keep on hand as I had such a hard time finding one locally in any store and did have to go to the Internet to purchase. Thus the reason to purchase a back up comb for those &amp;#34;just in case accidents&amp;#34;(I.e. leaving at the condo on vacation, etc.). I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> The perfect comb to use with my croc flat iron. I ha a lot of hair, thick and long. This comb makes straightening my hair so easy.</li>
    <li> The corc iron comb is inconvenient.  It did not work as I expected it. Maybe it is a matter of getting use it, but I am not comfortable with it yet.</li>
    <li> Great styling tool!  I have short hair and use this with a mini croc flat iron...  I don&#x27;t have to touch my hair or the hot iron.  Cuts my styling time in half, and I don&#x27;t burn my fingers on those sleepy mornings:)  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy and frizzy hair. I like to wear my hair pun straight but it&#x27;s hard to acheive that look given I am working against nature. However, this little tool helps me do it without all the cursing that traditionally has been part of my morning ritual. It&#x27;s great. I love it. I won&#x27;t. Will not no-sir-re-bob do my do without it. The end.</li>
    <li> This comb works very well. I thought that the teeth spacing would be too wide but it is perfect. I have natural 4B hair so I need this for my blowouts and flat iron days. Overall I give it 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I love this I use this with my flat iron when I straighten my hair.  It works great on coarse or curly hair if you want a polished flat iron look.  It takes some time to get comfortable to use, but this is a must and is great for Afro-American hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing comb survived for 2 years now</li>
    <li> It was purchased for my daughters. We have 4 women in the household we all have different hair texture. My three daughters have coarse relaxed hair and one has coarse un-relaxed hair. My hair is not coarse, but I have used it so this works on different hair textures. I use this in conjunction with a TRESemme spray for flat ironing, and it makes all the difference. My daughters hair came out so straight a girl thought she had weave or a wig. It did however take getting used to in order to get my hand at the right angles;to get it straight; so practice before you use it before a big event.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. You need to comb your hair really good first because this comb is so fine that it can tangle and pull your hair. I use it so often. Not bad...</li>
    <li> Fail. You are better off saving your money and buying either a heat resistant comb, or using a hot comb.</li>
    <li> This comb is very difficult to use.  It does not do anything for your hair.  Buying this comb is just like putting money in the trash.</li>
    <li> I wanted to link this iron comb, but the quality was cheap, and it was flimsy and difficult to use. I was frequently burning my fingers with my iron, and struggling to keep it closed, or getting my hair stuck in the hinge. Save your money.</li>
    <li> My fingers are not being burned by hot hair!  Love this tool!! Just wonder why they don&#x27;t sell one with each flat iron!</li>
    <li> Grips hair and make it easier to apply keratin treatment and flat iron. Handy comb. wish the tip was pointed so i could use it to part hair.</li>
    <li> hair breaks off in this ridiculous thing. do not buy!!!!! Instead spend your money on a good quality wide tooth comb.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
    <li> nice sturdy feel in the hand, and smooth working hinge. i use it almost every day when i straighten my hair. easy feel.</li>
    <li> not what i expected never used and threw it away</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Just a comb. Sturdy and good. Dosen&#x27;t break easily if you were wondering. I have thick frizzy hair and works fine for me.</li>
    <li> This helps me flat iron my hair to perfection. Only took a couple of passes and I was able to use it like a pro.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to help my straightner do its job, it was always hard to get it as smooth as the salon, thanks</li>
    <li> I had only really flat ironed my hair a few times before and hated it. It was too difficult and time consuming for me. But this comb makes it so much easier. It sections off the hair and keeps it smooth while i run the flat iron over the hair. I noticed some resistance combing through my hair if i didnt brush it out first.</li>
    <li> was going well and did what was expected but broke on second use. would have given 5 stars if it was stronger.</li>
    <li> This comb helped my hair get a lot straighter using it with a flat iron than just a flat iron alone. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect to use when straightening your hair with a flat iron.  Prevents hands from burn injury.  Grabs hair as you press it through the flat iron.  No need to touch hot hair.</li>
    <li> This comp really grips the hair to insure a great silky look when using my NaNo Bliss Flatiron.</li>
    <li> makes hair not only straighter but in half the time. Some people said it&#x27;s too fine to get through tangles, not the case at all. Works great, and grabs hair with one hand so the other hand can quickly follow with the straightener.</li>
    <li> very good muy buen producto de muy buena calidad. recomiendo este producto al 100%. muy buen juego se lo recomiendo</li>
