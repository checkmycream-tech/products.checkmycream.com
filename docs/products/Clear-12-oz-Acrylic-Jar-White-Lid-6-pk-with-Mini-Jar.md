      <li>However, I wish it came with a better cap -- maybe one that matches the jar.</li>
      <li>This product was more than I expected,and I will be ordering again.</li>
      <li>Love these jars.  </li>
      <li>Cute jars.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s really cute.</li>
      <li>Great for making your own lip stuff, but I wish the opening was a bit larger...</li>
      <li>arrived safe and sound and in timely fashion</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t find labels to fit, but the girls made cards.  </li>
      <li>One fairly light cream had turned to paste, and another that I don&#x27;t use often had all but hardened.  </li>
      <li>I loved these, they are very cute and small.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really recommend them for that, because the lid on the one I use most (which I had already replaced), is cracking.  </li>
      <li>Love the actual jar but the lids could be better, preferably metal.</li>
      <li>I like that the lids are not snap on but screw on, creates more secure jar for my essential oil mixtures.</li>
      <li>They are not air tight,, and best used for dry cosmetics, like mineral powder makeup.  </li>
      <li>First, a lid cracked as I was removing it.  </li>
      <li>Pretty gifts.</li>
      <li>Cute just wish they came in a larger size.</li>
      <li>I bought these to put creams and lotions into smaller containers for travel, conserving space, and keeping from contaminating a large container opened twice each day.  </li>
      <li>A little more expensive compared to others, but nice for gift giving.</li>
      <li>I grow andante olive oil, so I wanted to teach them how to use last years leftovers since we only sell fresh olive.  </li>
      <li>Definitely not for cosmetics or frequent use.</li>

    <li> This product was more than I expected,and I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Cute little jars perfect for making my own foundation mix!</li>
    <li> I purchased these jars to make lip balm with my nieces over the holidays.  I grow andante olive oil, so I wanted to teach them how to use last years leftovers since we only sell fresh olive.  The girls loved these!  Can&#x27;t find labels to fit, but the girls made cards.  Pretty gifts.</li>
    <li> I loved these, they are very cute and small. You can use them for your own creations.</li>
    <li> The jar itself is very nice and sturdy. However, I wish it came with a better cap -- maybe one that matches the jar. The cap is white and twists on in one turn. I put mineral powders in my jars and I feel like it&#x27;s not secure enough and will eventually spill out everywhere.</li>
    <li> Love these jars.  arrived safe and sound and in timely fashion</li>
    <li> I bought these to put creams and lotions into smaller containers for travel, conserving space, and keeping from contaminating a large container opened twice each day.  First, a lid cracked as I was removing it.  Then, I realized that after 2-3 months, the contents were getting thicker.  One fairly light cream had turned to paste, and another that I don&#x27;t use often had all but hardened.  They are not air tight,, and best used for dry cosmetics, like mineral powder makeup.  But I don&#x27;t really recommend them for that, because the lid on the one I use most (which I had already replaced), is cracking.  They would make a pretty container for small items in a tool box.  Definitely not for cosmetics or frequent use.</li>
    <li> Cute jars. I like that the lids are not snap on but screw on, creates more secure jar for my essential oil mixtures.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, lightweight, perfect size for my lip butter solids.</li>
    <li> Great for making your own lip stuff, but I wish the opening was a bit larger...</li>
    <li> Check the size before buying these.  I purchased them for a sugar scrub, however they are about the size of a lip gloss if that.  These are TINY!!</li>
    <li> Love the actual jar but the lids could be better, preferably metal.</li>
    <li> My fiance wanted a homemade mothers day gift from the kids so I decided on lipbalm. These containers work well except my only complaint is the weird white plastic cap that comes with it. I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t decide on clear acrylic lids to go with it.</li>
    <li> A little more expensive compared to others, but nice for gift giving.</li>
    <li> I love these!!! Very nice looking!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really small jar but it&#x27;s really cute. This is perfect for someone who is making their own skin line and need samples.</li>
    <li> Cute just wish they came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> The most elegant looking jars for lip balm or any salve! Bonus is getting a mini jar for your purse and a recipe on making lip balm! I will definitely buy this again from this seller again!!</li>
