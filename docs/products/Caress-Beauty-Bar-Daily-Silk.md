      <li>The best thing about this soap is that after washing with it, you skin feels soft and clean but without any soapy residue.</li>

      <li>When I opened the plastic packaging holding the 6 soap bars together, I got a strong whiff of the scent</li>
      <li>but, it is a really strong smell.  </li>
      <li>It has a strong gardenia scent while showering, but it isn&#x27;t too strong afterwards.</li>
      <li>nice little bonus is that the bars you&#x27;re not using will make your closet or drawer smell really good too!</li>

      <li>It lathers very well (though the bluish color of the suds took a bit of getting used to) and it rinses nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good beauty bar that works well for children&#x27;s sensitive skin too.</li>
      <li>And the soap does lather up quite nicely leaving me nice and clean though it does take an extra wiping to clean off in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I have always been a fan of Caress original soap</li>
      <li>I was excited to try Caress Emerald Rush soap.</li>
      <li>Finally a new Caress Scent that is just as nice as the original.</li>
      <li>great soap - will not leave your skin dry after showering.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have a lot of oil and is great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The soap&#x27;s fragrance, however, is actually quite mild and pleasant.  </li>
      <li>The scent is light and not too overpowering and leaves you feeling clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I do also think that this Caress doesn&#x27;t seem to melt away as quickly as I recall the original Caress did.</li>
      <li>soap bar is bright blue colored.  </li>
      <li>The color is also a bright aqua blue, like dyed Easter egg...</li>
      <li>The scent became more pronounced while bathing, which created a very relaxing atmosphere.  </li>
      <li>Also good as a facial soap.</li>
      <li>At the time of this review, the soap was approximately $1.28 per bar, which I feel is a good value, given the pleasant scent and the long-lasting quality of the bar.</li>
      <li>My first impression with this soap was just how strong it smelled.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more of a shower gel person than a bar soap person, but there are uses for it, and Caress is a nice readily-available bar soap; nice fragrance without being overpowering, and hard-milled enough to last well.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised that Caress Bar Soap, Emerald Rush had such a pleasant and refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>This soap was perfectly adequate.  </li>
      <li>Caress soap is just great on dry and sensitive skin, which is fantastic - this also seems to be a good value pack, so I would definitely recommend this!</li>
      <li>I love this new Caress Soap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to say that this new Emerald Rush scent was a perfect fit given all that, but unfortunately, this scent didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>And though the scent initially filled up much of my upstairs, after using it, the scent does not stick with you all day.</li>
      <li>Although not harsh or drying by any means, I still find Dove to be better in this area.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, this smells basically like Ivory soap with a tiny bit of pungency.</li>
      <li>turquoise color is almost mesmerizing.</li>
      <li>Great soap to use as a beauty bar for your face but not really enough lathering action to take a shower with.</li>
      <li>Right out of the box and</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>As far as a soap it is quite fine.  </li>
      <li>As far as cleaning goes it seems fine</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more of a straightforward cleaning soap and not much else.</li>
      <li>This has a clean smell and leaves a great scent behind.</li>
      <li>Pretty color too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know when exactly my mother first brought home this brand of soap.  </li>
      <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Looks  pretty in the bathroom too.</li>
      <li>bars embody the same basic good concept: medium strength and aroma, with an emphasis on freshness and evoking the imagery of spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only issue I have with it is how easily the soap melts.</li>
      <li>My preconceived notion of this soap was that it would be something like Irish Spring, with a strong, almost overpowering deodorant soap type smell.  </li>
      <li>This soap has a strong tropical fragrance that definitely perks you up during your morning shower.</li>
      <li>This stuff certainly isn&#x27;t made for or even marketed to &amp;#34;manly men&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Epitomized by images of a certain northerly country</li>
      <li>and it is very moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The emerald rush scent is very pleasing to me.</li>
      <li>Has gentle fragrance and scent does not overpower you.  </li>
      <li>But, the scent really isn&#x27;t that noticeable when showering</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and lingers on your skin for  a few hours after you shower.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll go back to the original and be happier for it.</li>
      <li>I found to be moisturizing and it did not irritate or dry out my skin, which dries out easily during the winter time.</li>
      <li>I thought the blue color would be off-putting, but I kinda like it better as I can visually tell how much soap is on my washcloth.  </li>
      <li>the scent filled up not only my bathroom, but the scent was still strong all the way down the hall.  </li>
      <li>This particular scent just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>If you plan to use this soap, I highly recommend that you get a soap dish.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a nice soap and carries a heavy scent, the scent of gardenia and white tea essence.  The package says it is made in the USA and comes from Unilever in Connecticut. The actual bar measures approximately 3 1/4 long X 2 1/4 wide X 1&amp;#34; deep.  This is a soap for someone who likes to smell like they just came out of the shower.  If you like that perfume like smell, you should like this soap.</li>
    <li> I really love this soap!&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful and it is very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The oval shape make it very easy to grip and it also works up a pretty good lather!&lt;br /&gt;The turquoise color is almost mesmerizing. Just beautiful!</li>
    <li> I was excited to try Caress Emerald Rush soap. I usually have problems with breakouts from most soaps but this soap left my skin soft and clear. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. The soap didn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like some soaps can. The color is a bright turquoise and is very pretty displayed in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I thought the blue color would be off-putting, but I kinda like it better as I can visually tell how much soap is on my washcloth.  I usually use the pale green Lever 2000 moisturizing flavor, which also has a little scent to it.  This cleans just as well, and doesn&#x27;t leave you so squeaky that your skin is dry (a la Irish Spring or Dial).  It cleans, it moisturizes, it cuts through grime...I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect to like it, but I&#x27;ve now found a viable option to my erstwhile bath soap.  I like the scent, and it&#x27;s something different, and I definitely like to keep the grunge guessing.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed unless moisturizing soap just isn&#x27;t your thing.</li>
    <li> I prefer bath soap bars to shower gels or other body wash so I was eager to try this new scent from Caress. I love fragrances and this one is very fresh and pleasant, lathers well, and seems to rinse off cleanly. I have very dry skin from using extremely hot water during the cold winter months in the Midwest so I am always wanting a bar soap that is not going to further suck the moisture from my skin. Although this is not labeled as a moisturizing soap, it seemed to leave my skin soft and the scent does indeed linger but not so overwhelmingly so that it interferes with cologne or perfume or other products if you use them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice little bonus is that the bars you&#x27;re not using will make your closet or drawer smell really good too! I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> So green bar soap is green bar soap, right?  Epitomized by images of a certain northerly country, yes?  Well this is green bar soap with a twist or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bars embody the same basic good concept: medium strength and aroma, with an emphasis on freshness and evoking the imagery of spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizers that are included in all Caress products are here - medium heavy, and good for avoiding dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the final twist is a bit of subtlety added to the aroma: plus the basic freshness, a slight bit of added floral, and then a bit of a zing that I suppose would be the &amp;#34;white tea essence.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a practical level, it lathers (easily) and rinses very much like other Caress products (a little extra rinsing to remove excess moisturizers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very good and no faults found.  Whether it is worth seeking out over standard green bar soap comes down to whether you need the moisturizers and whether the aroma has special appeal.  If either is true, then this is great soap for you.  If both are true, then there is probably none other that will do.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Dove soap user (my dermatologist recommends Dove or Oil of Olay bar soaps), but a gentle, girly-scented soap like Caress&#x27;s Emerald Rush was intriguing enough for me to give it a try.  When I opened the plastic packaging holding the 6 soap bars together, I got a strong whiff of the scent and I thought it smelled great.  But, the scent really isn&#x27;t that noticeable when showering and it definitely isn&#x27;t left lingering on my skin when I get out (which is what I was hoping for).  Although not harsh or drying by any means, I still find Dove to be better in this area.  Caress lathers okay and rinses,clean.  I&#x27;ll definitely use the 5 bars I have left (they won&#x27;t go in the trash or be given away), but once they are gone I&#x27;ll go back to Dove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not picky when it comes to brands of soap so I decided to give these Caress Emerald Rush bars a try. I was impressed with the results of it. The emerald rush scent is very pleasing to me. It has a strong gardenia scent while showering, but it isn&#x27;t too strong afterwards. I could still smell it on my skin after showering though...it just lightly scents your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar itself I found to be moisturizing and it did not irritate or dry out my skin, which dries out easily during the winter time. The pack comes with 6 bars of soap. One bar lasted me about a week with just myself using it. So price wise, it isn&#x27;t too bad when a 6 pack can last you about a month and a half. Would definitely buy this soap again and would also be willing to try out other scents that Caress offers.</li>
    <li> This soap has a strong tropical fragrance that definitely perks you up during your morning shower. The only issue I have with it is how easily the soap melts. It also has a bit of a chalky texture when the soap gets soft, however it still lathers up great.</li>
    <li> I love this new Caress Soap. I have always been a fan of Caress original soap so I knew I would like this new scent and I was right. The Emerald Rush soap smells great and does not dry your skin out. The scent is nice and lingers on your skin for  a few hours after you shower. I love that this is a great scent that not only smells great but also moisturizes your skin. Finally a new Caress Scent that is just as nice as the original.</li>
    <li> great soap - will not leave your skin dry after showering.  Will definitely buy again.  Also good as a facial soap.</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful!!  Nice change.</li>
    <li> Caress is a great way to describe this soap - it goes on silky smooth, and has a lovely fresh smell (&#x27;Emerald Rush&#x27;), which I really enjoyed!  Caress soap is just great on dry and sensitive skin, which is fantastic - this also seems to be a good value pack, so I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> My preconceived notion of this soap was that it would be something like Irish Spring, with a strong, almost overpowering deodorant soap type smell.  The soap&#x27;s fragrance, however, is actually quite mild and pleasant.  Cleans well without giving your skin the dried-out feeling that many mainstream soaps do.  The soap color is solid aquamarine.  Would definitely get this again.</li>
    <li> This soap was perfectly adequate.  I like my Dollar Tree soap shopping as much as the next person, and this felt like a dollar a bar soap, not like a three for a dollar.  It&#x27;s smooth, smells faintly of gardenias, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on me or dry my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each soap bar is bright blue colored.  Turquoise.  And, now, so is the window sill where I leave my soap.  If you plan to use this soap, I highly recommend that you get a soap dish.  If your soap dish has drain holes under it, or if you set the soap directly on tile, then you will quickly see a big blue spot form under this soap.  I don&#x27;t really care much if my bathroom is spotless, but the blue spots are a little weird.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I was expecting. I was expecting soft floral scent and a buttery feel but this reminded me a lot of those green soaps like Zest and Irish Spring except this bar is blue. It&#x27;s blue and somewhat dry. As far as cleaning goes it seems fine but it&#x27;s more of a straightforward cleaning soap and not much else.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice about this soap when you open the box is its crazy bright color!  Not what I expected to see in a bar of soap.  The next thing that hits you is the smell.  It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but, it is a really strong smell.  This has to be one of the most fragrant soaps I have ever used.  This stuff certainly isn&#x27;t made for or even marketed to &amp;#34;manly men&amp;#34;.  As far as a soap it is quite fine.  As they advertise it contains a good amount of moisturizers so isn&#x27;t too drying.  I do also think that this Caress doesn&#x27;t seem to melt away as quickly as I recall the original Caress did.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Caress soap bar of Emerald Lush Gardenia &amp; White Tea Essence at my work due to my previous usage of the white peach and silky orange blossom bar.  The Caress Lush Gardenia &amp; White Tea essence does do the job of moisturizing and cleaning the skin. However, I would have to admit that I still plan on purchasing the Caress white peach and silky orange blossom bar over this lush gardenia because of the scent.</li>
    <li> Great product. My husband has sensitive skin and this does not dry him out or give him any irritation. Plus I feel that scent is unisex. It is not overly masculine for feminine so the whole family can use it.</li>
    <li> Caress Bar Soap, Emerald Rush, 6 Count&lt;br /&gt;Caress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells lovely and lathers up nicely. Looks  pretty in the bathroom too. Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I really like this soap from the moment I opened the box, with the scent of the gardenia and white tea.  The scent became more pronounced while bathing, which created a very relaxing atmosphere.  The bar of soap is easy to handle and does not constantly keep slipping out of my hand because of its curve shape.  The soap felt very smooth and silky to my skin while applying and it left my skin feeling soft without a soapy residue feel.  I will be getting this product again.</li>
    <li> Has gentle fragrance and scent does not overpower you.  Seems to have a lot of oil and is great for dry skin.  Pretty color too.</li>
    <li> When it comes to soap, I&#x27;ve found I either really love or hate how it smells. I was pleasantly surprised that Caress Bar Soap, Emerald Rush had such a pleasant and refreshing scent. We have a 10 person household and on average the bars would last us about 2-3 weeks, which is above average. At the time of this review, the soap was approximately $1.28 per bar, which I feel is a good value, given the pleasant scent and the long-lasting quality of the bar. My overall rating for Caress Bar Soap, Emerald Rush is 5 stars. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Great soap to use as a beauty bar for your face but not really enough lathering action to take a shower with. Very nice scent and it does moisturize.</li>
    <li> The scent is light and not too overpowering and leaves you feeling clean and fresh. It leaves my skin moisturized too. I like this rather than Dove or Oil of Olay, which is what I usually use. I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more of a shower gel person than a bar soap person, but there are uses for it, and Caress is a nice readily-available bar soap; nice fragrance without being overpowering, and hard-milled enough to last well. I&#x27;m not that fond of the shape, which is like Dove&#x27;s rounded-bottomed and concave topped style - makes it a little hard to hang on to - but it is a mild soap, not too drying, and good as both a hand and body soap.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the way this smelled. It was overbearing to my olfactory senses.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this soap is that after washing with it, you skin feels soft and clean but without any soapy residue. It&#x27;s a good beauty bar that works well for children&#x27;s sensitive skin too. It has a fruity-flowery scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
    <li> My first impression with this soap was just how strong it smelled.  Right out of the box and the scent filled up not only my bathroom, but the scent was still strong all the way down the hall.  It is not a unpleasant smell, just very strong.  Thankfully the scent dissipated after a day or two and now can only smell it when I actually lather up.  And the soap does lather up quite nicely leaving me nice and clean though it does take an extra wiping to clean off in the shower.  And though the scent initially filled up much of my upstairs, after using it, the scent does not stick with you all day.</li>
    <li> Guys get your own soap.  This soap is too pretty and smells too good for men.  It leaves your skin soft and smooth.  The soap is a very pretty color and leaves your bathroom smelling great!</li>
    <li> I love all caress soap. I love all their fragrances. This has a clean smell and leaves a great scent behind. It also didn&#x27;t dry my skin, most Caress bars don&#x27;t dry my skin. I enjoyed this a lot and would buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time fan and user of Caress soap, so I thought I&#x27;d give this new scent a try. I was pleased to find that the soap works as well as the Caress I&#x27;m used to. It lathers very well (though the bluish color of the suds took a bit of getting used to) and it rinses nicely. I have skin that tends towards dry and has to deal with both the Florida sun and hard water on a daily basis, so moisture retention is important to me, but other soaps - even moisturizing bars - either don&#x27;t rinse well enough and leave my skin with a slimy feel or completely dry me out. Caress has always been a cost-friendly, reliable choice for my household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to say that this new Emerald Rush scent was a perfect fit given all that, but unfortunately, this scent didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s very strong, which wouldn&#x27;t be at all bad if I liked how it smelled. I&#x27;m sad to say I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s very floral, too floral for my tastes, and rightly or wrongly, it reminds me of a perfume my grandmother wore when I was a little girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like the scent, I think this would be a great choice. It does work as reliably and nicely as the Caress I&#x27;m used to. This particular scent just isn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ll go back to the original and be happier for it.</li>
    <li> I generally use Caress and, like the others, Emerald Rush lathers pretty well and does not dry the skin. Because of the moisturizing nature I do end up rinsing a little longer because I feel as though I still have soap on me, though it&#x27;s not too bad. My main complaint is the scent. To be honest, this smells basically like Ivory soap with a tiny bit of pungency. The color is also a bright aqua blue, like dyed Easter egg...maybe not a problem for some people but it is a little strong and bold (too unnatural and artificial looking) for my tastes. Given the other Caress scents available, I would definitely prefer to go with the others.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know when exactly my mother first brought home this brand of soap.  A long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Now I shop for myself and while I often buy off-brands or small speciality soaps, Caress is a good bath soap for the price and because it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.&lt;br /&gt;In the southwest, dryness can be a problem but daily use of this product will keep you from itching.&lt;br /&gt;I like the strong smell of the soap, too, though others may find it overpowering.  Even so, after the bath, the scent subsides.</li>
