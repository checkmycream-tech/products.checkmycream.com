      <li>A great all around hand soap for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Received fast and in good condition.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, it lathers fine and rinses well.</li>
      <li>When my husband found out he had to use fragrance free soaps</li>
      <li>odor* free.  </li>
      <li>I am a nurse and I needed an antibacterial soap that was fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>No odor, light texture.</li>
      <li>We both have been using this great soap for a long time now.</li>

      <li>For a fragrance free soap it lathers up very well</li>
      <li>I had a lot of trouble finding unscented hand soap, and I was so happy to find this Kiss My Face soap.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten to where I won&#x27;t recycle the old containers until I&#x27;m sure the replacement works.  </li>
      <li>I believe Kiss My Face soap works better than Soft Soap.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product; very creamy and a little dab does ya!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Very gentle.</li>
      <li>We first began buying these at our store, and now purchase them online</li>
      <li>The soap is good, but opening the top is really difficult.</li>
      <li>and it might be the only product I have ever used that says it is fragrance free and really is.</li>
      <li>I was very hesitant to order this product because I&#x27;d never heard of it and never seen it in stores.  </li>
      <li>I like the soap, it is totally fragrance free, which is what I was searching for.  </li>
      <li>For Gluten Free members of our family this is one of the only soaps that we have found to not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this at Whole Foods for years.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
      <li>It is very much worth any extra money.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper, the bottle lasts longer (more in the bottle), and it works just as well if not better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and is exactly what my dry, cracked hands needed.  </li>
      <li>I have to use fragrance free products due to allergies.</li>
      <li>I have severe allergies to fragrances and cannot find any other fragrance free liquid hand soaps.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the only hand soap i can use, i have very sensitive skin, my hands get very irritated from parabens</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but if you are looking for something unscented and moderately moisturizing then this is a great choice.</li>
      <li>Really enjoy receiving this soap every few months.</li>
      <li>However, the dispenser nozzle clogs up every day and causes the soap to squirt wildly in the air (or on you) rather on your hands.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance free soap (if they have any) is usually just in bars.  </li>
      <li>After changing from my regular hand soap, my dry chapped hands began to improve and I will continue to use it for as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>It cleans really well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands when I use</li>
      <li>Go back to the old formula, please!</li>
      <li>It does have an unfortunate jelling quality, and when left on my sink it tends to congeal in a kind of opalescent, swirly pattern, which would be very pretty, except that I want the soap on my hands and then down the drain, not shooting out over my sink.  </li>
      <li>Also, this washes completely off without leaving &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; or the aforementioned odors.  </li>
      <li>I thought an earlier review might have been exaggerating when the writer described the soap as leaping out at her, but darned if the soap didn&#x27;t just shoot out directly at me five minutes ago.  </li>
      <li>I have tried every product under the sun..literally..including California Baby and this is much better and non irritating.</li>
      <li>The soap itself is very gentle and one of the few soaps I can use on my hands, which can get eczema if I am not careful.</li>
      <li>I like how the soap does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>Otherwise I have to unscrew the empty dispenser and put it on the new container.</li>
      <li>I love the product, but every time I order, at least one of the bottles does not have the lid screwed on tight and it leaks in the box.</li>

<li> It does have a (very) slight smell to it, but it is nothing of significance.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s either poorly construction (too small an opening in the spout) or the soap is too thick.  </li>
<li> we began a tough search.</li>
<li> I think the soap is probably alright, but it&#x27;s difficult to tell.  </li>
<li> They&#x27;re terrible!  </li>

    <li> The soap is good, but opening the top is really difficult.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble finding unscented hand soap, and I was so happy to find this Kiss My Face soap.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but if you are looking for something unscented and moderately moisturizing then this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I have to use fragrance free products due to allergies. Used to love this soap. Now, it is like they mixed it half with water. It is so runny. Go back to the old formula, please!</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  No scent so your cats won&#x27;t lick themselves to death after you pet them. Received fast and in good condition.</li>
    <li> After searching for a soap without any unhealthy chemicals or unpleasant scent, I was glad to find this product from Kiss My Face.

    <li> I like the soap, it is totally fragrance free, which is what I was searching for.  However, the dispenser nozzle clogs up every day and causes the soap to squirt wildly in the air (or on you) rather on your hands.  I would not purchase again because of this.</li>
    <li> This soap is very easy on the skin and is great for those who are annoyed/allergic to strong smells because it has none.  Other soaps make this claim but there is always a little smell that stays on your skin; not with KMF.  Also, this washes completely off without leaving &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; or the aforementioned odors.  It is very much worth any extra money.</li>
    <li> So, we got this in the office because we have a colleague that has severe allergies to all kinds of fragrance and chemicals. This was supposed to be the safe alternative to hand soap.  I was happy with it, even though I find that it doesn&#x27;t sud as much, until I read the ingredient list. Apparently it contains parabens, something I did not expect from Kiss My Face, since they market green products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a soap it is good, not spectacular but good and it might be the only product I have ever used that says it is fragrance free and really is.</li>

    <li> Good soap. I like the pump dispense. I like how the soap does not dry out my skin. It&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse and I needed an antibacterial soap that was fragrance free.  The description on the web page claims that there is triclosan in it.  There is not.  Therefore it does not meet infection control standard for handwashing.  I just use it at home and it does not make my hands itch.  I like it as a soap.  They need to correct the description page.</li>
    <li> This is the only hand soap that I use. It doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious odor, it lathers fine and rinses well. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be extraordinarily drying.</li>
    <li> We first began buying these at our store, and now purchase them online&lt;br /&gt;at a discount.  This is a great product; very creamy and a little dab does ya!&lt;br /&gt;Just wish we could buy a larger quantity &amp; refill our bottles;thus saving&lt;br /&gt;plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Larry Fredricks</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found this unscented hand soap!  My son has eczema on his hands that flares up when he uses soaps with fragrance.  I have looked in many stores for unscented hand soap and this is the best deal I have found!</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to order this product because I&#x27;d never heard of it and never seen it in stores.  I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin and finding something like this in drug stores or grocery stores is difficult.  Fragrance free soap (if they have any) is usually just in bars.  I took a chance and ordered Kiss My Face and I love it!  It&#x27;s not *odor* free.  It does have a (very) slight smell to it, but it is nothing of significance.  It&#x27;s very gentle and is exactly what my dry, cracked hands needed.  I would have given this product five stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the dispensers.  They&#x27;re terrible!  You get multiples when you order and sometimes a good 50-60% of them won&#x27;t open.  Other reviewers are complaining about this too.  I&#x27;ve gotten to where I won&#x27;t recycle the old containers until I&#x27;m sure the replacement works.  Otherwise I have to unscrew the empty dispenser and put it on the new container.</li>
    <li> There are hardly any unscented liquid hand soaps on the market, and this one is the best. It&#x27;s the only such product I use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this at Whole Foods for years. I have severe allergies to fragrances and cannot find any other fragrance free liquid hand soaps. A lot that make the claim still leave a scent on my hands. This bundle price is a lot less than I was paying, even counting the shipping price. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
    <li> A great all around hand soap for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best I have found...and what a treat that it is really fragrance free...use for everything!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this soap several times.  I love the product, but every time I order, at least one of the bottles does not have the lid screwed on tight and it leaks in the box.</li>
    <li> For Gluten Free members of our family this is one of the only soaps that we have found to not irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> When my husband found out he had to use fragrance free soaps we began a tough search. Aveeno has some great products that are fragrance free, but they can get costly over time. That&#x27;s when I found Kiss My Face Soap. It&#x27;s much cheaper, the bottle lasts longer (more in the bottle), and it works just as well if not better. We both have been using this great soap for a long time now. For a fragrance free soap it lathers up very well and you can feel it working. I believe Kiss My Face soap works better than Soft Soap.  This is one item that is in every order I place with Amazon. We just can&#x27;t have enough of it around.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soap is perfect for people with allergies. I have tried every product under the sun..literally..including California Baby and this is much better and non irritating.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the only hand soap i can use, i have very sensitive skin, my hands get very irritated from parabens</li>
    <li> I love this hand soap.  It is safe and free from nasty chemicals and it leaves my skin moist.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy receiving this soap every few months. Love that this doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance and is good for my skin.</li>
    <li> No odor, light texture. Very gentle. For me slightly costly for daily use.  Would recommend if you do not mind expense.</li>
    <li> The Kiss my Face Fragrance Free Liquid Soap is the best! I wash my hands a lot and this hand soap is the least drying of any I have ever used. After changing from my regular hand soap, my dry chapped hands began to improve and I will continue to use it for as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this soap a lot.  I decided to buy the pack of six, but when I went to use them it turned out that all the containers didn&#x27;t open.  I ended up having to buy a soap dispenser.  So the money I saved by buying in bulk, was mush less then the price of the dispenser.  The soap itself is very gentle and one of the few soaps I can use on my hands, which can get eczema if I am not careful.</li>
