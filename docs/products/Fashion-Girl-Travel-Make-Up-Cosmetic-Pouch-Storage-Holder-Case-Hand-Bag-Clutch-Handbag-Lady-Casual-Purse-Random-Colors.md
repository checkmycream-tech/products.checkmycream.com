<li> This is not a good product.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s poorly made.  </li>
<li> simplistic and practical</li>
<li> you get a random color</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t know it was coming all the way from China, took a while to arrive. I dislike the fact that we werent able to chose colors, but out of all colors I got hot pink.. personally I hate pink so seeing that was kind off putting for me. Out of all the colors, I was really hoping not to get pink.. Otherwise so far its okay, spacious and seems durable. From reading reviews seems a lot of people got pink.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this make-up bag!! I have a few different cosmetic bags but this is my primary one! My others are now used as back ups for my make-up that I do not use daily haha</li>

    <li> i got the a navy blue color bag</li>
    <li> The product is cheaply made. I was hoping to get different colors in my order but got all one color.  Zipper is not properly working one of the 3 I ordered.  Shipping took a long time. I would not have ordered if I had known they were coming from outside the USA.</li>
    <li> great little bags!  perfect for cosmetics, jewelry, etc., especially when traveling.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality.</li>
    <li> Had a few that had broken zippers</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how much I can fit in this bag. It is durable and holds ALL my makeup &amp; nail accessories. Totally worth the money!</li>
    <li> The shipping took a while because they only have a standard shipping. I get a pink one, but i don&#x27;t think you can choose what color you want, it is random. The size is perfect for my bad and I can store my makeup stuff in it.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s bigger than it seems when you receive it. it fits all of my makeup stuff and even some extra. you get a random color but I hoped for pink and I got it :) totally worth buying! simplistic and practical</li>
    <li> Love it.Would purchase a few as gifts for my family.</li>
    <li> love it. the surprise color matched my larger travel make up bag. all seams are good, zipper works great. good size. I ordered 2 of them, both came  in pink.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is exactly what I wanted. Just a small to medium sized case for my purse.</li>
    <li> Love the colors received and they&#x27;re perfect for a cosmetic bag however, I&#x27;m glad I got two because the first&#x27;s zipper broke after one week but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Needed something to keep all of my misc baby items together in the diaper bag, it works great, seems very durable, and at a great price.</li>
    <li> It never got delucered</li>
    <li> Very good bag for the price I paid for it. It&#x27;s able to hold all of my cosmetics in it so it&#x27;s nice for a practical bag.</li>
    <li> Having orderedr three bags, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to received all the same color.  The quality of the bags is exceptional for the price.</li>
    <li> The product is great and they send it before the date delivery, which is good for me. I get the pink one, which is my favorite color. I love this item because it can fits maybe around 10 nails polish, 5 lipsticks and 7 lips gloss. The size is normal for me. But my complain are the item was folded, and it leaves marked on the item. Also, the texture of the items itself is really thick. Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> Took like 7 wks to receive otherwise they are a good purchase</li>
    <li> TOOK ALMOST A ,MONTH AND A HALF TO GET TO ME, VERY PRETTY OF BLUE</li>
    <li> This cosmetic pouch is perfect too keep in my bag. It fits all the make up I need and is lightweight.</li>
    <li> Cute, but as expected, zipper broke in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Really cute! And helps to hold travel size cosmitics.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cute I got the pink one</li>
    <li> Much smaller then I thought</li>
    <li> Product was a lot smaller than I anticipated, and it took a really long time for the product to get here. Also, you don&#x27;t get to pick the color of the item so be prepared to receive any color!</li>
    <li> I intentionally bought this to bring with me when I go traveling to have it with me in the plane before landing. But NOW I use it to carry a little makeup and skincare products with me to the gym.&lt;br /&gt;Rate it 4/5 because it would be nice if it had a clip or handle.</li>
    <li> Very nice make up bag and I love the design! I can fit my make up in here as well as my make up brushes. It&#x27;s perfect to fit all your make up in and then put it in your handbag before stepping out for the day. I have a diaper bag so it fits in my son&#x27;s diaper bag perfectly. Keep in mind that this is getting shipped from China so it would take a little longer to get your make-up pouch.</li>
    <li> Perfect makeup bag for travel. Shipping does take a long time though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great little cosmetic pouch.  I use it for a headlamp that I sometimes need to wear on my head.  It&#x27;s just the right size, but it has no hook or fastener to attach to my tote bag, but it does have a little metal loop. If you want to attach it, you&#x27;ll have to get your own fastener.</li>
    <li> AWESOME BAG. Came in good condition 2 weeks before it was even supposed to be delivered. I&#x27;m in love. Except for the color. I wanted a different color. With my luck, I happened to get a pink bag. I do not like pink but I&#x27;ll use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it very much because the zipper broke the first week</li>
    <li> Perfect size, and looks exactly as advertised. Fits all of my make up perfectly with room to spare.</li>
    <li> Took a while to recive them however they are a good purchase</li>
    <li> LOVE these. Super sturdy and vibrant hot pink color. I received 3 in my shipment which was a surprise. Seriously thinking of ordering more as gifts for Christmas. Zippers are made incredibly well. I was expecting lower quality based on price, but these are made well!! What a great surprise.</li>
    <li> literally took a month to come but it was worth it. It holds all my makeup and its good!</li>
    <li> This is not a good product.  The zip broke the first week I had it.  It&#x27;s poorly made.  I was going to buy more and put items in them for Mother&#x27;s Day to give to my family.  I am glad I waited and only purchased the 1.  The only  good thing is that the color is pretty.</li>
    <li> Great bag for what I need.</li>
    <li> Not really good quality!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice makeup purse, !</li>
    <li> Sturdy for being so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Really was happy to see them since the other ones I ordered didn&#x27;t ever come in</li>
