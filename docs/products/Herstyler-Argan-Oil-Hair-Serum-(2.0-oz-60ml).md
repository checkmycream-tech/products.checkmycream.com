<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A small amount is all that you need, a little goes a long way. There isn&#x27;t any silicone in this product which is a plus. Only Argan oil and Aloe Vera. Do not use too much because it will weigh your hair down and it will look oily. Hair is very smooth with use of a flat iron.</li>
    <li> i have thick and unmanageable hiar, this product manages my hair and it leaves a fresh scent and smoothness lasting for long hours.</li>
    <li> I love it. It smell good and keep your hair from smelling like hot hair. It straighten your hair well good product.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for my daughter who has hypothyroidism that causes her hair to split. It does have a strong smell but the scent is nice so we are fine with it. Just a small amount of this product helps her hair to looks smoother and healthier.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I can use it and let my hair air dry and it&#x27;s not frizzy and looks super healthy</li>
    <li> I love this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference on my hair because I live in Florida and do exercise very often. However, I would  buy this product again just because the way it smells. Even after a good work out my hair still smells clean. My boyfriend had noticed that my hair smells different and he loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought the Herstyler Hair Serum for my daughter. She has dry, thick, frizzy hair. She loved it. It made her hair softer and shiny. It smelled good, too. Other than the costly price, I do recommend this product to people with dry, damaged hair.</li>
    <li> Although I do not care for the strong scent of this product, it works so well I can overlook it.  I can also overlook it because this is a much better price than it is at the kiosk at the mall (and without being accosted and given the sales pitch)!  However, I would not have known about this product were it not for getting a one-use sample package from the mall... Nevertheless, this serum leaves hair sleek and shiny,  reduces blowdrying time and prevents damage from the flatiron.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> When I received it, it was open and spilling out. I was not happy with that, but, the scent was great and I wished I could use it for cologne.It shined very well on my hair.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000TW2JQC HerStyler Hair Serum Vitamin E Aloe Vera]]    This is simply the best serum I&#x27;ve ever used. No matter how much I use, my hair is not greasy, and it ends up extremely shiny and silky, no frizz at all, even in the most humid weather. Skip the drugstore brands, and try this! I&#x27;ve gone from using several products on my hair to only this!</li>
    <li> This hairstyler product is the best on my hair. Especially in the winter time with all the cold dry air. One of the best things about this product is you hardly use any at one time, a very small amount goes a long ways. I wash my hair every 3 days, so I use it once in those 3 days. My hair is soft silky and smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I use this after my hair has been washed and condition. Because my hair is thick and full in its natural state I probably use about 3 quarter sized drops.    Then I blow dry my hair with a 2000 watt hair dryer and a vent brush. After that I apply just a quarter sized drop all over then start straightening my hair with a flat iron at 450 degrees. Along with Chi&#x27;s Iron Guard, my hair comes out silky and incredibly straight.    The silky press lasts about 2 weeks if the weather isn&#x27;t too humid.      And I think it does a wonderful job of preventing breakage even after using alot of heat.    When I maintain my hair in its natural state, it keeps my hair tangle free! And that&#x27;s a hard thing to do.    I wish they would make a larger size of it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair for the first time. After using this product my hair felt smooth and shines. It works great with the flat iron. I had to come home and buy this product.[[ASIN:B000TW2JQC HerStyler Hair Serum Vitamin E Aloe Vera Silky Treatment]]And the price was great through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Her Styler Hair Serum is the only thing that works to tame my thick wavy hair. I bought this, the shampoo and conditioner, and saved over $100 dollars than what I would have spent at the kiosk at the mall. In the last 12 months, I have only gone through 1.25 bottles of the serum, and that&#x27;s me, my sister, and my friends using it. The delivery was a day early, which I loved!</li>
    <li> I first bought this product in a mall where they was showing different products. Let the lady apply to my hair, felt good on the scalp, made hair shine some and kinda put hair in a shape i wanted. Very pleased, over paid in the mall and found it on Amazon for 10 bucks. Ordered instantly. Its for men and women but it and test drive, you will like the out come....</li>
    <li> I first used this product when a mall vendor forced me to let them straighten my hair with the \\&quot;her styler\\&quot;. I expected to have to wash it out later, but I was pleasantly surprised when I didn&#x27;t. This product smells amazing and it absorbs into your hair quickly. If you use a straightener it&#x27;s fantastic for smoothing out the ends without making your hair look or feel greasy. I have accidentally put on a little too much before but I have never had a problem with the product absorbing itself into my hair. I would recommend it to anyone, and have had several bottles smuggled out of my possession by friend and my sister. (So keep your eye on it)</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was not the same product as it shows in the picture. No where on the bottle does it show the words Vitamin E. This is not the same product as you would receive when ordering from herstyler.com, its obviously a replica.</li>
    <li> Amazing product ! The smell is wonderful &amp; keeps my hair silky smooth even in Floridas heat . I even use a tiny drop on my hands before applying lotion . A lady at the mall was trying to get me to buy the product she waa super sweet but the price wasnt ! I was a little upset it was so expensive I was truly intrested . So I came home &amp; found it on Amazon for 12$ with shipping . Cant beat it !! Will be buying again &amp; again thank you cosmetic 4 less .. BUT when I opened the box the serum did not have a lid on &amp; the cap was not on tight enough &amp; lost some liquid but not too much to hold a grudge . Oh I recieved the email that my product had shipped &amp; next day It was at my door I was shocked !!! Once again thank you cosmetic4less :)</li>
    <li> I have very frizzy hair. I absolutely love this product even if Im not using my flat iron. In fact im finding by using this and not heating my hair, its growing out much healthier! It cuts out the frizz and makes my hair look soft and shiny. Its not at all greasy. I also love the smell.  I will keep buying this product and Im already on my 4th bottle. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product... it makes ur hair feel so soft.. and smells very good too!.. one bottle can last you a long time... its great when u iron ur hair.. and great when you dont too lol.. but i have tried so many hair stuff this one worked the best!! i love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair serum. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t make your hair oily. Will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It helps to keep my hair healthy and it provides it with a wonderful shine!  I recommend this product to everyone!  The price is great also!</li>
    <li> I was approached as I walked by a kiosk in the mall and asked if they could show me a great product. I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by the flatiron- I have one at home that works just as well and didn&#x27;t cost anywhere near the $200.00 \\&quot;bargain\\&quot; they were offering that day. BUT the free sample of the hair serum is another story. I am online to buy it today and plan to use it for years to come. My hair is long, wavy and a little frizzy. I used the tiny little packet for 2 days and both days my hair looked fantastic. The texture is soft and natural, it looks healthy and has a nice little shine. It made my hair look like I just left the salon. I applied it to towel dried hair and brushed it through, then blew it dry. I didn&#x27;t even use my flatiron, but I can&#x27;t wait to try it with the serum. I am also going to buy the shampoo and conditioner today- hopefully it will be as great a product as the serum is!!</li>
    <li> I have suuuper sentisive skin - to the point that I really can&#x27;t use conditioner or use leave-in products because they irritate the skin around my hairline.  This hair serum is a lifesaver!  I can use it without irritating my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp or greasy-looking at all.  In fact, I&#x27;ve stopped using conditioner in the shower and use the serum after my shower instead.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells great, not \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; but pleasant.  My finace never responds to lotions or body spray with fragrance, but every time I use this serum he remarks on how good my hair smells, even at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> After trying this out at the mall I decided to try to see if I could get it online for cheaper than $50, which is what the kiosk was selling it for.  I really like it.  I apply it to the tips of my hair every few days and it feels silky soft without getting greasy.</li>
    <li> I got so exited with the results of my HerStyler flat iron that I wanted to try more of their products so I got this Hair Serum,with my african american relaxed hair I really need to protect my hair of heat,  while the price was great for the product I realized after I got it that it do not protect the hair from the heat as other products, I am using this serum now just to seal the hair after I am done flat ironing but with my damp hair before flat ironing I am using Redken Smooth Down heat protection which is great for me.  So if you are looking for heat protection this is not the product, this serum is great for sealing the hair after is dry.</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum makes my hair feel even using the straightner every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have replaced 4 expensive hair products with this! This is exactly what my hair needs. Difficult to find when you need to reorder and price varies a lot!</li>
    <li> I have used other products for my hair and this is the best one.  It is light and not heavy like others I have used.  I highly recomend it for anyone to use on their hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing and fast i loveeee</li>
    <li> I use this product before and after straightening my hair. It protects my hair from split ends and burning as well as keeps it smooth and shiny. The product is a little expensive, however one bottle could last me 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with curly hair and wants to straighten it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I saw it selling in the mall for around $70.00.  I have bought this item twice for less than half price what they sell in the mall.  First time no problems, loved it and decided to order again.  The next time I ordered it, it smelled different than the last one and didn&#x27;t work the same.  My guess is it was from a different vendor and they added something to it, or it had turned in the bottle.  I should have sent it back, but didn&#x27;t end up doing so.  When you receive item, smell it first to make sure it hasn&#x27;t turned and is what you ordered.  I am starting to think something fishy about this &#x27;HerStyler&#x27; product, as I have ordered hairspray, shampoo &amp; conditioner as well and had similar issues :(</li>
    <li> I have very long hair. And it&#x27;s very dry! So it&#x27;s hard for me to go a whole day without getting terrible tangles in my hair.  But when I use this, my hair is wonderful! I put it in my damp hair after a shower, then I blow dry, and I can run my fingers through my hair all day. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for forever! Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried countless serums, and I saw the best results with this.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery and price from supplier!   If you have never tried this stuff...you SHOULD!   My daughters have LONG \\&quot;mixed chic\\&quot; hair.  That means, fine strands, super frizzy, looks like cotton candy hair.    After washing their hair, I add this serum, work it through to the ends, let their hair air dry and THEN flat iron it with no other product.  Their hair looks like it was always straight!  It moves, it&#x27;s shiny, it smells great.   I&#x27;ve used many other \\&quot;serum type\\&quot; products and most are far too heavy for a good result with a flat iron.  This stuff is just right!   You will love the result even if you leave it natural and curly!</li>
    <li> Great is all I can say! Great product, Great price, Great ship and packaging, Great service! Just a better (much-much better!) price than at the mall with or without purchasing a herstyler flat iron!</li>
    <li> I bought one of the Herstyler flat irons and recieved this oil for free. I have fallen in love with it ever since. It smells great, has a wonderful shine, and is light weight so that your hair is not weight down and still maintains a lot of body. I have African American hair, it is not coarse or relaxed. I&#x27;m 100% natural and have been using this products for several months. It is sometimes the only thing i put in my hair after a wash and flat iron and it works great. I recommend you to try, but i encouraged you to try and get a deal, because it is very expensive and come in a small bottle. However it is well worth the money, because you only need a drop for your whole head! It hast pretty long as well. I have had the same bottle since Nov and it has lasted up until now.</li>
    <li> I saw this at the mall in a little kiosk place and found a much better price on Amazon. I love this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product I purchased through amazon is the same and works as well as sample I got in store. My hair has more shine and less frizziness. Looks fuller.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I was given samples of this product in a mall 5 months ago.  I recently went out of town overnight and wanted to pack lightly so I grabbed one of these samples not expecting much, just the usual serum.  I was amazed the next day at how differently my hair felt, blow dried, styled, everything.  I used the 2nd sample the next day just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t different water or humidity or something else.  Nope, my hair was even better.  I ordered this bottle the next day and have used it about 5 times now.  I have long wavy/ almost curly hair.  It takes about 25 minutes to blow dry straight due to thickness.  I then must flat iron or hot roll to finish smoothing.  I have been doing this routine for about 18 years now.  This serum makes my hair so soft, manageable, and frizz free I really don&#x27;t have to do much beyond blow dry.  I have tried every cream, serum, spray etc. out there and this is AMAZING.  You will love it!  I never leave feedback, but felt this product really warranted my review!</li>
    <li> My wife has been a Herstyler user for 3 years now and as far as she is concerned there&#x27;s nothing better on the market.  Thanx</li>
    <li> This product helps control my thick, wavy hair.  A little goes a long way.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Arrived a week sooner than expected!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product. I recommend it to anyone- especially those with colored and/or heat treated hair. And a LOT cheaper here!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have very fine dry hair, and this product gives my hair body and shine without making it flat.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that protects my hair very well! It smells great, too! Don&#x27;t use too much, or you will have to wash your hair again (start with just a pencil-eraser sized dot)! I also use this in stages, as I straighten each layer of hair. This is a fabulous product to purchase! :) (And I&#x27;ll get it again!)   Note: This is the same product you get from the mall, I&#x27;ve used both and notice no difference, except price!</li>
    <li> I too foolishly bought my flat iron at the mall and paid Big Bucks, but, this serum is soooo fabulous, soft, shiny, silky smooth hair, i would even wear it as a perfume, it smells so good!!</li>
    <li> This serum treats my hair very nicely.  bought it after reading good reviews in Amazon and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me. I&#x27;m not using it anymore since it&#x27;s almost winter and the humidity is gone. Anyways I still use it in any special occasions to keep my hair silky and in place. Hoever, I&#x27;ll get some more for spring and summer for sure ;). If you have a frizzy hair, get it, it will help you :)</li>
    <li> This product is great. It smells great and works really good on straight or curly hair. I would buy it again and again. I will only purchase it through Amazon because it&#x27;s over priced in the malls. It&#x27;s $49 dollars in the mall verses Amazon has it for $4.95 a bottle!! I bought (2)bottle for that price.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Daughter loves it. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product protects my hair and makes it shine. I&#x27;m so happy I got this product!</li>
    <li> I like this because its non-greasy and makes my hair shiny without being heavily weighed down.  I actually got this at $20 because I haggled!  I thought the price of $45 was a price that the lady at the kiosk made up so I was just about to walk unless she went down on the price. :) NOW IM REALLY HAPPY I GOT THIS!</li>
    <li> too oily, too heavy...I don&#x27;t like this product. also, when I received this it was already leaking because the lid was not tightly closed. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is any better than other serums. In fact, I like it less than the standard John Frieda. It is light and didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, and I can use a little even shen my hair is dry. I also didn&#x27;t feel it was all that moustrizing though- just a lot of silicone.</li>
    <li> The first product that actually did make my hair as shining as in the absurd hair-swinging ads. which never work.</li>
    <li> This product is very similar to [[ASIN:B000BIVY0G Bumble and Bumble  DeFRIZZ (4 Ounces)]], which is what I normally use.  Both products effectively coat your hair with a gloss and protect it from heat damage &amp; tangles.  The HerStyler serum works to that end -- it makes my hair silky and shiny.  I purchased the HerStyler serum rather than the B&amp;B DeFRIZZ because the HerStyler was selling for under $8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only major complaint I have is the smell.  It has a strong scent which isn&#x27;t exactly a bad smell, but not great either.  The smell fades after I blow it dry, so it&#x27;s not so bad.</li>
    <li> This product makes you hair very silky and easy to manage. I use a hot iron after blow drying. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> After all the good reviews I read on this, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it comes in a really cute bottle, and it&#x27;s not too big or clunky, and I like how it&#x27;s transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair looking really nourished and healthy, and makes it softer than normal.  I also experience a lot less frizzy hair throughout the day.  It also brings out the blonde in my hair and makes my hair look bright and sleek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just feels so great in your hair, and I use it every day!  It&#x27;s a definite hair serum must-buy.</li>
    <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve used, but I have yet to put it to the REAL test.  95 degree Summer @ the beach.</li>
    <li> This is my first review of a product on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to write about this product to let others that are wondering, \\&quot;should I really spend the money\\&quot; and \\&quot;will the product do what it says\\&quot; and \\&quot;will the product turn my hair into this awesome wonderland that no one can take their eyes off of\\&quot;. Okay, so I&#x27;ll break it down: YES to all hypothetical questions because it&#x27;s no longer hype to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I used this product with &#x27;The Croc&#x27; flat iron (Nano Classic) and the results were absolutely amazing. The flat iron was really cool (no pun intended and The Croc flat iron review will be separate) and I strongly feel it was a definite contributing factor in my experience with the Herstyler Serum purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The retail price of the Herstyler Serum is $75.00. I paid $13 &amp; some change on Amazon, price dropped to below $12 in last week (DARN). Still so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is super-light. I don&#x27;t like heavy serum or oils, which tend to weigh my hair down and it&#x27;s looks like a stringy greasy mess (I&#x27;m hate when it happens!). This product recommended use before and after flat-ironing. I followed instruction and used the Herstyler serum before AND after flat-ironing my hair. Like I said, it&#x27;s light! I was floored by how super-straight and super-shiny my hair was, I was surprised in all good ways. My hair just transformed into super-model hair in less than 10 minutes. I&#x27;m a bit lazy when it comes to my hair, but I was inspired to spend a bit more time practicing with the serum and using the iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At work, I was stopped by female and male co-workers that commented on how straight and shiny my hair looked; not that I didn&#x27;t have nice hair before, but this Herstyler Serum prompted an explosion of hair gorgeousness on a level I have never seen, felt, or experienced; it&#x27;s a hair miracle. I could not stop looking at my hair, and neither could anyone else. I really think this serum (with my choice of flat-iron) made a HUGE difference. I forwarded the link to both the serum and flat-iron to my inquiring co-workers; I have no doubt I&#x27;ll be seeing more transformed hair in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I can name drop, but I&#x27;ve used other serum-like oils: Moroccan Oil, Kendi Dry Oil Mist, Redkin Smooth Down. None compare. I still like the Kendi Dry Oil Mist, but I haven&#x27;t reached for it since trying the Herstyler serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I don&#x27;t sound like an infomercial, but I really feel that anyone looking to buy this serum along with or use with a professional or good quality flat-iron will NOT be disappointed...unless my experience is unique to my hair type: I have long, chemically treated hair (salon visits regularly), hair length is past my elbows, and fine but lots of it. My hair is nice, but it was completely super-model-ish after this serum &amp; flat iron experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope everyone that tries the serum and the flat iron has the same experience I did. It was worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the link to the flat iron I bought (again, review under separate cover): [[ASIN:B003RR4A2M Turboion Rbb Croc Classic Straightener, Black Titanium Plates, 1.5 Inch]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( :-iron to my inquiring co-workers; I have no doubt I&#x27;ll be seeing more transformed hair in the office.

    <li> A good product. It does the job.</li>
    <li> great, light weight&amp; non greasy. Makes your hair so soft when you flat. iron your hair. The price great! BUY 2 So worth it!</li>
    <li> Someone recommended this product and to buy from amazon.  I was not so sure about it but read up and made sure I could return it if needed.  The product arrived much earlier than it stated and I love it.  It works great in my hair and my daughters.  It keeps it from frizzy all day and the style stays all day.  I only bought one bottle to make sure I like it but next time will buy two if there is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, soft, fragrant hair! When used in conjunction with a flat iron though, there is build-up. Love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, less is more is definitely the motto of this product. I use it on damp hair, before I straighten my hair and after to give it an extra shine and sleek look.&lt;br /&gt;one small pump each time is just enough.</li>
    <li> Makes hair nice and smooth and shines.</li>
    <li> This serum work great. Leaves your hair soft, and conditioned. I&#x27;m on my third bottle, alittle goes along way. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the mall for $60 and they told me it was a deal. So when I ran out of it, I went online and found it here for a lot cheaper here. Don&#x27;t go anywhere online before checking amazon! My only complaint is that it is so small</li>
    <li> I really like this Product. I saw it in my local mall at a stand &amp; I took a chance &amp; tried it &amp; I love it. Works really well for my fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  My hair is so much healthier and it only takes a small amount to make a huge difference.  It also makes my hair styles go better and this product protects my hair from the heat styling tools I use.</li>
    <li> Had a small bottle that came with my Herstyler. Had to get another. Love this product!</li>
    <li> My hair was a mess and I had never tried these types of oils before. I guess the 1st is the best, because I&#x27;m very happy! Tamed my frizz and I&#x27;m able to go outside without my hair being tied back!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!!! I have dry frizzy hair, controls frizz and adds shine. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> My daughter got me hooked on this.  I spend a fortune on hair styling products. I&#x27;ve used Kerastase, Chi, Living Proof, Fekkai.  Nothing works as good as this.  I am 51 and die my hair.  This product leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I have naturally wavy hair and wear it curly some days and straightened others. With this product, both hair styles come out looking fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;In the mall you pay twice as much.  This is a bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write a review, but don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive serums. You&#x27;ll love this!</li>
    <li> Clogged my pores and cause forehead bumps!!</li>
    <li> This product is very good for smoothing your hair.  It has a wonderful feel and smell.  So far it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for helping with the frizzes and giving your hair that great feel.</li>
    <li> Im absolutely in love with this product!!!!!! It leaves my hair feeling great, soft, and smooth!!!! five stars to this product!!!!!:)</li>
    <li> So I have been purchasing this item since last year and I love it.  I used a sample first and it made my hair really soft so I decided to buy it.  It works for a while, but then I felt like it was still frizzy sometimes so I found a way in which it works to smooth out my hair every time.  After I take my shower, I towel dry my hair for around 10-20 minutes, I brush it, and then apply a bit of this serum.  Once it dries, you&#x27;ll see the difference.  Also you can add a little more later in the day and it makes it even softer, but DO NOT use too much or your hair will look oily.</li>
    <li> Wont leave hair looking greasy even if you re-apply - most products can&#x27;t do this so it&#x27;s nice to be able to apply morning and night with out the oily look.</li>
    <li> ok first let me say I am African American with natural hair. that means kinky and frizzy! which sometimes can be mistaken for hard and fluffy! I was walking through the mall (with my afro puffs) and HerStyler&#x27;s people saw me. they asked if they can flat iron my hair. I didn&#x27;t think it would work so I only let them do very small section, but OMG! so, my boyfriend bought this expensive set for me. the amazing part of this set is the SERUM. boy! when I tell you it takes out the frizz and leave my hair shinny and healthy looking. everyone thinks I permed my hair, or they say you must have nice hair or something. but, I am telling you this is the product to invest in if you are looking to battle the frizz of ANY ANY ANY hair type. If it worked on my nappy hair it will work on any hair. I wish I can tell them thanks! they&#x27;ve changed my life.</li>
    <li> I have hair so long its now almost to my knees, and last year I had to cut off about a foot and a half just because it was SO DAMAGED from normal wear n tear. That&#x27;s when I stumbled across this product. Let me tell you, I used it once and right then and there I spent $50 on 2 bottles. I use 2 drops every other day only on the last foot or so of the length (where all the damage is) and it looks INCREDIBLE-like I just got it cut!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its softer, shinier, and I&#x27;ve noticed that it grows even faster cuz its so HEALTHY! I CONSTANTLY have people stop me and comment on my long hair, how healthy it looks and how beautiful it is, and I tell EVERYONE about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the last 3 months I actually ran out of my stock, and hadn&#x27;t gotten more yet.... my hair looks so damaged, and it tangles so easy - its tangled right after I brush it.... so, today I found it here so cheap and bought 5 bottles. I have no intention of running out again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I have seen a few other women with hair as long as mine, but none that look and feel as soft and healthy as mine does when I use the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*also, please note, the only things I do to my hair is wash it with shampoo and conditioner (I use tresemme moisture rich since before I found this product cuz it makes it noticably softer), let it air dry, and put herstyler vitamin e.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for using with a hot iron! Smells wonderful,everyone comments on my hair and the smell! I adore it! A little goes a long way. I section my hair and every time I iron a section I apply a drop of this stuff, comb it,then pass the iron on it twice and Voila! I get a lot of compliments... pls keep selling if Amazon!</li>
    <li> I was approached by a man from a Kiosk at a mall in Southern Florida.  He was mainly trying to sell me on some extensions and a flat iron.  He did a small section of hair which left me feeling a little silly-looking so I jokingly asked him to do my whole head.  He very graciously did and when he was finished he stroked this serum through my hair and oh my goodness, the smell and shine!  NOT GREASY OR HEAVY at all!  I bought some sleek serum from Garnier and took it back to the store.  Hated it and felt greasy all day long.  This stuff is amazing.  So grateful to find it on Amazon and cosmetic4less shipped super fast.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on the rave reviews and was really hoping it would rescue my hair too, but I guess my hair is more damaged and dryer than most.  It didn&#x27;t work as well for me but that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t for you.  It might be because my hair type --coarse thick hair that has been color treated, permed and chemically straightened and I wash every day (otherwise it gets too oily).  I applied this product for about two weeks, and tried to test it different ways, on damp hair, towel-dried hair, and blow-dried hair.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t control my frizz and slightly improves dryness if I put a lot of it in (much more than the smidge/small amount recommended by others). My hair feels softer after about 10 pumps but it still looks dry and frizzy.  Some said this small bottle could last them months but I think I could go through it in one month easily.</li>
    <li> It smells awesome and makes my hair very manageable. Im happy it Worked really well on my African American hair.</li>
    <li> overall product review great!! my only issue is when i opened the product there was serum all over the bottle &amp; box due to the pump being broken(its supposed to lock when you turn it but mine just spins).so i didnt have a full bottle. if i had not already purchased this product before i wouldnt know any better.</li>
    <li> I received a different product than pictured.  What I received has Argon Oil in it which I had tried in a different product &amp; didn&#x27;t get the effect I was looking for.  When I was shopping for the Herstyler brand I was looking specifically for the silver bottle as pictured with no Argon Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  product works well hust wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.</li>
    <li> The Herstyle hair serum is a really great product. However when I received the package it was leaking and seemed previously used because there was so much missing from the bottle. It was leaking but not that much compared to what was missing from the bottle.</li>
    <li> Placed my order on Sunday, today Wednesday, received my product! I&#x27;m SO glad I did not purchase the HerStyler Serum from the mall cart. They wanted $30 for same product. What a deal from your website! Thank you SO much. Will order from you in future!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman who after years of using chemical relaxers on my hair, decided to stop using chemical and just go natural. The Herstyler hair serum was originally given to me as a gift by a friend 2 years ago as I was transitioning to my natural style. It kept my hair looking healthy. It is non greasy and has a very pleasant scent. Now that I am all natural, it is the perfect product to maintain my healthy curly look. Other products weighed my hair down and left it too oily.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for heat protection for my hair and to help defrizz my really thick hair. I am in my upper 30&#x27;s and my hair is wavy and stays dry on the ends.  I have used a lot of products (including expensive salon products) to help with the frizzies.  This by far is the best I have used.  A little goes a long way and it amazingly works very well.  I put it on after the shower and again after my hair is dry. I sometimes use a flat iron and sometimes go natural, either way it&#x27;s good.  It really gives your hair a healthy shine also.  I know this product is pricey but is worth every penny.  I am reordering today and I highly recommend to anybody with the same hair type as mine (thick, frizzy, wavy hair).</li>
    <li> I have used all the major brand hair serums and this one kicks all their butts :) It turned my cotton candy hair into soft, sleek, sexy hair! The greatest thing about it is that my hair looks amazing even when i don&#x27;t use it, it repaired my hair..</li>
    <li> I bought a hair straightener at a Kiosk at a mall. The sales person offered me this serum as well. I love this product ever since. I am not actually sure if this serum protects hair from heat, but I use a tiny portion before ironing my hair. It makes my hair shinny and straight. It works well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this some time ago but have never used it. I now have very short hair, pixie style, due to it growing back from having gone through chemo...I like the look it gives me...the wet look but not so wet that it looks like I just got out of the shower.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  It leaves my hair soft and silky...and smooth!  I have naturally curly hair and I use this when my hair is wet before I dry and straighten it.  It REALLY works! A++!</li>
    <li> This Product is Awesome, leaves your hair shiny, &amp; silky soft without the greasey feeling that other hair serums do, I highly recommend this product. If you try to buy this at the Herstyler Kiosk at the mall they will charge you $45.00- $50.00 dollars, dont buy it there go to Amazon.com, I just purchased another bottler for $4.99.</li>
    <li> i love this product and will order it again I got it in record time and have recommended this to other friends it works great</li>
    <li> About to clear out my other hair products this is all i need it leave my hair looking flawless and silky soft!! will buy this product again if i ever run out !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+++++ Delivery was super fast +++++</li>
    <li> I just wish this were still made because this product does an incredible job of making my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> The serum makes your hair feel and look beautiful. My haiur is dry and the serum makes my hair look like a hydrated and healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product, just a small amount is necessary and my hair looks glossy and not greasy at all. And Amazon as always offers a better price. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried this at my local shopping mall. The guy said it&#x27;s exactly like biosilk with vitamins. Smells great and it&#x27;s also good for your hair. Retail price is actually $45..but hey it&#x27;s worth every penny to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It works great for taming frizziness and giving shine to hair. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and it smells really good.The only complaint that I had was the creepy package that it came in.</li>
    <li> Before buying this, I searched through all the feedback to find someone that doesn&#x27;t have very thick and/or curly hair.  Since I did find a feedback with shorter thin fine hair, I decided to try it.  My hair is medium-short (versus short short).  I&#x27;m 64.  I used to be blessed with pretty hair that was thick, but not overly so.  Even though it has also been fine, it had body.  Even though I don&#x27;t have much gray due to the minerals and whole B supplements, my hair has become dull, unmanageable,  and doesn&#x27;t look very good.  It is also about 60% thinner, unfortunately. My description will help you compare with your hair likeness.  After I towel-dry my hair, I put one squirt on my hand, rub my hands together and lightly rub through my hair.  Then I use another squirt and do it again.  This seems to be the right amount for my hair.  I have to say, I now LOVE the way my hair looks and feels.  It is soft, feels silky and looks healthy.  It does not leave an oily, which is my pet peeve.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Smells really good.  A little bit goes a long way. I have really long hair and a couple of squirts is plenty enough. I use this before straightening my hair and it helps prevent damage.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great, i love it! it smells good, makes my hair feel good too.</li>
    <li> The reviews are true, and Iv&#x27;e tried about every serum there is out there! My husband uses the paul mitchell skinny serum and I think this one is way better than that. It smells great and is not oily nor leaves hair oily, just super soft. I have very curly hair and surprisingly this works great on my curls and also when I straighten it! Of course I only put a small amount of serum when I straighten it and it last about 3 days, I use more when I leave it curly and dry it with a difuser.</li>
    <li> This product is an amazing value!  I have tried lots of other serums that cost more and don&#x27;t do as much.  I used to use Moroccan Oil and switched to Neil George Indian Gooseberry Oil a couple years ago.  These products cost over $40 (4 oz) each and don&#x27;t do nearly as good a job at giving me smooth healthy looking hair.  HOWEVER, I have to be really careful with this product around my face because it causes me to have breakouts.  I have very long hair and I just apply it to the \\&quot;pony tail\\&quot; part so it doesn&#x27;t get near my scalp or face and it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> This was good for a while, it smoothed my fine partly straight/partly wavy hair into glass, but they changed the formula, and the product accumulation and strong smell eventually became too much for me. This product has way more stuff in it than the label reveals. I recommend Marrakesh X by Earthly Body instead.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and thought this might be the product for me, Not. I am black with natural hair (7 years) that is very kiny and dry. This product made my hair extremly dry. I am learning that Aloe is used on oily hair.  In the future, I will stick with Carol Daughter, Miss Jessie&#x27;s and Wen products. I will donate this product to one of my White/ mix friends. If you are Black with natural hair and going to buy this product.  Please get a sample at the Mall first. This product is not for ALL HAIR TYPES.  Do Not waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have probably tried at least a hundred hair serums and this is absolutely the best one for my hair - which is Caucasian, old, dry, dyed, and coarse curly. I use either as a tamer when leaving hair natural or as a smoother when straightening. Smells great and is not greasy. This is also an incredible price for the product. Shipping to Canada was slow, but the supplier did ship it promptly after purchase, and the product is worth the wait.</li>
    <li> SCAM-This is Def NOT the product!It smelled like bug spray &amp; made my hair feel disgusting &amp; almost like straw.Terrible.</li>
    <li> The serum repaired the damage done by straightening my hair everyday! It also makes your hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I got samples of herstyler at the mall and fell inlove.with it , I didn&#x27;t wanna pay $75 for the 2oz bottle . So I looked it.up, it was less than $15 on here I ordered it, it came within 2 days ! I use it every day ir only takes a tiny squirt &amp; hides those hideous dead ends !</li>
    <li> I love this oil, I bought mine at the mall for $20 I can’t believe they’re selling it on amazon for this price. It leaves my long curly thick hair feeling amazingly soft and shiny. I have tried many oils and serums and none compare. I’m not too fond of the herb smell but it does subside. I will continue to repurchase this on amazon. I highly recommend it for coarse curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have curly unruly hair without this product I would walk around looking like I was wearing a clown wig...  The smell is fabulous, strangers stop to ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> People notice when I use this in my hair.  I notice a difference when I use this in my hair.  It&#x27;s fantastic and I will place another order as soon as I can.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product but i got the one with vitamin e instead ... its not bad but i wanted to get what i ordered</li>
    <li> Works well, without making my hair oily.  Came with a hair straightener and it works great.  Doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily when it is used.</li>
    <li> When first apply on hair: the perfume smell is overpowering but at least tolerable, the hair feels great through your fingers, though the sleek look of hair I was expecting was not there. Fifteen minutes later, the fragrance evolved into a gag-inducing smell (just like cheap perfume would). My hair looks and feels no different than without using this product. It actually makes it a tad bit more easy-to-tangle than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a few more trials and vary the amount, etc, to see if it makes a difference but the strong fragrance is just too intolerable. Throwing this away since it can&#x27;t be returned used...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just realized what I received might have been fake? Like another reviewer mentioned: there is no \\&quot;vitamin E\\&quot; written anywhere on the bottle. In addition, the box it came with didn&#x27;t have any artwork as pictured. Now I have a reason to return</li>
    <li> At first I thought this product smelled like bug spray, but for some reason as I used it, I kind of liked the smell... I think it helped make my hair feel a bit smoother, but I really couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference. This product is not exactly as advertised, either. It does not say anywhere on the product &amp;#34;Vitamin E&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Without being like glue, I&#x27;ve tried other products and I rather have fuzzy hair. This stuff is great reminds me I need to order more.</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my hair very soft and easier to brush through when wet.</li>
    <li> My hair looks so much better after using this product, no frizz any more, now i have shiny, silky and smooth hair</li>
    <li> it helps to take the frizz out of curly and color damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I  have to deal  with is that it creates a bit of electricity in my hair but I  can usually take care of that with a cream called &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; that I  also use.</li>
    <li> This item works great it has just been two weeks and it would work great with its flat iron. Was glad I got it. Smaller than I thought though but it works great and u just need a little.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my wife , she loves it , her hair looks great highly recommended .will buy again!</li>
    <li> When I started using it, I love the way my hair feels, but after a few weeks it caused me to have static( huge) in my hair. I stop using it and problem solved. So, it not worked for me If I want to use it every day. The bottle is not recommended for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great low price.</li>
    <li> I first found out about this hair serum at a kiosk at the mall. It was way too expensive. I found it here on amazon for an exceptional price. My only issue is that I run out of this stuff too fast, so next time I think I may buy it in bulk to last me a bit longer.</li>
    <li> I was handed a sample of the HerStyler serum at the mall, with little hope  I thought to myself; \\&quot;yet another hair serum.\\&quot; My sister convinced me to try it. She told me that her friend swears by it. I finally used my free sample and boy was I impressed. I applied it after I shampooed my hair, before setting it. My hair was left silky, not greasy nor sticky . No offensive odors.  Hair&#x27;s texture felt very natural. I am Latin and I relax my hair, so you know what that means&#x3D; frizzy, dry, wavy. In short, \\&quot;oh no, it&#x27;s humid outside!!!!.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried Moroccan Oil and Frizz by  Living Proof and other drug store brands. Moroccan Oil is not bad. Living Proof Frizz leaves hair heavy and a residue on your hair brush. I recommend you to get a sample of the HairStyler serum before investing your hard earned money. Next time that I go to the mall, I won&#x27;t hide or rush away from the flatiron kiosk. I will compliment them on their great product and purchase their serum.</li>
    <li> If this product is so good why am I having hair breakage?  My hair usually does not suffer from breakage.  Did not notice  it immediately.  It&#x27;s been a slow process.  My suggestion to anyone using this product would be to test it...Also, the product does not out perform any other serums on the market....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;hype\\&quot;...Several of the previous reviews are duplicated on other sites on the internet (copied and Past).???..Judge for yourself</li>
    <li> I have very fine, straight, fly-away hair.  A year ago, I received a sample of HerStyler and have been using it ever since with great success. It gives my hair a lot of body, nice shine and it smells very nice. Love it!</li>
    <li> This hair serum I recently bought with my new herstyler hair straightener. I use this hair serum after ever time I flat iron my hair. It comes in a charming bottle and smells heavenly! It leaves your hair even more polished and smelling wonderful. The formula is not too greasy for your hair as some of the serums I have used in my past. I recommend this to anyone looking for a serum that is effective and affordable.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy it based on the reviews but as always what works for someone does not work for another one. Well I don&#x27;t like the smell of it reminds me cheap products. I would not suggest it for people with oily hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve used every other kind of serum in the US and this is by far the only one that smells great, provides shine and vitamin E. I;ve used this for 7 years and will continue to do so for many years to come</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; hair product.  I&#x27;ve never found it in a retail store, so Amazon keeps my hair in  line!</li>
    <li> love thr small an work great.</li>
    <li> Product not as advertised. I thought the first time I received the wrong product that it was a fluke, but when I reordered, your company shipped me two of the same wrong hair care products. These two products do not achieve the same results. Why would you advertise that you&#x27;re selling the bottle containing \\&quot;Vitamin E and Aloe Vera\\&quot; which is distinctive with a silver colored pump, but continue to send your customers the Argan Oil bottle that has a  chrome pump? You need to correctly advertise what your company is selling.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of HerStyler serum.  I use it before flat ironing my hair, works great.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Useful when you just do your hair, but does not last long enough until you wash and do your hair again</li>
    <li> I really love this product!  It makes your hair very smooth and silky. I have extremely coarse, virgin hair and once my hair was blow dried I applied the serum before flat ironing.  The results were smooth, frizz-free and shiny hair.  Needless to say that when I run out of this product I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> I originally had gotten a sample of this from the vendor in the mall that is set up with the flat irons.  I didn&#x27;t need another iron but took the free sample.  I have thick hair but it makes it silky and smooth when I flat iron it an use this product.  It takes several pumps for my hair but tends to last a couple days.  I was happy to find it at this price through amazon.</li>
    <li> the serum came with the heystyler iron and i dont really care for it has a weird smell and does not do much for my curly hair</li>
    <li> Thank You So Much. I absolutely Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Can&#x27;t get enough of it..... I recommend it to anyone who wants Silky Smooth Hair..</li>
    <li> We  first bought this product in Vegas &amp; loved it.  If you have a brillo pad for hair, this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> Just okay, don&#x27;t care for the scent. Blah</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I FIRST TRIED IT WHEN THE SALES PERSON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MALL GAVE ME A SAMPLE. I FELL IN LOVE THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. BEING THE SKEPTIC THAT I AM I GOT ANOTHER SAMPLE JUST TO BE SURE...AND THE SAME AMAZING RESULTS! I HAVE LONG THIN/FINE, DRY, SEVERELY DAMAGED AT THE ENDS HAIR (I DONT WANT TO CUT IT CAUSE IM TRYING TO LET IT GROW JUST A LITTLE LONGER). WHEN U USE IT, IT MAKES YOUR HAIR FEEL MOST INCREDIBLY SOFT, SHINY, AND BOUNCY! IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE ONE OF THOSE HAIR MODELS ON TV! I ALSO ENDED UP BUYING THE HAIR MASK...INCREDIBLE! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> I got suckered into buying this at the mall. There is nothing like being in the middle of the mall and a hot guy wanting to straighten your hair (I&#x27;m pretty sure he was straight) and saying that nice hair is what guys remember about a girl. So I ended up paying 150 bucks for a hair straightener, this serum, and the conditioner. It was worth it!! My hair has never been so shiny and felt so strong. I love this stuff. And I like the way it smells. It may take some getting use to for some people because the scent is a little strong.</li>
    <li> After straightening my hair, I like to put this serum in my hair, and it leaves my hair really shiny, not where you would think it would be greasy, but as a healthy shine. My hair feels so soft after I put this product in, so everyone touches my hair haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t judge my title</li>
    <li> LOVE, love, LoVe the smell of this product!!!! It&#x27;s amazing! I put I in my hair after I get out of the shower or after I straighten my hair! It&#x27;s a serum for smoothing so don&#x27;t get it confused with a heat protectant!</li>
    <li> basically I use this stuff after a shower before I&#x27;m going to flat iron my hair. And make some of course hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> My hair is better now. This product saved my life. If you want to try, go ahead, I recommed this argan oil, it is easy to use and smells very good.</li>
    <li> My favorite flat iron!</li>
    <li> I think this would be okay but it has too much of a perfume scent. I do not wear perfume because strong smells affect me in a  negative way.  This product is good, except the scent. I usually use Moroccan oil but thought I would give this a shot for cost savings.</li>
    <li> I tried the tiny sample pack that they give you at the mall kiosk, and I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;So then I bought one online later and now I love to use it everyday before I blowdry my bleached blonde hair to help it not get to much damage. Then after it&#x27;s done being blown dry, I use it again before I use their hair straightner..love it!</li>
    <li> Herstyler Hair Serum With Vitamin E and Aloe Vera was exactly as discribed.  It really works good on my hair .  Not to heavy.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this stuff and it smooths away little hair and leaves it shiny! This is a good buy</li>
    <li> This hair serum is great! It is so good for you hair I put it in my hair while it&#x27;s still damp everyday after my shower and it makes it so soft and smooth! I&#x27;m already out and I will definately be buying more!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this product at the mall, which was being sold at one of the kiosks.  It is a fabulous product.  As an African-American female who has tried several products, this one won me over a million times.  It makes my hair very soft and gives it a nice shine.  The added plus is that it smells really good.  Note:  I use it right before blow drying my hair and again right before I press my hair with a straightening comb.  This product works so well, that my hair dresser is now using it for her other clients.</li>
    <li> I actually got to try a free sample of this at the mall one day and fell in love with it!  When I found it on amazon I could NOT pass it up!!  This stuff is amazing!!  The bottle does say a little bit goes a long way and it does!!  Do not use too much or else it looks like you never even took a shower - yuck!  I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> I had a this done a year ago I was happy when I left the salon but after I washed my hair I was not, Yes it left my hair softer for about 2 weeks but after that it was back to normal. It was a waste of money for my hair. I recently bought a new straigtening iron, curling iron, and hair care products and spent a forth of the price as I did on the Brazillina blow out and my hair is softer than it has ever been in my life. I was at the Mall and a salesman asked me to let him try his straitening iron on me, he took 17 minutes to straigten my hair that took me on average an hour and a half to straighten with my Chi Iron. I went ahead and purchased the products thinking in the back of my head \\&quot;man I just got taken\\&quot; But after using the products and the iron I was so happy. It took me 20 minutes to straighten my hair this has never happened for me. Like I said the products left my hair sooooo soft I can even run my hands through my hair and I can not stop. I am amazed. I would never waste my money getting a brazillian blow out again. If you want products that really work search for HER STYLER products, they have a website. You can also buy them on Amazon which is a lot cheaper. I have very course,thick, frizzy, and tight curls I have always hated my hair but now I love it. I dreaded straightening my hair before these products because it just took so long so I only did it about once a month or so but now I do it all the time. Good luck ladies I hope you take my advice</li>
    <li> This is very bad my hair was coming out from the roots my nice long hair had to be cut off cause it did not do what it said it would I&#x27;m very hurt by this still I know some people said it work for them but this is not good i hope know one had to put up with what i had to... I even have pics on how bad it was</li>
    <li> A tiny bit goes a long way - smells good.  I just really love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just love his product. I use it more on my ends because of dryness. I noticed a big difference, my hair has more shine and the ends aren&#x27;t as bad. Very Happy with it....</li>
    <li> I love this serum. It tame my fuzzy hair alot. It help my hair shiny and look healthy.</li>
    <li> This is AWESOME stuff for my hair. It makes my hair look and smell great when flat ironing.</li>
    <li> I must admit I fell for the mall scam and got my naturally curly hair done with the flat iron from a beautiful Russian girl who did a marvelous job selling her products.  I paid $165.00 for the flat iron and she gave me the shampoo, conditioner, and serum for \\&quot;Free.\\&quot;  Ha!  She also included coming back 5 times to get your hair done for again \\&quot;free.\\&quot;  I have yet to go back, but I too must admit that even though I overpaid for all of the above, it was worth it to find these products.  My hair has never looked and behaved so beautifully.  Now when I blow dry my hair straight, I almost don&#x27;t need the straightner it comes out so soft and shiny.  I just use the straightner to touch up certain spots.  I get so many compliments and have been told by numerous people that I look younger, if you can believe that from my hair just being straightened and shiny.  I&#x27;m 47 and was told I looked 10 years younger and one person said I looked like a teenager. &#x3D;)  I still like to wear my hair curly now and then, but with compliments like that I love my straight hair more!  You only need a small amount and it works wonders.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> it is not pure oil like I thought it was, go there really is no benefit in this oil</li>
    <li> This is great for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I happened to come across this product at the mall. Someone had actually left a product sample of this serum in the store where I work and the kiosk selling this serum and the hair straighteners were close by and a lot of people kept leaving the unwanted samples in the store. Instead of throwing them away I decided to try the serum since I was running out of my salon brand serum at home and fell in love with the first try. It smelled wonderful, didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all (just be sure not to dispense too much) and there was less frizz and usually my hair us all over the place and just won&#x27;t behave but this product helped calm it down and makes it look much healthier and shinier. I feel like I just stepped out of the salon after I&#x27;ve put the product on my hair. Definitely make a purchase of this product here on Amazon rather than wasting a fortune to purchase at the mall.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! I use it every time I straighten my hair and it doesn&#x27;t only protect my hair from being damaged but it also helps dry it and it smells really really good! It&#x27;s just perfect and the price is amazing and it last for a long time it&#x27;s pretty big. Thank you so much! Will definently shop here again.</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy hair that tends to frizz.  Over the years, I have tried many, many conditioners and styling products.  Some of them worked somewhat, but none of them ever got rid of the frizz without leaving my hair sticky or stiff, until now.  I love this stuff!  It completely eliminates the frizz and makes my hair soft and silky.  And I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair to smooth it.  I wash my hair at night, put three pumps of this stuff in my hair, comb it through, and put my hair in a pony tail.  In the morning, I take my hair down, comb it, and it&#x27;s smooth and lovely.  When the weather is humid, I spend a couple minutes going over it with a flat iron, but that&#x27;s it.  The only caveat is that this stuff smells pretty strongly of roses.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, very curly, fine hair. Functioanlyl, the results were great--didn&#x27;t make my hair look weighed down or give it that oily \\&quot;over conditioned\\&quot; look that almost always happens + no frizz or static remained. But it has a VERY STRONG perfume-y scent. That&#x27;ll keep me from using it on a daily basis,  because it&#x27;s too much, but if it wasn&#x27;t for that, it&#x27;d be a definite 5++ .</li>
    <li> I Love this product and will continue to buy it. It makes your hair feel like silk and managable LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This Serum is perfect for my hair. My hair is so soft and shiny once I flat iron it. Great product.</li>
    <li> Product okay, did not repeat</li>
    <li> This serum leave your hair silky and shiny.  Put it on the hair before applying your heating tools and it gives you shine without your hair being greasy and weighted down.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This Serum is exactly like the sample at the mall.  I was able to cancel my salon appointment for a Keratin Treatment now that I have this. My hair is very fine, colored, slightly wavy and always Frizzy the day it is washed. I could never wash my hair the same day I was going somewhere because even after taking so much time to flat iron it was always frizzy. I always had to wash my hair the night before. When I use the serum ( I use it on damp hair). I dry it and it only needs about 5 swipes with the flat iron on surface hair only and I am out the door!  I am placing an order for 4 more, everyone at work wants it. My bottle does NOT SAY MADE IN CHINA.</li>
    <li> I love the serum and use it daily. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Just the tiniest amount smooths and gives shine to my hair.  I have purchased more for my two daughters for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I like it! because my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy, best product so far that I been try. I am really happy.</li>
    <li> I just love how this makes my hair nice and shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel all oily I had to order 2 from amazon because the price at the mall is outrageous!</li>
    <li> This stuff works well. I prefer heat protector spray followed by a finishing spray, personally, this stiff goes on weird.</li>
    <li> This serum is perfect for curly hair. I have tried other products, and this one is superior. It makes my hair look great without looking greasy like some hair oil products can do. I received a bottle as a gift before purchasing this replacement bottle.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my mom, she loves it! I will be ordering from you all again!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It protects your hair when using hair dryer, straightener and curling irons!  It also gives your hair a healthy glow!</li>
    <li> So I apply this to my ends RIGHT after I shower and it always makes my hair much much more smoother when it dries. Since I&#x27;m a student, I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry or straighten and always have to air dry - with this serum I know that when I leave the house with wet hair, I won&#x27;t have a poof on my head 2 hours later.</li>
    <li> Item was purchased for my daughter to go along with her Royale Professional Straighener Iron.  She said it works wonderfully and smells awesome.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected, I would definitely recommend this product. Excellent product construction and it was packaged properly and securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this as a gift. They enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> I bought a herstyler straightener and it came with the small packets of the hair serum. When I ran out of it, I came here on Amazon to see if they sold it and I found it. I love it! It makes my hair super soft and shiny. It also takes away the friziness that I sometimes have. This doesn&#x27;t make my hair staticky.  I have medium thick hair. The best hair serum I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t use anything other products on my hair than this. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I got it as a free sample with my Herstyler straightener.  It smells great and works well.  I have big, thick hair and tried many hair serums; this one has been my favorite.  Even if I have used a little too much of it it doesn&#x27;t completely grease-lock and ruin your hair for the day.  Works great on both wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> It works just like another argan oil I had been using. I am glad I tried out something a little more affordable. :)</li>
    <li> The same as I expected</li>
    <li> This stuff has seriously tamed my frizzy hair. I apply it right after I towel my hair off when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Smell amazing like hair perfume n Got millions of compliments&lt;br /&gt;I totally Love this Herstyler Argan Oil Hair Serum !</li>
    <li> Received a free sample of this at a mall and got hooked on it.  A few drops is all you need.</li>
    <li> I love the way that it makes my hair very shiny and takes away the frizzes.  Makes my hair soft as smells good.  Also for the price of about $11 it is much  cheaper that the $75 at the mall</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Her Styler products. I have tried several and they are awesome and they smell terrific!</li>
    <li> After applying the product to my hair, and, then, straightening, my hair stays straight and frizz-free until I wash it.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipment!!! Works great on weaves for taming and detangling hair!!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use.</li>
    <li> Can you please check my other review on this product?  As you can see after ordering this one bottle, I love it so much I had to order more.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing. Never before have I been able to walk out of the house after my hair has manually dried. I&#x27;d either have to straighten it, or hope it was wavy enough to scrunch it with products and pray for asymmetry. No longer. One drop of this stuff is enough to create shiny, smooth, frizz free hair without grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that the smell is a bit..\\&quot;Masculine,\\&quot; and strong, but it fades soon enough. Small sacrifice for the wonders this stuff does. It has saved me so much time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Hair feels healthier, so much more shinier and styles better too!</li>
    <li> I love this product and a so glad that I can order it from Amazon.  I am never disappointed and the delivery time is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so smooth, silky and shiny! And seems to help prevent split ends when I use my flat iron. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  Helps control frizz and provides a coat of shine.  Use after flat ironing for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only needed on the ends.  Can weigh hair down if applied to roots.</li>
    <li> Must have for any woman!  It leaves hair shiny and unbelievably soft!  It has a wonderful scent to it as well.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after trying a lot of other products. It makes my hair soft and smooth and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair feel very soft.  I love it.  I would recommend this product to women with very dry hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I first became acquainted with it at a shopping mall when someone handed me a sample packet. It was a long while before I decided to give it a try. Really liked it. So I ordered a bottle which I have come to find goes a long ways. I like the results too. It leaves a nice finish in my hair. However, I think the fragrance is a bit strong and may be offensive to some, while others may actually like it--I mean admirers and not just the wearer. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel I made a good choice. It&#x27;s not to greasy but just right.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t do any thing to my hair.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a great product !! You only need a little bit goes a long way ..</li>
    <li> This serum is awesome!  i have curly hair that i straighten with a flat iron every day.  My hair is also color-treated ... so it is not in the best shape and i have used many products to try and make it healthy .. or at least \\&quot;appear\\&quot; healthy :) This serum makes my hair silky, shiny and it feels amazing!  After towel-drying, i use a couple of pumps and brush through my wet hair.  i blowdry it and then straighten.  I use one more light pump and distribute that through my hair for the final touch. It does not weigh your hair down or make it feel mucky.  It has a very, very light scent that is fresh and clean and not perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to thank the guy at the Herstyler kiosk i was walking by at the mall for trying to sell me his straight iron.  Although i said no to the straight iron, he was at least kind enough to give me a sample of this serum ... or i would have never known about it.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Packaging when shipped was ripped, other than that everything was good.  Received product in a timely fashion at a good value!</li>
    <li> Since I got it I&#x27;ve never had my hair feel so soft and healthy! Most of my split ends are gone! Plus I have a 2 year old daughter with fine hair that keeps breaking and since I&#x27;ve put it on her hair it&#x27;s been amazing to see the results.  Only down side was it leaked a little in packaging.</li>
    <li> This hair product has really made a difference in my hair. After only two uses u can&#x27;t even tell I have split ends. It smells so good too the smell stays with u even after you straighten your hair. :)</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll absolutely love the way that this hair serum smells, it&#x27;s light, fragrant, but pleasant on the nose.  The smell lasts all day ..... .  Now I don&#x27;t notice a difference or improvement in my hair&#x27;s structure, but because I love the way it smells, I&#x27;ll buy this time and time again :)  It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be with out this serum now!&lt;br /&gt;its amazing...leaved my hair so soft and shiny with out leaving it oily...i love it...&lt;br /&gt;i reccomend it especially if you have a frizz even after you use the hot iron!</li>
    <li> i ordered it for my daughter she is black and loves the way after a blow dry it smooths her hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth every penny...it&#x27;s magical. I have really thick hair and I use this before and after I dry my hair and it leaves my  hair feeling soft and smelling beautiful</li>
    <li> Really makes a difference in how my hair looks and feels without being greasy or unnatural. I don;t use it all the time, since it is expensive, but the price was much more reasonable from this vendor than other places I found it.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how shiny my hair looks!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with this product, especially because it is cheaper through Amazon and or through other websites recomended by them. This product not only helps straighten your hair but it also protects your hair from heat damage as well and it lasts all day long. You can also apply the hair serum to wet hair before you use the blow dryer to style your hair. When you use this herstyler product be sure to apply small amounts at a time, a little bit goes a long way. Although it is a small container, it does last.  I would recomend this product and use it again for myself.</li>
    <li> this stuff is so good when I use my styler this helps control my hair a lot better and makes my hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is fake or something. I got one as a gift from an actualy HerStyler booth and it was way different. While both have the same smell the &#x27;real&#x27; one had a more thicker texture and actually made my hair shine. Also, it lasted me for a year! This one not as thick and hardly made my hair shiner or less frizzier. Apart from that, it only lasted me 3 months!! Maybe it was just a one time thing. But I don&#x27;t reccomend buying from here. I&#x27;d rather use $35 or so bucks to buy the legitimate one that lasts me longer and is better.</li>
    <li> It is for my daughter. She uses it some. product is good and I used it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky and not at all oily.  Just use a tiny pea size amount. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is amazing in a bottle. My hair frizzy, thin, frizzy, dry, frizzy, and did I mention Frizzy. I couldn&#x27;t stand getting my hair done, within an hour of getting it done, it looked as if I was in the hot tub for an hour, it looked as if the style would have been nice if.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, upon walking in the mall I sprayed their sample in my hair, light feeling, automatically took out the frizz, gave it an instant shine, Mind you the hair was flat ironed and still looked frizzy, I applied this to the tips of my hair and wow!! then I went out for a half hour did vigor activity and you know what, my hair was still perfect! The shine is beautiful, doesn&#x27;t seem like it sits on your hair like some do. It also seems to just draw into the hair and make it silky, BETTER THAN BIOSILK, BETTER THAN CHI, BETTER WAY BETTER THAN JOHN FRIEDA, this is awesome. Yes it is pricey at $45 dollars plus tax. It is worth every penny though. If frizz is your problem and you have tried everything else, try this, buy this. Use before or after your heat service ( I do it after, and works every time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please leave a review for this product don&#x27;t let the secret stay bottled up!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this as I was leaving the mall, but I didn&#x27;t talk to the sales person at all so I had no idea what to expect. The next morning I put it in my damp hair after my shower and instantly, my hair felt extremely soft and silky. I was literally telling everyone to touch my hair. I was so happy to find the product on here and for an extremely great price. I use it every day after my shower and any time my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth as I would want it. Although it&#x27;s a serum, no matter how much I put on(although with this, a little goes a long way), my hair never gets oily. I have oily hair but haven&#x27;t had any problems with this. The scent is mild and pleasant. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 months and hardly even put a dent in it. The only thing I would suggest is putting a cap on this. I&#x27;ve read other reviews where half of the bottle was wasted because the pump bottle released product during shipping. I experienced this problem as well, except luckily, there was only about a pump or two wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I went to the mall and some lady was trying to sell me a curling iron and said she would give me a discount on this serum. Although I had some at home, I was curious as to how much she sold it for on it&#x27;s own. She told me this exact product went for $75!! Seriously, I didn&#x27;t have the heart to tell her I get my supply for under $10.</li>
    <li> This is very nice to give hair some structure, silky feeling and eliminates static fly aways. But be careful - a little goes a very long way. If you use too much, hair will be sticky and the only way to get rid of it is to wash it. I have shoulder length + hair and 4 pumps is plenty. My mother had thick, grey hair and she loved how it made her hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> This smoothing serum goes on light which is thought to find and has a unobtrusive fragrance which I appreciate.  It certainly does make my hair shiny but I wouldn&#x27;t say it necessarily smooths down flyaways.</li>
    <li> gentleman was trying to sell me the same size product @ xmas time for $75.00.  I knew if I researched it long enough I would find a better deal.  I love this stuff for my hair it really makes your hair feel great and brings more shine</li>
    <li> I had tried this at the mall and loved it so much I had to get some ($30 at the mall and only $15 on Amazon)! When I first got it, I think I used it wrong because I only used it on dry hair but then I read you need to do it on damp hair. So after I shower I use heat protectant and thn dry my hair a little so it is not dripping but still damp. Then I use one pump of Herstyler (I have long hair that goes farther than mid-back) and rub in both hands and then start from the bottom of my hair and work it up. Then I finish drying my hair and it is perfect! Sometimes I still add some after its dry if its particularly humid that day. I dye my hair a lot with bleach and so my hair is so frizzy and dry but this product fixes those problems. Also I have tried the Argan oil version as well and I like the regular stuff a lot more. It makes my fair less frizzy and it&#x27;s just better overall. You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
    <li> This stuff really makes my hair behave and it does a great job of protecting my hair from the flat-iron!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a little confused about this product.  It seems to be marketed under multiple names, and the one I bought from the mall is called &amp;#34;evalectric hair serum&amp;#34; AKA Evolution.  I have uploaded a picture of what my package looks like.  Exact same wording/ingredients, different packaging and HUGE price difference.  Luckily I know the person who used to sell these products so I paid $15.00 but the price at the mall is $75.00!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, If you read the ingredients carefully, yes vitamin E, argan oil, and a few silicones are in the mix, but that doesn&#x27;t explain the smell, which is very perfumey.  The product works OK but it makes me question the integrity of this hugely overpriced item if the ingredient list doesn&#x27;t at least say &amp;#34;fragrance.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Does not say vitamin E on Bottle, but everything was the same like the sample I got. It makes you hair shine.</li>
    <li> Will never use anything else when straightening my hair. It smells amazing and keeps the frizz away.</li>
    <li> If she uses this product, it must be good! Trust me with her experience and knowledge she knows what works!</li>
    <li> I hate running out of this hair product - it works great.  I keep buying it and the price is right too.</li>
    <li> Light, easy product. I feel like it protects from split ends,  and it makes my hair feel very soft. I like this product.</li>
    <li> Iove love this product make my hair and straight I recommend to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Good frizz serum. I put it in my hair after a shower and it&#x27;s not that great on wet hair but it works great with straightened hair.</li>
    <li> Se eu pudesse dar 10 estrelas eu daria. O produto chegou intacto, e o vendedor mandou dois saxes de amostra caso tivesse vazado.&lt;br /&gt;O cheiro &amp;eacute; maravilhoso, deixa o cabelo com brilho,macio. maravilhoso pra fazer escova e chapinha. A chapinha desliza e o cabelo j&amp;aacute; fica brilhando. Não &amp;eacute; gorduroso, e não deixa o cabelo pesado e com aspecto de sujo. Muito pelo contr&amp;aacute;rio, deixa o cabelo uma seda e cheiroso. Super recomendo</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this product at the mall and ordered it through Amazon. It makes hair feel soft, shiny silky and healthy looking. would recommend!</li>
    <li> I have soft curly hair that can be dry and sometimes frizz.  This product did not work for me and made no difference in my hair at all, even with air drying.  So disappointed since the reviews were so positive.  A slip inside the box asked to send info on negAtive experiences but gave no way to contact seller.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! It makes you&#x27;re hair feel super silky and makes it look shiny. Be careful not to use to much or it will make your hair look greasy! lThe seller also sent a note that explained that some of the hair serum leaked out while being shipped so they included some packaged samples of it to make up for the lost serum. I thought that was very thoughtful. I would definately buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!! Its light on my hair and gives a super shine without weighing it down...and it smells great :))</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this on Amazon for a MUCH cheaper price. About 5 years ago I was walking through the mall minding my own business when a sales rep for Hersyler pulled me over and straightened my hair. I fell in love and purchased the ($100 at that time) straightener and hair serum. While I feel kind of silly for buying the straightener (which still works by the way after so long and daily use) at $100 I am glad I was introduced to the serum. I love this serum, it makes my hair feel soft and not greasy at all like others. Every time I use it my boyfriend says my hair smells so good. It&#x27;s definitely a good deal on Amazon because when you buy from the seller it&#x27;s like 50-60 bucks.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it makes my hair smell and feel great.  Arrived as promised and in excellent condition.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells terrific but subtle and not overpowering. Expensive but u need only a couple drops .... And I have very thick shoulder length hair; African American. And when done massaging thru hair .... I rub on my elbows for extra measure! Know u will enjoy. Worth the money</li>
    <li> well, I got the product. but it was broken.and leaking inside of the packaging. it works for a while bit then just adds static to my hair??? I wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> - has a strong smell that is a bit chemical like, but tolerable&lt;br /&gt;- my hair length is approx 4&amp;#34; past my shoulders and it takes around 4 pumps of product to receive 3/4 coverage of medium dense hair&lt;br /&gt;- after continuous use, hair tends to get weighed down&lt;br /&gt;- price is okay--cheaper than what they sell it for at the mall kiosks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better, inexpensive and easier to apply product is garnier fructise spray on argan oil.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smell great!</li>
    <li> I was given a different serum, the plain one. I ordered argan oil hair serum. It&#x27;s suppose to come in 2 bottles but I was only given one.</li>
    <li> I have to say since I have been using this on my hair it&#x27;s so soft and smells wonderful stuff...</li>
    <li> The fist time I used this product I loved it , but for some reason the fragance after a while gives me a headache. I ended up giving it to someone else.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this stuff at the mall, and I tried it that night and I had to get some more. I put about 3 squirts in my hand and applied it to the mid-end parts of my hair when my hair was kind of damp. My hair is really long, goes down to my lower back. I don&#x27;t straighten it. Or blow dry it. Even when my hair air dries it&#x27;s smooth, shiny and not frizzy at all. AND it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair! It&#x27;s amaaazing. I definitely recommend getting this product. Oh.. and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I am always skeptical on hair products expecially if they do not advertise to multiple ethnic groups. But i bought this anyway via recommendation from Amazon and I love it. It works very well and the bottle is super cute. Thats a win win</li>
    <li> I bought it after reading some of the reviews and thought what the heck, I LOVE IT!!! Works great and smells great!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works. It makes my hair SO soft and shiny without making it greasy. It&#x27;s amazing what a difference my hair feels like with this in it. And the smell is sooooo good! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this hair product! I have naturally curly hair so it has a mind of its own. This product helps a lot when I straighten my hair. After I dry it I put this though my hair. A little goes along way. Use my flat iron. Its silky. When I wash and wear my curly hair, I still take a little and put it though my hair it tames it well especially in when the air has a lot of humidity. This product works well and smells great!!</li>
    <li> This is the only one hair product that actually works for me! I have a thin long hair. But it&#x27;s always freeze from the middle to bottom and flat in the top. My hair is also pretty damaged from straightening, curling, blow drying. I have tried many products like it&#x27;s 10 leave in conditioner, paul mitchell super skinny serum, garnier anti freeze serum, the popular Moroccan oil, redken anti snap leave in conditioner, sexy hair soy cocoa leave in conditioner, bed head after party, fekkai glossing cream, Crack leave in conditioner, etc. Yes, I have tried so many products. All of them works but not last all day long like this hairstyler serum. My hair turns very soft, very shiny, and no freeze at all. The smell is just like heaven. Absolutely no greasy or weight your hair down at all. My hair seems healthier, and softer everyday. I&#x27;m so glad that I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works best for me. Before, I used to like the Moroccan oil the most, but it turns out to be so much expensive compared to this magical serum. You should definitely try out since it&#x27;s pretty cheap. For those who are wondering about those products I bought. I recommend not to buy it&#x27;s 10 plus keratin leave in ( without keratin, it works better), sexy hair cocoa leave in, fekkai glossing cream, garnier, paul mitchell, redken anti snap. Those are products I think not worth the money.</li>
    <li> All I can say is wow. I acquired their brand of flat iron from my sister, I liked the results honestly. It was only a few days later when she gave me the bottle of the vitamin e serum that I was absolutely blown away by the two products together. I&#x27;m of mixed decent, white and african-american, and my hair from both parents has always been practically untameable and frizzy. I dye my hair regularly, my ends were still awful from when I bleached my hair, I never use relaxing products because I find them pointless and harmful and for a while I swore off almost every product available because they were all the same thick greasy mess in a bottle. That&#x27;s not the case with this product! After washing and conditioning I used their vitamin e serum along with a few  modest sprays of Guardian Angel flat iron protection and let my hair dry over night and into the next day. Even before I straightened, the softness, the lack of tangles, the smooth texture was unbelievable. I used their hair straightener and by the end of it I have come to the conclusion that my hair has never been more sleek, weightless, bouncy, soft and shiny.. I honestly cannot keep my hands off of it! It has never felt better or looked as beautiful. It takes care of most of the fly away strands, makes it a little harder to keep a style that involves curls, but I imagine that if you&#x27;re a hairspray loving girl that problem can be fixed. I honestly plan to stock up my closet with this product because it gives me the hair I&#x27;ve always wanted. Also the smell, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful and my boyfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I could not under any circumstances rave about a product more :) Best of luck to you if you try it out, I truly, honestly hope that you have as great of results as I did! The confidence that came from this bottle should be shared by all! lol :D</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product...she says that it works really good, smells good, and makes her hair very soft.  Highly recommended by my daughter.</li>
    <li> Product I got from Amazon was fake. It was opened, no cap and no effect that I experienced with real product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to actually find a product that makes my hair still look silky and shiny when I&#x27;m done blowdrying/straightening/teasing it. I&#x27;ve tried other serums and sprays, but my hair still ends up looking dull and straw-y. The kiosk worker forced this sample on me in the mall and after months of having it sit in my bathroom cabinet, I gave a great big sigh and used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed. Absolutely astounded. For once, my hair actually looked dynamite. The only downside is that the smell reminds me of my grandmother (then again, the Aveeno Smart Essentials Scrub immediately nostalgias me on my childhood). I think I can deal with that, though - the smell eventually fades, but the shine doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely wouldn&#x27;t pay the $50 mall price for this, but $12 at Amazon? You bet.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this serum makes my hair look and feel. I usually use professional serums and this one does just as good. I just hate that the shipping for this item is almost as much as the item itself!!!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and when it arrived the product was different than the one shown in the image.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone as it is different than the actual item.</li>
    <li> Serum is good, smells good and makes the hair shiny.  Packaging wasn&#x27;t great though...bottle leaked and so bottle wasn&#x27;t full upon arrival.</li>
    <li> We bought this along with the straightener that we bought our daughter.  They sell them in the mall, you can buy both at the same time.  When i ran out, I went to buy a bottle there, and they wanted 25 bucks.  Save money, shop here!</li>
    <li> I like the smell of this product, but it really didnt jump out at me as a miricale product or anything.  It somewhat tames frizz etc... but no more than any of my products bought at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> It was a little greasy and smelled like \\&quot;old lady products\\&quot; I think it may have made my hair more dry in some way. It also gave me bad acne in my scalp. If used lightly, one drop, to smooth fly always it can work but that&#x27;s about it. Did not get soft silky hair from this product!</li>
    <li> I have used several oil hair serums through out the years, and I must say this Argan Oil leaves your hair smooth and NOT greasy. I love this hair product!</li>
    <li> Got a small sample of the product and tried it and really liked it so had to get some more.  I have tried many products to assist in getting healthier hair and this one seems to beat all I have ever tried.  It is not only a great detangler when my hair is wet with only a small amount, but it adds a softness and sheen to my hair as well.  Another thing I really like is that it seems to eliminate most tangles after my hair is dry.  A person would think placing an oil on your hair would make it oily and heavy but I have had no such results.  It just makes my hair soft and manageable.  Loved the product and will continue to buy it.  I have bought several and given it to family and friends who have the same results as I do.  They are sold on the product as I am.  What more can you say?</li>
    <li> My hair has changed significantly and it shines like never before. Plus it has a great smell to it that is very addictive. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best serum I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried many. I have long, fine, frizzy hilited/colored hair. This product isn&#x27;t heavy and holds up to humidity. I wash and straighten my hair daily as well. I&#x27;ve read some reviews where customers ordered Vitamin E serum and received Argan Oil. I have both and see no difference at all in the texture, scent or performance of the product. There is a price difference, but considering the fact that this sells for $50 in the store and the company website, I&#x27;ll take Amazon price!</li>
    <li> Love the Her Styler Serum! I use it almost everyday and I can tell my hair is healthy day by day!</li>
    <li> I love this product , it&#x27;s not greasy at all and smells so good it makes you hair look like a million Dollar hair !!</li>
    <li> I also have been using this  product for at least the past three years or more and have found that it is a excellant product and keeps my hair moist and healthy looking with mininal breakage. I also found the price to also be much less than the same product I had purchased at local stores.  I will continue to order product from amazon when needed.</li>
    <li> I used the Herstyler serum after I blow dry/ straighten my hair. Basically after I apply heat to it. My hair smells amazing afterward but importantly, it looks healthier and shinier. If you have mild frizz after styling, this is a fantastic product. If your ends are a little dry and need a little help, I recommend as well. Only negative is that you sometimes have to apply more than once. My hair seems to drink it and then wants more. Not sure if that is an issue for anyone else but overall, I really like the product. Just remember not to be TOOOOO liberal with it or your hair could appear greasy. I have really long hair (almost to my butt) so I use two pumps, rub hands together and apply to my ends first, then work whatever is left to middle, then smooth down fly aways at top of head.</li>
    <li> I love this gel!! I have naturally curly hair and its hard to put a comb thru it, i tried this gel..the girl at the her style kiosk gave me a few samples, best stuff i ever used my hair is soft, the curls look awsome, and its easier to put a comb thru it!!! She even straightened my hair and did an awesome job!!!</li>
    <li> i have dry hair and yes this oil is very good for my type of hair...  I use this oil daily</li>
    <li> This is a light serum. It doesn&#x27;t make your&lt;br /&gt;hair feel oily. It has a clean and wonderful&lt;br /&gt;smell.  It&#x27;s great to use before you straighten&lt;br /&gt;your hair. It&#x27;s also good for your hands and&lt;br /&gt;feet.</li>
    <li> I only used a tiny bit as directed on my long, wavy, coarse hair which gets tangled and frizzy very easily.  This serum did help detangle my hair some so it was easier to comb out the knots, but it left my hair extremely greasy to the point that I had to re-wash my hair before I could leave the house.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair shiny at all, just greasy.</li>
    <li> This was a oiled down product, was not the original serum!</li>
    <li> This hair serum is by far better than any other serum I&#x27;ve ever used before. Beats biosilk AND Moroccan oil in my book. Smells great, smoothes down my fly-aways and I only have to use a tiny amount everyday (medium-long hair). Saw this product at the mall and they wanted over $65 for it. Thank goodness for amazon ;)</li>
    <li> I love this product and I was very pleased on how fast it was sent to me! Will definitly order again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is seriously amazing. I have naturally dry, coarse, thick, frizzy, extremely curly hair. In the summer I used to just wear my hair up or have my sister put it in braids because the humidity would just reverse the hours it took to straighten my hair. This product though, has made my hair softer and blocks the humidity so my hair looks flawless. I love it. I love it. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and frizzy hair.  This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found, especially when used with a flat iron.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It arrived very promptly.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling super soft and smells great.  A little goes a long way.  I have fine hair that I dye and frizz no longer a problem.</li>
    <li> i have naturally curly/coarse hair.  i&#x27;ve tried all types of hair serums and spray from biosilk to citrus shine and the list goes on.  this is by far my favorite hair serum!  here are my pros &amp; cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pro:&lt;br /&gt;- it has a nice light &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; scent that most liquid serums don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;- the formula is not too thick and not too thin&lt;br /&gt;- it isn&#x27;t greasy!&lt;br /&gt;- gives a natural sheen/shine to hair (not oily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- small size</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Helps save my hair from heat damage , smells great, and makes my hair shiny and soft!!!!! Love this product.</li>
    <li> Works like it should, got here on time, but best of all it cost WAY less than I found it anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I first tried this hair serum as a free sample from a mall salesman. When I looked at the pricing online to see what it sold for after loving the results, I found it to be $50 on the company website. Amazon is definitely offering a better deal! I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product thus far. The only thing I would add is if you&#x27;re in a dry/static environment, the serum doesn&#x27;t do much for stray flyaways. Otherwise it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This serum leave my hair silky and shiny. Shine without my hair being greasy. Smell is okay. Love it so far.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  On the one hand, it&#x27;s a great serum for my thick, dry hair.  It tames my hair nicely and makes it lustrous and shiny.  The caveat is the smell.  I can&#x27;t stand it.  I can&#x27;t quite place the scent, but it&#x27;s like a heavily perfumed musk.  It&#x27;s not a scent I would expect from a hair serum.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t smell very feminine at all.  It&#x27;s a smell I associate more with a man&#x27;s cologne or grooming product.  If you can, try to get your hands on a sample before ordering it outright.  I find the smell very strong and off-putting.  I won&#x27;t be using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it regularly, its amazing with my hair and gives it a shine that doesn&#x27;t look saturated by oil or gross and sticky. And when it&#x27;s all dried and damaged it heals it especially with the amount i have to straighten it. Love it will continue you to buy it as well as recommend the product itself.</li>
    <li> I have had this product years ago and didn&#x27;t know where to find it anymore but I had saved the bottle of it and I remember to search with amazon cause they have it all or at list is connected with any company to supply any products and my surprise was that I had find it and love it. this product is amazing, the reason I love it is cause it shines your hear untangle it get it very smooth and the gentle smell is just to perfect. I just believe is the best of the best.!!!</li>
    <li> I got this because the ingredients didn&#x27;t list fragrance. This stuff has the strongest smell. It is kind of herbal floral and perfume like. I can&#x27;t say much for the product because I couldn&#x27;t use it due the scent.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff smells really funky - like overripe fruit or something.  I can leave it in my hair for an hour or so for deep conditioning in a shower cap wrapped in a hot towel, but I can&#x27;t use it and go about my daily routine - or leave it on overnight.  Who wants stinky hair?  There are better Argan Oil products out there - or should I say better SMELLING.</li>
    <li> Nice and shiny to my hair</li>
    <li> The serum makes your hair smell so wonderful after application.  The softness is nice too, but the smell is so pleasing that I use this often just because the smell is so fresh and lasting.  A nice way to extend that short shower and shampoo!</li>
    <li> I dont flat iron my hair that much but these product helps alot when I want my hair look slick.</li>
    <li> use it without fail...every single day of my life!...will always use this and no other product compares...go on...try it!...it saved my hair from breaking and splitting and drying out.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The price was great and shipping was fast... I use it all the time and now I&#x27;m getting it from friends and family... Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This serum is great for humidity. Living in Texas there is nothing but that in the summers, has a great smell to it too!</li>
    <li> I am shocked by how strongly this smells.  I actually could smell the product before I even opened the pump!  I don&#x27;t mind mildly scented products - in fact, I often prefer a bit of a smell if it&#x27;s natural, citrusy, minty, mildly rose-scented, etc... I only tried one pump of this, and I have a headache from the cologne smell.  It&#x27;s hard to explain - it&#x27;s strange, because it&#x27;s called HerStyler, but I would almost characterize the fragrance as masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is a very beautiful bottle:  heavy glass, clear, and classy.  The serum itself doesn&#x27;t seem greasy or sticky.  Too bad it&#x27;s so obnoxiously scented!  I&#x27;m returning it immediately, no ifs, ands, or buts about it.</li>
    <li> I did not see the same results as the sample the HerStyler Rep gave me.  My hair did not have the shine and texture as the sample.  Also, Paradise never answered the questions I sent them.  The bottle had no cap and it leaked all over the box.  They do not seem to claim responsibility for any problems associated with my order.  I would not order from Paradise again.&lt;br /&gt;Very inconsistent in their advertising of the serum but they say it is all the same serum?&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than if ordered from HerStyler but they claim it is the same?</li>
    <li> I bought this because of all the excellent reviews.. I to have tried everything on my weak brittle dry hair (hypothyroid) I love the smell too !! Does not grease your hair or make it stringy looking.. Gave it shine and bounce !!  Try it , you won&#x27;t be sorry !</li>
    <li> As indicated by the title, smell is very subjective. Previous reviews note the smell to be \\&quot;great,\\&quot; however I find the smell to be very awful and \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;-like. In regards to how well the serum actually works, it did not work too well for me. I have very long, dark, and thick hair. I was hoping for the serum to soften up the ends and make my hair feel great and refreshed. But it did not do so. My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different. I feel like I simply put awful smelling perfume on my hair and felt self-conscience as a result [during the couple days I when I tried it]. Perhaps it works better for other hair types. No, I would not recommend this product to a friend, or any women for that matter.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this serum a 2 years ago when I got a free sample packet from the mall. Mind you I was very skeptical to use it, but I was curious. I had just had my first baby and my hair was extremely dry and damaged from the pregnancy, so I gave it a shot. I went back to the mall the next day and forked out $45 for a bottle, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I wish I had checked on Amazon first before I spent that much for one bottle. I will definitely be buying from here again.</li>
    <li> After lot of positive reviews , purchased this for my wife. she hates it . She looks so oily after applying this.</li>
    <li> Herstyler is an excellent product for protecting the hair from too much heat.  Used for more than a year now.  Product always arrive timely.</li>
    <li> I love this product. In the beginning, I only used it because my daughter opened the sample. After trying it, I was well pleased. My hair was soft and flowy. I saw a lady walking out of a salon and she commented on how pretty and healthy my hair looked. My press was two weeks old at the time. My true test will be against the midwest summer humidity. I will keep you posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of wisdom.. do not buy it from the mall.</li>
    <li> Love the Herstyler serum -- as prior reviews indicate, use only a tiny amount.  Great for shine, smoothness and helps to eliminate frizzies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product directly from Herstyler and it made my hair feel so soft, silky, and smell really good till it was time to wash it! So knowing this I took the chance and ordered a \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; one on Amazon, and ended up getting a leaked bottle when delivered, leaves my hair oily, and the smell only lasts while I apply it on my hair. It makes me think twice of what I&#x27;m actually putting on my hair the times I have to use it.....I fell in love with the REAL product. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Received a sample of this at the mall, I am VERY skeptical and told the guy there would be no way I would buy it without trying it on my daughters hair....WELL we put it on her hair, she has THE THICKEST HAIR EVER, and it is naturally tight curls, long and blond, but with African texture...everyone who has ever seen it says they have never seen anything like it, and I have to agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this made her hair so smooth and easy to comb through!!! amazing! but she does have to use more than the suggested amount.&lt;br /&gt;I use the regular amount</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! It&#x27;s not too greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I bought two bottles of this and one came broken. Amazon refunded my money, no questions asked!</li>
    <li> This product is the top hit when entering hair straightener. It does leave your hair soft and shiny, but there are better products for getting your hair STRAIGHT. I would not buy this again and rarely use it.</li>
    <li> This product has helped by hair so much! It fixed my split ends and made my hair have more shine to it and made it look alive; since before this product my hair looked dull and crusty. I will be buying this product again once I finish my first bottle!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same as the 50 stuff at the mall. I love this product. It makes my dry hair feel really silky</li>
