      <li>Love the smell from my childhood.</li>
      <li>I love using this product again.</li>
      <li>It works for most everything...</li>
      <li>You can pour it into a nalgene bottle for better packing, or just leave it like it is.</li>
      <li>Works awesome as a clarifying shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s used Prell shampoo for many, many years and enjoys the clean smell.  </li>
      <li>(I only need to use a pea-sized amount) make it the ideal for traveling.</li>
      <li>I felt much more comfortable of it not spilling during shipment.</li>
      <li>It is a clean soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a film, it works AWESOME when camping or outdoor living, and it packs VERY WELL (just like a big toothpaste tube).</li>
      <li>just a tiny dab does a great job of getting your hair clean.</li>
      <li>Nice to ADD ON to main order.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved Prell shampoo since I was a little girl 50 years ago and was glad to purchase it again after not being able to find it in any stores.  </li>
      <li>This cleans it all out lets you start all fresh!</li>
      <li>I wish someone made the original formula.</li>
      <li>I first received a free sample of this in the flight bag given me on a BOAC flight from Canada to England in 1951.</li>
      <li>Smells great, lathers, isn&#x27;t watered down.</li>
      <li>This version of Prell  always makes my hair squeaky clean on the first shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Sudsing action is okay</li>
      <li>Prell has a fresh smell that is not overpowering or perfume-like.</li>
      <li>The price is just right and</li>
      <li>The shampoo keeps my hair clean without too much perfume.  </li>
      <li>Also the smell of the product is pretty bad--it may be the same as the original smell when the product was released 50 years ago, but it needs to change to something more modern and nasal-friendly.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping</li>
      <li>The concentrate fits in the suitcase better than the big bottle</li>
      <li>so it is even MORE AFFORDABLE, actually, than about any comparison you can offer.</li>
      <li>There are too many other options on the market that have re-branded to modern times are available substitutes for this product.</li>
      <li>I miss this because a dab the size of a pea is enough to wash your hair with more lather than you really need.  </li>
      <li>Only a dab is required to wash my hair and it&#x27;s easy to pack.</li>
      <li>Really makes your hair feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; like in the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair clean &amp; not dry.</li>
      <li>I use this and prell gentle care.</li>
      <li>This really gets rid of all the build up from products on your hair.</li>
      <li>It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>I wish the old green bottle was back because the newer version of classic clean isn&#x27;t as good, which is why I just ordered two packs of the concentrate.</li>
      <li>This shampoo takes as much product to clean hair as does the regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>Not quite the same as the original product.  </li>
      <li>fragrance is much nicer than the new shampoos with scents of fruits and vegetables - I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like a salad!</li>
      <li>I thought a &amp;#34;Flash Back&amp;#34; product would be a great thing to use for travel since it takes up small space, but the configuration of the lid allows for leaking and popping open in luggage.  </li>
      <li>It still smells the same and leaves the hair squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>(I plan to live a while yet!)</li>
      <li>Not as I remembered when I used in high school in 1950&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>However, the shipping and handling made the cost of the Prell way too high.</li>
      <li>I use it everyday and love the scent.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo, but it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores anymore, especially if you want the concentrated stuff in the tube rather than the more liquid stuff in the larger container.</li>
      <li>I really like it as a guy, because it is one of the few soaps that do it all, and can be conveniently fit into your travel/shaving kit.  </li>
      <li>I love that the container is not big and clunky and so it fits in my little shower.</li>
      <li>Not concentrated like the old days.</li>
      <li>More like a thick goo instead of the old time gel.  </li>
      <li>Lathers &amp; Cleans the same as the older version.</li>
      <li>Looks small, but it is so concentrated you only use a dime size dollop in your hair then add more water for the cleanest hair in town.  </li>
      <li>The older version could be left uncapped with no such problem.  </li>
      <li>you can wash your hair with it, your body...even as a general handsoap if you want.</li>
      <li>I have used it to the almost total exclusion of all other shampoos ever since -- and at age 75 I still have a healthy head of hair with hardly any \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; in it.</li>

    <li> I thought a &amp;#34;Flash Back&amp;#34; product would be a great thing to use for travel since it takes up small space, but the configuration of the lid allows for leaking and popping open in luggage.  Also the smell of the product is pretty bad--it may be the same as the original smell when the product was released 50 years ago, but it needs to change to something more modern and nasal-friendly.  Sudsing action is okay and I believe it cleans the hair and scalp well, but the for the price and smell and packaging, I will not buy it again.  There are too many other options on the market that have re-branded to modern times are available substitutes for this product.</li>
    <li> I needed to ship shampoo to a man, and I thought this was great for its packaging.  I felt much more comfortable of it not spilling during shipment.</li>
    <li> This Prell Concentrate might not have quite the same fragrance as it did when P&amp;G owned this brand, but its close enough.</li>
    <li> I first received a free sample of this in the flight bag given me on a BOAC flight from Canada to England in 1951. I have used it to the almost total exclusion of all other shampoos ever since -- and at age 75 I still have a healthy head of hair with hardly any \\&quot;salt and pepper\\&quot; in it. Can I attribute that to the Prell Concentrate? No, but at the same time I cannot eliminate that as a contributing factor. All I know is that the tiniest drop (about the size of a garden pea) is all I use every morning in my shower. And now I am stocking up on another ten tubes -- each lasts me about 4 - 5 months! (I plan to live a while yet!)</li>
    <li> Prell is the onky shampoo that I like using  ut, unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. Tha k Goodness I found it here!</li>
    <li> Not as I remembered when I used in high school in 1950&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I am a retro freak, so I use a lot of pomade and wax and such in my hair. Other shampoos can&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;cut\\&quot; it. But, Prell can get most, if not all, of it out of my hair! I use this as a clarifying shampoo and follow it up with my tea tree shampoo, and my hair has never been softer. 5 stars!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo, but it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores anymore, especially if you want the concentrated stuff in the tube rather than the more liquid stuff in the larger container. The price is just right and just a tiny dab does a great job of getting your hair clean.</li>
    <li> love this formula.  Looks small, but it is so concentrated you only use a dime size dollop in your hair then add more water for the cleanest hair in town.  Very fast shipping</li>
    <li> Still the best for travel--concentrated and cleans satisfactorily.  I&#x27;ve been around most of the world with it.</li>
    <li> Hey where else can you get good inexpensive shampoo in a TUBE!</li>
    <li> I use this and prell gentle care. Smells great, lathers, isn&#x27;t watered down. I wish the old green bottle was back because the newer version of classic clean isn&#x27;t as good, which is why I just ordered two packs of the concentrate. It cleans every time. Has anyone noticed how watery shampoo has become? Not this. Too bad drug stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
    <li> I use the larger bottle of Prell for shampooing at home, but the small size and high concentration (I only need to use a pea-sized amount) make it the ideal for traveling.</li>
    <li> I have used Prell for years and years. The concentrate fits in the suitcase better than the big bottle and it last a long time because it only takes a little drop to lather up. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I wish someone made the original formula. That smelled nice. This is ew.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these smaller containers of Prell shampoo for his work travels.  He&#x27;s used Prell shampoo for many, many years and enjoys the clean smell.  I order the case of this smaller size so I always have it on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Prell shampoo since I was a little girl 50 years ago and was glad to purchase it again after not being able to find it in any stores.  However, the shipping and handling made the cost of the Prell way too high.</li>
    <li> This shampoo takes as much product to clean hair as does the regular shampoo. Concentrate does not distribute or lather well.</li>
    <li> Really makes your hair feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; like in the &amp;#34;old days&amp;#34;.  I love using this product again.</li>
    <li> This version of Prell  always makes my hair squeaky clean on the first shampoo.  I love that the container is not big and clunky and so it fits in my little shower.</li>
    <li> glad to find the concentrate, hubby&#x27;s favorite</li>
    <li> Works awesome as a clarifying shampoo, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair. I use it everyday and love the scent.</li>
    <li> It is concentrated so you don&#x27;t need much.  It works wonderfully and it is great for oily hair.  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Prell Concentrate for 40-years. It works for most everything...you can wash your hair with it, your body...even as a general handsoap if you want. It is actuallY CONCENTRATED, so a little goes a LONG WAY. It is affordable, too...so it is even MORE AFFORDABLE, actually, than about any comparison you can offer. It is a clean soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a film, it works AWESOME when camping or outdoor living, and it packs VERY WELL (just like a big toothpaste tube). You can pour it into a nalgene bottle for better packing, or just leave it like it is. I really like it as a guy, because it is one of the few soaps that do it all, and can be conveniently fit into your travel/shaving kit.  A must have, if you are a hunter, camper, or outdoor enthusiast! Doesn&#x27;t have a heavy-odor, like a lot of other things do, either.</li>
    <li> The tiniest amount lathers beautifully, making the cost worth it.  Easy to toss in the gym bag, and the scent is very nice - like the original we remember from years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is much nicer than the new shampoos with scents of fruits and vegetables - I don&#x27;t want my hair to smell like a salad!</li>
    <li> Love the smell from my childhood.</li>
    <li> This really gets rid of all the build up from products on your hair. This cleans it all out lets you start all fresh!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Prell for years.  The tubes of concentrate are increasingly hard to find.  One tube placed in my travel bag will last me for years.  The shampoo keeps my hair clean without too much perfume.  Only a dab is required to wash my hair and it&#x27;s easy to pack.</li>
    <li> I use the Prell concentrate when I travel since it takes up much less space because it is a concentrate. It is impossible to find in a brick and mortar store so I get it here. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Leaves hair clean &amp; not dry. Only need small amount. Good price.  Nice to ADD ON to main order.</li>
    <li> Not concentrated like the old days. Same thing as regular Prell shampoo.</li>
    <li> It still smells the same and leaves the hair squeaky clean.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> Not quite the same as the original product.  More like a thick goo instead of the old time gel.  If uncapped, product leaks out.  The older version could be left uncapped with no such problem.  Lathers &amp; Cleans the same as the older version.</li>
    <li> A wonderful product in a compact form, perfect for long trips.  I miss this because a dab the size of a pea is enough to wash your hair with more lather than you really need.  I wish they would re-issue it, but I doubt they will as even regular Prell shampoo is getting harder to find in stores.</li>
    <li> An excellent shampoo ... lathers well and rinses very clean. Prell has a fresh smell that is not overpowering or perfume-like. It does, indeed, just take a tiny bit in the palm of your hand to wash your hair. I would definitely recommend Prell and purchase again myself.</li>
