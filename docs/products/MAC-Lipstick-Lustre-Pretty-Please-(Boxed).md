### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Great!  </li>
      <li>What a perfect summer look for a fashionista.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>One would not HAVE to wear a lipgloss over it to get the sheen you want, It&#x27;s magnificent on its own.</li>
      <li>This is beautiful &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved mac products,</li>
      <li>Goes on fine ~ just not the perfect color for me.</li>
      <li>I love mac!</li>
      <li>This is the real deal and the color is beautiful .</li>
      <li>Very light in color nothing compared to the picture</li>
      <li>Love this, a very light color.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Glad that I  can purchase my favorite lipstick on-line.  </li>
      <li>buy it for sure.</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>are on top of a darker color for definition.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great lipstick if you&#x27;re looking for something sheer and light.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it would be light coverage.</li>
      <li>The color is a psty pink--too light.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to try MAC Lipstick in Lustre-Pretty Please color.</li>
      <li>Especially with bright eyeshadow</li>
      <li>Smells like vanilla and is a pretty light color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect kind of color just for your simple everyday wear!!</li>
      <li>Maybe that&#x27;s ok for a 12 year old girl who is playing dress up</li>
      <li>PRETTY PLEASE is a Lustre finish.</li>
      <li>I hope to see PRETTY PLEASE on all age groups this summer.</li>
      <li>A medium tan complexion and a nice neutral pink blush.</li>
      <li>I have used  MAC LIPGLASS over it for an extra sexy punch.</li>
      <li>fast fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The colour isnt very flattering</li>
      <li>Hoping for more of a matte neutral pink.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t look real on the skin.  </li>
      <li>color and very creamy.</li>
      <li>This lipstick has a lovely subtle pink color, and I can tell that it is authentic.</li>
      <li>I sometimes add a little gloss, and love the natural look.</li>
      <li>My lips are regularly pretty rosey colored and this definitely took the color out.</li>
      <li>This is the main reason why I hardly ever wear lipstick: I don&#x27;t like the chemical-like taste and smell that most lipsticks have.</li>
      <li>HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT, when I opened it it was all melted and when i twist it up and down it would just fall side to side</li>
      <li>If You want to add to a collection of neutrals OR you can only get one high end lipstick, then MAC PRETTY PLEASE Lipstick is an absolute MUST,  especially if your look for the day is a pinky neutral.</li>
      <li>this is over rated and a huge waste of my cosmetics budget.</li>
      <li>Very creamy consistency and very sheer.</li>
      <li>love it, just makes lips a little dry FYI</li>
      <li>Also, the lipstick is VERY sheer, and if your lips are chapped even a little, it will show all of the imperfections rather than smooth over them.</li>
      <li>I expected a light pink...</li>
      <li>although maybe it would&#x27;ve been ok as a base for a top coat of another lipstick..</li>
      <li>This is real lipstick and not a knock off like other sites.</li>
      <li>I would recommend spending a little more on a higher-end brand lipstick, or much less on a lip balm!</li>

<li> Honestly I expected the product to be less sheer</li>
<li> This was delivered in just a few short days as promised.</li>
<li> Not really my color,</li>
<li> It&#x27;s matte, flat and so pale</li>
<li> but I ll use as I will mix it with other shades.</li>
<li> The lipstick smelled very bad (old) and would not go smooth on my lips,  I could feel little crumbs.  </li>
<li> My personal opinion is not to have a deep dark bam in you face fake spray tan.</li>
<li> The color is a little brighter than pictured.</li>
<li> I felt like I wasted my money on a dollar store brand.  </li>
<li> Very pale but frost glow.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
<li> Seriously.</li>
<li> The lipstick&#x27;s staying power is weak, and one would have to reapply it on an hourly basis for the color to show.</li>
<li> I am a believe it or not, Proud to be Grandmother.</li>
<li> this was a weird color...</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s like a crappy fake lipstick!</li>
<li> ugly itty bitty bit of color and tastes bad.</li>
<li> However, I was disappointed in its staying power, which in my opinion, it has almost none.</li>
<li> I absolutely hate it and would never order it again.</li>
<li> Not to mention,  it looked horrible on my lips.</li>

    <li> This is the real deal and the color is beautiful . I like it by itself are on top of a darker color for definition. I will order more.</li>
    <li> love it, just makes lips a little dry FYI</li>
    <li> Very creamy consistency and very sheer. My lips are regularly pretty rosey colored and this definitely took the color out. It&#x27;s a great lipstick if you&#x27;re looking for something sheer and light. Not really my color, but I&#x27;ll use it. Especially with bright eyeshadow that I don&#x27;t want to clash with my lipstick.</li>
    <li> this is over rated and a huge waste of my cosmetics budget. ugly itty bitty bit of color and tastes bad.</li>
    <li> Not a replica . This is real lipstick and not a knock off like other sites. Thank you!! This was delivered in just a few short days as promised. Definitely would order from this user again!!!</li>
    <li> The color is a psty pink--too light.  Makes your lips look like you&#x27;ve been kissed by a ghost. Doesn&#x27;t look real on the skin.  It&#x27;s matte, flat and so pale it&#x27;s garish.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try MAC Lipstick in Lustre-Pretty Please color. However, I was disappointed in its staying power, which in my opinion, it has almost none. Also, I am not a fan of a &amp;#34;lipsticky&amp;#34; taste and smell. This is the main reason why I hardly ever wear lipstick: I don&#x27;t like the chemical-like taste and smell that most lipsticks have. This one is no exception. Also, the lipstick is VERY sheer, and if your lips are chapped even a little, it will show all of the imperfections rather than smooth over them. The lipstick&#x27;s staying power is weak, and one would have to reapply it on an hourly basis for the color to show. I regret spending $25 on it. I would recommend spending a little more on a higher-end brand lipstick, or much less on a lip balm! :)  The lipstick hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation, but again I haven&#x27;t used it but two times!</li>
    <li> This is beautiful &amp; I&#x27;ve always loved mac products, fast fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS. I repeat, DO NOT ORDER THIS! I didn&#x27;t realize it would be light coverage. I applied it and it was completely sheer. You can&#x27;t even tell I have anything on. But add a second coat and you look like a hooker! Seriously. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. My lips started to look glittery. Maybe that&#x27;s ok for a 12 year old girl who is playing dress up but this color is NOT for a grown woman. I absolutely hate it and would never order it again. Do not order this! Choose a different shade with PIGMENT!</li>
    <li> Gave this lipstick 3 stars because its a bit irredescent for me.  Hoping for more of a matte neutral pink.</li>
    <li> Great product. The color is a little brighter than pictured.</li>
    <li> The colour isnt very flattering but I ll use as I will mix it with other shades.</li>
    <li> Very pale but frost glow.&lt;br /&gt;Nice color and very creamy.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, she loves it!</li>
    <li> This lipstick has a lovely subtle pink color, and I can tell that it is authentic. I love mac! It&#x27;s hard to find a real one online and this seller definitely provides the product I wanted.</li>
    <li> Honestly I expected the product to be less sheer</li>
    <li> Goes on fine ~ just not the perfect color for me.</li>
    <li> If You want to add to a collection of neutrals OR you can only get one high end lipstick, then MAC PRETTY PLEASE Lipstick is an absolute MUST,  especially if your look for the day is a pinky neutral. PRETTY PLEASE is a Lustre finish. One would not HAVE to wear a lipgloss over it to get the sheen you want, It&#x27;s magnificent on its own. I have used  MAC LIPGLASS over it for an extra sexy punch. My personal opinion is not to have a deep dark bam in you face fake spray tan. A medium tan complexion and a nice neutral pink blush. What a perfect summer look for a fashionista. AAAAANNNNDDDD it tastes yummy like marshmallows too. (BTW) I am not a teen or twenties lady. I am a believe it or not, Proud to be Grandmother. I hope to see PRETTY PLEASE on all age groups this summer.</li>
    <li> The lipstick smelled very bad (old) and would not go smooth on my lips,  I could feel little crumbs.  Not to mention,  it looked horrible on my lips. I felt like I wasted my money on a dollar store brand.  Ended up giving it to a friend for $10.</li>
    <li> Great!  Just like the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s.  Glad that I  can purchase my favorite lipstick on-line.  With just one click.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect kind of color just for your simple everyday wear!! :) No extra gloss needed! Perfect! You won&#x27;t be upset!</li>
    <li> Love this, a very light color.  I sometimes add a little gloss, and love the natural look. buy it for sure.</li>
    <li> Smells like vanilla and is a pretty light color.</li>
    <li> this was a weird color...I expected a light pink...there was alot of white in it...I threw it away bc i just couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;use it..although maybe it would&#x27;ve been ok as a base for a top coat of another lipstick..</li>
    <li> Very light in color nothing compared to the picture</li>
    <li> HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT, when I opened it it was all melted and when i twist it up and down it would just fall side to side, it&#x27;s like a crappy fake lipstick!</li>
