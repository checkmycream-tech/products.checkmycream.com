      <li>Since I&#x27;ve used Sia Botanics products, I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin which I attribute completely to these products.</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this product because of my pores and my dark spots and let me just say this has been the best purchase in a very long time.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It stings after couple of seconds but this stuff is SO wonderful I will continue using it.  Not many other products out there that make my skin feel as good after use as this.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Doesn&#x27;t take much to cover face. Warms a little as dries. Left face feeling fresh and tingling after washed off.</li>
    <li> The mask has a fabulous smell and leaves your skin clean and smooth after each application.</li>
    <li> this stuff burns but after my skin feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling great</li>
    <li> I am a 55 year old women who has been using Sia Botanics products for several years now. The Pumpkin Enzyme mask is a great skin rejuvenator and smells so wonderful it&#x27;s hard to know whether you&#x27;re so supposed to eat it or use it on your face! My skin is radiant and soft after using this mask. Since I&#x27;ve used Sia Botanics products, I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin which I attribute completely to these products. I appreciate the quality of the products and all of the natural ingredients that go into them. I have never used skin care products that make my skin feel so \\&quot;happy\\&quot;. Though I am not one who generally submits reviews, I hope that with enough positive feedback this company will be around for a long time!</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL AND HOW MY FACE FELT AFTER I USED IT SO SOFT</li>
    <li> I loved it when I first used it. Smells good. Gentle  to my face didn&#x27;t tighten my skin and gurt. made my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it makes my face feel very smooth and clean.  Will keep using the product</li>
    <li> This is my first time using Sia Botanics.  I was looking for a face mask to help improve the tone of my skin and help reduce lines.  I saw this Pumpkin Enzyme mask and liked what I read in the description and the reviews were very positive.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the texture of the mask the minute I put it on.  It has a great fragrance.  I can tell this is a very nice quality product and am enjoying how it is making my skin feel.  I can only imagine how I will feel with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper as part of my skin routine.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I received it in exchange for my honest review and must say how really impressed I am. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and will definitely continue to use it in the future. I love the tingling sensation it gives, but I love even more how my face looks and feels afterwards. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with large, clogged pores. I have noticed a huge difference... My blackheads and pores seems to be minimizing. I have tried several products and nothing has helped till this. I&#x27;m so excited to finally find something that actually works!!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product smells and feels on my skin. It really smells like pumpkin pie which brings me right back to the holidays. It gives you a tingly sensation which is not overpowering and subsides after a while. I leave it on for about 20 minutes and afterwards my skin is very soft. I love how my skin feels and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Already feelin the difference my skin is so soft but I hate the but in sensation at first</li>
    <li> I heard about Sia  Botanics  product before and decided to give this mask a try. Now I love treating my skin every once in a while especially when I have hormonal break outs. This mask not only smoothed my skin right out but it shrunk my pores and lef r my skin feeling exfoliate without feeling damaging. It does sting for me a little bit however it is not a uncomfortable sting. It also didn&#x27;t stain my skin like I thought it would and to top everything off.....it smells like pumpkin pie. Defiantly recommend  this product. The company also wrote me a personal thank you note for purchasing.</li>
    <li> This mask is very refreshing. You will not believe how smooth and moist your face will feel after this mask. Love it!</li>
    <li> I just used this Pumpkin Enzyme Mask, very nice. Did have some tingling but I figured that was it working.&lt;br /&gt;I am seeing a difference in the pores and soft skin. I really like this, no bad smells and seeing results immediately.</li>
    <li> Love This Product, I am someone who has suffered with child and adult acne all my life and have tried so many different creams and solutions and medical peels. The medical peels hurt and make your skin so sensitive. I decided to purchase this product because of my pores and my dark spots and let me just say this has been the best purchase in a very long time. I have been using this product two times a week for about two weeks now and can already see a difference in the size of my pores and the texture of my skin. This is a fantastic alternative to the peels. I have not used it quite long enough to see how much of a difference it will make in the dark spots but I am very confident I will get the results I am looking for seeing what it has done already. It leaves my face feeling clean and smooth without feeling oily and without the redness. I love this product and will continue to purchase this.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff made my face very soft.  The only complaint is the size that it comes in only allows a few uses.</li>
    <li> This enzyme mask smells amazing - that&#x27;s the first thing you will notice when you open the jar!  It&#x27;s like a pumpkin pie only better.  I saw an immediate difference in my skin after only using it once. It was tingly like they said that it might be at first, but only briefly. Then, it sets in and you wait..... upon removal, my skin is now so very soft.  I received this product for my honest review.  I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future provided that it continues to make my skin feel the way that it does right now from just one use!!</li>
    <li> Your face feels quite clean  and velvety after using it, will keep using and see whether it improves the skin condition at all.</li>
    <li> When they say it tingles and heats, boy they are not kidding. After the first couple minutes I wasn&#x27;t sure I could keep it on, but it does subside within a few minutes. My face was pink when I took it off, but felt great. My pores looked way better, and it the mask smells great too.</li>
    <li> This mask smells yummy enough to eat.....don&#x27;t do that.  But do put it on your face.  When I first saw the jar I thought, ok I can get maybe five uses out of it, but I was wrong.  The consistency of this mask is thin so it takes very little to cover on your face. This jar will actually last a long time.  You can feel it tingle and the \\&quot;heat\\&quot; when you apply it but it is not unbearable and it settles down.  My skin glows after I use it. I can see the difference in my pores and skin texture, plus an improvement in fine lines. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling face mask ever. I cannot get over the smell. It smells just like pumpkin pie. Not only does it smell amazing, it works great. My face feels and looks refreshed and soft. Its just so great.</li>
    <li> I have used this only twice and already see a significant change in my skin. It is softer and has somewhat of a glow to it which my friends and boyfriend noticed almost instantly! Wonderful product. Also my mom has been using is too and she has noticed reduction in fine lines. We are going to look great for my sisters upcoming wedding. The only slight criticism I have is that there is a slight burn...but it does say so on the container so I was not taken by surprise. I have super sensitive skin so I thought it would be an issue and it wasn&#x27;t at all. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product does not smell good. I really did not like the thick consistency. The mask itself is pretty gentle on your face, however, I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but definitely not the best. I felt the differenece the mask had on my skin right away, but after a few days my skin returned to condition it was in before. Its good for short term and you can see an immediate change but its not something I will be considereing when changing my whole skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Smells pleasant. ...At first i felt like i was putting baby food on my face...but hey who hasnt had baby food on their face...lol...At first it did tingle..not sting...but kind of a hey im here kinda feeling...I left it on for 5 minutes and rinsed .My skin seemed brighter and pores seemed a little smaller. Will keep on using it  !! A win win !!</li>
    <li> My skin looks flawless and feels very smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I have small pores, and I don&#x27;t break out easily, so this was more to try to see if it could improve the overall feel of my face. I use skin peels and face masks regularly and this was awful smelling, (and I&#x27;m the white girl in the fur boots and pumpkin latte in hand). It wasn&#x27;t pleasant to wear. It tingled, but it was more a magic trick than doing anything. To top it off, my face was greasy after. I am sure that it works differently on different skin types, it just didn&#x27;t do anything to my own.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have terribly acne prone skin and was afraid of what this might do to my face. This is by far one of the most amazing skincare products I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m a big fan of this brand to begin with, but wow did they ever knock it out of the park with this one! I saw an immediate difference in my skin tone after only the first use. No negative side effects whatsoever. My skin literally glows! My complexion is clear, bright, and my face is super soft. As others have mentioned, the smell of this mask is delicious. It really smells edible! A little bit of this goes a long way, so honestly the price point is more than fair. I didn&#x27;t experience any of the burning others have mentioned, and I have insanely sensitive skin. The mask did tingle a bit, but nothing more. Do yourself a favor and purchase this immediately. You won&#x27;t be sorry you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****I received this product for my honest review*********</li>
    <li> I received this complimentary, but it is a wonderful product even if I had paid full price...Smell is great and leaves your face so soft.</li>
    <li> I gave this product only four stars, because my face seemed to have an allergic reaction with it. My face was really red and burned when I used this product, but the skin on my face is really sensitive. However, I know it is a great product for others, because I let my mom try it and she absolutely loves it. After just one use her skin was soft and glowing! My mom cannot wait to try Sia Botanics other products!</li>
