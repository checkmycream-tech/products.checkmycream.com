<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The cooling body cloths themselves are nice; shoppers should be aware that the resealable package of wipes is enclosed inside of the outer packaging. I&#x27;m not quite sure why. At approximately 3 X 5 inches, it&#x27;ll tuck easily into just about any handbag or (certainly) a gym bag. The wipes have a very light fragrance... nothing overpowering... and do both cool on contact and dry to a powder finish. For those of us who deal with occasional hot flashes, it&#x27;s a quick way to cool down. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using these wipes in your feminine area. Use on arms, neck, or chest would be safe.&lt;br /&gt;So what is the benefit of buying these wipes over other portable packages of wet wipes? You&#x27;ll dry more quickly and the powder feel afterwards is nice. You won&#x27;t feel wet and sticky (or oily) after using them. If you find them at a reduced price and/or have a coupon, I&#x27;d recommend the purchase. I received one free package in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> The best feature of these is their convenience.  Easily kept in a purse, luggage, drawer.  They have a nice, light scent that is reminiscent of a fresh shower.  They do provide a quick method to freshen up after exercise or hot flashes.</li>
    <li> Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths are an awesome addition to my Hot Flash Survival Kit. They instantly cool me down and add a refreshing scent and powdery fresh feel. Super easy to keep in my purse!  I would give them 5 stars if they were only a little larger, more the size of a baby wipe.</li>
    <li> A pleasant-smelling and conveinently-sized product.  The smell isn&#x27;t overly strong and dissipates quickly after applying using the supplied towelettes.  The towelettes come in a palm-sized resealable pouch that is easy to stick in a pocket or bag while traveling.  I used them to remove sweat after a vigorous sweaty walk.  The product worked well and left a slight powdery feel on my skin that was pleasant.  Works great for times when you can&#x27;t shower immediately and need a bit of refreshing.</li>
    <li> My husband is the kind of person who perspires quite heavily when doing odd jobs around the house.  Sometimes it isn&#x27;t convenient to take a second shower during the course of the day so he was happy to try these cloths.  He told me that he immediately felt cooler and refreshed and was able to wipe down well using only the one cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried one but I was not feeling heated at the time.  To me, it was a pleasant cool sensation but one where I felt dry afterwards instead of slightly damp like one might think after using a wipe cloth.  The fragrance was mild and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not use these cloths to merely wipe my hands clean as there are many less expensive cloths available for that.  However, if you need a quick and more serious clean up or cool down or if you need to freshen up midday for a meeting or other important occurrence, you should seriously consider trying one of the three fragrances of this body cloth.  I found that Refresh scent to be really pleasant.</li>
    <li> I see there are 3 different scents offered by this brand.  I&#x27;ve used 2.  I see no real difference between them.  As with the others, they have a slight scent, they are textured, they are large enough for most normal usage, and they have a refreshing zing to them as they are alcohol-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most wipes for the body, you have a lift tab with adhesive so you can re-seal.  It works well.  Try not to rub over very sensitive areas, and if you are sensitive I wouldn&#x27;t use them.  I compared the last batch I reviewed to Pampers baby wipes because, yes, I use them.  Sometimes toilet tissues fail.  They fail me often, due to a sensitive urinary tract.  I am taking Cipro right now because of it.  I try to wipe front to back, but my diet makes my digestive very active, and I am in the ladies room all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how your underarm perspiration and odor could be helped by these, as the make you squeaky clean.  I&#x27;m going to stick to baby wipes for my problem, and slip these into my purse which they are perfect for.  They are sort of costly, so not quite worth it for every day use.  Definitely, I am traveling with these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a shower is not convenient.  Camping or traveling are some of those times.  Also. I sit a lot as an artist and internet junkie.  I recommend these. They are worth you peace of mind.</li>
    <li> This is a very refreshing wipe for when you are hot or sticky.  One great selling point that the manufacturers do not promote, is that it&#x27;s great for hot flashes!  The cooling, refreshing effect leaves you feeling clean, cooled down, and very comfortable.  These are a wonderful, innovative idea, with the clean, powdery feeling left behind after wiping.  A real winner!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> i ride my bicycle a lot during the week. i use my refresh body cloths all the time to freshen up. they work great. the instructions say to only use them on your skin that has no open wounds or cuts and keep them away from your eyes. i always have them handy where ever i go. they are a good product.</li>
    <li> For some reason not everyone enjoys the smell of a sweaty bear. But you can&#x27;t always hop in the shower when the need arises. When traveling, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes worked better than I expected them to. Although about the size of one of those hand wipes that come with the BBQ, these are plusher and have a lot more, and much gentler, cleaning fluid. A quick wipe of the offending areas and the offensive smell is replaced by a subtle, powder smell. These are going in my bag for use on those long trips when I need a freshness reset.</li>
    <li> Our summers can be hot and humid in the Mid-Atlantic and sometimes you can get incredibly sweated just walking a couple of blocks when its in the 90s or breaks 100 degrees. I misunderstood initially thinking that these wipes were for after a workout, but they&#x27;re really more for the situation I just described when you need a quick &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; from the heat or some mild exercise, but don&#x27;t have time or access to a shower or restroom. They&#x27;re not a substitute for a shower, but they can help in a pinch when you&#x27;re feeling gross.</li>
    <li> I know these are popular. Not so much with me. In general, I am sensitive to strong smelling products and choose no scents or light scents. These cloths do not smell strong enough to give me a headache, which sometimes happens, but the scent stayed with me a long time. That could very well be a plus for some because I stopped by an older (72) in-law’s house on the way home, about four hours after I had used the cloth and he said I smelled “lovely.” The powder was not a big selling point for me either. Once wherever I had wiped (neck, shoulders and forearms) dried, my skin felt tight, and there was visible powder that I ended up brushing off. I am rating these as okay because I don’t hate them; I would use them in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and a lovely scent.  I&#x27;ve used this in the past, and I like to freshen up during the day and it is perfect for that.</li>
    <li> My wife loves these cloths</li>
    <li> Well first let me say that I LOVE THESE! They are great for some one like me who sweats A LOT and uses a fan constantly. They are cooling but also refreshing to the skin. My only complaint is that they need to be a bit bigger- I have very small hands and they just barely cover my hand.Making  them about twice the size would make them easier to use and allow you to wipe more of it body/skin. With this size I get only my face/neck and sometimes my arms and chest. I did however order them again because I can&#x27;t find them in any store- anywhere!  They have a nice scent like baby powder and leave a silky feeling. I&#x27;m sold but I&#x27;d like them bigger-- great concept!!</li>
    <li> These cloths are soooo refreshing!  They are great for wiping away perspiration and leaving you feel powdery dry and smooth.  Wonderful!  I wish they came in larger packs.</li>
    <li> Total refresh might be a bit strong given that these are fairly small towels, but they are refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Each 10-pack is palm-sized and resealable, making them ideal for travel or purses (or glove compartments or backpacks).&lt;br /&gt;-Towels are sturdy, and don&#x27;t shred when used vigorously.&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is trivial, maybe a bit of &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; and baby powder. Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-Afterward there&#x27;s a feeling of baby powder, likely the towel includes a hint of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None to report, except perhaps for the feminine packaging? Wet wipes are great for camping, travel, and lots of things. I think it&#x27;s silly that they have to be marketed as &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;for babies&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;for camping&amp;#34; to be sold. But that&#x27;s a minor gripe.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic if you lightly workout on your lunch hour but don&#x27;t have time to shower. They&#x27;re quick and easy to just refresh yourself before going back to work. My coworker has an amazing sense of smell and didn&#x27;t think I smelled sweaty when I returned. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d use them after my long run (a shower is SO much better then anyway), but they&#x27;re useful to keep in my gym bag for those light workouts and lack of time to shower.</li>
    <li> These are basically very soft wet wipes, except without that weird wet feeling. They smell very &amp;#34;chemical-y&amp;#34;, but once on the skin it leave a very light, fresh scent. It does dry into a nice, powder-like finish, and is super effective in a pinch. If you ever have to rush out somewhere after the gym and don&#x27;t have time to take a shower, these should be a staple in your bag or locker.</li>
    <li> I live in humid Florida and even though it&#x27;s been cooler here for the winter, it is still humid and I still  swear.  These cooling body cloths are nice to wipe down with while at work. I just pop into the restroom and wipe my chest and area&#x27;s that get damp and sweaty throughout the day.  Folds in skin, etc.  These places seem to harbor smell&#x27;s too and these wipes remove those smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no real detectable smell, just a fresh one that&#x27;s faint.  The wipes are not immensely big but they do the job.  They are wet enough with product to clean a rather big area.  My forehead sweats a lot in Florida and it&#x27;ll be nice to wipe down with these in the hotter weather as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.  Can throw package in purse and be on the way.</li>
    <li> But seriously, gals...this is a very nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a scent that doesn&#x27;t scream that you are wearing perfume, these disposable cloths are perfect for a quick refresh when you might not have time or access to soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;Just the right amount of moisture to feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;Hot flash to hot weather, and sized to tuck in a gym bag or purse.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used similar wipes that leave you feeling so sticky that you are almost worse than you were prior to using. Not as much of an issue with these.</li>
    <li> A little underwhelmed by this product. The chemicals work OK, leaving me clean and cool, though somewhat chemical smelling. The cloths are very small, maybe half the size of standard baby wipes. I needed half a dozen of these cloths to wipe myself down after a lunch hour workout.. Some competing adult products are much larger (and heavier duty) than baby wipes. I&#x27;m giving up on Ban and using the larger products instead.</li>
    <li> I love finding new uses for products.  I originally used the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths for “bathing” myself at work after walking during lunch.  Then I took the cloths home and my girlfriend, Tammy, suggested we use them after our nightly massages.  Then Tammy and my best friend Sue volunteered to baby sit Tammy’s grandniece, Clair, while her parents (Theresa and Scott) are opening up a new restaurant in Miami, Florida.  Fortunately, Sue is also my roommate.  It was convenient to move Clair’s crib into my office across from my bedroom.  Tammy is a heavy sleeper.  I’m a light sleeper.  Sue sleeps one floor below ours.  Guess who runs to Clair’s aid during the middle of the night when she begins screaming?  I’ve been using the Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths to clean up her messes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Restore scent smells great.  And Tammy and I do our best to restore Clair to her happy, lovable self.  The cloths themselves are truly wonderful.  They don’t sting or aggravate Clair’s flesh; they haven’t produced an allergic reaction during the week that we have been using them.  They arrived in a packet that I cut open at the top.  Inside is a re-sealable pouch that will help keep the cloths moist and fresh for up to forty-five days (according to the package).  I store these in a traveling bag along with Clair’s disposable diapers.  On nice days, we take Clair and the bag with us to a nearby park.  Theresa called the other night and said Scott and her are staying another week in Florida.  Thank goodness for Pampers diapers and Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths or we’d be looking for an orphanage.</li>
    <li> These are not that great of a wipe product at all. First of all, when you take one out and smell it, it smells exactly like those little alcohol pads at the drs office. You definitely smell the alcohol very strongly! There is an after smell (i may have made hhis term up? like an after taste,, but a smell instead, no other way to describe) of a very light scent, but the straight alcohol smell definitely over powers it. Alcohol is the second ingredient in the list, so that tells you something right there...  I am pretty sure you could effectively disinfect a wound with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are SMALL wipes. Less than half the size of a typical baby wipe. They fit inside the palm of your hand. They&#x27;re perforated as well, so they tear easy at any point on the wipe. They like to tear when trying to remove them from the pack and they like to tear when using them. If you have long nails, they poke through easily. Since they are small and perforated, they are not good for absorbing any sweat etc. I mean, they will absorb some, but don&#x27;t expect to use these if you&#x27;re a sweaty mess after the gym etc., unless you don&#x27;t mind using a whole package at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package says they are safe to use on your face. With all of that alcohol in the wipe, there is NO way I would be using these on my face. Wow! Absolutely would NOT use these on a baby or child either. The package says not to use on sensitive areas, so you won&#x27;t want to use these on your bottom, etc., and you won&#x27;t want to use them if you have sensitive skin or other sensitive areas in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, back to the alcohol smell - the odd thing is that once your skin dries after using these, you do smell more of the fragrance on your skin and not the alcohol, so that is a good thing. The scent is a cross between the smell of scented pads/tampons and baby powder - not a terrible smell, but definitely a feminine hygiene type of smell. Your skin does dry very quickly after using them, due to the alcohol content, and it is left smooth. Not sticky or tacky and no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t buy these, nor recommend them. You would get much more mileage out of a baby wipe or feminine wipes even. I could see using these specifically for underarms if you have a need to, but other than that I would not want to be using these regularly, or semi regularly on my skin because of the alcohol. If you have dry skin, I would definitely skip them - alcohol is the last thing you want to use on dry skin. It will dry it out even more and possibly cause irritation/redness. I don&#x27;t have dry skin, but when I used these randomly while trying them out, hours later I could tell where I used them because the skin was more dry. I was wanting to apply lotion and I usually only do that after my shower, so there was definitely a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am probably being slightly gracious with the 3 stars. My gut feeling was 2 stars, but the wipes redeemed themselves somewhat with the morphing scent (not smelling like alcohol after it dried on your skin). Another redeeming factor was the &amp;#34;powdersilk&amp;#34; feature advertised on he packaging. Your skin does feel somewhat satiny or powdery smooth after using them, so that is true advertising on their behalf with that. The cooling effect is somewhat true but only lasts a second or two. Again this effect is achieved with the alcohol content. You can achieve the same thing by using alcohol on a cotton ball.ntent, and it is left smooth. Not sticky or tacky and no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure I wouldn&#x27;t buy these, nor recommend them. You would get much more mileage out of a baby wipe or feminine wipes even.

    <li> I took these on a trip with me and they were convenient to have after a long plane ride. I would definitely take something like this on an international flight to use even while on the plane, that would be refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems it might be useful to keep these in the car, if you&#x27;re going to be out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each pack comes with 10 towels, which have a tear line so you could extend it to 20 uses if you need light refreshing. If you&#x27;ve sweat at all though, you&#x27;ll probably use a whole one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the question is... at roughly $.25 a wipe (depending on packaging etc.), is it worth the difference between this and, say, the $.02 a wipe Kirkland wipes? This is definitely a good travel size, a packet thin enough to fit in a purse, and I did like the scent, but I&#x27;m tempted to use the idea and put some normal wipes in a plastic baggie for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is: If you want these for the occasional use where you need to smell fresh, and/or need the convenient size, go for it. If you are looking for something to use every day or multiple times a day, where you can keep it at work or in your car, normal (cheaper) wipes (or a washcloth and some soap) will do just as well.</li>
    <li> This wipes are a great way to freshen up on the go.  They are soft, cool to the touch, and they have a great baby-powder scent.  I used them on my mother during her recent post-surgery hospital stay.  During her 7 day stay I tried a bunch of different wipes on her, but she like these the best.  She kept calling them, “the sweet ones.”</li>
    <li> There are many skin care products nowadays that use alcohol&#x27;s evaporation to provide a cooling effect.  These Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths do just that and also provide some cleansing and deodorizing.  The soft powder scent is light so both guys and gals may use it without overwhelming others nearby.  According to the manufacturer, these clothes are &amp;#34;Safe for use on the face&amp;#34; but my family and I have sensitive, dry skin so we didn&#x27;t use it to wipe our faces due to the alcohol (denatured) content.</li>
    <li> Love these!! I have a long commute to work and need to use the refresh cloths while waiting in line for a bus where is gets very warm!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s always nice to have a set of wipes on hand for when you get out of the gym, for traveling or just if you&#x27;re sweaty and don&#x27;t have a chance to take a shower any time soon. The Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths in Restore (I&#x27;m assuming it has to do something with the &#x27;powder-fresh&#x27; scent) are very convenient since they come in a resealable pouch that can easily fit in your purse, bag or glove compartment (the package states that it&#x27;s best to use them within 45 days after opening).&lt;br /&gt;They do a great job of helping to cool you down in large part because they contain a good bit of alcohol to them - the &#x27;powder-fresh&#x27; scent can&#x27;t quite mask that fact and it takes a couple of minutes for the alcohol scent to fade away. Also, the cloths aren&#x27;t that big - they&#x27;re not as big as baby wipes so if you really want to clean off you might need more than one, but they&#x27;re a bit thicker (and for some reason can be easily torn in half). They state that they&#x27;re gentle enough to be used on the face as well, but that would depend on how sensitive your face is, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, these are great to help cool you off and refresh when you&#x27;re on the run, just keep in mind that you might go through the pack a bit quickly.</li>
    <li> This is another product that as a younger male I had to give to my middle aged mother to review.  She states they do work to cool you down and they have a nice scent and leave the skin feeling silky.  They are small enough to easily stow in a purse or the car and the package can be resealed.  This would be a great product to bring along on a long trip for a quick freshen up  when a shower or bath will not be forthcoming right away.</li>
    <li> Those cooling cloths are great to stash in your purse or to take to the gym to freshen up quick. The cloths are small, but they offer a portable way to freshen up on the go.</li>
    <li> One reviewer noted that this product is best used by menopausal women. I did search the manufacturer&#x27;s website ... and, while I did not find that precise usage suggested, it does seem to be the case. Between the very small size (this is not a Handi-Wipe or a traditional cleansing cloth that you might get from Simple, Olay, or Burt&#x27;s Bees) and the strange sensation, it is more on the &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; side than the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; side (so, in that sense, the product name is spot-on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a cooling sensation, but there is a distinct smell that might be prohibitive for those with sensitives/allergies to fragrance or for those who are concerned about her perfume clashing with this odd scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are too small to use when traveling (a little packet of Burt&#x27;s Bees clothes are perfect for such moments), but I can envision that these might provide relief to women experiencing hot-flashes. In this sense, the price and the size would make a little more sense.</li>
    <li> Great product! 5/5 stars! These wipes come in handy after a workout, on a hot day or anytime you want to freshen up on the go! These wipes come sealed in a foil package to keep them moist. They have a refreshing mild scent and a great cooling feeling when you wipe them on your skin. Leaves skin feeling clean &amp; smelling fresh!!</li>
    <li> Need to refresh, but can&#x27;t take a bath? These Ban Total Refresh Restore Cooling Body Cloths are designed to cool you and make you feel clean. While they certainly give that sensation, my main gripe about these is all the chemicals they include in the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look: WATER, ALCOHOL DENAT., LAURYL METHACRYLATE/SODIUM METHACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, DIMETHICONE, DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL, NEOPENTYL GLYCOL DICAPRATE, METHYLPARABEN, ACRYLATES/C10-30 ALKYL ACRYLATE CROSSPOLYMER, ISOSTEARYL GLYCERYL ETHER, PEG-8, POLYSORBATE 60, PHENOXYETHANOL, FRAGRANCE, SODIUM CARBONATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of those are hard to pronounce and putting this directly on your skin makes you absorb all of that into your body. Can&#x27;t they make these kind of things with more natural ingredients?</li>
    <li> Why have I not heard of these things? These cooling cloths are perfect. PERFECT for women who have hot flashes. They really help cool you down quickly while wiping any perspiration that comes along with the hot flashes away. They come in a handy little pouch that fits inside my purse perfectly. I keep them in my purse for a quick cool down when I&#x27;m out and about trying to run errands while trying not to have a heat stroke, even in mid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice light powder scent that isn&#x27;t too strong. I will definitely be keeping a supply of these with me at all times. I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful they feel when in the middle of a hot flash.</li>
    <li> The Ban Total Refresh Cooling Body Cloths are basically a baby wipe turned body wipe for adults.  These are an improvement in that they are not as wet as baby wipes, which is a plus for their intended use.  Each cloth is about 4\\&quot;x6.\\&quot; They are two-ply in thickness but I found that each cloth can be separated into single ply for more coverage.  The PowderSilk technology refreshes your skin without leaving behind any sticky residue.  The scent is very subtle and does not linger, also a nice plus when you want to reapply cologne or perfume.  They are not effective enough to take the place of a shower after a workout but otherwise are a great convenience between meetings or when going from work to a dinner appointment.  A bit pricey per cloth but still worth keeping in a desk drawer, glove compartment or purse.</li>
