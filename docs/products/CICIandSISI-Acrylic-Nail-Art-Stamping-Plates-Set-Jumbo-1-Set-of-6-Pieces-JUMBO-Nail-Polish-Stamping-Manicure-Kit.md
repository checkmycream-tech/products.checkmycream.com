<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just received my plates and I am very happy with them. I love the case that holds them, and I got another stamper and scraper too. I will be buying the other sets too. The designs are very nice and the plates are well made.</li>
    <li> Stamping made easy. Easy to pick up image. No special polish required. Will be buying more.</li>
    <li> This was my first attempt at stamping and this kit is great! The stamp is good, I did use a credit card instead of the scraper and it worked even better. Very happy with it and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> These plates are amazing!  The case keeps them nice and safe during travel and there are so many designs to choose from.</li>
    <li> Good set of plates, and the images stamped pretty nicely.  I was concerned that I would have problems stamping the corner images, based on other reviews of this set, but there were no problems.  The stamper and scraper was discolored and defective, but I have many stampers so that didn&#x27;t really bother me too much.</li>
    <li> I love love this stamping plates. They work perfectly fine for me. Great price. Awesome quality.</li>
    <li> Good quality products!!</li>
    <li> Cute designs, easy to use, the only thing is that I bought another stamp (KONAD), just because I&#x27;ve tried it before and I think it&#x27;s the best one out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert at nails, but can get some pretty neat mani&#x27;s out of these. The images are bigger than my nails, so I have to measure and place carefully, but for the price, I&#x27;m very pleased with how many designs are included.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it... Don&#x27;t forget to take off the blue film before using</li>
    <li> Received this for christmas and I can&#x27;t wait to use it. It comes with 6 VERY sturdy and we&#x27;ll made plates, a scraper, and stamper. There are TONS of options for any liking. I&#x27;m so happy with this and will be something I keep forever!</li>
    <li> never worked well for me, the plates are not deep enough for the polish to sink into</li>
    <li> The actual stencils are fine, but the plastic sleeves of the carrying case are all torn and damaged.</li>
    <li> I recieved this for Christmas and I absolutely love the stamp set. There are so many designs which always makes it difficult to decide which design to choose. At first I did struggle, but that&#x27;s because I had never use one before. I looked at videos on YouTube and practice on how to use it until eventually I got the hang of it. Now I can change designs anytime I want during the week because of how easy it is to use.  Oh and to add I purchase this with the Konad Nail Art Double Ended Stamper And Scraper after reading the reviews. The rubber comes off the stamper that is included in with the design plates, so I was relieved to had order the Konad as backup.</li>
    <li> Love these. They are great to use. Have a good depth and great patterns.</li>
    <li> Came in on time, and it&#x27;ll take a while to get the hang of it but it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
    <li> The book holding the plates is surprisingly good quality. The plates have been really durable and there is a great variety of patterns. The stamp itself is conversely cheap and fell apart by the third use. A little super glue fixed it but I would recommend buying a better stamp to go with it.</li>
    <li> What can I say. .awesome plates. . Has holiday art in them too which I didn&#x27;t notice when I purchased And with prime delivery option... cant get Any better</li>
    <li> This one is perfect!! A little practice and you will be stamping in no time. The stamper comes apart easily but I can work with that!!</li>
    <li> Nice stamps! But the scraper doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job properly. I have a try a few times to get it right.</li>
    <li> Ordered this with amazon prime 2 day shipment had a minor delay of one more day i was very excited to get this saw some good reviews n some bad. Personally the package came in great not damaged i stamped every image on paper to see which one did not stamp i had heard some were difficult. It kinda was but bcuz it all depends which nail polish u use n what dirrection u pull ur excess polish of. I use my debit card to do so so that i can maintain my product like new much longer with no scratches or dents. The only thing i hated of this product very very much was the stamper it self. Its very sticky gewy rubber. I buffed it with a nail buffer to take the shine away heard it works best like that but it smodged my image or it pulled up the plate along with the image bcuz of its sticky. So i used my salon express stamper since its the only one i have but plan to order the rectangle stamper to pick up the full image i have picture sry if its poor quality</li>
    <li> Look elsewhere, the designs in the plates are too shallow and the stamper is just crap. I need my money back.</li>
    <li> all these stamps come out clear and detailed. good quality stamps...but i wouldn&#x27;t use the stamper. i used the konad stamper.</li>
    <li> Packaged arrived on time. Each plate was amazing. Stamping was a charm was easy to transfer. Will be ordering the other sets as well.</li>
    <li> I love nail art and I am always on the look out for new plate.  These plates a bigger that I thought they would be and the images are large enough the cover my nails.  I have small nail beds so this isn&#x27;t an issue for me most of the time.  I like that the plates ar in a cute storage holder to make traveling with them and keeping them organized easy.  You don&#x27;t have to buy something extra !</li>
    <li> First time purchasing stamping set. So far it is awesome!</li>
    <li> Love it great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have purchased a variety of plates, all kinds of different brands. And these are by far some of the best plates. Not only are the images crisp but there is a large variety of images to choose from. The price tag is a little high but overall nice plates.</li>
    <li> I like the plate but they are too big for my nail bed.  I suggest you measure your nail bed before you purchase any stamp plates.</li>
    <li> Cute and neat setup. But there are some patterns that I guess are to small, and the pattern doesn&#x27;t go on the stamp thingy :/</li>
    <li> Pretty nice plates with a variety of images. I just realized that they&#x27;re supposed to come with a stamper and mine lacked one so I cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> This plates are amazing they came on time the only thing that I not happy is because three of them were scratched</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! I use it very often. I just wish it had a chevron &amp; animal print patterns.</li>
    <li> fantastic stamping set! this is my first set and I was able to stamp like a pro on my first try! great product, stamper and squeegee thing!</li>
    <li> overall great kit. minus the scraper, you&#x27;re better off using an old credit card.  but even with the credit card you have to make sure to clean it off after each use or the stamp won&#x27;t come out well.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL nail stamping plates! A wide variety of designs to fit all types of stamping needs! If you like to stamp all 10 nails, or just an accent nail, this kit will work great for you! The stamper that comes with it is also GREAT!! CiCi &amp; SiSi quality NEVER disappoints! Delivery was speedy!</li>
    <li> I just got my stamping plates and i must say that is really awesome, i was a little bit scared because i didn&#x27;t know if i had the RIGHT nail polish, why do i say this? well if you go to any supermarket and you see a small, cheap stamping plates set, it come with a tiny nail polish and it says &amp;#34;use stamping nail polish&amp;#34; and i didn&#x27;t know if what i had was right or not, but now that i have my stamping plates, I KNOW, well, at the beginning i started using the stamping plates with light weight nail polish and it DID NOT WORK, because the nail polish was so light that was drying almost instantly on the plates and didn&#x27;t stick on the  applicator,, i tried pure ice nail polish, sally Hansen,  B.S.N, L.A Colors nail polish, non of then worked; what actually worked was a thick nail polish that at the beginning i didn&#x27;t like because was too thick BUT NOW  I DEFINITELY LOVE IT BECAUSE IS VERY USEFUL, the nail polish that worked 100% was: KLEANCOLOR NAIL LACQUER, if you buy this nail polish in Walmart is $2.99 and if you get it online is about $1.00 the bottle, so if your nail polishes didn&#x27;t work with this product, try Kleancolor nail polishes, enjoy!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend friend for her birthday and she said she loves it, stamp great, loves the images!</li>
    <li> Great stamping plates with lots of fun designs.</li>
    <li> These plates are pretty good; the images on plate 01 were a bit too shallow to good lifts, but the others worked really well. The images are much prettier and crisper than I expected, and I like that as a whole the set aren&#x27;t &#x27;themed&#x27;--they&#x27;ll work well for lots of occasions.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also impressed that they came with a little vinyl/leatherette case, which was a classy thing to do. The stamper they included is nice and squishy but will need some buffing before using. The scraper has a metal blade but I prefer using an old gift card so I won&#x27;t be using it anyway.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the set; pretty good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit on 2/8/14: I wrote the above a few weeks ago; since then I&#x27;ve noticed a real problem I didn&#x27;t really catch on to earlier. While the size of the full images is nice and generous, it seems that the patterns themselves have also been enlarged which means that you can&#x27;t get a good patterned effect if you have average to smaller nails. This makes some of the images unusable, and this is true for both both sets. Some of the patterns have been enlarged so much that whatever parts you can fit on your nails will still leave you unable to see the full pattern. Plate 07 in set 2, for example, has an image of a crescent moon--there is no way the entire moon will fit on any of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, most of the patterns work really well and I&#x27;m still happy with the purchase, but I&#x27;m taking off another star because of this issue.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this set. I have been changing my nail polish every couple of days just so I can do a different design. No instructions come with it but it is simple and easy to understand. Put nail polish on the design then take the scraper and scrape off the excess then put the sponge on the plate press down then put on your nail. If you want it to last longer out on a clear coat.</li>
    <li> No good product, the plates are very cool design, but to put the paint and press the stamp against it is not transferred to the seal. So it is not painted on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back!!</li>
    <li> Awsomeeeeee!!!! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the designs and it&#x27;s so easy to use. My eleven year old loves using also.:)</li>
    <li> Great product. I tested it and it worked perfectly. The only thing I do not like is the metal scraper. But it is a small thing you can fix with an old credit card.</li>
    <li> Thank you for such a great product. Highly recommended. These stamping plates look perfect with their own storage folders. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these stamping plates high quality</li>
    <li> Love these stamps!! never used stamps before this is a great starter kit!</li>
    <li> Great presentation of the product in its binder. The binder is sturdy and the plates are also sturdy.Will recomend it!</li>
    <li> set for me, a beginner to stamping and wanted a compact set. The case is VERY sturdy and of good quaility as well. I will be buying set #2 in the near future. Lovely product, the stamper and scraper work well. I do advise looking at stamping basics tutorials before passing judgement on plates!</li>
    <li> the item arrived after a month but I&#x27;m so happy now to own the item! tried it already and it&#x27;s so easy to use and you can make so many differents cool nail arts...thank you! 10/10</li>
    <li> This product is horrible. The polish comes right off the plate,(all of it). I&#x27;ve tried several different ways and it just doesn&#x27;t work. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t even go on the stamper. I feel like my money went right out the window with this. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT NICE NOT THE REGULAR  IMANAGE EASY TO LAYER LIKE  WATER MARBLE VERY EASY TO USE ETCHING PICKS UP WHOLE IMAINGE</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I was inspired by a nail stamp art I wanted to try out. The images came out clean and clear. I like that the set comes organized in a case and with a stamper and scraper.The extra stamper came in handy when I was making decals.</li>
    <li> So many choices of designs to choose from comes neatly packaged. Leather case holds up well and the plates are easy to clean. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone who loves doing their nails.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this product.... Its sooo worth every dollar..</li>
    <li> I will be buying more of these as they become available. They have really nice prints and it&#x27;s fun making new art on my nails. The case they come in is very nice too.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife and she loved them. I knew she wanted a stamping kit, but beyond that I just searched for one with great reviews. It&#x27;s well made, has lots of options, and she loves it, so...5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have used many different stamping discs in the past and I feel like I&#x27;ve gotten my technique for it down.  I always use pure acetone to clean the discs and the stamper between uses. I always make sure they&#x27;re dry and clean.  I use a plastic card to swipe off excess polish at an angle, etc.  I never have isses with Konad or the other misc discs I own but I just can&#x27;t get it to work with CICI&amp;SISI stamps.  I tried different designs, different polishes (I used WnW Black Creme, French White Creme, Sally Hansen Insta-Dri, OPI, Zoya, Konad, etc) and none of them work.  I used a few different stampers as well including the one included with the CICI&amp;SISI set and I get the same result every single time.  The stampers do not pick up the nail polish from the designs.  I think they may be too shallow like a couple of reviewers have mentioned.  I&#x27;m very disappointed because I really wanted to use a lot of the designs in this set.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m good at this but it don&#x27;t stamp well</li>
    <li> The images are gorgeous but most on the outside edges don&#x27;t pick up very well on the stamper,  it&#x27;s a shame. The ones that do pick up in the center of the plates do so very well and the designs are awesome. I feel it should be half the price because half the designs on each plate are usable.</li>
    <li> Did not come with the stamp tool have to buy it separately. So it&#x27;s deff over priced when u have to buy everything separately</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t stamp the art...doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Cici &amp; SiSi have the best stamping plates in my opinion and for the price you can not beat it! I love the packaging and the little binder they come in. Some of the actual sleeves that hold the plates can tear but that doesn&#x27;t effect how great the images are and the variety you get for such a great great price. Not to mention you also get a stamper, mine was marsh mellow squishy and a scraper. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn&#x27;t tried any of their plates they are so adorable and so many images to choose from!!!</li>
    <li> The set it&#x27;s really great, you can decorate your nails so easy and cute and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  Totally recommended</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a part of several nail stamping enthusiast groups in social media. Many of us are having the same problem with this set. The plates are not totally flat (&amp;#34;curled up&amp;#34; at the edges) so images on the corners and some along the sides do not transfer well (because you can&#x27;t scrape them properly, difficult to pick up cleanly, etc). Hope the manufacturer addresses this issue going forward.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing, I was a bit weary because it was a new brand and reviews were a bit up and down BUT I am so happy I got this set. When it first arrived, the packaging was just as stated: hard plastic that was easy to open with a small stamper and scraper and the few extra goodies. After opening and inspecting the plates, which were snuggly fit in the pockets, and having to take a few seconds to maneuver them out of, I was thoroughly impressed. I like the cardboard under it and the fact that it is a nice change (P.S. This is my first large plate) from what I am use to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, purposely, chose not to review until I stamped every last image (plate images will be posted under this page) and after doing that, all but one (179/180) of the images stamped. I tried stamping with the XL stamper, the accompanying mini stamper and the konad stamper and, I must say, the small accompanying stamper (once I swiped the gloss clean with acetone-based polish remover) works best (I tried it with my other plate and I loved it!). It is squishy, soft and the images pick up so much better and so easy. I will admit though, 2 of the 179 images I had to use the steel/iron scraper to get the image to pick up but otherwise, I used my plastic scraper so I dont scratch up the plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this collection of plates are amazing, easy to stamp and the detailing are amazing. I highly recommend. P.S. If someone could tell me how to get the image (plate 1, 5th down; left corner) to stamp I would greatly appreciate it.</li>
    <li> I like the designs on these plates. The problem is that the backing boards are too flexible, so the plates are getting bent/warped in delivery. I&#x27;m having trouble picking up images fully. I&#x27;m trying to leave them under something flat and heavy right now to see if that helps with the bending problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that they come with their own case. The stamper and scraper set are not very good though.</li>
    <li> The plates are awesome. I tried them out today after receiving them in the mail and they work great. They are easy to clean and the designs come out crisp. The only complaint that I have so far is the stamper I received with this set does not work at all, and is made out of really squishy rubber that does not pick up the polish, but I can&#x27;t complain too much because the plates and the book they come in are perfect so far!</li>
    <li> I am not happy with these nail stamp plates at all.  They engraving is so shallow that I can&#x27;t get the pattern to pick up at all.  Not worth the money I paid!</li>
    <li> These are some more wonderful stamping plates to own. They have awesome designs and never ending looks for your nails.</li>
    <li> I think they are so pretty and I&#x27;ve tested them out but I&#x27;m having trouble getting them to my nails. That&#x27;s user error. When I get a hang of this I don&#x27;t doubt they will be beautiful to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I removed 2 stars. The middle page was not attached to the other plastic pages. So I have to worry about loosing that page. As well when I watched youtube reviews and they showed extra empty pages in the back which was part of why I choose them for my first stamping plates. My book didn&#x27;t have any extra pages.</li>
    <li> I have both of the Cici&amp;Sisi sets and there are no duplicates between the two.  What there are is tons of full nail images for every occasion that are large enough to fit the longest length I will wear my nails.  They are beautifully etched and I haven&#x27;t had a problem getting a great transfer to the stamp, no matter what polish I use.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this stamper and I hate the metal scraper, but not enough to take any stars off for them.  The stamper is shiny and needs to be seriously buffed with a file if you are going to use it.  Find yourself a stamper you like and go crazy with these designs.</li>
    <li> there are several designs that I have tried that are not etched deep enough so they don&#x27;t stamp well.  There are a lot of cute designs and I havent tried too many of them yet.</li>
    <li> as pretty and beautiful as expected and more, easy to use, variety of shapes is wide. truly unique piece and  excuisite</li>
    <li> I love this stamping set and I like the designs on these plates.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, not always get a perfect stamping.&lt;br /&gt;For now I have only tried a few designs, so I can not judge correctly</li>
    <li> I love this!!! I love the way my nails look now because of my stamping set :) with the help of YouTube I was able to get the hang of the nail stamping down!</li>
    <li> this a another nice set...I look forward to more sets from you nice and fair price for the contents of the kit</li>
    <li> Reviews sound more like advertising. I got these and wanted to love them but they just don&#x27;t work for me. Images are awesome but they need to work on the quality still. Images in the center are ok, the ones on the side(around) I can&#x27;t even scrape them. I follow people on YouTube and girl had the same problem(I wish I watched it before I purchase) also another blogger(FB) had the same problem. All I&#x27;m saying is dont just belive these reviews. Do some research and then decide. I hope this people make these plates better so I can repurchase. I will keep an eye on them and bloggers reviews.</li>
    <li> Amazing deal!! I LOVE it.. Original &amp; good quality images in a handy organizer along with the stamper &amp; scraper... That&#x27;s just awesome...&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is the cute owl couple on plate 2 where the smaller owl is just a blob with no details &amp; it&#x27;s not only my set that had this issue. Many of my nail stamping buddies on FB had the same issue... Hope they can put the fixed image in a future set as it&#x27;s adorable... Looking forward to more sets from this company :)</li>
    <li> New to stamping and I&#x27;m happy to say that these plates are amazing! Exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;m looking forward to purchasing more plates!</li>
    <li> These plates are excellent! 215 images (yes I counted them lol) and they are well etched. I love these and recommend them highly!!</li>
    <li> I love love love it .... my first stamping plate set and its pretty awesome thank you. .. this arrive 2 days before the scheduled date</li>
    <li> Super fun, works great, easy to use!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t miss this collection, it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite set of plates. They work so well. I don&#x27;t use any special polish. I have used sally hanson extreme wear or wet and wild and it really, really works well  Plate 1 is my fave, but they all work so well.  Didn&#x27;t get the stickers,  and there was only six pages. This was a surprise as youtube vids show ten pages. But it works so well, so who cares.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, good quality of stamps (neither too deep nor too shallow etched). All plates are flat and not bended so also the corner pictures pick up without problems.</li>
    <li> it is a very nice stamping set especially for a beginner , don&#x27;t like the stamper but the plates are great</li>
    <li> There is a large variety of stamps in this set. It was easy to pick up the image I wanted and transfer it to my nail. It is actually fun to look good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m already watching for Set 3 to be created.</li>
    <li> Wonderful they&#x27;re really awesome. Excellent transfer stamping plates. And the stamper is jist amazing. Please let me know if you have a set number 3.</li>
    <li> NIce plates! Designs pick up easily.</li>
    <li> I really like the stamping patterns on this set and the stamper itself is incredible. It&#x27;s nice and squishy so picking up the image from the plate and stamping it on the nail is super easy and does a great job. Just make sure to clean the plate and stamper after each pick up or else it won&#x27;t pick up the entire image for the next nail. Also, I haven&#x27;t been using the scraper that came with it just an old plastic one that I had because this one has metal and I was afraid it was going to scratch it. The only downside was that the product name on the back got stuck to the plastic pouch for all of the plates. It won&#x27;t affect the quality of the stamping it&#x27;s just a little aesthetically unpleasant. Other than that it&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
    <li> Great set! Lots of nice designs. Came in a nice little book with plastic sleeves for each plate. The stamper that comes with the set is junk (would not pick up the polish from the plate) but I got a Konad stamper and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> best ever I&#x27;ve got in past. deff need to get this if you like your nails to be awesome :P</li>
    <li> These plates came as advertised, in their own little pleather carrying case.They feel sturdy and solid, and they&#x27;re an awesome selection of designs. I&#x27;ve been doing my nails once or twice a day since I got these plates because there are just so many designs I want to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images are also etched pretty deeply, so you get a complete image when you stamp, especially if you&#x27;re using stamping polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> I have had these plates for couple weeks now and I absolutely love them, the images I have used so far stamp very well. I am very pleased with this set, only con is that I didn&#x27;t get the decal stickers shown in picture but that is okay, will be getting the pink set soon, also the stamper that comes with the set works great just remember to prime it before using cause it has a shiny coat on it. This set is highly recommended to any beginner.</li>
    <li> These stamps are great! There is a fantastic variety and I love the booklet they come in. There are 6 pages of them.</li>
    <li> Gifted to daughter. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I love the unique designs and just how well made these plates are. I have cheeky, red angel, pueen,gals, konad, and a few non brand plates, and now these and to be honest with you I truly believe these plates are the same quality of konad and cheeky. I love them so much, and the best part is that the designs do not resemble any of my other plates. People keep complaining about the corner images but here is something I tried and that could perhaps help.First of all do not apply too much nail polish when before scraping and when you scrape do so towards the outside of the plate meaning towards the corner (you do not wanna have to scrape over it more than once since that will cause residue nail polish to be picked up with the image in the stamper) and if you have too much nail polish left then quickly remove the excess left in the corner with a cotton ball (wet in acetone) and then pick it up with your stamper or pick it up and once on the stamper with a piece of tape remove the excess the image is clean of extra nail polish. The rest of the images are no problem and work great. Now as for the stamper I cleaned it with acetone until it was not shiny and it worked perfect however it does not pick up the corner images, therefore I used my ebay xl stamper for the corner images and  problem solved. I like the fact that the stamper is actually good and its head does not fall off like my xl stamper and it is silicone which is a plus. Now as for the scraper gosh a disappointment every time I tried it unless I did it super hard it did not work and since I don&#x27;t like scratched plates I just used an old card. And how great is it that it includes a case?....love it and they are good quality. Anyways totally recommend them. Love you CiCi and SiSi now. By the way both sets are great just depends what images you like the most I got both and love them. For more reviews on the plates go on YouTube and type cici and sisi nail plates and you can see many reviews and decide from there.</li>
    <li> I bought both set 1 &amp; 2 and really like them both.  the scraper is metal so I don&#x27;t use it but the stamper is very good.&lt;br /&gt;All images worked for me.. I probably tried 30 or so.&lt;br /&gt;Everything fits perfectly in the case.  Works well and had larger designs that filled my nail... I have large hands so many other brands images look very small or don&#x27;t cover the whole nail when intended to.&lt;br /&gt;If you can&#x27;t splurge for both sets get the white one as I believe it is more universal.</li>
    <li> Nice plates I haven&#x27;t had any problems using. I found the stamper takes a bit of prep to work and its still not my favorite stamper. The packaging is fantastic, and I&#x27;m not terribly impressed by most packaging.  I do wish they sold the plate holders on their own I have other plates in similar size and would love to have plate holder for them .</li>
    <li> I have also had a chance to use many of the images that came with this set and am in love with this one too. I have multiple brands of image plates and these are my first Cici&amp;Sisi. They have moved up to the top of my collection because every single image stamps beautifully. My previous favorite brand has plates that are hit and miss as far as image quality, some would stamp flawlessly and other won&#x27;t stamp at all. I can&#x27;t wait to order whatever they are cooking up for us stamping girls next.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try this stamping set so I got it. It has interesting designs. The quality is good and it&#x27;s worth the price. Highly recommended for those who&#x27;s hobby is nail designs!</li>
    <li> Edges are a bit bent making pu of the entire image a bit difficult sometimes impossible. Other images pu great</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about these stamping plates. Extra large stamp is great for all applications. Unlimited creativity ! Great quality!</li>
    <li> I first seen these plates on YouTube, I knew then I just had to find them for myself. The price wasn&#x27;t bad, and they looked amazing. When they arrived I immediately had to try each plate for myself to see how well made the images were, I used the stamper that came with them ,not so well. I ended up using my own favorite stamper, but I won&#x27;t give up trying the little stamper that came with the kit. The plates are well etched and stamp great, also came in its own cute case. Over all this is a wonderful product that I recommend any stamp lover to buy.</li>
    <li> I love this nail stamping kit. I use an old iTunes gift card to swipe instead of the one included and a lint roller to remove the extra polish off the stamp once I&#x27;ve stamped my nail. I don&#x27;t like how much polish is left in my skin around my nail (that&#x27;s just how stamping goes) but I am working on a solution for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As was said in other reviews left, some of the images don&#x27;t transfer well. (My two little Owls on the branch is one) but to be honest I don&#x27;t see myself using those ones and there are so many other ones that I really like, I don&#x27;t mind having a few (that I didn&#x27;t care for anyways) that don&#x27;t work... It was a great deal for the price, gives you lots of design options, stamper works well and plates clean off easy(sparkly polishes take a little more running to get clean. The printed logo on the back comes off/smears when acetone gets on it. Not that it effects it.  I really like that it came with a case and a sleeve for each plates. Keeps them stored nicely and don&#x27;t have to worry about them get scratched up.  Also, some of my platest are warped a bit. But if you put your polish on and then hold the plate down with one hand (fingers spread out to flatten corner that has curved) and swipe with the other (do the same when picking up the image with the stamper) the image comes out nicely still....just some things to be aware of. I thought my experience might help others not get so frustrated...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super like this set. I have had it for 4 months, I use it often. Finish off with Seche Vite Fast Dry TopCoat - it&#x27;s AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price. I have some issues with a few of the designs getting a good transfer.  LOTS of designs for the $, and love that they come in a leather book.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good. New designs I have not seen on other nail stamping kits. Some of the designs were not quite as deeply etched as I would have liked, but still usable.</li>
    <li> the plates and packaging is really great but i did not receive the scraper or water decals as advertised. the holder for the plates is decent quality but the individual plastic sheets are somewhat inconsistant with some sheets open in the front and some open in the back. ive watched some yiu tube videos regarding this set and some people have even gotten more than 6 plastic sheets. 4 stars due to inconsistancy. the plates are beautiful and they work well. this set is perfevt for the novice and experienced stamping enthusiantist.</li>
    <li> These plates are great. There is so much to choose from I didn&#x27;t know where to start. It will take me quite a while to do all the designs with hundreds of variations.</li>
    <li> Love it also my owl image has a face not previous review that said it didn&#x27;t cons: they seem to cheap out and take decals extra pages on holder, all images are crisp and detail</li>
    <li> love this entire set i get so many compliments when i stamp with any one of these plates</li>
    <li> Love everything about this.</li>
    <li> This set is great for beginners in terms of the quantity and variety of images you get.  Generally most sets are on here are duped or similar to other sets.  This set actually has some unique images.  However if you are a beginner you may have a hard time getting these to work for you.  Some people have said they received bad sets and some have great.  I myself have bought this set twice and found some variation but for the most part they are the same.  The etching isn&#x27;t as deep as Moyou, but it is not shallow like the problematic Bundle Monster sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found it is very dependent on the type of scraper/stamper/polish you use.  A flexible type of scraper or old credit card used as a scraper should work better than metal.  I used a soft but firm stamper not as hard as Konad.  For polish I&#x27;ve used the special stamping polishes.  I have tried other polishes not made for stamping and results varied.  The special polishes worked best.  All that being said you might still have issues with corner images.  I think most of the problems stem from the hard plastic holding the metal plate.  It does not sit as flat as it should.  I just kinda bent/flexed it until it laid more flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please not that in Set 1 there is a one defective image.  It is the owl image.  I believe its Plate #2.  The smaller owl has no face.  I have contacted the seller and they said they would speak to the manufacturer.  Issue may be resolved in future batches.  Please let us know if it is as I&#x27;d like to get mine replaced!</li>
    <li> Great design variety! They come in a sturdy carrying case in a nice little box with a free scrapper and stamp. You gotta move fast!! But these are easy to use. This was my first stamping set, and I&#x27;m inlove!! Very easy to clean as well! I recommend!</li>
    <li> This has been my first time ever stamping my nails, but it doesn&#x27;t seem too difficult to use. It has so many amazing designs, and once I figured out how to use it properly, the stamps of my first time came out pretty clean! I&#x27;m so excited to use these!</li>
    <li> The plastic holders have \\&quot;melted\\&quot; so now and the cici&amp;sisi logo is imprinted all over the plastic, and there were no extra stickers or decals with it like the description says. The images are pretty, but I have some difficulties picking up from the edge where the plate curves.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to test all of the images yet, but I&#x27;ve had fairly good results so far.  I did notice that a lot of the corner images are very hard to scrape because of a natural bend in the plate.  Hoping that I can sort that out to make them useable.  The grey silicone stamper did need to be cleaned thoroughly because it was completely covered in a slimy oil, and then prepped rather extensively with a file.  Love the case and that it has slots for up to three additional plates.</li>
    <li> Awesome plates, very well engraved. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Love this, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> fast shipping - great quality</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of the CICI&amp;SISI collections.  I recommend it.  People ooh and ahh over my nails when I use these.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous and fun to mess around with :)</li>
    <li> This is great Item ,, I love my collection .!</li>
    <li> fast shipping even in this blizzard. packaged nice has everything described.</li>
    <li> transferred well, fast shipping</li>
    <li> These plate are ok and there is a good variety of designs but some, especially the designs along the plate edges don&#x27;t stamp very well.</li>
    <li> i love it great product</li>
    <li> wonderful plates, only issue is that plastic folders were damaged</li>
    <li> Had an issue with delivery....I think it was isolated.  Set is awesome!  Great mix of images, awesome case as well.  Will order more of the collections!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to stamp. Images come out clear. I bought both the sets. Definitely worth it for the price. Works perfect with a Konad stamper - bought at the same time as these sets. When I first tried nail art stamping it used to take me an hour to get it right and I used to get very upset and frustrated. This morning I timed the stamping process - 2 mins for my left hand to be done. It helps to watch the nail art stamping videos on You tube - you can pick up great stamping methods. So you don&#x27;t need to stress and feel alone. The ladies on the videos are kind enough to take time out of their busy schedules to help others - which is amazing. It also shows you how to &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; the cici&amp;sisi stamper that comes with this set and how to get it to work. I do my nails three times a week and sometimes get my nails to match my dress colour. The Konad double end stamper is the best for these plates. It picks up the design clear, crisp and neat. Practice makes perfect. Watch the videos, honestly. It helped me so much. I hope this helps. Sheena from Johannesburg, South Africa.</li>
    <li> Plates are as described even though some of them have dark marks on them that was below the blue plastic wrapping. It&#x27;s no big deal since their meant for stamping. But the rubber stamper that came with it is so terrible. I have tried cleaning it with acetone, rubbing it with my fingers, etc and nothing works. I will have to purchase a new stamper and then try to use the plates. Right now their just collecting dust. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
    <li> Very nice selection of designs</li>
    <li> so happy with this purchase i have both sets!!</li>
    <li> very good product  my girlfriend love it</li>
    <li> It is just as described</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had time to stamp all the images but the ones I have came out perfectly. I am very happy with the set.</li>
    <li> This is my First Plate and I love it. Took 30 mins to do my first set. The quality is awesome. Just FYI, I had watched many Videos on how to do it and tips and tricks prior to buying. The case is Leather and all of the plates were great quality. Very Happy with my purchase! One of the tips was to prep the stamper with a Nail Buffer first which worked perfectly. Only down side was the scrapper, just use a card so you don&#x27;t scratch your plates. And do not use to much polish.</li>
    <li> Great set! I LOVE IT! Works beautifully!</li>
    <li> the scraper doesn&#x27;t work well... but otherwise its  ok. would definitely suggest fixing that!</li>
    <li> I am currently giving it 3 stars because I have not used them yet. I was a little disappointed  because one of the plastic holders for the stamp board was all cracked at the corners. I was a little upset because I really loved the quality of the book that holds all the stamp boards. I don&#x27;t understand how only one of the plastic covers is like that but it is :-( hopefully all the stamps work.</li>
    <li> This is my first stamping experience and my daughters and I played with this for hours!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this set, thinking about getting another.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all. Please don&#x27;t buy this product, its just wasting your money and time.&lt;br /&gt;The designs look pretty but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I am very happy having bought this particular set. It is a great set with lots of designs. The images are well etched, crisp and transfer well. Quite pleased.</li>
    <li> Love love love...so glad I bought these plates.</li>
    <li> Plates are nice and carrying case is good quality but the stamper and scraper are awful.  I just use an old hotel key as my scraper and I bought a new stamper that works really well.</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> They stamp work very well!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first set of stamping plates, and i absolutely love them. The shipping was really fast, got it within 5 days. Each plate image comes out really clear and transfers perfectly onto your nails. And the booklet cover is really cute too. I&#x27;ll most definitely be purchasing from them again!</li>
    <li> Packaging: This item was packaged really nicely. The stamper and scraper are secure in molded plastic above the set. The box that contains the set is just big enough to hold the set and stamper,  the outside of the box has the Cici &amp; Sisi name and logo in gold. Really nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamper &amp; Scraper: This set contains a basic stamper and scraper, nothing to write home about. The scraper is on the small side, and the stamper has a very high gloss that will not pick up images. For that reason this set is not ready to use straight away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stamp booklet &amp; sleeves: The booklet is white heavy vinyl with the Cici &amp; Sisi logo, as well. &amp;#34;Nail Art Stamping Plates&amp;#34; embossed on the front. The booklet has a tab that snaps closed. The sleeves are a clear plastic that each stamping plate slides into.*** I received my set and one of these pages was completely ripped apart at the top :( ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plates: There are 6 plates that contain all kinds of images! There are travel, abstract, music, Love, nature and animal images. ***One of my plates arrived with a tear in the protective film, and multiple scratches on the plate surface***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: All said this is a very nice set, that is nicely packaged. This set would make an awesome gift. However the fact that it came with absolutely no information regarding the set nor any instructions regarding use or care was very disappointing. I would&#x27;ve given 4 stars if my set had arrived in perfect condition. And would&#x27;ve given 5 stars had it arrived in perfect condition and with instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading :)</li>
    <li> I received two Jumbo sets for Christmas, and am very pleased with both. The designs are diverse and of multiple sizes so they work well on all sizes of nail. The enclosed scraper is great but, like ALL metal scrapers, will scratch the heck out of the plates so I use an old credit card instead. Both sets came with stampers that were creased from the packaging, rendering them unusable, however I emailed Cici &amp; Sisi Customer Service and they mailed me replacement stamper heads right away. Very impressed by their customer service! I&#x27;m definitely going to order stamping plates from them in the future- especially these jumbo sets with so many fun designs.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new at this but I really like the patterns in this set.  Plus it came with a case which I think is a big bonus!</li>
    <li> Wow! I am really impressed! The images I tried out stamped really well even the corner ones that so much people are having problems with.  I just scraped in a different direction and voila! A perfectly clear, beautiful image.  The stamper wasn&#x27;t so great even after wiping and filing away all the shiny residue.  It was inconsistent and time consuming to get a perfect image so I used my own stamper and it works fine. The plates are a little scratched but it didn&#x27;t flaw the images so Im really happy about that.  If anybody read the other reviews on these plates then Im sure you read about the owl image on plate 2, I was hoping it would be fixed by now but it still does not have a face. But, thats not a deal breaker for me, all the other images are great.  And the case is an extra bonus which Im also happy about.  Its really cute and I don&#x27;t have to worry about spending more money on buying a case for these.  Overall, a really great buy :)</li>
    <li> Are you tired of seeing the same old nail art stamping designs that get repeated on almost every set of plates you look at? Then you REALLY NEED both of the CICI &amp; SISI Jumbo sets! The plates are well etched with truly unique designs for all occasions &amp; artistic whimsy. They are mounted on a sturdy backing (similar to the xl Cheeky plates). Both sets come with a storage album that can hold 10 plates this size, a squishy stamper &amp; metal scrapper plus nail art stickers. If you love stamping on your nails, you will love having these fresh new designs that will set your nails apart from the boring!</li>
    <li> great product! have had issues so far, everything stamps great and etching are perfect. holding case is well made and I&#x27;ve even added plates that didn&#x27;t come with covering since there&#x27;s room to spare in each sleeve&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll will be buying other collections.&lt;br /&gt;Great for beginners to experts.&lt;br /&gt;stamper wasn&#x27;t too bad either, didn&#x27;t use scrapper and metal + metal &#x3D; scratches.</li>
    <li> These are such a fun set of stamps!  I also was not expecting the awesome case they came in!  Im in stamping heaven!  Only one or 2 out of a LOT of stamps don&#x27;t scrape as well as I would like.  Both are on a corner of a plate.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to received  Nail stamping plates but didn&#x27;t work at all for me, ive tried several times with different techniques and nothing seemed to work, tried lots of design from plates with different nail polish, konad stamping polish, stampers, credit cards, scraper. When tried to pick up images with stampers it didn&#x27;t transfer at all or were not clear or didn&#x27;t have full image same thing on the nail,  the images look nice but felt images were not deep enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like was the stamper because transfer so nice and crisp images from my other brand plates and looked beautiful with different nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like these plates but didn&#x27;t work at all,  I returned it already. maybe this set of plates came out bad.  Im not sure if I&#x27;ll try to order again another set again.</li>
    <li> its sooooo beautiful!!!! the size are perfect!! the desing are pretty!!!&lt;br /&gt;i love it!!!!!!!  i want more collecctions!!!! a lot .....!!!</li>
    <li> This set is spectacular. So much to choose from, at this price point. Keeps my clients entertained and overwhelmed. If you want to see something really funny, take a close up look at plate #5...the small designs down the middle. One of my clients was looking through the plates and said, &amp;#34;Who would want old people?&amp;#34; I was like, what? So I looked at it, and sure enough, there&#x27;s a design of two old people, hunched over, with a cane. Hilarious!!</li>
    <li> This was a whole lot of new experiences for me- for one thing this was my first experience with a jumbo plate ever, and I really like them, they are easier to sort through compared to the small disks and this is a new brand for me. The images are nice and wide, I had no issues with my thumbs, (I use a konad stamper which does not stretch the image out, not the soft squishy kind this comes with, I also did not use there scraper, I have a soft squishy one from Claire&#x27;s but I only use the soft squishy kind on pedicures) so you shouldn&#x27;t have any worries about fitting them on your fingers like some brands unless you have abnormally large nail beds. I bought them because I was kinda bored with what I had and was looking for new full nail designs to play with and this seemed like a good option because there are few single designs (only down the middle row.) They come in a nice book and what I found out is there color coded by set (my second set came today and that one has a pink book and pink backings.) I am glad I ordered the second set. I am real pleased and would definitely consider ordering more nail plates from this company in the future and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I received defective plates. The edge designs on every plate will not transfer because of being too shallow and warping on the backing. I have been trying since late February to resolve this issue. I followed the instructions on the insert that came with the plates, asking me to email them with any issues and they would help. No reply. Facebook commented them. They deleted it. Facebook messaged. They ignored it. I just now opted to ask a question on how to get resolution, literally begging them to help. They deleted it immediately. So here is my review. The designs are amazing. Shame they don&#x27;t work. I am a pro stamper, over 2 years experience, and am not one to leave negative reviews. I am nothing but satisfied with all of the other companies, and was very excited about this one. I am very disappointed, very let down, and stuck with 35 dollars wasted on useless plates. I wanted the other set, thankfully I didn&#x27;t order both at the same time as I planned. I will contact amazon with my issue from this point. Buyer beware. Some people are happy with theirs, some have same problem I do. Read all reviews, be advised. Wish I would have.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten these yet so not sure what to say about them. I look forward to seeing what they look like.</li>
    <li> Really nice and easy to use,  my daughter and my self, enjoyed doing our nails with all the different designs that the plates have.</li>
    <li> I received my stamping plates about a couple of weeks ago, and I wish I had not ordered them in the first place. Although the images are lovely, they are ALL too shallow to scrap the image cleanly. The ones that aren&#x27;t too shallow are warped so there is no way to even try. Waste of money, order from anywhere but here.</li>
    <li> I love these large and very unique design plates. They stamp crisp, come in a great holder and the designs are endless. Will be buying another set soon! Also, delivery was super speedy.</li>
    <li> So many designs to choose from!!</li>
    <li> helpful hint, take the blue plastic off. i thought that it was just blue plates, nope there is a protecter on it, im guessing for shipping? i tried to use this with it on and it did not work. annoyed that i spend money on something i thought was worthless, i decided its not gonna matter if i accidentally destroy it by picking at the plate, low and behold, the plastic came off (although kind of a pain to get off) so i tried it again and it worked!! i love it! there is a bunch of different designs to try!</li>
    <li> I was so excited and couldn&#x27;t wait to use these. Definitely a great product. There&#x27;s many stamps to choose from, and the stamper it comes with is good. I don&#x27;t like the scraper, and didn&#x27;t use it, because it&#x27;s metal and I&#x27;m afraid it will scratch my stamps and possibly ruin the image. (I used an old plastic gift card.) I will be purchasing all the sets.</li>
    <li> Plates are really good but the pouch they came in where all split very disappointed</li>
    <li> works perfect! highly recommend to any new stampers!</li>
    <li> I must be stupid. Because I have followed tutorials and directions. But my little batman&#x27;s ears don&#x27;t seem to want to go with the stamp. Ew. Cool concept though,</li>
    <li> Lovely set, nice large images  and a sturdy holding case. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The plates are nice; the only reason I didn&#x27;t giver a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;  was because the set came without the stickers as shown in the ad.  Other than that, it is a nice set to own.</li>
    <li> By far the best plates i have ever bought! They stamp amazing! I thought the stamper was going to be crappy, but it works pretty good too! The best part about it is that it&#x27;s grey and you can see both white and black stamping polish on the stamper!</li>
    <li> Images are pretty and unique. But some of them are not deep enough to make their designs.</li>
    <li> Love the plates!! Cute and large images. It doesn&#x27;t come with water decals as it was described in some youtube reviews. The stamper isn&#x27;t the best quality, once you file the shiny part off it works better but I&#x27;d get another stamper if this is the only one you have. I also love the fact that the plates come in this cute folder. This way they are protected and I can take them with me when I travel. I&#x27;d definitely order from them again.</li>
    <li> The actual plates are amazing they work great!!! I&#x27;ve tried other ones and this are the best! The stamper that came with it doesn&#x27;t work that well it has a weird material and it had like a weird indentation so I just ordered another stamper that would work for like 5 dollars, that&#x27;s why the 4 stars . I&#x27;ll definitely will order more since they have other colors and designs. I love how it&#x27;s like in a book so it&#x27;s easy to use and store. I&#x27;ll be buying more of these for gifts and for me!</li>
    <li> Mine was damaged. The stamper was gouged and not usable, the plates were scratched and the holder was worn. The packing was awful. Returned and did not re order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:I was given a full refund.</li>
    <li> Love these plates! Images are large enough to wrap around long and/or wide nails. I also own Konad and Bundle Monster plates, and CiciSisi are by far my favorite as they are always the easiest to work with. I&#x27;ve been able to grab images with a squishy or a stiff stamper, using opaque, special and regular polish. The squishy stamper it comes with is good for advance nail stamping technique as well. Can&#x27;t wait to buy another set.</li>
    <li> Very nice set! Good price.</li>
    <li> I love that they full nail stamps are large enough to fit my entire nail</li>
