<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently had surgery on my face and this covered up the bruises.  I also use it on my arms.  Having a garden and doing a lot of yard work you get pretty beat up, it covers beautifully, I mix the fair and medium together.  If you use it on your face inconjuction with your foundation, let it set.  And to be sure of the color match, I always put makeup on by a north facing window, it gives the worst light for you to be seen in, so if you look good in that light, you will look good in any light!</li>
    <li> I have tried many brands. But this one works the best. It is easy to apply, it covers better then I expected and stays on longer. The only thing they could improve is the sponge attached to the bottle, it falls off after a few uses. I use my hands to apply which I think helps it settle in.</li>
    <li> It went on like a makeup concealer it didn&#x27;t conceal very well and then the sponge would flake off if you press down too hard or used it too many times</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago.  I&#x27;m very self conscious about a couple bite marks and razor nicks on my legs.  I had tried this before only as a concealer on the scars.  That didn&#x27;t work well because the shade between my skin and this makes it noticeable.  Last night I decided to compare this and sally Hansen airbrush legs ( in tan) side by side on my legs.  I put this on my right leg from my knee to my ankles.  I did the same with the Sally Hansen.  I let both dry and went to bed.  Neither stained or rubbed off my white sheets (today&#x27;s laundry day anyway)&lt;br /&gt;The  sally Hansen may have been too dark because it made my legs look Orange in daylight.  This made my legs look ashyyt at night but was amazing during the day.  I actually couldn&#x27;t believe those were my legs.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased in how fast this was shipped, by the seller.  I do wish I would have ordered a darker shade, as it was much lighter than expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27; pretty good. You need to use it sparingly as it can get messy and look fake. I&#x27;ll no doubt buy it again. The price is right!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of leg make up, but this one was easy to apply (sponge applicator helped in spreading the make up quickly for even coverage).  The color is a nice medium/light tan which matched my leg tone.  It does not rub off easily and covers my bruises and spider veins!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have circulation issues in my ankles and feet. This covers without looking weird. I would recommend buying one shade darker than you normally are.</li>
    <li> Okay I have tried \\&quot;everything\\&quot; and I have blue and red spider veins and overall not perfect 49 year old legs.....&lt;br /&gt;Mix with a tiny bit of lotion (optional) and cover every area that you have flaws.  Apply a little at a time and rub it in, don&#x27;t forget the backs of your legs ladies!! I bought Medium color first and its a bit too fair for summer so I bought the TAN also, and I LOVE IT!  Stays on all day, does not easily transfer.  I used a bit of bronzing powder mixed with baby powder and dusted my legs with a big makeup brush after application because it can be a bit tacky.  No pantyhose for me this summer!! I wore it all day outside in the heat with shorts and it did not come off at all.  Washes off with soap and water. Ladies at work think I have perfect legs!!&lt;br /&gt;My advice: Buy it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Joan Rivers, you ROCK!!!</li>
    <li> First - a little background: I am a 54 year old caucasion woman who started getting spider veins beneath the knees about 20 years ago.  Every year they would get a bit worse.  I have had scleropathy, veinwave, and the foam injections, all with mixed results. So, now there are parts of my legs that are pretty clear, parts that are purply splotchy, and other areas with old and new spider veins.  Sigh...  let&#x27;s just say that I would not be comfortable going outside without some kind of cover-up on the lower part of my legs.  Like most women, my legs look their worst after a hot shower, but even as they cool, they are pretty splotchy looking.  I have tried all of the creams out there and this one is, by far, the best.  But, you need to know how to put it on.  I have tried various methods to make it look right.  This is what I do to get very nice, even, and natural/air-brushed coverage where all the flaws are still hidden:  first, I use a self-tanner on my legs.  I typically need to apply this on two subsequent nights to get the tan level I need (not too dark - just a nice light - medium golden color). Then, once I have that nice color on my legs, I can apply the cover-up cream (I use the Medium color).  What I first do is apply a light moisturizer to my legs.  This is a very important step - I use a light moisturizer in a bottle that has a pump (so the moisturizer I am using is not heavy-goopy). I apply the moisturizer sparingly on my legs.  That is, I do not apply tons of it, and what I do apply I spend time really rubbing in so that there is no tacky sensation when I touch my legs.  Then I apply the cover-up.  I do not use the sponge applicator!  I have tried doing this and it&#x27;s ridiculously hard.  Instead, I squirt a bit of the cover-up into one palm and apply it to my legs with the other hand.  I use up and down movements (not circular).  I don&#x27;t put tons of it on at once.  I do enough so that I can cover the front of one leg, then squirt out some more in my palm sothat I can do the sides, then squirt more to do the back. Then I do the knee area.  And then I repeat with the other leg.  I work relatively fast so that the cover-up does not dry on my leg too quickly, before I have had a chance to spread it around.  It is true that the cover-up will eventually clog up the hole beneath the sponge applicator, and that it will form hard crusty bits on the applicator that will end up getting into the cover up.  So, before using the cover up, I first clean off the surface of the sponge applicator.  Then I use an inexpensive plastic comb that has one of those long pointy handles, and I stick the point of the handle into the hole of the applicator to make sure it is not clogged up.  From start to finish, the entire process of doing my legs takes about 5 minutes.  When I am done, I wait around 10-15 minutes to dress so that the cover-up has a chance to dry.  Then I take a tissue and very lightly run it over my legs to get the surface stuff off.  When I am done, my legs look pretty flawless and natural.  However, there is one thing that does drive me a bit crazy - this stuff still gets all over the inside of my shorts when I put them on or take them off.  And it comes off on furniture and car seats.  And, if you bend down while wearing shorts, the color will get all over the back of your shorts. But I don&#x27;t know of any cover-up that does not do that. (BTW, this stuff does come out in the laundry so it does not stain clothing). I have tried various products and this one is definitely the most natural and attractive.  I have also tried the spray on stuff and it&#x27;s messy and does not give me the coverage that this does while still looking pretty natural in that air-brushed sort of way.  So, if you have tried this product with limited success, don&#x27;t give up just yet. You just need to perfect your method and it should definitely work.  It took me several tries to get it right, and now I think it is a wonderful product.  I just wish that Joan would make a light powder to go over it that would prevent it from transferring.</li>
    <li> This is a rather pricey product that is just so-so.  Sally Hansen makes a product for one third the price that is Just as good.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It not only looks terrible on your legs, it doesnt cover good and gets on whatever u touch. I wish I would of read the reviews (which I usually do) before I bought this produce.....its terrible!</li>
    <li> I read many reviews - most of them were positive so I decided to try Right to Bare Legs for a spring wedding.  I would say that the cover-up is quite good though the bruised areas and spider veins still showed through a little bit. It covered up enough to really lighten the areas that I have been embarrassed about. The \\&quot;finish\\&quot; was silky enough that my girlfriend thought that I had on stockings! So I would say YES~ buy this product though don&#x27;t expect complete and total coverage. But it is good enough coverage to wear bare legs in the summer.</li>
    <li> It is so good and I recommanded for women with spots in their legs.&lt;br /&gt;Thabk you for the results I have got.</li>
    <li> one use ,threw it away</li>
    <li> The medium color looked pink like a doll&#x27;s skin.  It was a dull look, not sheer and natural looking.  But the worse was that my legs felt dirty.  Sorry not for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect to cover up spider veins - once dry (10 minutes) it stays on for days. Get the moisturizer she sells also, it helps the makeup to go on more smoothly than average moisturizes. they work well together.</li>
    <li> the absolutely worst purchase i ever made. no way to evenly spread this stuff fast enough as it sets INSTANTLY.So thankfull that i was able to wash it off as it was horrible. I only gave it a one because there was no minus numbers</li>
    <li> I didnt end up using it but the product itself its good since its very dense so a little bit will be enough. For any part of the body even the face, its like a concealer in a big jar.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the great results I was hoping for. Yes, the product goes on well and stays on once it&#x27;s set, but it&#x27;s not opaque and did not completely conceal my spider veins. It definitely made the veins less noticeable, but I was expecting those veins to disappear, which is the whole point. Maybe the results vary depending on how dark/close to the surface your veins are. In addition, after only two uses, the sponge applicator split apart and fell off. So I&#x27;ll have to buy some cosmetics sponges and squeeze the cream onto one to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it does make my legs look tan. I can&#x27;t really recommend this product as it is, but I&#x27;m going to watch for a new and improved version. The manufacturer needs to make it more opaque and either make a sturdier sponge applicator or dispense with that and just supply a separate cosmetics sponge, which can be washed out. It would also be nice if it came in different skin tones, not just light to dark. On my pink skin, it looks a bit too yellow.</li>
    <li> Too dark, would like to order medium</li>
    <li> I wish I would have read reviews before I purchased the Right to Bare Legs cover up off the web site.  Buy one and get one free.  But what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you pay almost as much for the postage and handleing as the one tube. I purchased the product for my Mother.  She followed the directions and Her bigggest complaint was that it never dried.  Remained tacky ALL DAY LONG and at the end of the day she could wipe it off with a tissue.  She said it felt awful, came off on her clothing. Day two she tried it again but did not use lotion on her legs first.  She had the same results, it never dried completely. And again she waited ALL DAY LONG for it to dry.  She did say it covered good. What good is a product you can&#x27;t go out in public with? Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with my leg cover up.  it does look good on, and does cover all the icky stuff on my legs</li>
    <li> did not do a good job of covering any of what I wanted covered.  It looked cakey and the &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; fell apart on first application.</li>
    <li> I attended several humid summer weddings and this made my legs look flawless. It never rubbed off or ran, yet was easy to wash off with soap and water.</li>
    <li> The product did the job of covering the veins on my legs, but it was too thick and clearly looked like I had makeup on my legs.  You would have to cover both legs entirely with the makeup to have it not noticeable.</li>
    <li> Love the cover of this</li>
    <li> It is fairly paste like and difficult to spread. If you have a lot of lotion on and apply it right away, not letting lotion dry, it goes better. It covers very nicely then and is very light. Once applied you don&#x27;t feel it at all. I thought it would feel heavier since it was so tacky going on.</li>
    <li> I use it to cover up my Tatoo for work we are not allowed to have them it works great love it!</li>
    <li> I purchase this product because I got to read some of the good reviews on the fair color, so I got into their main web page and it said that this was the best color for me. Well i got the medium one and what a disappointment :-(&lt;br /&gt;The color looked like dark brown with like an orange color fused together. So I tried it anyway in one leg and it looked so ugly, like I had applied tons of foundation makeup on it and it started to crack up after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt; It didn&#x27;t even cover my leg tattoo, I applied it 3 times over the tattoo and you could still see it.&lt;br /&gt;BAD BAD BAD!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is not true to its color. Went on very dry &amp; matte even with prior moisterizer. Looked awful. Was suppose to return it but was too disgusted.</li>
    <li> This coverup up is amazing.  I have to take a medicine and I get red spots on my arms so I just dab this one and it really does the trick of covering up....I have recommended to friends and they all love it.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> Not natural looking at all.  It dries so fast you can&#x27;t spread it evenly and it leaves you looking ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I think the coverage is great and it stays on very well. It&#x27;s important to put a small amount of moisturizer on your skin first to help it spread with ease. I also make sure I wait 10 minutes before I get dressed. The rest is &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and it gives great confidence when going bare legged.</li>
    <li> The formula is heavy and does not blend fast and you can tell you applied something to cover your legs.</li>
    <li> I love the product BUT it is SO hard to get the lotion out of the tube!!!!  It needs a larger exit hole.  Legs need a large coverage area, and the tube dispenses just a tiny amount at a time.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all!  Looked unnatural and streaky. I would not recommend this product and felt is was misrepresented.</li>
    <li> I love Joan Rivers Right to Bare Legs product as it frees me from having to wear hosiery which is wonderful during the summer months.  I have a lot of sun damage from many years of deliberate exposure.  Right to Bare Legs has been the answer to my problem.  Also, it works to cover sun spots on my arms.l</li>
    <li> this stuff is unbelievable. it covered my tattoo and stayed on all day. i went to a wedding and did not want my tattoos exposed.no touch up was required. blended with my skin very well. perfect for all skin types.</li>
    <li> The product seems to work well.  I am very fair; however, the medium seems to be the best match for my legs.  Others indicated, as well, that the same product for fair skin was not a good match. The Corrective Cover-Up was easy to apply as well as no problem to remove with soap and water.  Waiting about 10 minutes, post application, to avoid stains on clothing is a good idea.  Overall, I am pleased with the product.  My only caveat is that the labeling of the skin tone seems inaccurate.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover my veins like it described it would. It was hard to apply. It took a long time to dry and when it did it still came off no matter what touched my leg, example car seat, clothes.</li>
    <li> It was awful.  It would not apply easily or smoothly.  I had to take a loss and toss it.</li>
    <li> this stuff was a waist of my money and i would never buy it again do not buy it no good</li>
    <li> My wife uses this to cover the tattoo on her wrist, and it works well.  She is a school teacher, and everyone knows that the sight of tattoos gives kids cancer.</li>
    <li> Good product but very hard to squeeze out of container.  Needs a different container.  I have to cut in half in order to get to product.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Results are fabulous. Remove with soap and water. I love it! thanks for having it at such a good price!</li>
    <li> TOO THICK. DOESN&#x27;T GO ON WELL. DOES NOT COVER UP VEINS. THE COLOR WAS TOO LIGHT. COLOR CAME OFF ON CLOTHES</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product since I bruise easily.  Looks like makeup.  Plus is that it does not rub off on clothes once dry.</li>
    <li> i have keratosis on my legs and they look like i was bitten by bugs, very embarassing.  i skeptically ordered this product and was amazed.  it covered the spots and made me feel much better about wearing skirts and dresses to work.  i did find that the applicator didn&#x27;t hold up very well so i use a makeup sponge to better apply this product.  well done Joan !</li>
    <li> Good coverage &amp; goes on easily if legs are moisturized.  However, I find that it rubs off on my clothing all day.</li>
    <li> Color not dark enough.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cover anything!  very disappointed</li>
    <li> Very satisfied,fast delivery, smooth transaction,Thanks</li>
    <li> I was surprised how easy this is to apply.  It does a good job of coverup of spider veins and uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> I use her Cover Up on my scar on my chest (from a skin cancer removal).  Also -  when I wear a sleeveless dress or shirt, I apply it to my arms - generously and it makes my arms look young again.  And when I wore my &amp;#34;little black dress&amp;#34; without stockings - covered up my spider veins!!!  YES - THANK YOU JOAN.</li>
    <li> Sucked butt. Looked streaky and really didn&#x27;t cover crap</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover as well as I would have liked.  Needed to mix medium and fair together to get a decent match.  Applicator is decent.</li>
    <li> One star was two many. It was impossible to get on without streaks and looked like concrete when it dried. It rubbed off on my clothes and I had to remove it before I left home. I was very disappointed with it!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Received right away! Very pleased</li>
    <li> Love the product! Great for covering areas that either need a little or a lot  just blend quickly for best results</li>
    <li> This is the best spider vein makeup that I have found so far.  The medium color blends perfectly with my leg color.  As the package suggests, I put some moisturizer on the area of the leg that I want to cover.  I noticed that 2 light applications works best for me.  Also, this product does stay on the entire day, even in the hot summer!</li>
    <li> This year the  color Medium didn&#x27;t cover my legs  well. I wouldn&#x27;t  use  the product any more.  Thank you, Ann</li>
    <li> I purchased this exact item and when I received it it was used and old and gross. The sponge was covered in the product and stiff. Don&#x27;t buy this ever. Ever. It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it is all that good</li>
    <li> When I first put this on I thought it was good. I followed the directions and waited ten minutes before getting dressed, but it still rubbed off on my dress. I sat on the sofa before leaving and it was all over the sofa. I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s wedding in July, but I think I will probably wear stockings afterall. As unconfortable as stockings can be, I think they will be more comfortable, believe it or not.</li>
    <li> I absolutely HATE this product, it is a very poor product with an EXTREME price tag! I ordered this from the official site with the tv offer deal buy one get one free...yeah right! My shipping was nearly as much as my order, and it was packaged in a bubble envelope(cheap). I anxiously opened the tube and tried it...TERRIBLE!!! You would seriously get the same if not better results with a self tanning cream. It has an orange tint, does NOT go on evenly or smoothly, (similar to the applicator tip on the \\&quot;nail hole filler\\&quot; wall patch compound) and it DOES come off on clothes &amp; furniture (even after a 15 min. wait)! It didn&#x27;t even cover my freckles...just shows what they really do with the magic of make up artists &amp; television! The only good thing I can say about this product is that is washes off easily with soap &amp; water...Thank Heaven! I am so totally serious when I tell you this....PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!! I guess we should ALWAYS go by the age old adage...If it sounds to good to be true, it usually is!!!</li>
    <li> I have to admit that I was \\&quot;given\\&quot; this product so it cost me nothing.  Amazon&#x27;s price, however, seems pretty reasonable to me.  My daughter applied this to my legs, QUICKLY and with a strong hand, when my granddaughter asked about all those dark purple marks on grandma&#x27;s legs.  She applied a thin layer, really rubbing it in with long motions up and down the vertical axis of my limbs.  I was warned not to roll my pants leg down for about 15 minutes because of possible color transfer (but I was wearing dark gray workout capris and wasn&#x27;t too worried about it).  Well, I have to tell you that my legs looked airbrushed afterwards.  Sure, the big purple blothes still could be seen through the makeup, but they were sooo much lighter.  And the overall look of my legs was smooth and much more attractive - like I said, airbrushed.  I am very fair and the \\&quot;fair\\&quot; color is a perfect match for me.  I would like to try a more summer-y tan color but I&#x27;m not sure which shade to go with.  I, like the rest of you, don&#x27;t want an orange complexion for the warmer months.  I don&#x27;t know about the Sally Hansen product mentioned by another reviewer, but I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased with this infomercial product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product but was going to order it from Soft Surroundings because it stated that it wouldn&#x27;t rub off on clothes or sheets.  After reading the reviews I believe I will stick with what I&#x27;ve been using that is less than half the cost.  It is &amp;#34;Sally Hansens Airbrush Legs&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s a spray on and immediate.  It&#x27;s just like make up for the face...</li>
    <li> This will make your leg look better but will also stain your car seat or any place that you touch with your legs.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. The color is too dark.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. It is perfect for those occasions when wearing hose is more appropriate than bare legs. I genuinely looked as if I were wearing hose.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it. But thats because I have a ton of discoloration on my legs from injuries and poor circulation.  Most likely, for me at least, no product is going to make my legs look good.</li>
    <li> just like useing base</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all. Too much like face foundation.  Greasy and stains clothes.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible!! If u have thick old makeup that would work better. Does not even deserve one star</li>
    <li> I had purchased it to cover a tattoo on my wrist but the color was not right and the pruduct sunk into the crevices in my wrist but on the legs it might not so if you are looking for just what it say it is for it might now sink into the skin as bad.  It just is not a good cover up for anything else!!!</li>
    <li> it is not  cover well and also its is not water prof as they said.the sponge its not working good ,,i have to use my hand ,,and its not cover any thing.</li>
    <li> Sucks - off color very orange and unnatural. Came damaged and Mary&#x27;s Market wouldn&#x27;t refund my money.</li>
    <li> I am a light-skinned Black woman.  While it helps to hide facial marks it does not hide my varicose veins.</li>
    <li> I am using it to cover my tattoos for a formal event and it works better than anything I have tried.</li>
    <li> Had to use this with a lighter cover up and blend together.&lt;br /&gt;Is difficult to get out of container and not that easy to apply, but&lt;br /&gt;it does cover some veins quite well</li>
    <li> The amount of coverage isn&#x27;t perfect, but it definitely makes my legs look much better than they normally do. I was a very serious dancer, so I have a lot of random scars on my legs. This does help!</li>
    <li> even though this product is not even working for me il stil keep it just incase when i go to the beach</li>
    <li> I was excited to about buying this product to cover up spider veins on my legs.  First of all it&#x27;s hard to blend because it&#x27;s thick.  They instructions recommended adding a little moisturizer and that just made it smear unevenly.  When I finally got the right mix and let it dry, it never covered my spider veins.  The pictures in the package are very deceiving.  Better off using make up and a concealer stick.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Good Price! Shipped Quickly!</li>
    <li> Works great...looks like you are wearing stockings</li>
    <li> did noy like or use It was like mud and did not thin out</li>
    <li> Terrible Product.I am a caucasian woman of German and Italian decent.I bought the medium.No coverage at all.I reccommend this product have many individual shades</li>
    <li> Saw this on Tv and feels greesy and doesn&#x27;t cover like it showed on Tv. Disappointing waste of money n</li>
    <li> This is a re-order.....my third. Goes on smoothly and covers imperfections beautifully!</li>
    <li> Argh! Where did those spider veins come from? Before using this, I hesitated wearing a dress without panty hose. This cover up goes on easily and stays on even in humidity. It really works. They don&#x27;t go away of course, but they are covered up until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs for quite awhile, but I hate how shimmery it is, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I got the medium shade - I have a golden skin tone and this product just does not look good on it.  It has a pinkish undertone similar to calamine lotion and when it dries it looks powdery, despite using tons of moisturizer prior to applying it.  It is very thick and it does cover well (I have a lot of spider veins), but the color of it is just unnatural-looking for me.  Looks like I&#x27;m wearing very thick, pinkish-tan colored pantyhose.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> better than I thought possible</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that will work on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays on all day long and looks great.  I wash it off with Oil of Olay soap at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to wait until it dries before putting on dark clothing.  I also should have ordered the light color which I will do next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The product was ok it covered some but not all as advertized. The color was too light and I tried to return it but you have to request a return authorization. I sent numerous requests by email and several phone calls to the customer service department and was sent in circles and was on hold for 35 mins. almost every call. To this day I have not received one answer from this company and I am stuck with the nonreturnable product . The shipping and handling costs were more than the product. I will never order anything from this company again. Clm2501@</li>
    <li> Please, do not listen to other reviewers and just get the color that matches the color of your face or body. If you&#x27;re white, buy the fair color. If you have a medium skin tone, buy the medium color and if you&#x27;re dark buy the tan. Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to listen to other reviewers... I&#x27;m white and ended up orange and like rusty with the medium shade!! In terms of coverage, yes it covers to a good extent. I used it to cover stretch marks, it didn&#x27;t cover them 100% but it did cover nicely, just the color didn&#x27;t match.</li>
    <li> Actually bought it for dark eye corner shadow from glaucoma drops. Long lasting and covers brown spots on my hands.</li>
    <li> Used it on my daughter&#x27;s ugly leg tattoo to cover during a wedding.  The ugly tattoo could not be seen.</li>
    <li> Horrible color and too thick to look natural!</li>
    <li> Best product on the market to cover age spots and vains, I picked med. to use in the summer even though I have fair skin, just have to let it dry before putting on shorts or it will rub off on your clothes, but once it does, it lasts all day until you wash it off.  I feel good in dresses or shorts again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the TV infomercial. The shipping cost more than the product and it took several weeks to arrive. When I saw the shipping cost, I called the company and got no satisfaction...pretty much told me \\&quot;tough luck\\&quot;. The product is not any good. Does not do what it claims to do. Sally Hansen product is superior to this one. The applicator sponge tears apart the first time it is used. The coverage is not good. Fortunately my credit card company reversed the charges (Capital One CC rocks!) and the Joan Rivers product never contested the payment denial. I am in the process of throwing the Right to Bare Legs cover up and moisturizer in the trash.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL BE SORRY!</li>
    <li> i love the product and i will continue to patronize this cream. it wont totally make your scar disappear but this cover up cream would make your scar less noticeable. i bought the medium shade and maybe i would want to try the fair shade and combine both.</li>
    <li> Covers tattoos very well</li>
    <li> do not buy was just smudge did not help to hide my stretch m</li>
    <li> If you apply this correctly it is amazing!! Good coverage for my skin. birthmarks and bruises will disappear right in front of your eyes.This product can take your legs from oh! no! to oh! my! Its fast, easy to use and it works.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a type of makeup, to cover some very dark spots, and this did the trick, even better than I was hoping.</li>
    <li> I chose only 4 stars because this will rub off on clothing and furniture as long as you are wearing it.  That being said, it covers great!  I have scars and a mass of spider veins and this covers them.  It makes my legs look great without having to wear hot pantyhose during the summer months.  I just keep the rub off in mind and I am careful if I sit on upholstered furniture.  If it rubs off on my clothes, I treat it with stain remover and it washes out.  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> I love pantyhose but cannot wear them year round, so I wear this leg cream and I add a little lotion to it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> this does not work.  I could use face make up to cover better than this.  very dissappointed in product.  Glad I did not pay Joan Rivers price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M TIRED OF WRITING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER!  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED! NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT.</li>
    <li> Blends beautifully and stays on.</li>
    <li> Luckily, I bought mine off of an auction site so I didn&#x27;t pay full price. But this product did not cover anything at all. I have a light scar that is barely noticeable as is, but I could still see it easily after applying this product. I tried experimenting to cover different conditions: a small mole, a faint stretch mark on my knee, discoloration, sun spots - it covered nothing! All this product did was change my skin color and add a bit of a \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; feeling to the applied areas. And IT DOES RUB OFF on furniture and clothing even after it&#x27;s been applied for well over an hour. I&#x27;m not sure what made them think they could tout this product as a \\&quot;cover-up\\&quot;. Please save your money!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about getting a spray tan and a friend recommended the Joan Rivers cover-up instead.  I love the look and being able to have bare legs and look great with a dress.</li>
    <li> Not right color but that&#x27;s the darkest it come&lt;br /&gt;I think if it was just a little darker it would work for me</li>
    <li> I try it on my scar and it works....i just rub it on a couple times and boom the scar vanish...:)</li>
    <li> It did not work on my legs.</li>
    <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t cover even small vein or marks, and worse than that it never dries out. I put on some on my leg and  4 hours later went to a party and sat on a very expensive coach and stained the coach all over. It was one of the most embarrassing day of my life. Save your money and stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to cover tattoos for my job.  I ordered the tan, which is a little darker than my skin, which is olive toned.  Unfortunately, it did not work.  II even tried putting a second coat on after the first coat dried.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t completely cover spider veins, but makes them much less noticeable. Would buy again. Must moisturize well before application for best results.</li>
    <li> The product is okay but it looked like it had been opened and used as some product was on the outside of the tube and on the sponge.  Too much hastle to send back so will keep it.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this product thank goodness I didn&#x27;t buy from the actual site this product just plain old SUCKS it doesn&#x27;t cover a damn thing ...Tattoos NO freckles NO scars NO bruise NO I mean it doesn&#x27;t cover nothing NADA Mrs Rivers you should be ashamed of yourself for conning the people it&#x27;s a wonder that any product works for you with all the plastic surgery you&#x27;ve had ...PEOPLE please don&#x27;t buy this shit it doesn&#x27;t work for crap total waste of your money and time to even put it on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LLM</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the bad reviews of this product.. I think it delivers what it says. I bought it and I love how even it may my legs look. Covers spider veins and other marks and scars. I need to be used with moisturizer for a better distribution . It dries pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I am not thrill with is the packaging, that tube is hard to get the product out because it gets clogged. I now leave a toothpick in it to keep it from clogging.&lt;br /&gt;And the sponge in the tube is worthless. They should get rid of it, since is better using the product with the hands, at least for me it is.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think is a great product and I will continue using it.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. The sponge on the end fell apart after first use. Didn&#x27;t cover like it said it would.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t do without this product in the summer, but I have found a crucial step in this process that they leave out! After you shave/exfoliate, put on the lotion that they sell. Not too much, just enough to hydrate. Let that soak in for a few minutes, then quickly apply the right to bare legs as instructed and wait about 10 minutes. This step coming up makes all the difference! Apply talcum POWDER (baby powder, whatever) like the dickens!  I use a powder puff in the shower, put it on heavily and then rub it in. It sets the make up in a way that nothing else can. I have almost no transfer to sheets, clothes, etc. when I do it this way. it lasts me half a week, and for whatever reason I don&#x27;t have to shave as often when I&#x27;m using these products.</li>
    <li> Liked product.  Took off the applicator sponge for faster coverage and really felt it did what it advertises.</li>
    <li> Not great coverage. Very hard to apply. Product has a foam applicator tip that is very difficult to get any product through.</li>
    <li> Thick goop, junk waste of cash.</li>
    <li> OMG... this is the WORST stuff I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!  It made me look like I was wearing those thick old  lady pantyhose and it was such a mess to clean off!  It doesn&#x27;t come off with soap and water but you have to scrub the heck out of your legs to get it off and then, it splatters everywhere and you have to clean the shower, the nozzle, the soap dish.... everything.  What a horrible experience.  I&#x27;m sticking to Sally Hansen forever more!!!</li>
    <li> My own cosmetic concealer works better than this cover up. It feels weird on the skin too. It didn&#x27;t cover up my spider veins as described. The consistency of the cream was all right but it does dry fast when applied. I am only glad that I bought just one to try. I also didn&#x27;t like it that the sponge was attached to the tube.</li>
    <li> This does cover your legs good but it comes off on your clothes and anything else your legs touch.  Not worth what you pay and I am just before sending it back.</li>
    <li> This really works and makes my legs look soft and smooth like they said it would.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> the product is good i&#x27;m totally recommend it is like makeup, and is cheap, is not only for womens, you can hide tattoos on something like that</li>
    <li> I was very excited to get this product.  Joan Rivers has excellent products but this one fell short for me.  I have given it many tries and all unsuccessful.  Very difficult to apply and even after letting is set the product still comes off on your clothes.  I will not purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> it does cover up the veins but the legs  looks fake do not like applying with applicator will not use this product again..</li>
    <li> This could be a tad darker and I would love it. Does what it says. Stays on until you wash it off with soap.  OI livecin Fl and swimyear round  it stays on until younusecsoap and water</li>
    <li> The coverage is okay, but it looks like face foundation applied to the legs.  Doubtful that I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> keep carrying the product It really helps cover up some of my veins in my legs even though I had vein surgery 6 years ago my veins came back and The Right to Bare Legs is the only product that works</li>
    <li> The product did not live up to expectations at all.  I found the cream to be very streaky and dried before you have a chance to spread it on evenly. I would not reccomend this product although I love the Joan Rivers great hair day product.</li>
    <li> Product makes your legs look like you have prosthetics. Not natural looking at all. Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product through Amazon.  It saved me alot.  I really like the product.  It does what it says it will do.  It doesn&#x27;t hide everything perfectly but my legs look so much better and natural.  I like using it on my arm age and sun spots as well.  Also my neck and chest.  Only gave it a 4 star because the sponge is a waist of time.  I tore if off and like using my fingers to spread it around.  One tip:  be sure to put lotion on just before using as it help to spread and look natural. I purchased one medium and one fair just in case I needed to blend them to get the right shade but so far the medium has worked just fine on my fair to just a bit of tan arms and legs.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup-- the med. color is a good color---I will order this again- thank yu  Hope  you will cotinue to carry this  makeup.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  It&#x27;s very easy to use too.  The colors are very natural and blend in great.  Any flaws in your skin disappear when you apply The Right to Bare Legs and this cover up doesn&#x27;t come off on your clothes.  I can&#x27;t wait to hit the beach now.  You will love it so try it.</li>
    <li> The product itself gives good results.  It has excellent coverage enabling me to go without stockings and to wear a short skirt. There are however 3 problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1 the attached sponge fell off after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;2The product is difficult to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes along time to dry, and so when you are in a hurry to get dressed, forget it.</li>
