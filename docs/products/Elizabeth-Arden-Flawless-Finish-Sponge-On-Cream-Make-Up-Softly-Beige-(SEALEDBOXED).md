    <li> Elizabeth Arden flawless finish makeup is great! I have worn this brand and color for over 30 years. I always get compliments on how smooth my skin and complexion is.  Easy to apply with sponge that is included. Simply wet the sponge and apply makeup.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and in good condition.  Absolutely love this foundation.  Always flawless as the name indicates.  I have found a buyer I will use again.</li>

    <li> This is a foundation that I have used for  6-7 yrs and this one had an aroma that to me smelled like dead roses. I felt that although it was sealed and boxed- that it was old. Anyway not happy and they wouldn&#x27;t credit, refund or replace. $25.00 lesson learned.</li>
    <li> my favorite makeup for decades.</li>
    <li> The item was as described with a good price.  The item is an older package than what is being sold in stores in USA but that doesn&#x27;t affect the makeup.</li>
    <li> I received the product and found it to not be the color I thought is would be. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to match the color &amp;#34;wording&amp;#34; on the box with numbers etc. but this one did not work at all!</li>

    <li> This makeup is one of the best I have ever tried. The sponge-on application makes it clean - no fingers - and smooth in appearance. The color doesn&#x27;t turn making me appear heavily madeup or like I&#x27;m about to have a heat stroke.</li>
    <li> This is an older style sponge on.  The newer style has more of a horizontal case.  But that isn&#x27;t the main issue.  It took over a  month to get this.  Crazy, I wont order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden sponge on make up for several years and have never found anything better. It goes on  creamy and provides a very good coverage.  It does not dry the skin and your skin will look fresh and smooth all day.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and the price has grown substantially.  I was so pleased to find this at a great price on amazon.  The makeup hides all flaws and is gentle on my skin.  I received it quickly and it was wrapped and new.  I am very pleased and will buy again from amazon!</li>
    <li> While I like the product, it has an&amp;#34;old&amp;#34; smell, like something a much older woman would wear. I won&#x27;t order again. I&#x27;m disappointed because I&#x27;ve always heard Elizabeth Arden was such a good make up line.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  Have used it for many years.  I previously used Rosy beige but it is apparently no longer offered.</li>
