<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> u can use on battery or plugged in , which on most newer models cant do this ; only battery for those.</li>
    <li> In my opinion Norelco razors are the best of the electrics</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband one year ago. I have to say we are not pleased with how it has lost it&#x27;s effect to shave him. I cut his hair and then use this for the finish part of the back of his neck and side burns and it gets slow and hard to get a smooth finish. It is easy to wash out but does not charge well.There is nothing to tell us the charge is finished. I think next time I will get a shaver for him that has a cord to it......</li>
    <li> Holds a charge for weeks. By the 3rd time I used it there was no face burn at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Replaced my 10 year old shaver that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;The new one cuts so much better and faster.</li>
    <li> good product- but lacks a light to inform you to recharge the razor, other styles have this feature.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that a good value</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!  When I don&#x27;t shave for a week, It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair</li>
    <li> Not as good as my original. Not battery indicator. You do not know when the battery is low, or when it is fully charged. For over 200.00 it is shame on Norelco not to have include this standard feature. I would not buy another Norelco product.</li>
    <li> I owned a Norelco Rotary Shaver for about 8 years. It was working fine until the rechargeable battery would no longer hold a charge. I would have replaced it myself - but I don&#x27;t know how to solder, so I broke down and ordered the Braun Series 3 340 foil shaver.  I had done a little research and most of the \\&quot;experts\\&quot; all suggested that foil shavers shave closer than rotary shavers.  Obviously, razor blades have the \\&quot;closest\\&quot; shave, but I wanted the convenience of an electric shaver. I do not have a thick beard - anything but.  I only shave once every 3-4 days so I end up w/ long whiskers in spots vs. 5 o&#x27;clock shadow that some people get after an hour :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the Braun Series 3 is a beautifully constructed shaver - but it didn&#x27;t work very well. It took many passes to cut my facial hair...and then I had to work it from different angles to successfully shave off the hair at different parts of my face. Yes, it finally shaved - but it seemed to take so much longer. In the end, I just wasn&#x27;t impressed at all - so I returned it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week or so, I purchased the Norelco 8240XL rotary shaver. It is not as nice looking as the Braun - and certainly doesn&#x27;t feel as well constructed - but it shaved me beautifully the first time around. The trimmer works so-so, but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for the trimmer. The 8240XL cleans easily.  The only thing wrong with the 8240XL package is the travel case.  The travel case only holds the shaver - and does not allow for the brush and charging cord.  How cheap is that?  Norelco really should include a larger case to accommodate the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the 8240 XL 5 stars as a shaver....and 1 star for the case. 4 overall only because the shaver outweighs the case. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Shaver was promptly delivered as advertised.  The unit is very easy to use and the instructions are clear.  Charging is a simple \\&quot;plug it in\\&quot; and go.  The overall shave is pretty good and the swivel on the heads makes for a reasonably comfortable shave.  The blade height is not adjustable so I find myself making a couple of passes for a really close shave.  My previous Norelco, which lasted me ten years, had this feature.  Overall this was a very good value and I am pleased so far.</li>
    <li> This is my second norelco that I have owned.  The previous one worked flawlessly for 7 years until I dropped it on our ceramic tile floor in the bathroom. (not a wise thing to do)  I got the 8240XL about three weeks ago and it gave me a close shave right out of the box.  I would highly recommend this product because I have a thick beard and if it can shave me close I could imagine what it could do for an average person.</li>
    <li> exceptionally quiet.  gives a nice close shave.  I particularly like the hot water rinsing-cleaning feature.</li>
    <li> Battery life is excellent, have used for one month and I&#x27;m still on the first charge.  Shave is very close, but does not irritate my skin.  Performance on my neck is somewhat lacking.  I spend 60% of my shave time trying to get my neck finished.  In all fairness I have yet to use an electric razor that works the neck area perfectly.     Overall, very pleased.</li>
    <li> A great razor without a lot of bells and whistles. Why pay 2 or 3 times more for, basically, the same razor with a few more lights? I agree that a low battery light would have been nice, but this isn&#x27;t a big deal since the battery lasts a long time and can be charged in 1 hour. Plus, if you don&#x27;t have an hour to wait around a quick 5 minute charge will get the job done (or you can use it corded.)    Now, as far as the shave goes it gives a very close shave with no irritation. It is a little faster than previous models but don&#x27;t expect to cut your shaving time in half. I tried a foil razor once and it left a few stray hairs here and there which it refused to pick up no matter how hard I tried to get them. I switched to a rotary and I haven&#x27;t had that problem since. I switched to electric razors a few years ago when my face just couldn&#x27;t handle blades anymore; I thought I&#x27;d have to sacrifice the closeness of a blade for a healthier face but this hasn&#x27;t been the case with Norelco, they have consistently given me blade close shaves.    I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 6 months now and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;ve read the reviews on the Arcitec and, honestly, can&#x27;t see a good reason why I should pay 2 or 3 times for it when this one works so wonderfully.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice electric razor for the price. Would definitely buy this from Amazon again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for years.  After 4 years of reliable service, my last one finally gave up the ghost and would no longer hold a charge, so I decided it was time for a new shaver.  I decided on the 8240XL because of the balance of features it offered and its pricepoint.  I could not be happier.  There were several things that I noticed when I first started using it.  First, I was amazed at how light it was.  After using Ni-Cad powered shavers for the past 6 years, I was used to some \\&quot;heft.\\&quot;  This shaver on the other hand is powered by a much lighter Li-Ion battery. The second thing I noticed was how long the charge lasted.  I got over a weeks worth of shaves off of one charge- again thanks to the Li-Ion battery. The third thing I noticed, like other reviewers, was how quiet it was.  It didn&#x27;t sound like I was holding my buzzing alarm clock next to my face as I shaved. The final feature that I really appreciate on this shaver is the charging time.  It will fully recharge in about an hour.    But, all these features are pointless if the shaver doesn&#x27;t do what it was designed to do... shave!  The manual stated that it takes about a week or so for your face to adjust to a new shaver, and that was pretty accurate.  The first week, it felt \\&quot;funny\\&quot; or \\&quot;different\\&quot; on my face.  It provided a good shave, but it just didn&#x27;t feel like what I was used to.  After a week though, that funny feeling went away and the shaver felt very natural.      The shave it provides is comfortable and close.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or snag on my longer whiskers.  It pivots and glides well across my face and is able to shave close in those areas that are typically hard to get a close shave in.    The only thing about this shaver that doesn&#x27;t thrill me is the lack of a charge indicator.  Some of the more expensive models in this lineup have that feature, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay for it, so in some regards I can&#x27;t complain but so much.  On the old Ni-Cad powered shavers, even if the shaver did not have a charge indicator, you could hear and feel the shaver getting slower as the charge died.  For this Li-Ion powered shaver, that is not the case.  It keeps its power up right until the charge is gone.  In some ways that&#x27;s good because it gives you full power until the end.  In other ways it&#x27;s bad because you don&#x27;t know when the \\&quot;end\\&quot; is and you could be in the middle of a shave.  On the bright side though, it will recharge in an hour (as long as you have the charger with you).    Overall, I highly recommend this shaver.  It&#x27;s a full-featured shaver at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was always a Norelco user for many years but last year I bought a \\&quot;Braun\\&quot;.  What a mistake, because when I came back in November, 2009 with your new Norelco 8240XL it was a better product  by giving me a closer all around shave. Another factor, when I did not shave after 2-3 days I did not have to use the trimmer to remove the few stray hairs close to my upper lip.  I ALWAYS had to use the Braun&#x27;s trimmer to remove these stray hairs.  Last but not least, the cleaning of the blades by using the water faucet is fantastic. The price was also a great buy KUDOS!  Ed Olonovich</li>
    <li> My husband is thrilled with this shaver that was a Christmas gift.  I did a great deal of research before purchasing a new shaver--I was going to get him one of those new, three-floating platform shavers that have become so popular.  However, after reading numerous reviews about problems with those shavers (he would hate to have to clean out the shavings chamber every other day, and I was concerned about reports of getting shaving burns), I found this little gem with great reviews.  A no-frills shaver (which suits my husband), the price was just right, and he is surprised at the quality of his shave, the speed of the shave, and how quietly it works.  I did just fine with this gift!</li>
    <li> The Norelco 8240 offers the best value/comfort/performance for the money I&#x27;ve found. Lower models in the Norelco line lack some very effective features (floating heads, multiple inset rotary heads, etc.), while higher models are much more expensive with no benefit to performance (some do a poorer job of shaving, including the ARC series).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the best foil shavers generally shave closer, the Norelco 8240 cuts nearly as close (not quite, but the difference is virtually unnoticeable). The rotary heads, however, are MUCH more comfortable and not nearly as prone to razorburn as foil shavers. The floating heads on this model are excellent (not as stiff and MORE effective than the $130 ARC series), conforming well to my face, even at my sharp chin and gentle adam&#x27;s apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what makes it really superb compared to any other shaver I&#x27;ve tried in my 18 years of shaving:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The $80 price (at Walmart, December 2009), on the low end of the price range that consistently offers the best value/performance ratio ($70 - $110).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The motor is wonderfully quiet... it purs in a low, comforting tone, without the high whine of most other rotary and foil razors I&#x27;ve tried (the ARC series is much louder, as are Braun foil shavers). When I first used it, I though the battery must be low on charge, but I finally realized that it really is just that quiet all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shaving performance is excellent: It offers the 2nd closest shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric shaver (The Braun foil shaver I&#x27;ve used for the last 6 years shaves negligibly closer), yet gives almost zero razorburn to my sensitive/dry skin (the Braun gave mild to moderate razorburn daily). Better yet, the Norelco shaves close WITHOUT need to pull my skin tight with a second hand as I shave. That is the main reason I switched back to rotary... Foil shavers only give a close shave by constantly pulling the facial skin tight with another hand while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The ergonomics are very comfortable: It fits perfectly in my hand and feels very light. My Braun foil shaver always felt like holding a large cell phone... no ergonomics to speak of, which occasionally led to dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convinced that negative reviews of this razor are either by folks with very strange face shapes or, more likely, folks who don&#x27;t understand that a razor MUST BE BROKEN IN for about two weeks before it offers an optimum shave. On the first shave, the Norelco 8240 is unimpressive, but by the fifth or sixth morning (assuming you use it exclusively), it will adjust to your face and give you a remarkably good shave. The quality continues to improve slightly until about the end of the second week. Stick with it, and you&#x27;ll be glad.br /&gt;- The ergonomics are very comfortable: It fits perfectly in my hand and feels very light.

    <li> Purchased for my husband who has owned several norelcos in  the past. He was not happy with this razor.  He says it is like driving a car with an under sized engine. The manufacturer must surely be thinking of the bottom line on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric shaver and remember the ancient ones my father had ages ago and was never interested in them as they never seemed to give a decent shave.  A friend of mine has one of these and uses it for his head and that seemed like something that would work for me since I have the same haircut and shaving with a razor can be a pita at times compared to running this around your head!  He also said that the Norelco was better than the Braun units (for your head), I&#x27;d guess because of the three floating heads ability to deal with all the contours.  I am impressed with the Norelco&#x27;s performance, it does exactly what I want it to do for my head and now and then I&#x27;ll use it for my face too and it seems to work pretty well there.  I still prefer a razor for my face and neck, I don&#x27;t think anything comes close but this works good on the face too and average on the neck.  Briefly I&#x27;d rate it as: Head&#x3D;great, Face&#x3D;pretty damn good, Neck&#x3D;average.</li>
    <li> I have always used a foil razor and when my old one died, I thought I would give a rotary a chance.  I did use the product for 3 weeks to \\&quot;let my skin adjust\\&quot;, but even from the first shave, the motor seemed underpowered and seemed to take twice as long to shave.  I also prefer a foil to do the jaw line and more angled areas.  I traded it in for the 45-day trial and got a Panasonic 8243 which I am stoked about.</li>
    <li> Rotary razor technology has not changed fundamentally in fifty years -- and foil technology hasn&#x27;t in seventy -- but the razors get slowly better with newer materials and tinkering. This is as good as rotaries get at the moment; the newer, narrower Norelco models shave no closer and are louder.  No electric shaves as well as a blade but this comes surprisingly close, at least for men with rotary faces (some do better with foil razors). As other reviews have mentioned, when the charge runs out it stops suddenly without any audible warning. But that doesn&#x27;t happen very often, and when it does you just plug it in; the razor will work immediately.</li>
    <li> I have always owned Norelco shavers but unfortunately this is not one of my favorites.  Due to the design for the pivoting razor head assembly it allows shaven hair to fall out of the shaver while shaving.  All my past shavers had enclosed main heads with the individual floating heads which contained the shaven hair until rinsed.  Still does a good job of shaving but is slightly on the messy side.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the standard gel and razor for shaving till now and thought of trying out the electric shaver. So, I picked up the 8245 model from Costco and my experience with it has been very average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Maybe I&#x27;m not used to a dry shave but I felt that this shaver was abrasive and left my skin red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shave did seem to be close, but with this shaver, you pretty much shave against the grain. If you do that with a regular razor, you can probably get an even better shave. Against the grain did not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I had to spend some time shaving with this. It didnt seem powerful enough to shave the hair off in one go. It took me multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The shave was even worse around the jaw line and on the neck and hence it took even more passes, resulting in more abrasion on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not happy with the product and will return it.</li>
    <li> I am 82 an have used many shavers. This is unquestionably the best I have seen. Was just previously using a Braun. The shaving and performance is so much better. I am delighted with this shaver and encourage others to try it. I still use a blade razor once a week, but this is my everyday shaver. I do clean it after each use, as per their instructions and take out the razor heads once per month and wash them under hot water.</li>
    <li> My old Norelco used to cut so much better - back when you could replace the blades - now you have to buy an entire new head.     Battery works well - nice long charge.    It is quiet.     But - Wish I would of bought something else.</li>
    <li> Replaced previous Norelco shaver after several years of service. This is a great improvement smoooooooooth shave and quiet.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I was expecting a very good shave but that&#x27;s not what I got with this razor. It&#x27;s very quiet but the shave wasn&#x27;t close. After using this razor, I went over my face again with a four year old Braun, with six month old blades, and still got quite a bit more stubble. Using this razor, it never felt like a close shave.</li>
    <li> As a dedicated user of Norleco Shavers for many years the precision and  craftsmen of this shaver is very good. The shaver is extremely quiet offering  a very close shave. Phillips Norelco recommends a break-in period of 21 days. The company (Phillips Norelco) offers a 100% refund if not completely satisfied within the 45 days from date of purchase. I contacted Customer Service on two  different occasions concerning cleaning and removal of the shaver head. There response to the queries was handled in a timely manner. My last Norelco shaver lasted 7/8 years. Yes, I would recommend this shaver to anybody who wants a quality product.</li>
    <li> This is the second SpeedXl I&#x27;ve bought.  The first one failed with its complex indicator lights discharging my battery. I bought this one because my charge card issued me a refund,    This one is better than the model they made 3 years ago.  I know they have an external charger version but from my earlier experience I stayed away from it.    I took this on a 3 week trip and survived without having to charge it. The flexible head is also a great improvement.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in time for  Christmas, given we ordered in a few days before we needed it, and it has turned out to be a good product. Fast service.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say too much about it, other than that this is the best razor ever. I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for about the last 7 years or so. And I can honestly say this is the best one. Give it a week or two to adjust to your hair on your face, then in no time, you will be in love. Easy cleaning, quick charging, great for travelers too. Save money on disposables and buy this razor now.</li>
    <li> I always used to think that Norelco was the Cadillac (Mercedes?) of electric shavers.  I bought one about eight years ago and within a year the controls started to go crazy and I couldn&#x27;t turn the thing on.  It was still under warranty, so it was replaced.  Same thing happened to the replacement within six months.  I guess that&#x27;s why they pulled it off the market quickly.    I wasn&#x27;t going to buy Norelco again, but I was swayed by all the reviews here.  I bought the 8240 almost exactly a year ago from Amazon (and for $69.99).  No real complaints for a year.  Just a little hard to shave up near the nostrils.  Easy to clean, a big plus with me.    Unfortunately the day came when I forgot to stop charging it after an hour and left it to charge all night.  Next morning it ran for 15 seconds and quit cold.  Now the battery won&#x27;t hold a charge at all no matter how long or short you charge it.  I haven&#x27;t given up on it yet, but for now I have a corded razor.    Addendum - 1 month later:  Could not resuscitate the battery.  Nice shaver still, but corded.</li>
    <li> This has gotten good reviews, and I agree. It&#x27;s comfortable and simple. I like that shaving heads only tilt, not separate for cleaning. I still don&#x27;t know about battery technology. I imagine it is the best available, but wish it were bragged of. The price is really low.</li>
    <li> I called Amazon and was helped picking out my shaver.  The product was very good and came with a rebate, that was the good part. I just received a notice in the mail saying I was not getting the rebate. I should get a credit or something for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husbands birthday.  It never held a charge and therefore was useless.  I contacted the company to see if there was something we were doing wrong.....we didn&#x27;t do anything wrong and the company said they would replace the product for us free of charge and even provide a prepaid return box.  I was told that I could expect the new razor in 7 t 10 business days.  That was July 29th as of yet we have received nothing....it is now August 16th.  I have received an email saying the item is back ordered and they don&#x27;t know when another shipment will com in.  Yesterday I placed a call to the company, I had to leave a message because no live person was available....I&#x27;m still waiting for a call back.  This is a major company and I really expected more from them.  Amazon did nothing wrong....I received my order in a very timely mannor~~</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave - practically as close as a blade.  The only issue is one that applies to all electric shavers - your face must be absolutely clean &amp; dry for the shaver to work.  The slightest bit of moisture, perspiration, etc. will cause the unit to skip areas.  This particular model does not have a charge indicator to let you know when it will need to be charged, so it just stops abruptly.  That&#x27;s not a major problem because it can be used as a corded shaver &amp; the charge time is very fast - around an hour.</li>
    <li> Great product,great price, husband LOVES it! This was a birthday present for him, so he was pleased. It gives a close clean shave, and very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I wish I have chosen different shaving machine. The motor is very slow. I will certainly order Braun next time. The machine was delivered on time.</li>
    <li> excellent silent razor with cheap price,i bought it as a gift at the promotion price and the razor is made in netherland.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor that has come close to matching a brush and blade shave.  Quiet operation with a fast close shave even under the chin.  No razor burn and easy cleanup make this a winner.  This is definitely the best electric out there for under a $100 and possibly the best at any price.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband, who was having problems with his old razor. He loves the fact that it is so quiet. He has always liked the Philips Norelco razors and likes this one, too. We are so happy that Amazon carries this razor. We have always had GREAT success when we order anything from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for $50 dollars when it was a gold box deal.  Could not pass it up since it is usually $70 dollars or more at costco when there is even a coupon.  I have been using the same model for years now.  Would recommend for those that use electric shavers.</li>
    <li> I had to purchase a new shaver to replace my old Norelco shaver which wore out. I have been using Norelco shavers since about 1955.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Norelco when I was in highschool.  It was adequate then.  I then went to a remmington titanium, and then to a Braun 360.  They never shaved my face that well. I thought they would shave under my neck better but they missed so many hairs that I had to use a razor to clean up what was left.  This Norelco is soooo great that my shaves are close and clean.  No hairs missed.  I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t buy much on line and I was very pleased with the service and handling of this purchase from Amazon. The item was satisfactor except it did not have a feature I considered important. \\&quot;Low battery indicator\\&quot;. I returned it, which, also was handled in a very satisfactory manner. Thank you.  Don Schlotterbeck</li>
    <li> Previously purchased the more expensive [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Silver]] .  This Philips is cheaper, more comfortable, and seems to shave in less time.  Easy to use wet in shower or dry outside.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my  husband.  He seems to be very pleased with the shave.  It is quiet.  He has used it for 8 days without a charge.  This gift came in a timely manner after I ordered it from Amazon even though it was the busy Christmas gift ordering time.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand and have always been satisfied with it. This new one is to replace the one I had for over 20 yrs. It is  as good as I expected. No complaints with service or the product</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, who always used Norelco. The reviews I read before purchasing were the deciding factor.  He  loves it !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have that much hair on my face.&lt;br /&gt;This unit requires 5 to 7 passes to cut a few white hair and&lt;br /&gt;even that I must bring my face close to the mirror&lt;br /&gt;to do the job properly, otherwise a few hair&lt;br /&gt;will remain.  My old unit which no longer holds&lt;br /&gt;the charge, I could make one or two passes, without the aid&lt;br /&gt;of mirror, I am done. Not this one.&lt;br /&gt;I regret buying it.</li>
    <li> I am female and decided to buy this because lady razors really suck and don&#x27;t cut the hair close at all. This razor is great and does not cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about 3 weeks ago, and I must say it is amazing. very close shave (even before the 21 days adjustment) with no to minimal skin irritations. This product made me hate shaving so much less, it is almost enjoyable.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco SpeedXl is a great improvement over the older Norelcos.  It&#x27;s quiet and I love being able to clean it with water!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with his new razor.  The delivery, etc. were excellent.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from the 7300 model to this 8240 model of Philips Norelco shaver and it is quite, but the shave is the same results as my 7300 model shaver. I do have a thick bread and I do following the directions on shaving technique, but the results seem to be the same, but you pay double the price for this model. This 8240 is well built as compared to other shavers I have owned, and should last a long time.</li>
    <li> this was a gift for our son. He really likes it - uses it everyday gives him a very nice shave.</li>
    <li> I just unpacked this item and was dissapointed by 2 things    1. When I plug it in, the charging light does NOT come on  2. The package says it comes with a cleaning brush but I didn&#x27;t find one in the package.    Anyone else with the same experience?     Thanks</li>
    <li> I only gave this product four stars because I&#x27;ve only used it for one week, but so far I&#x27;m really enjoying it!  Sure, after 25 years of shaving with blades I&#x27;m bound to have some irritation.  All my research indicated that it would take my skin and beard 3-4 weeks to adjust, but so far my irritation is confined to the area above my upper lip and below my lower lip.  I bought this item at Amazon.com for an amazing $69.99...whereas the local Walmart sold it for $93.00.       At first the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d expected, but the more you use the razor the closer the shave gets.  I&#x27;m a military officer and after just one week it gives me a shave close enough for any inspection.  It&#x27;s quiet, smooth, easy-to-use, and easy-to-clean.  Save yourself the extra $30 for the cleaning &amp; charging stand that comes with the 8260 Speed XL...all you need to do is rinse under hot tap water daily and give it a more thorough cleaning each month. Also get yourself some cleaner/lubricant for electric razors (Remington Shaver Saver).       I recommend that those that are new to electric shaving follow all the recommended steps below until your skin fully transitions to electric shavers:    - Shave after you shower with hot water and wash your face thoroughly.  Use a good face scrub every other day to exfoliate dead skin and prevent ingrown hairs (recommend Neutrogena Razor Defense, Every Man Jack, or Nivea).    - Use a pre-electric shave lotion like William&#x27;s Lectric Shave to dry out the hairs and help them stick out straight (it really does help though it smells strong!).    - Spray your razor heads with Remington Shaver Saver before each use to lubricate the blades and help reduce friction (saves your face and razor at the same time).    - As soon as you&#x27;re done shaving, rinse your face well with COLD water and apply a good, soothing after shave balm/lotion/gel.  Go for one of the new brands with low alcohol content and high contents of glycerin, aloe, etc.  Again, recommendedbrands are Neutrogena Razor Defense, Every Man Jack Cooling Gel, or Nivea.    Don&#x27;t give in and quit before your 3-4 week transition period is over...stick with it and you will soon enjoy the convenience and cost savings of electric shaving.  I will continue this review after another month or so.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco Rotary shavers since I started shaving 30+ years ago.  Other methods always irritated my skin but he Norelco&#x27;s rarely did.  This one is so much quieter and lighter than any of the ones I&#x27;ve had before.  You can actually hear what&#x27;s going on around you.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with a Braun Shaver for years. I always had to shave with a regular razor after shaving everyday around the neck area because the braun never shaved good here. Right out of the box, the Norelco shaved so close, I would have sworn I had shaved with a straight razor. I will never go back to a Braun. The other thing that is unreal is how quiet this shaver is, I did&#x27;t think I had charged enough the 1st time.</li>
    <li> Nice shave and easy cleanup quick recharge  As  advertised, no low battery indicator however</li>
    <li> I found this Electric Razor to be exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with it.  Easy to use and maintain</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with my model 8240XL. I actually \\&quot;downgraded\\&quot; from an Arcitec model because I&#x27;m mostly bald and also shave the top of my head, but the loud Arcitec caused scrapes on top of my head that would scab up. Also, the small Arcitec trimmer was too short and imprecise for trimming the sideburns and the shaving head gets in the way of positioning this trimmer. Further, the Arcitec heads are impossible to take apart and clean thoroughly, so the heads would clog up with long hairs which took many tedious minutes to clean out with sharp tweezers!    The 8240XL provides relief from the above problems, giving a great shave, and the pitch and sound volume is surprisingly lower in a small bathroom. My only concern is the manual gave no indication how this \\&quot;low-end\\&quot; model, without a low battery LED, notifies the user of low battery charge. The answer is not that it simply slows down like a rubber band glider, but that it simply stops abruptly in the middle of a shave. The first time, I thought it was broken! To my delight, it resurrected after charging for a few hours. So, the moral is to always keep that charge cord handy. I know Norelco may love to charge $20-$30 more for the upgrade model, but this is really a bit cheap on their part for what must be the tiny expense of adding the low battery LED to all models.</li>
    <li> Good product - I replaced my old Phillips with this one and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> -- Gives a decent, reasonably fast shave on one- or two-day beards,not so much for longer ones -- normal for Norelcos.  -- Cleans up well under a stream of hot tap water. :)  -- Head is very prone to popping open while shaving, with only a light touch needed to dump nano-fibers of hair inside your shirt :(  -- Charging process calls for you to unplug the shaver once full charge is reached, or the battery degrades faster. Means you have to monitor it rather than set it &amp; forget it. :|  -- Charging light is reversed in my view -- is solid when charging, blinks when &#x27;full&#x27;. I think it&#x27;d be better to reverse this. Oh Well. :|  -- You&#x27;ve gotta hold your mouth right to get the shaver head back into the hinge keeper after you remove it for detailed head cleaning. :(  -- Shaver end of the charging cord is all black, as is the plug end of the shaver. In any case, there&#x27;s no easy visual indicator whether the slot in the plug should face up or down, and which side of the shaver is up or down. :!    All in all, probably a case of design by bean counter.</li>
    <li> The battery has a good performance, I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and it still working as first day.</li>
    <li> The product was on time and as described.  I have had great service from previous Norelco porducts and expect the same from his one.  I just wish that there was a better packaging system than the plastic bubble packs.  You have to take care not to slit your wrists when trying to cut through them.</li>
    <li> Nice refined product. Does an excellent job, easy to clean and gives many shaves on one recharge.</li>
    <li> the book says that the battery lasts for 17 days... as a matter of fact, it lasted with me in the last two charges only 10 days... is there a problem with the battery, or this normal?    thanks.</li>
    <li> I paid $93+ for this puppy at Target a few months ago. It feels well made. The shavers in the $50 range feel / look like junk. I&#x27;m not sure if one shaver shaves any better than the other. They all have blades that go round and round or back and forth.    The charge does seem to last longer than other shavers I&#x27;ve had. But it gives no warning as to when the charge is gone, it just stops dead...    But hey, it&#x27;s not made in China ! I was stunned to see it was made in the Netherlands !</li>
    <li> My 8240XL arrived from Amazon 5/21/2010 by USPS.  I ordered it 5/16/2010 and requested \\&quot;Super Saver\\&quot; free shipping so it took a few days.  The shaver, shaving head protector, manuals, soft carrying case and brush were all present (nothing missing) and were all in good shape.  I am not happy with Amazon reducing the price of my 8240 by $3.00 only 2 days after I placed my order.  I realize that&#x27;s how buying on the Internet works but it doesn&#x27;t make me feel any better.  I&#x27;m certainly not pleased with Amazon for doing this and not automatically giving me a break.    I should have heeded the recommendations in an appraisal I read prior to attempting to open the plastic blister pack.  I should have used my large tin snips instead of a standard scissors for cutting off the plastic lip.  It was difficult to do with a standard scissors.  I slipped once and bloodied my thumb as a result (the back side of my thumb rammed into a cut surface of the plastic lip which was rather sharp).  This is my major complaint about this shaver - it seems Norelco could come up with something a bit easier, not to mention safer, for the average customer to open.    I initially charged the batteries for about 13 hours (manual recommends 12 hours - I didn&#x27;t awaken soon enough very early in the morning).  Although I don&#x27;t understand why the initial 12 hour charge is recommended since the battery showed full charge (led started blinking) after approximately 1 hour, however, I could see no harm in leaving the shaver attached to the charger for the recommended time.  I think the perceived instruction manual contradiction of recommending the 12 hour initial charge vs. subsequently not continuously charging does not apply for the 1st charge.  I think the manual is recommending the user not recharge the unit until the batteries are run down and this does not apply to the initial charge procedure.  I have done my own evaluations of NiCad batteries as part of my former job at Schick (New Product Development Lab back in the 1970s) and they work best, not to mention last the longest, when they are always nearly completely discharged before recharging.  This is what I have done with my most recent Norelco, model 6615X (cordless only) and its NiCad batteries are still OK after about 6½ years continuous use.  NiCad batteries tend to develop a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; if they are recharged too soon, too frequently or continuously and will prematurely lose their charge holding capability.    I miss the low battery indicator that was on my old 955RX Norelco shaver.  This had an LCD bar display showing various charge levels.  With this indicator I would have an idea when the batteries were almost discharged so I would not be unexpectedly surprised in the middle of a shave.  My experience with my previous &#x27;cordless only&#x27; Norelco (6615X) has been a problem when it would stop in the middle of a shave.  I would then need to shift to my old 955RX (cord and cordless) to finish the shave.  The new 8240&#x27;s batteries finally ran down after a month of daily use.  No warning, I heard a click and it just stopped.  I plugged in the power cord and finished shaving with no problem.  It took about an hour to recharge afterwards.    I do not understand how a previous user had all shaving head parts fly out when he popped open the head for cleaning.  They are retained by a traditional Norelco retention system which has always worked well for me.  The components should not come loose unless improperly assembled.  I suppose it&#x27;s possible the factory did something wrong in this person&#x27;s case, however, I have had no problem when I daily pop the head open for rinsing under hot water.  Nothing has come apart; nothing is loose or assembled improperly.  The head popped open easily by pushing the little button under it and it was quite easy to rinse out the debris using hot water as the manual recommends.  After one month I disassembled the head and cleaned the comb assembly components in alcohol.  No problem but it&#x27;sa very delicate operation and it is very easy to damage the components.  The manual recommends doing this monthly.  Too bad Norelco can&#x27;t come up with a design that doesn&#x27;t require disassembly of the shaving head for monthly cleaning.  Good for business I suppose - probably sells lots of replacement comb/cutter assemblies.    I have a concern about the manual&#x27;s recommendation that the head assembly be left open until it dries out after the recommended daily rinsing in hot water.  This makes the head assembly quite vulnerable to getting damaged (bumped) because it sticks out well beyond the shaver itself when it&#x27;s open.  The head protector can be mounted on the open head assembly but that&#x27;s a bit tricky to do.  If you don&#x27;t put the protector on, the individual comb assemblies can be easily bumped and damaged.    One other concern is that the 8240 seems to be more unstable when lying on its back than the older Norelco shavers.  This means it will more easily roll to one side or the other than the older shavers if it is not carefully placed on a hard flat surface or if it is bumped while lying there. This may be a concern if it is placed too close to the edge of a solid surface (countertop, shelf, etc.) as it might easily roll to the side and fall off the surface.  I can see this happening if a person is in a hurry and/or is not very careful when laying the shaver on a hard flat surface.    Initial shave experience with the 8240XL - 5/22/2010:  I have a relatively light beard and have been using Norelco shavers for over 35 years (perhaps longer).  I had no problem with 1st shave irritation since my face is well accustomed to the Norelco system.  I liked the feel of the 8240, the increased head / comb surface feels nice (3 cutting rings per comb instead of the previous single cutting ring).  Because of the increased cutting area I think my shaves go slightly more quickly than with my previous 6615 shaver - but that is not a certainty.  I can not feel anything at all while shaving and my 8240 shaver seems much quieter and smoother than my previous 6615 shaver.  Maybe that&#x27;ll change as it gets older and the newness (a.k.a. sharpness) wears off.  This is what all of my previous Norelco shavers have done.  Since I&#x27;ve only had the 8240XL about a month at this writing it&#x27;s probably too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco 8240XL a few weeks. I have bought a new Norelco shaver every few years for the past 25 years.    The 8240XL replaced a Spectra 8891XL (a higher-end model when purchased). The 8240XL provides a better shave. It is the quickest and closest shave I can remember a Norelco giving me.    I am still using the initial charge and unsure how many more shaves it will give me. This is the one issue I have with this model. Norelco should include some type of charge status indicator with all cordless models.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the 10 year old Norelce that I retired - but it is.</li>
    <li> I tried this out but it didn&#x27;t cut neck/chin hair well, gave me A LOT of irritation/razor burn and even a few ingrown hairs. Also kind of a weird feeling, can pinch sometimes while shaving. The 3 head design just doesn&#x27;t make sense, it can&#x27;t effectively reach and cover places on the human face. I think the foil method is much better, especially for sensitive skin, although it&#x27;s not a great alternative either. Rubbing your hair in circles isn&#x27;t good either because then your hairs grow in all different directions which isn&#x27;t good. I returned mine with no problems. Might work for some with very light facial hair.</li>
    <li> Have had Norelco for 6 weeks.  Smooth...quiet...and reasonable close but not as close as the Panasonic was.  Horrible base.  Very dangerous..With razor in it easily tips..falls into sink, so be carefull and NEVER lets it stand plugged in near a sinkfull of water.</li>
    <li> You will get a better shave trying to take the dollar bills and run them across your face than you will get from this shaver.  Not only does it not give a close shave, but I seem to keep bumping the razor head release button as well - each time, the thing flies apart with three razor heads, their respective covers, and the 3-pronged bracket that is supposed to hold them together racing for the sink drain. More than once, I&#x27;ve had to take the trap off the sink and fish these out.</li>
    <li> I am making the switch from a traditional blade and shave-gel to electric shaving system with the Philips Norelco 8240XL. Based on my experience a few years ago which left me with irritated skin and ingrown hairs, I was not expecting much. After a few weeks of use, I am pleasantly surprised. No skin irritation or any more ingrown hairs than I get with traditional shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses: It is easy to use and much faster than traditional shaving. After using it, it is very easy to clean using the included brush. The kit includes a small charger (no bulky transformer which makes transportation easier) and a collapsible case. I appreciate the case versus the hard case I had with the shaver I used a few years ago; the form factor for storage is convenient and thoughtful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;1. It leaves a mess. Every time I shave the counter is scattered with little hairs. Rather than gathering them up in a lather like traditional shaving or keeping them inside (which would require more frequent cleanings), the 8240XL seems to just spit the little hairs all over a 3 foot diameter. It, therefore, requires a little more cleanup than traditional shaving and is not as good for shaving in the car as I might have hoped.&lt;br /&gt;2. Not good for long hairs. It is very effective at clipping off day-old hairs. As hairs get longer it tends to miss them. This is a self-perpetuating problem. If I shave quickly and leave a few stragglers, there is a lesser chance that these will be clipped off tomorrow than the shorter ones. After a few days I have a few long hairs among a well-shaven face. At that point, I give it a run with the traditional razor which takes care of it. Likewise, if I skip shaving for a few days between workdays, it is pretty much useless, very slow, and somewhat more irritating to my skin than traditional shaving. That said, if I&#x27;m careful to do a thorough job each morning without skipping days, the 8240XL is very effective and quite a bit more time-efficient than my old method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding its limitations and maximizing its benefits, I am happy to make daily use of the Norelco 8240XL supplementing it with traditional shaving at times. Especially considering the low price point, I would recommend the 8240XL with some cautions to those considering it.Understanding its limitations and maximizing its benefits, I am happy to make daily use of the Norelco 8240XL supplementing it with traditional shaving at times.

    <li> This my 4th Norelco shaver is indeed the best ever :corded/cordless-swivel head for navigating the jawline-long lasting battery shavetime with 1 hour recharge(for me that&#x27;s the best of the best)-easy to clean under hot water.Of course the most important feature of a good razor is a clean close shave and this razor delivers.Some folks might want to step up to the next 82 model which alerts you to a low battery charge but that&#x27;s a personal choice.</li>
    <li> I have been using norelco razors for 25 years. My last one, an 8825 lasted about 5 yrs. This one seems to do well, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like it is going very fast. I keep thinking it has a low charge, but even fully charged it is so quiet.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norleco since &#x27;75 and you always know what to expect.  This one seems to be the best I have tried.    Pros:  -----   Very Quiet        Seems to have a better on/off button. Last one failed on that.        The XL Heads seems to do a better job.        Lithium-Ion batteries (according to bottom of box)        Can use hot water to rinse head.        Smaller wall wart.          Cons:  -----   You must move head SLOWLY to get the best cut.        Case won&#x27;t hold recharge cord like on older models.        Not sure pivoting head will last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this razor.  It works well.  It&#x27;s easy to clean. It holds a charge well.  This works even better than my trusty old Norelco (5885XL?).  Anyway.... Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever purchased, I bought a Braum six months ago and it wouldn&#x27;t cut the hairs on my neck and i could never get a close shave, also this razor stays charged for a long time, haven&#x27;t recharged it since I purchased it. Love it.</li>
    <li> Used WAHL trimmer for my left cheek to trim my week-old \\&quot;beard\\&quot;, which I grew to test this product. Then used Philips-Norelco trimmer to trim hair on my right cheek. Neither of those do a good job, but they do it somehow. Then used Philips-Norelco 8240XL shaver (cost $95) to shave. Took longer than usually with a shaver - entire 10-15 minutes instead of 2-3 minutes. When I thought I was done I found long hair on my upper neck which I went through many times with the shaver. The shaver pulls hair even after trimmer job and has a weak motor that does not have enough strong rotation for a fast, close, painless shave. Shaver leaves face red and with whiskers sticking out and a lot to desire. To compare with a $68 Remington 7130 - I&#x27;d rather keep Remington, even if Remington is built sloppy and cheap and it&#x27;s head falls apart (etc.), but at least the Remington does a fast and painless job. Also - I own a 14 year old and top of the line very expensive PHILIPS Philishave, which needs a new head, but the Philips factory in Europe (and USA) refuses to supply me with a new head for it... That&#x27;s the PRICE we pay for \\&quot;patriotic\\&quot; American corporations sending jobs overseas and bringing inferior products in exchange. No more PHILIPS - NORELCO for me! I will be looking for a \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; Japanese brand shaver. Or at least \\&quot;Made in USA\\&quot; one. (8240XL) not recommended.</li>
    <li> Having read all of the positive reviews, I wonder to myself if we&#x27;re talking about the same product.  I admit to being a blade user but all the \\&quot;close as a blade\\&quot; advertising made me decide to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting the nearly impossible packaging open the first thing that sours me is the lack of some kind of rechargeable base or stand I can put the razor into when I&#x27;m done.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like too much to ask for considering this is a $100 product and leaving the razor and a power cord lying around is a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco looks and feels nice in my hand with a nice big on/off switch and it&#x27;s noticably quieter than the Norelco I owned years ago.  The one difference I see now is the entire base rotates up and down as opposed to just the blades in my old shaver.  But looks aren&#x27;t as important as performance in my opinion so let&#x27;s talk about the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say my skin probably hasn&#x27;t been toughened up by constant shaving.  Being self employed, my face has lived the life of luxury as shaving is mostly optional and, when done, it&#x27;s with an electric trimmer for a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  A blade is used only when necessary.  I flip on the Norelco, go to work on my shadow and... YEEEOOWWW!!!  Ripping and tearing through my face like a hatchet through the jungle.  It&#x27;s a bloody mess.  More pain when I put on the aftershave.  I get irritation using a blade but this is so bad the irritation doesn&#x27;t stop even after the aftershave stop burning.  They said it&#x27;d take a while (as long as a month) for your skin to &#x27;adjust&#x27; but they didn&#x27;t say you wouldn&#x27;t be able to show your face in public.  What was shaving with a Norelco like?  Like falling off a motorcycle at 50mph and hitting the pavement, face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I stuck it out for a full month.  Future sessions weren&#x27;t as bloody but they sure did hurt and irritation continues to linger even after applying aftershave.  The frequent yank of hairs being ripped out is not the most pleasant feeling in the world.  Worst of all the resulting shave is certainly not as close as a blade.  I might look shaved but I still feel the bristles.  It&#x27;s a laborious process as well, rubbing over the same hairs over and over as a lot gets missed.  Shaving with an electric takes longer than a blade even with the added time spent applying shaving cream and rinsing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it the college try but after a month I&#x27;m sticking with a blade, thanks.  Gillette&#x27;s Mach II and Mach III razors and some quality shaving cream have done me fine.  I&#x27;m not saving any time using an electric and I&#x27;m in a lot less pain using a blade.st pleasant feeling in the world.  Worst of all the resulting shave is certainly not as close as a blade.

    <li> This is a very good, smooth, and quiet razor.  It works well even on a rough beard.  I like using regular gel shaving cream with this razor.  Just rinse it with warm water.  Gives a nice close shave without razor burn.  This is my third Norelco in 6 six years.  Very good product design.</li>
    <li> I found this product delivers what it promises.     I&#x27;ve owned a Norelco Shaver many years ago and it lasted forever.     For the past 10 years, I have only used a razor, but an opportunity came up to try it again, so I bought this model.  I found it extremely quiet as compared to my old one and it gives me a much closer shave than the older one ever did.    Norelco seems to have improved this product over the years and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take a break from just using a razor and still get a good shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 8240XL about 6 weeks ago and I could not have been happier. I had switched from  Norelco about 3 years ago and opted for the Braun foil shaver, it worked well, but I am glad to be back with Philips Norelco triple head shaver.  Probably the closet shave I have ever had, great product, excellent value for the price. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor about 3 weeks now, have probably used it a dozen times and am still on the first charge.  It runs remarkably quiet &amp; smooth.  I shaved with an older, similar model for many years so my face and I are very much used to this kind of razor.  It will never shave \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;, but is close enough and works well when used every day or every other day with a light beard like mine.  Does not work so well on long whiskers if you have not shaved in several days.  I am still trying to figure out how to properly trim &amp; groom a beard with this thing, but it is my first beard and the problem is probably with me, not the razor.</li>
    <li> He wanted one that was made in Holland like the good &#x27;ol days. Says it cuts like butta.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several electric razors, mostly Norelcos, over the years.  The design remains the same, but they&#x27;ve made it better somehow.  Hard to imagine how their top of the line could be any better than this one.  Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Positives: Quiet. Charge lasts two weeks.   Negatives: No major weaknesses. But the cutting performance is only good, not great.</li>
    <li> I found the Norelco shaver gave a very close and fast shave.  I had previously purchased a Braun which forced me to go over an area many times before all the hairs had been clipped.  I also found the trimmer to be better than the one I had on my previous Norelco.  All in all, I highly recommend the product.  The only downside I have is that I would have liked an LED indicator as to the battery life.  No manufacturer seems to do this anymore, at least not at this price level.</li>
    <li> Initialy i used to feel a bit of iritations but now my skin has accepted this new shaving system.  the best thing is no more cuts now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my son who is in the military and must shave daily.  He has been using it about a week now-and he loves it!  He lives in the cold Northwest and was always complaining how hard shaving was on his face.  Now, it does take some breaking in time-but he feels like his skin is already better.  Thanks  Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> I looked and looked at so many shavers that I think I am shavered out.  I got this one for my boyfriend who said his was getting old.  I looked into the pricer ones and just couldn&#x27;t break down to spend that money.  I read reviews and would get frustrated by the negative ones.  So, I just buckled down and bought this one, because it was in my price range.  My boyfriend loves it.  He says it shaves closer than his previous one (which is also a Norelco).  I was proud of my investment in this and I hope that whoever else decides on this is just as happy.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelcos for years.  They all have given me good shaves.  The surprise is that there is no low battery warning light.  You are in the middle of a shave and it just stops.  Annoying.</li>
    <li> This shaver is an improvement on my older Braun and an older Norelco (stolen in a foreign airport.) The shave is fast and close, the battery is good for two weeks of my shaves.  There is no low-battery indicator.  However, the shaver works with only the cord or recharges enough for one shave in a couple of minutes and fully recharges in an hour as claimed.</li>
    <li> This razor works  great.  Close shave, charge lasts and lasts and it&#x27;s so quiet!!  I am very pleased and would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my Norelco 950RX that I purchased 20 years ago.  My old razer was on its second set of batteries and they wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  Instead of repairing them again I decided to purchase a new one.  Compared to the 950RX, the 8240XL is much lighter and quieter.  Being lighter has taken some getting used to.  The 950RX had a battery charge indicator and a closeness adjustment whereas the 8240XL has neither which is not a huge issue.  The new shaver gives a good close shave and since the initial charge I haven&#x27;t had to recharge and its been over a month!  I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have had many Norelco Razors.  This one is good just like all the rest.</li>
    <li> My Philips Norelco SpeedXL gift has been greatly appreciated.  He loves it!  It gives the cloest shave he has ever had from an electric shaver.  Everything I read in the previous reviews was true.</li>
    <li> Did a bit of research on Norelco shavers before replacing my husband&#x27;s 7000 series model.    This is a step up!  It&#x27;s a better engineered product, with more advanced cutting heads and a better look on top of that.  I noticed right away he didn&#x27;t have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow when he came home.  He commented that it got hairs on his neck he used to have to touch up with a blade.  For about twice the price, you get:  *longer battery life/ very short charge time  *extra pivot point- the whole cutting head can flex, in addition to the 3 individual cutting heads  *more shaving area--what does 50% more cutting surface really mean?  the product is not bigger, there is just less wasted space.  a noticeable improvement over 7000s.  *good travel case (fits shaver only) to prevent scratching.    Don&#x27;t spend any more than this!  You will get an improved product without paying for any extra flashy features.  Get rid of the old HQ8 blades and move on to the HQ9.</li>
    <li> So far very good.  Close shave, very light and very quiet.  Easy to clean, just rinse under running water after using.  The only negative I&#x27;ve found it that the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as on my previous Norelco.  I&#x27;ve gotten about 10 shaves out of this shaver before it needs to be recharged, my previous shaver would last about 21 shaves.  I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a stand to take up a lot of precious space on my bathroom counter, just a cord that you plug in.</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Holds a charge for weeks.  Surprisingly quiet.  Very smooth, comfortable, close shaving action.  The &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; cutting heads have been improved by adding cutting blades to the center portion of the heads.  Haven&#x27;t tried the trimmer yet, but my old one didn&#x27;t work very well and this looks like the same design.  Comfortable and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> The razor gives an excellent close and quick shave.  It&#x27;s lightweight and quiet.  However, one big feature that is unsatisfactory is that it has no low battery indicator light providing the chance of the razor stopping in the middle of a shave.  This is not good if you have taken the razor with you to a remote site without the charger cord.</li>
    <li> Runs very quietly, does a good job, my husband is very pleased, and it was a good price.</li>
    <li> My son who is a marine stationed in Iraq asked me to send him an electric razor. I reviewed many razors and read reviews and this razor appeared to be the best buy for the money. My son said it works great and really appreciated getting it.It works great even in the hot,dusty desert climate.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and rate this product as OK. Even though I was using a similar, lower grade Norelco shaver before, getting the blades used to my chin and hair took 2-3 weeks and now shaves as well as the Gillette Mach 3 razors I was using before, at a fraction of the cost and hassle. The plus points over lower-priced shavers are: this one is made in Holland instead of China, battery charges within one hour and maintans its power for 30 minutes of regukar use. Norelco recommends new blades each year but in my experience, blades lost at least two years.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor that&#x27;s well-designed, convenient to use, surprisingly quiet (compared to my old Braun)and provides a reasonably close shave at a mid-level price point, the Norelco 8240XL would make a good choice.  In addition, it is very portable and, so far, the battery life is impressively long.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t bought a new circular shaver in a while. This is way better than these shavers were a few years ago. Clean shave, quiet operation, very easy to clean!</li>
    <li> He shaves twice a day so he needs a good shaver. He said this was much better than his old one and realy enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> Have used Norelco shavers for many years. This is my fourth. It is a fantastic shaver. While I thought the previous shavers were excellent, this one is a tremendous upgrade. I shaves close with few passes and is very quiet. I really like the wash clean-out feature.I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have had several Norelco shavers oover the years and this gives the best shave of all. Its&#x27; multi-plane floating head really gets the heads to the shaving surface and the heads and blades do the rest. My last Norelco shaver is only three years old bu this new is far superior.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric shavers in the last 45 years and this Norelco is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Unlike other brands I&#x27;ve used, this shaver is very quiet. I get a smooth face with every usage. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been exclusively using Norelco shavers for the past 35+ years. This one is the closest shaver of them all. It works well and holds a charge for at least 15 close shaves. The only problem I can see after using this shaver for a month is that there is no warning when the battery is almost discharged - it just stops working. I plugged it in and continued shaving without further delay.</li>
    <li> I have been using norelco shavers for many years and when the battery of my previous shaver started acting up (could barely hold enough charge for 15mins of shaving), I decided to buy another norelco.    I wanted a shaver that could be cleaned by directly rinsing the head and that was cordless.  I settled on the 8240XL as it seemed a good price-performance trade-off.  I&#x27;m not utterly disappointed but the 8240XL is certainly not a significant improvement over my older norelco that used the HQ5 heads. Specifically, while it shaves slightly faster (rotation speed of the heads is higher, which \\&quot;fixes\\&quot; a long-standing issue with norelco shavers compared to other brands), the HQ9 heads don&#x27;t really provide a closer shave than the HQ5 heads.  As a matter of fact, they do a substantially worse job on the upper lip (I have a hard beard) where after over a month of usage (so it&#x27;s not a question of getting your beard used to it), I have so far not been able to get as close a shave as I used to with the HQ5 heads.  I guess that the \\&quot;fancier\\&quot; layout of holes and slits on the HQ9 is just that, fancier and not better.    Except for this, the shaver is fine.  It does clean easily simply by putting the head under running water.  It recharges reasonably fast, and it appears that one charge does indeed hold 50 mins of shaving time.  The one other shortcoming of notice is that there is no \\&quot;low charge\\&quot; indicator (my old shaver had a display showing the number of shaving minutes left in the battery, which was convenient), which makes knowing when you are about to run out of battery a bit challenging, especially since norelco recommends recharging the shaver only when the battery is nearly depleted.  The next model up does have a low battery indicator, and I would recommend spending the few additional dollars for that model, simply because of the added convenience.</li>
    <li> I have had an earlier version of cordless Norelco shaver.  The new Philips Norelco SpeedXL shaver is a great replacement.  The pop-up trimmer is perfect for grooming and the three floating heads give one a very close and clean cut.  I especially like the pop-up heads that allow for rapid cleaning-out of whisker stubble.  The shape of the razor is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> My previous Norelco razor (6863XL)was purchased around 8 years ago.  It was a great razor that worked well even with the original blades(!).  It started to make noise so after looking at options and reviews I went with the 8240XL.  I was nervous because of the poor reviews some Norelco razors received from loyal customers.  I have been using Norelco for about 30 years.  I have used the 8240XL three times so far and have been disappointed each time.  True, it is quieter and the head pivots nicely.  The bottom line is that it shaves no better (perhaps worse) than my 8 year old razor with the original blades.  As others have noted, the battery level indicator is a step backwards from previous models.  It takes many passes to get a decent shave.  I even recharged it overnight to make sure the battery was full.  Since I have used it, it appears I cannot return it to Amazon.  I plan to return it directly to Philips after I use it for 3 weeks as part of their 45 day guarantee.  I&#x27;ll be looking at Braun and Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This shaver is an improvement over my last Norelco, which was several years old.  New, sharp blades probably have something to do with it, but this shaver has been giving me a much better, closer shave than I&#x27;ve had for quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This is agreat razor for the price.  The battery has lasted over 3 weeks and still hasn&#x27;t needed to be recharged.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Costco on impulse, looked like a good upgrade and a good deal with the extra head.  My last shaver was a discount deal,  similar style but was so wimpy it took a noticeably long time and multiple passes, leaving lots of single hairs, and the motor was so weak it pulled painfully every few seconds.  I wrote it off to the cheap price, you get what you pay for.  What a surprise - this unit has all the same problems! This thing is the most anemic, wimpy shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  The motor seems overloaded with a full charge and as a result pulls painfully every few seconds like the old cheap (corded)one, leaves lots of hairs behind uncut. How much more could it cost to include a real motor and/or battery?  An extra dollar?  These guys know by now how design a razor; chalk up one for the marketeers. Junk in a nice package.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Norelco&#x27;s in this price range fo a very long time. They have, and this one does a great job.  My only observation is that the stubble leaks out a little more than earlier models.  I suspect it has something to do with the pivoting head.  The fixed heads probably had a better seal.  The good news is that you can open this one and wash it out in the sink.  Therefore it is easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to worry about dumping the stubble. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used this shave for 5 months now, and I have to say I&#x27;m not happy with it.  If you let your hair to grow a little bit before shaving (say, over a weekend or 3-4 days vacation), you won&#x27;t like shaving with it.    Neck area is a brutal challenge for this shave. It completely ignores tons of hair on the neck, and only scrubbing it with a side cutter (or whatever it&#x27;s called) will more of less cut the hair about half-way.    Mustaches area, if you let the hair grow there for a couple of days, will be a pain to shave. And I mean \\&quot;pain\\&quot;. From the very start, when blades on it were completely new, it would pinch and tear out the hair from the skin, which is quite painful. Right now every time I shave that area I can&#x27;t help but anticipate the pain that always follows.    I will be throwing this thing away and returning back to a horizontal shave from Panasonic, which was way better.    My recommendation - look elsewhere, this thing shaves like a $10-dollar discount shaver from Ross.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remington for many years, but they&#x27;ve cut back on the variety of products and I needed up change my rotary shaver.  I saw good compliments on this, so I gave it a chance.  Was I glad to get it!  This didn&#x27;t require any \\&quot;break in\\&quot; time--it was a close shave from day one.  It&#x27;s extremely quiet and holds battery power for about 5 days.  I really like being able to plug it in and use it when it does run out--something none of my others would do.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband and he writes: This shaver replaces the \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; norelco that I had for seven years. This Norelco gives me an excellent shave, never chafes my skin,  leaves my skin so soft and is very quiet. There is only a minor concern, occasionally when shaving around my beard it pulls out a whisker. Other than that I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Only complaint would be picture shows coiled cord and it came with a string cord, which is a pain to deal with.  Have been using Norelco shavers for over 50 years and they seem to be making them more costly while taking away the little things that made them great.</li>
    <li> I, like many blossoming professionals had grown up with the Philips brand and its glowing reliability. Now, the only thing radiating is the wave of screaming hair follicles from this face-grinder.   Looking for something that had evolved at the same (and hopefully more balanced) rate as myself, the Philips razor has grown to be become a beautiful looking machine, while degrading to a set of primitive spinning blades on a gimmicky foundation.   I have effectively paid 50% more for the razor than my last one, and in return have a 10% drop in shaving experience, with its inferior trimmer, weak motor and deadly neck trimming performance.  I constantly return to follicles missed, and have doubled my shaving time.   I no longer wonder why Philips has become ever-so-focused on its aesthetic appeal, as their actual performance has reached a mediocre plateau.     Looking to move up to the next best thing in shaving technology? Go all-or-nothing with a premium foil shaver, or save some cash with the reliable cream and blade.</li>
    <li> The 8240XL gives a great shave, but I was disappointed to find it does not give any incation when the battery needs charging. My previous Norelco had lights to indicate the battery condition. I guess they decide to cheapen this model. I wish now I had done more research &amp; purchased the model with a battery indicator.</li>
    <li> So far Philips Norelco shaver is working fine.  Lost charge once without warning.  Recharged and it is now working.  Gave no indication that battery was low!  I rate seller very high.  Product arrived on time and was what I ordered.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my grandson.  It is his first electric razor.  I was tired of hearing him complain about having to shave with a regular razor (The pup has light hair and a beard that is none too thick at this time.  He has had a problem with his chin breaking out where his football helmet chin strap touches his face and his coaches suggested he try an electric shaver). Despite the fact that he only has to shave about ever third or fourth day, the whining emails and text messages became too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wanted a razor that did not cost an arm and a leg but at the same time did not want a hunk of junk.  Things have a way of disappearing in the black hole he calls his dorm room so I did not want to spend a fortune on something that disappeared into the same void as the many other odds and ends have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted something that was simple, simple, simple as my grandson takes after me and is not what you would call mechanically inclined, i.e. he has trouble changing a tire and installing flashlight batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I wanted something inexpensive, workable, easy to use and very easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his use this razor is absolutely perfect.  He has been delighted with it.  The complaining has ceased, he looks quite well groomed and so far has not lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not want for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
    <li> This was my first electric razor.  I had previously been shaving with manual Gilette Fusion razors, so that is my only basis of comparison.  I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin as much as a manual, but as far as closeness of shave, there is no comparison.  The manual razor will give you a much closer shave, but generally the tradeoff will be a bit more redness &amp; irritation, especially if you shave with a manual everyday.  I have been using it for about 3 months now with no major complaints.  It is pretty quiet in action, has a long battery life, and does a pretty good job as an everyday shaver.  It does have difficulty shaving the neck and mustache areas, as I have to go over those areas multiple times to cut the hairs down to a reasonable level.  The sideburn trimmer feature is OK, not great.  But overall, I would say far less irriation than the manual razor.</li>
    <li> I did my research and purchased this razor for my husband.  He couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the close shave and the ease of cleaning.  Also, it seems to hold it&#x27;s charge well.</li>
    <li> I have to take the cleaning head apart to clean so I can get a shave about twice a week. Then I have to keep the cutters separate, and reassemble the head. I am very displeased with this shaver, and would like your comments as to how to resolve this problem.          Edward Schlaich          Lexington, Ma 02421          781-862-1529</li>
    <li> THIS RAZOR IS ALL THAT THEY SAY ABOUT.  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND FOR OVER 59 YR.S   GREAT PRICE TOO!!!! I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I just received my Razor the other day.  As with other reviews getting the razor out of the package is a little bit of a chore.  I did as instructed and let the razor charge overnight even though after an hour, the indicator light was blinking fully charged.  The razor is much quieter than my old norelco razor.  The head pivots which alows for a more closer shave.  The shave itself was smooth and thus far, no irratation to speak of.  Clean-up was easy as you jut pop up the head and rinse with hot water.      There are no bells and whistles (carry case is flimsy and there is no charging stand) and it is as others have stated a basic razor.  But it is such an upgrade from my old norelco in which the batteries were wearing down and the shave was very rough.  So far I am pleased with the shave and at $79.99 on amazon (including shipping) it is very good value for the price.      Thus, if you are looking for a good basic electric razor, this one is a pretty good choice.</li>
    <li> Ordered the norelco speed 8240 for my husband.  He absolutely loves it.  It is easy to use, quick charging and has several different types of cutting blades.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for about 20 years.  I am very happy with the 8240.  I think it gives a slightly closer shave than my previous shaver.  It is very quiet and comfortable to hold. The shave is very comfortable.  It is easy to clean (I do once a week).  Gives more than 2 weeks per charge.  Only problem is that it suddenly stops when the charge is gone without any warning.  However, I understand that it works on cord.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used a electric razor in years and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d like it. To my delight its been the best shave I&#x27;ve had in years. Wish I would have purchased it years ago. The tender skin under the neck is not affected at all. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a close shave.  Ron D.  Bells, TX</li>
    <li> Well I like using an electric.  this one worked great the first few times.  Now a month later I find myself having to go over the same spot a few times to get a smooth shave.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after using a Norelco 7775X for years with great success. The 8240XL, however, is a literally painful disappointment. It snags and yanks hairs on the sensitive areas of my neck. Feels like you&#x27;re getting jabbed by a needle and will quickly jerk you out of a sleepy early-morning haze. Maybe it&#x27;s got something to do with the way they redesigned the combs with all the added little holes instead of full, open combs all the way around each cutter. It also takes more time spent shaving - i.e. multiple passes - to get a close shave. This shaver is truly not worth what I paid for it. I will be sending it back to Philips Norelco per their 45-day guarantee and purchasing a different brand.</li>
    <li> I have had norelco shavers for at least the last 20 years. The models with cord/cordless capability are probably best. Newer models do give a cleaner/closer shave with less skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;A good solid purchase at a reasonable price that will last until battery burnout and then time for a newer model.</li>
    <li> My original review for this razor was not good, however, now that my skin has gotten used to it, I felt obligated to write another review.  The 8240XL comes with a very nice travel pouch and features a pop-up trimmer.  At first, it took my skin some time to adjust to this razor because I was used to using the Cool Skin model (wet shave).  Eventually, I decided to try the Lectric pre-shave lotion and since then, this razor has been excellent.  I have very sensitve skin, so I need to use the lotion.  For only $5 or $6 you can get a bottle with lots of lotion and it will last a long time.  For anyone with sensitive skin, that is what I recommend.  This razor now gives me a smooth shave and I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and when my last one stopped working I looked again on line for another one primarily for travel. (I have 2)    This one works well as I expected, but there are a couple of improvements that you might consider.    1) You advertise a larger area of the shaving head to cut more at a time.  I found that the area around the blades is too wide  that it hinders my shaving next to my nose.    2) This one worked for a long time after my first charge, but it has no blinking red light to let me know when my next charge is necessary.  It just died.  This is hardly something I want to happen on my next camping trip where there is no electricity to plug into. I&#x27;ll have to remember to charge before any trip I take.     Otherwise it is a great, comfortable shave.  Tom</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband when his last electric razor died.  We both like the results of this one and he reports that it is smooth and easy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for 4 months, and it took a while to learn how to better use it for my skin. I have a very sensitive skin, when I shave wet I can only shave downwards, otherwise my skin gets very irritated. I bought this shaver because, as I have to shave everyday for professional reasons, doing it wet was not good either.  The electrical razor is less aggressive to the skin. After a month adapting to it and finding out how to shave, I found out that, even though it&#x27;s an electrical shaver, I must also shave only downwards or from the left to the right and vice-versa, not upwards. It&#x27;s not as close as wet shaving, but it fits my needs well because I can shave everyday and get a decent look without getting my skin irritated. For those in my situation, a very practical choice!    PS: As everybody here knows (and Norelco should also), the lack of battery life indicator is a downside...</li>
    <li> works a lot better than the cheaper norelco and holds charge for awhile no indicator when charge is getting low.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]    Previously I was using a Norelco Razor 5885XL for 8 years and things started to fail, so I replaced it with a Philips Norelco Speed 8240.  I have been using it for a month and it is a pleasure to use.  I have not had to recharge it yet after 25 days of use. It gives me a close shave but not so close that it leaves your face burning.  It is very easy to clean, pop the heads open and run under running water for 30 seconds or so, then set it up and let it dry.  The razor has a nice feel when you pick it up, light, but fits the hand perfectly. It is quiet and gives the impression that the motor is weak but when it hits the heavy places in my beard, it doesn&#x27;t slow and leaves my face nice and smooth. The razor has a tilt head that dramatically helps getting a close shave when compared to my old razor. This is in addition to three rotary heads that move independently to contour to your face.  I think it is a great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought the 8240XL for my Dad for Fathers Day and he loves it!!! It gives him a close comfortable shave.  I own the 8260XL and the reason I did not get him that model is because I knew he would not use the Jet Clean System.  This razor is very good for my Dad, but as for me it&#x27;s a different story!  I collect Norelco Electric Razors.  I have the Spectra James Bond Razor, the Smart Touch XL with the minute display, and the Arcitec 1050cc with the Jet Clean System, and the 8260XL with the Jet Clean System.  Now which one shaves the best?  First, unlike my Dad, I have a heavy dark beard and I have to shave every morning and sometimes in the afternoon to keep from getting a shadow.  For me, all of these razors shave ok, just ok, never as close as a blade!, but the best of these razors are the Spectra James Bond Razor and the Smart Touch XL.  These two razors shave pretty close.  The 8200 series is ok, and I will leave it at that.  The razors in the 8200 series  are all pretty much the same except as you move up the line you get more bells and whistles. All the razors in the 8200 series shave the same.  I shave with the Arcitec 1050cc and the 8260XL and rotate between the two. At present, they are doing a pretty good job, but sometimes I  bring my other razors out of retirement.  I like to use Mennen Afta Pre Electric Loation and a little talc powder which helps me to achieve a close comfortable shave. Williams Lectric Shave is too greasey.  After shaving, I put on a little Mennen Afta After Shave Skin Conditioner or Nivea Post Shave Balm which helps my skin from becoming dry. I do not get razor burn from any of these electric razors. I do like the Jet Clean System that came with my Arcitec 1050cc and 8260XL.  I always wash out my razors before I use them in the cleaning system which helps to save on the cleaning solution.  The cleaning solution last about a month and it can be purchased at Walmart or you can have it delivered right to your door every month by purchasing it from Amazon. Norelco has been a trad in my family for years.  My Dad, Grandfathers and Great Grandfathers all shaved with Norelco Electric Razors.  I&#x27;m 47 and I have been shaving with them for the most part since I started shaving.  I have had problems with Norelco though.  There have been times when a relatively new Norelco Razor would just quit on me, but I am happy to say that Philips Norelco ALWAYS replaced the defective razor!  If you want to get a close comfortable shave stick with Norelco.  Shaving with Norelco Electric Razors is better then the mess of soap and water and you don&#x27;t have to buy blades and shaving cream all the time.-Michaelit from Amazon.

    <li> This particular Speed replaced a base-model, roughly 4-year old Quadra.....now relegated to occasional use on my son&#x27;s 15YO chin.....and I&#x27;m neither terribly excited nor disappointed with it.      The 8240XL is not as physically sturdy as its predecessor.....which really is no surprise as older designs are \\&quot;updated\\&quot;......and I&#x27;m still getting used to its feel in my hand (more angular, and marginally smaller, than the old Quadra).  I also note no evidence the Speed head design has contributed much of anything to the shaving action versus its older counterparts.  But, at the end of the day, it does the job for which it&#x27;s intended;  and that&#x27;s really all I can ask.    I also picked it up at an EXCELLENT price.  Amazon&#x27;s price at the time was &lt;$80.....the price is now in the low 90&#x27;s, much closer to the typical retail price.....PLUS another 15% off with an E-coupon.  With free shipping, I paid under $70; a SERIOUS bargain for a current model (and about the same as I paid for the old Quadra on Walmart clearance 4-years ago).  Had I paid $90+ for the unit, there&#x27;s decent chance I&#x27;d have de-rated it by one star.    One more point;  it&#x27;s my opinion that the Norelco rotary design is more effective on comparatively soft (or perhaps somewhat curly) whiskers.  If one&#x27;s whiskers are extremely stiff, I believe a foil-style (like a Braun) might be a better match.      As an exclusive Braun user for 20 years.....and exclusively Sunbeams before that.....I took a flyer on the aforementioned Quadra to see how Norelco would work.  It gave me a better shave with 3 year old blades than a Sunbeam or Braun EVER gave me right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I decided to make a switch from traditional razors to the Norelco electric.  I read a lot of reviews, did a lot of research, and decided to go mid-level price and features with this model.  The instructions say to give the electric at least 21 days for your skin to get used to the change.  I did, and I am back to shaving with a traditional razor.  Not only did the electric leave my face still feeling rough, it was more work and much more time consuming based on the fact that I had to go over some areas over and over and over again to get missed stubble or single whiskers.  In addition, the small hairs make a mess of the bathroom counter.  The motor seems cheap and doesn&#x27;t have much power.  I am returning the product and will be returning back to shaving in the shower with my trusty old razor.  For those of you who have always shaved using a razor and now have decided to try electric, I wouldn&#x27;t go to the trouble.  You&#x27;ll never get as smooth or as nice of a shave...and the electric takes twice as long.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality control. Received it as a gift for Xmas 2008. Replaced first one in March. Second one in June. So 3 units in 6 months. It&#x27;s September now and I have the same problems as the last 2. Luckily it&#x27;s fairly easy to get a new one under warranty, just call them up and they ship you a new one.    It appears as though the motors keep burning out. I charge exactly like the manual states (12 hours first charge) and use the unit until there is no power left. Then I recharge for an hour till the light starts blinking. The last two units have had ZERO water run in them as I thought that was the problem with the first one (even though the manual states that is how you clean the unit). I use the unit 3-4x a week so we&#x27;re talking AT MOST under 50 shaves per razor and then it croaks.    Horrible product, avoid. Had my last Norelco razor for half a decade and it still works, guess I&#x27;ll just buy a new head for it.</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought a better Quality shaver this my 3rd shaver from this Mfg. the others shaved better and gave a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely thrilled with the quality and amazingly quiet effective performance of this shaver.  It has been 20 years since I last bought a Philips, and although I liked my old model, the advances in technology by Philips have been incredible.      This shaver gives me a close comfortable shave which I thought was only possible with a wet shave - and without the nicks, cuts, and time-consuming application of foam soaps.  No more putting off shaving - I enjoy it now!  I like the quiet operation, and the impressive duration that the battery stays charged.  I also like how hair stays inside the shaver, and being able to flip the top, and wash the heads out after a shave.  The pivoting heads are an advancement, allowing much better contact with the skin&#x27;s contours.  The shaver comes with a soft little carry bag with a cleaning brush, and a  manual.  It needs a 12 hour charge before using the first time, even though the charging light may blink after an hour.    Well done, Philips!  It&#x27;s nice to know that there are still such high quality products out there!</li>
    <li> An excellent shave for the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times, but it is so much better than what I was shaving with before. I used to shave with disposable, plastic 2 or 3 blade shavers, and they give you a good close shave, but you have to put on the shaving cream, etc. and it is kind of a pain (and can take awhile). I also had a Panasonic ES4025 electric razor that I occasionally used, but was hard to use and didn&#x27;t give a good shave. This new Philips Norelco 8240xl is light years ahead of the Panasonic. You will get a really good shave. And importantly, it is very quick. I probably can finish shaving 2 or 3 times faster than before, and it is much less cumbersome --- think of the time you&#x27;ll save over the life of the razor! Maybe if you spend more you can get an even better shaving experience, I don&#x27;t know, but for me this is currently a great shaving solution. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Norelco 66??XL that had done me well for about the last six years or so. My old one still gave an ok shave but the battery was becoming very unreliable. The first two things that hit me with the 8240XL was the lightness of the shaver and how quiet it is. Matter of fact, it is so quiet that I first thought it didn&#x27;t have the power to do a good job. A month in and the low noise level still impresses me each day. The shave is also improved over the older model. The heads seem to have more pivot and so hug the curves better. Closeness is improved a little but I typically replaced the heads on my older model pretty regularly to maintain a pretty close shave all the time. You&#x27;ll always (unless you&#x27;re one of those guys who just can&#x27;t get a decent shave with an electric) notice a closer shave with new heads so I guess it is just a matter of how long they provide that closeness. I wouldn&#x27;t say that this model cut my shaving time or requires significantly less passes but I am pleased with the performance. I&#x27;ve used Norelco electrics for many years and they&#x27;ve always worked well for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/12/12):  Nearly three years and this Norelco is still going strong. Of course I have had to replace the blades once or twice but the battery life is as good as when I bought it which is about a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and as expected.  It is the quietest electric razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> I like my new Norelco shaver.  It does a good job, giving a close smooth shave and it does not make a loud noise.</li>
    <li> This is a no nonsense shaver that works great.  My husband needed a good travel shaver and this one is perfect. Easily made purchase.</li>
    <li> I should say, \\&quot;It selectively gives a close shave\\&quot;, as in, it gets some parts of my face completely shaved, and other parts, it seems to have difficulty shaving at all. Overall, i rank it as a three star device because it gets enough that if I&#x27;m on the go, i wont be disappointed, but realistically, if you are looking for a quality shave, you will still need a normal razor when you are done with this one to finish the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those items where you should really look at non-vine reviews as well. I think the viners were so happy to have a free shaver that they forgot they were supposed to review this thing properly. Or, perhaps the shaver has just lowered in quality over the last three years since it was released. Dunno.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Razor as a gift for someone who had owned one many years ago. He really liked the new one, so it was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this shaver. I own two older Norelco&#x27;s (5800 series) and they seem to run at faster speed and shave better than the new 8240. Also, the unit comes with an external (charger) power supply which is a nuisance, instead of just a cord. With the older shavers, you could pack your cord and shaver into the pouch they give you which is great for traveling, but with this 8240 model, you can&#x27;t do that so you have to remember to pack both the shaver and separate power supply. The fact that I can rinse the shaver under the faucet is no big benefit and did not affect my decision to purchase this model.    This is probably my last Norelco shaver purchase unless they eliminate the external power supply and use a faster shaver motor. I don&#x27;t care what it costs - I just want a good shave every morning with my electric razor.</li>
    <li> My old shaver died and when Amazon offered this one for about half its normal price, it seemed like the smart thing to do.  The shaver works well, although it does not provide as close a shave as that of a blade razor.  To be fair, however, Norelco says you must train your beard and not switch back and forth between blade and shaver to achieve the best results.  For the mornings I don&#x27;t wish to lather and shave, it offers a quick alternative that works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve not used this razor yet, but I checked it out, turned it on, etc.  It seems to be a quality build razor that will last for some time.  When I use it thoroughly, I would be happy to do a follow up review.</li>
    <li> I owned an older norelco before buying this razor. The new razor provided a extra close and comfortable shave. Being extra quite was a bonus. Great improvment over the old razor. A real bargin for the price.</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing the Philips Norelco 8240XL, I considered the 8260 model that included the cleaning stand and battery charge remaining indicator, but didn&#x27;t think it was worth $60 more.  The product arrived in that impossible-to-open-without-impaling-yourself plastic packaging, but I managed to get the contents out without losing a digit.  The shaver feels sturdy and well made, easy to clean and maintain, and is probably one of the better electric shavers on the market.  The problem is the length of hair it leaves behind.  Immediately after using the shaver my facial hair was long enough to grab and pull out with my index finger and thumb.  I estimate it is the equivalent length of 16 hours after shaving with my manual razor.  Granted, I have not found any electric shaver that is satisfactory, and I gave the product 2 stars because I am certain it is good as far as electric shavers go. I desire a stubble-free smooth close shave which in my experience this product cannot provide, so I&#x27;m returning it for a refund and will stick to my Gillette manual razor.</li>
    <li> The reazor works well. However it does not really cuts as much as it is advertised.  It is supposed to cut three times as fast as a single line of blades. However it does not.  It is quite but very slow. It does not have speed. I spend almost the same time as I did with my old,  single cutting line Norelco.  I would not recommend it. DO not waste your money on this. Get something better.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old Norelco 8000 series shaver whose battery died on me completely a year ago. I have lost a lot of hair since I had my original electric razor so I bought this to not only shave my beard but also my entire head. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.    Pros:  * good close shave (after a short week of adjustment);  * quiet motor;  * battery lasts long (just under a week) between charge cycles;  * quick charging (1.5 hrs for a full charge);  * no mess/collects cut hair in small reservoir;  * reservoir easy to clean;    Cons:  * not very portable (size wise) though much lighter than my old unit;  * wish case had a small pocket for the cleaning brush;    Bottom line, I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this shaver (Philips Norelco 8240) to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good hassle-free shave.</li>
    <li> Just for context, I am a picky shaver (one who shaves) with sensitive skin and a round, slightly chubby face. I also shave against the grain for a very close shave. I used to shave with a razor, but got tired of cutting myself. :-)  I first got a Panasonic ES8077S. It worked well, but pinched me too much and gave me cuts (I now know this was because I was using it wet). Shave was about 90% as close as using a razor in the shower.  I switched to a Remington MS680CS for the past year and it was fine. Noisy, but OK. Cheaper than the others. Shave (dry) was about 70% as close as using a razor.  Then I got tired of the level of stubble I had at night and decided to try something new. So I got a Norelco Speed 8240. It was VERY quiet, but the shave was worse. Shave (dry) was about 55% as close as using a razor. I&#x27;ve tried going in circles, going slow, going fast, pushing hard, pushing slightly, etc. It&#x27;s just not as close. I have a round, slightly chubby face, but I&#x27;d heard that Norelcos are BETTER than foil shavers with my kind of face.  I&#x27;ve gone back to Panasonic.</li>
    <li> I bought this electric shaver to replace an older model I had bought from Singapore, which I had for about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has good charging time, about an hour, and runs for a month if used twice a week. Also, its not noisy at all and it&#x27;s cleaning mechanism is also very easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s razors are not sharp enough to shave off my hair in one sweep, it takes about 2 to 3 swipes for me to clean off hair, but even then a few tiny hair remain on the sides. It is only good for shaving off hair around corners, like your chin. Other than that, I only use it for general cleaning and sometimes still use my older model since that one cleans off all hair in one sweep, although it creates lot of noise.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco rechargeable, and I end up using them until the battery doesn&#x27;t take a charge and moving on figuring other components could use replacement as well.  I will admit that my last Norelco seemed to be in good enough shape where replacing the battery would be worthwhile so I ordered one and attempted to replace it myself...no go.  Turns out you have to be very good with a soldering gun and even them it&#x27;s tricky.  Ended up trashing the circuit board and wasted $5 on a battery.   Anyway, as far as the 8240, I&#x27;ve had it about six months and use it daily.  It doesn&#x27;t have quite the heft of my previous Norelcos but seems like it will hold together.  The ability to wash the shaver down with water is a plus but it does leave a coating of \\&quot;shmutz\\&quot; inside the workings that you&#x27;ll deal with when you finally break the shaver down to clean the heads and the assembly pieces (which they recommend monthly).    Norelco offers so many different models your head will spin when you try to choose.  I got this one because it was in stock and I needed it right away.  The 8240 has a pivoting head that looks kind of cool but it adds mechanical complexity and I&#x27;m not sure it  really makes the shave better.  My previous ones had fixed heads and that seemed fine as far as following facial contours.    One thing this model doesn&#x27;t have is an indicator for when the battery needs to be recharged, and I notice now that some of their cheaper models do have that feature---and it&#x27;s good to have.  The 8340 runs and runs, never slowing down RPMs like my old shaver then all of a sudden it just stops dead and you have to charge it-- no warning, no extra time.  I suspect this has to do with a different battery type, maybe Li?  A good feature probably common to other Norelcos is the quick charging time, and you can shave with it as it&#x27;s charging even if it was dead when you plugged it in.  Overall it&#x27;s a good shaver, I worry a little about durability due to light weight and more plastic components, it&#x27;s lacking a low battery indicator, and the cost is a little high with competing Norelco models at lower price points with some good features.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver.. Does everything it claims to do... Love the fact that you can wash it under the sink... Had a foil shaver before and had to buy containers of cleaner at 12 dollars a pop.... Hooray for Norelco....</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Norelco in 25 years.  It is quiet, shaves very quickly and closely. My previous 12 year old Norelco still works well and I use it when on trips.  I bought this one for daily use at home and because the price was right and I received free shipping.  It was nice to see that it was made in Holland - distributing the world&#x27;s workforce!</li>
    <li> My husband had bought the older model of this razor about 6 years ago. It had lasted amazingly well and I&#x27;m sure he would have continued to use it if I had not damaged the cord with the vacuum cleaner. I bought him this one as a replacement and he has been very happy with it as well. If you want a long-lasting razor that consistently works well this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband.  The Phillips Norelco 8240 is very quiet and easy on his face, but it takes him up to 35 minutes to get a decent shave.  Since shaving requires so much time, recharging is needed after only 3 shaves rather than after 17 as advertised.  Also, when using the trimmer, it is necessary to go over the same area many times before the hair has been cut satisfactorily.</li>
    <li> Because of some surgery affecting my face, I had to quit using a wet blade system. The Norelco brand seemed best becasue of the floating heads that conform better to the hills and valleys of my new facial features. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 8 months and, after an inital adjustment period, am quite pleased. The charge lasts about 2 weeks. The shave is not as close as a blade, but is certainly acceptable. I use Williams pre-share, which also helps. I gave it a 4 rather than 5 stars because it&#x27;s not as good trimming the beard at the bottom of my side burns. The built in trimmer only is good for cutting back the hairs on the side burns. I like being able to rinse clean. The directions recommend overhauling the shaver head about once a month by dismantling and rinsing in alcohol, so there is a maintenace issue. Recommend for good value electric razor.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas last year, and I love it. I use it almost daily. It has a water-resistant design and the head opens to dump shavings. Each of the three individual shaving heads can be removed for cleaning, and it features a flip-out trimmer. Again, I love it.</li>
    <li> My husband still cannot believe the shaving ability of this Norelco.  He has always used Norelco&#x27;s in the past and this one by far exceeds all the others he has had!  First is the quietness. He thought the shaver wasn&#x27;t working at first until he felt his face. Amazing! And second, because of such a close shave he seems to think he only has to use it every other day.  (I will be the judge of that...)</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and its easy for my skin to get irritated with a close shave. This shaver is fantastic at giving me a close shave without the irritation i get from other shavers. Its also incredibly quiet, pretty well built, and the battery lasts a very long time.    I&#x27;ve had it for a month and a half. Since i primarily work from home i don&#x27;t have to shave each day. Usually every second or third day. In the last month and a half i&#x27;ve only had to recharge it once and that was yesterday.     As i have to take trips overseas every couple months, and for a week or two at a time, its refreshing to have a shaver that will hold a charge in my checked bag and give me great shaves the entire trip. One last bonus is the power supply runs on 120-230v 50/60hz. So with a $2 plug adapter for whatever region i am in i can charge it anywhere in the world if i need to extend my stay.    I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there&#x27;s no battery life indicator on it. I still highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> does its job but slowly, probably due to a slow and weak motor. very quiet, gentle on my skin. the battery is good, lasts for many sessions. overall, good for not so close shave and probaly not good enough for guys with thick stubble.</li>
    <li> Initially, my husband loved his shaver, but it didn&#x27;t hold up very long.</li>
    <li> i really don&#x27;t know. i bought as a present. i don&#x27;t know something about this item. i did&#x27;t hear something from my friend.</li>
    <li> I think the multiple floating head concept is way over rated in that my first Norelco, many years ago, cut about the same as this one.  I do not like the grip on this model as much as another model I presently have.  The charge does hold for a long period, however, a warning that batteries were nearly expired would be ideal, rather than simply dying in the middle of a shave.</li>
    <li> The razor was to my surprise much better than expected. After about a week of my skin getting used to it (I used a Braun foil razor before) and me learning how to use it well I managed to achieve much closer cuts than the previous razor with less irritated skin in comparable time. Definitely a recommended buy if that&#x27;s the price range You&#x27;re looking at.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  After juggling all types of shaving cream, all types of razors, frequently having to buy normal razor blades (I watched some idiot deluded into thinking he was a genius by cleaning his normal razor blades on his jeans, on youtube, when electric razor is so superior).    Anyways, this saves time.  It&#x27;s simple.  I shave more frequently (daily) because it&#x27;s so simple and fast.  I still can&#x27;t believe for how many years I lathered up with shaving cream and spent 4-5 times as long on shaving. Granted, if I want an extremely close shave I may use a razor, but I&#x27;m fairly certain that I haven&#x27;t used a normal razor since getting this 10 months ago.      It&#x27;s immensely resourceful.  When I cut my own hair, the trimmer feature trims sideburns and back of hair so I (with my pocket-knife, and yes, this sounds absurdly rugged, but I have two mult-use devices that work great for differnet tasks, I can give myself a full haircut that looks amazing and awesome with trimmings iwth this).    I use the trimmer to shape, thin out and trim moustache, too.     The only reason why I&#x27;ve debated 4 or 5 stars is I wish the shave could be a bit closer.  It&#x27;s hard to shave where the neck meets jaw not because of design, just because of contour (my face / jaw / neck is slightly angular-gaunt making for a slightly sharper angle and thus more challenging shave, but still) this device rocks.  It&#x27;s smoothly replacd the absurdly antiquated hassle of old razorblades.  I scoff at people who use those (and scoff at myself for using old razorblades for so long).      4.5/5 stars. (rounded up lol).</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the Norelco shaver I had had for about five years except for the fact that recharging it had to be done weekly. The attraction of this model was the lithium ion battery which is advertized to last 17 days. I have now had the new razor for a month and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge!</li>
    <li> I started using this shaver 25 days ago, and just ran out of charge today. Impressive. It&#x27;s very quiet, fast, and gives great results (I&#x27;m still pretty smooth shaven 6 hours later). It can be cleaned quickly--just a rinse under hot running water. No problems and no complaints so far. This is my third Norelco shaver, and by far the best.  Downsides are more annoying than important. Getting the package open is not a job for the faint-hearted. It takes a *strong* pair of scissors, a certain amount of sweat, and a modicum of strong language. And the included case is chintzy nylon with no padding and is too small to hold both the shaver and the charging cord. If you want to travel with it, this may not be a minor issue. Fortunately, I still have the case from my first Norelco, which has enough room for both.</li>
    <li> We brought this shaver as a christmas gift for my brother-in-law, it arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Works good and would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 10 yr old 67xx series.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like how slow it cut.  Sometimes I had to go over certain areas like 2 or 3 times.  But then I noticed I had a lot less razor burn than before and more importantly, less tugging at my longer hairs.  Tradeoffs are well worth it.</li>
    <li> It just arrived.  WOW.  SO much better than my previous Norelco (which was itself a massive leap over the one before it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the most-striking improvements (which are no doubt better detailed in other reviews):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- in addition to the individual heads being free to track your face, the entire three-head assembly pivots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- much quieter than earlier generation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- seems to cut much closer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no snagging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(and that&#x27;s just after a single use.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t been sure about this purchase, as it seemed a bit expensive (even though this model seems to have dropped in price considerably since it first came out.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the moment I started using it, my only regret was that I&#x27;d waited so long before dumping the old one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally, 100% thrilled with this purchase (and even Amazon&#x27;s free shipping was incredibly fast.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;____________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October, 2012 Addendum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Norelco says you need to replace the blades every year, mine lasted three years.  Almost exactly at the 36 month mark, the shaves started missing hairs and taking much longer.  Replacing the blades made the unit perform like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(ie, I&#x27;m still thrilled with the product.)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as good as my old 5861 XL.  Needs battery indicator.  When you open the head to clean every thing falls out.  Blades don&#x27;t lock in place.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and thought I bought it for $62.00.  Bill for $69 came with product.  My brother bought same shaver from Target with $20 coupon in paper for almost $20 less than Amazon.  Amazon would not honor coupon.  My husband seems to like it; says it shaves closer than his last Norelco.  But. like other reviews, the popup trimmer is useless.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco for 15+ years.  I normally replace blades but they are very expensive.  I decided to try the Mod. 8240.  It made a world of difference.  Closer shave, easier to use.  I could not be more pleased with this razor. A year ago I purchased a Remington foil shaver-it was nothing compared to the Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for yrs and after about 12 yrs needed a new one.   The 8240 works well, stays charged for about 2 wks, and shaves nicely.   The one gripe that I have is that the shaver head pops open about half the time when you remove the plastic head cover, spilling shavings over the bathroom counter.   Annoying.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for just over a month now and am quite satisfied. I mostly shave everyday, but sometimes go scruffy for a couple of days, and at this point I have not had to recharge the razor yet. I have a moderately heavy beard, so when Im shaving after a few days there is a little bit of pull, but not so much different than a straight blade. My previous razor was a Remington, which still works but would need new blades and battery. So I updated! The Norelco does shave closer than my Remington (age), and the rinse and air dry cleaning is so easy. If you&#x27;re used to electic razors, then the transition to this razor is nothing. For straight blade users it might take a bit to get used to.</li>
    <li> Bought this one to replace an older top of the line Norelco shaver and I can&#x27;t believe hqw quickly and quietly it shaves. The only improvements would be a larger carrying case, big enough to hold the charging cord and a warning light when the battery is getting low but if the battery runs out while you are shaving you can just plug in the charging cord and finish shaving. You have to plug it in to recharge it anyway. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My razor came without the instuction booklet; fortunately, I had a booklet from similar razors I have owned.  This razor cost me less than similar razors I have bought from any military BX/PX, and it works great.  A good, close shave without setting the skin on fire.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get near the shave with this model that I got from my previous Norelco shaver.  This unit really feels like a child&#x27;s toy rather than a man&#x27;s tool.  It is very light weight and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t retract snugly into the body.  The way the trimmer moves under my finger pressure while shaving bugs the heck out of me.  No stand for this model either and the motor speed is incredibly slow.  The slow speed tends to make it pull some hairs rather than cut them.  The only reason that I bought this shaver was because my old one no longer holds a good charge.  Nonetheless, I have gravitated back to using my old model even though I often have to use the cord.  The packaging is so robust on this new model that you don&#x27;t really know what you&#x27;ve got until you spend 15 minutes opening the carton.  I will never buy another Norelco unless I can first hold it in my hand.  In the meantime, I am headed to Batteries R Us to see if I can get a replacement for the battery in my old shaver.</li>
    <li> This Norelco Speed 8240 shaver gives an excellent close shave. I like how quiet it is compared to some of the other brands. Very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> I like the quietness and lightness of the unit.  Actually, both surprised me when I took it out of the box and used it for the first time.  I have never been able to get as close a shave with an electric razor as I have been getting with the 8240.  Frankly, I did not think it was possible.  That was a nice surprise.  On the downside there is no way of knowing when the battery is getting low and you are encouraged not to recharge until it is low in power.  About two weeks after I started using it and without warning it stopped which meant I was out of power.  I wish I had known it was coming.  The company recommends 17 days between charges but how do you keep track of such a detail when there are so many other details one needs to track that seem much more important than thinking about the razor battery.  Otherwise I like the unit and pleased that I bought it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Good close shave with out the irritation of older electric razors. Price was right, excellent value. I would highly recommend for someone looking to purchase a razor.</li>
    <li> This is a very good razor.  I had an older model and never had a problem, but it ended it\\&quot;s life.  I thought about going with a different brand, but I like the three rotary disk, and the shave is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I was nerveous switching from a DE blade razore to an electric.  But, I get a shave that every bit as close as my DE blade....... Very mild adjustment irritation that is now gone after a week of use.    Buy one today.</li>
    <li> Just received this shaver as a Christmas present. First use and it gives a VERY close shave. I think many of the complaints are from people who are pressing too hard (it only needs a light touch, let the shaver do the work) or are trying to finish shaving too quickly. I&#x27;ve been using an old Braun that has a bad foil and worn blades and this is a major improvement. I hope the shaver has a long lifespan as I like it a lot. I have a tough beard and it cut through a 3 day growth with ease.</li>
    <li> This is the second Norelco shaver I bought. The last one I bought 4-5 yrs ago and worked pretty well.  I expected the new model to be much better, however despite  the claims it is only marginally better. The shave is slightly closer but takes the  same amount of time. Underneath the chin is still a problem. Recharge time is    better - 1 hr or so and battery life is better (recharge needed after 2 weeks).</li>
    <li> If your face and/or neck is easily irritated by shaving, you should try this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first Philips 3 head shaver several years ago because it could be used in the shower and supposedly was gentle on the skin. Even with the best disposables, My neck always turned red after shaving and I routinely suffered bumps and cuts. I had to use after shave balm or my skin would sting for hours after shaving. I&#x27;d tried a previous foil type electric and that was painful, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first Philips 3 head model I got was the \\&quot;Coolskin\\&quot; model with the little Nivea shaving gel packet inserts. The gel was released through the shaver head with a push button. I found it to be much more gentle on my skin than disposables. The push button was handy, too. But, it took about 10 minutes to get a good shave (vs. 3 minutes with a disposable) because only the outer rings of the heads were shaving areas. Since it was an improvement, I kept it for a few years. Finding the Nivea packets became difficult, plus it was a drag to run out of shaving gel in the middle of a shave while standing in the shower. I ended up buying some non-foaming shave gel and that worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the battery life dropped considerably on the Coolskin model, I bought the SpeedXL. I found it to be just as gentle on my skin, but since the whole head was a shaving area, it dramatically cut shaving time. When the heads became dull after a year, I replaced them. After 2 years, the battery life dwindled to the point where I had to charge it every day. That&#x27;s when I looked to replace it. After shopping a lot online, I bought another 8240XL. When it came time to replace that unit, I shopped again and decided to try one of the fancy skinny Philips Norelco models for twice the price. I saw no benefit except that it was thinner and lighter, which wasn&#x27;t worth the extra cost to me. I returned it and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few weeks, I use a good disposable on my face to get it really close.  Overall, I am happy with this unit. It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as a good disposable and it takes a bit longer, but I can live with that. It&#x27;s not worth the pain to get a faster, closer shave. It seems to be the best you can get for the money. I hear the upper end Brauns are better, but, I&#x27;m not willing to spend that kind of money.eally close.  Overall, I am happy with this unit.

    <li> Great shave from the Norelco 8240.  Quiet, compact, holds  charge for a long time.  Cleaning is easy using tap water.</li>
    <li> What a disappointment to pay nearly $90 for a razor and find it doesn&#x27;t have a low battery warning.  Norelco will find me searching out competitive products the next time around.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. Long battery cycles between charges. Does not pull at all and gives a smooth, close shave. I have somewhat sensitive skin and I have no problems with this Philips Norelco Speed XL 8240XL razor. I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver. The biggest complaint I have is that it doesn&#x27;t have any mechanism to warn you before the battery runs out. However, when it does run out, you can simply plug it in and continue shaving.</li>
    <li> This Shaver is better than the expensive triple and 4 blade expensive blades. I figured I would spend $180.00 a year for the expensive gillette blades. This Razor cost about 89.00 on Amazon, and I will probably not replace it for 5 years, and at today&#x27;s prices of blades thats a savings of $812.00 on blades not including shave cream. It&#x27;s worth the price and the comfort.</li>
    <li> I had an older speed XL shaver and thought it was a little underpowered.  I bought an Arcitec and didn&#x27;t like it at all.  I recently got the new 8240 and love it.  I get the closest shave ever.  There is nothing I dislike about this one.  If I go the weekend without shaving I have no problem cutting through the next Monday morning. Get this one with confidence.</li>
    <li> This new SpeedXL replaces my 20 year old Norelco razor of similar design.  This razor is wonderfully light and feels like nothing in your hand.  It operates for about twice as long before needing a charge.  Cleaning is a snap.  The bottom line is that it shaves competently and expeditiously.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 8240 is an excellent shaver.  It holds the charge real well&lt;br /&gt;and gives a nice close shave.  Highly recommend.  RCCJR</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for nearly 40 years, and I&#x27;m sorry to say, they don&#x27;t seem to be getting better than they were back then.  They&#x27;re prettier and sleeker, but they don&#x27;t cut any better, or maybe even as good.    I believe this is supposed to be Philips top of the line razor.  I&#x27;m just going to say it isn&#x27;t much better than the near bottom of the line Philips that I bought a few years ago.  The $49 price is right for sure, and it will cut your beard, but don&#x27;t expect to be knocked off your feet by the job it does.  It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
    <li> This is a good shaver without bells and whistles.  Unless i have done something incorrectly, i don&#x27;t think there is a way to know when the charge is getting low.  The shaver works at full speed and when the charge is gone, it just stops.  There is no \\&quot;slowing down\\&quot; of the shaver. Notwithstanding, it shaves great.  I would buy another.</li>
    <li> For many years, I was a higher end Braun or Panasonic shaver user, using it on my babyface and then blade shaving to finish while in the shower, which in honesty, gives you the closest possible nick-free shave without paying a barber to do it.    About a year ago, I was given a 6340XL, which did a pretty good, if not fast, job, is reasonably quiet and pretty low irritation. For the money it turns out that it sells, a great deal, very decent shaver... which is still working fine and will be a \\&quot;losable\\&quot; travel shaver.    The 8240 is a SUBSTANTIAL UPGRADE in the quality of the shave, and I noticed the difference in the very first shave... and the machine is obviously not yet broken in. It definitely cuts faster, though that can be attributed to sharper blades to a degree. My shaving is equivalent to 1/3 the amount most guys shave, so I&#x27;m easy on the shaver, but it can be tough on me.    I expected to get some burn the first shave: nope. The new tilting head made for a much more comfortable shave and for much less tendency to want to press hard. Remember what your shop teacher told you: let the tool do the work!    The cutter itself is the classic Norelco-designed Lift-and-Cut dual rotary system, with three heads. It works. The foils on this model have different shaped slots/openings, for different lengths/stiffnesses of hair, and it seems to work. The cutter head assembly simply flips up for cleaning, though it can be removed. Not sure this is actually an improvement, as I normally give the old metal head assembly of the 6340 a couple or three whacks upside down against the inside of the sink to knock out the stubble, tapping the body to loosen what&#x27;s there. I&#x27;m not sure that I can get the same quick cleaning with this without fatiguing the flip-hinge, and don&#x27;t think I can do the flat whack on the sink, either. Shame.    This shaver, though, IS rated for HOT water cleaning, and they do specify HOT water, so don&#x27;t burn your hand! Don&#x27;t submerge the shaver, but it&#x27;s okay if water runs out the bottom. Just don&#x27;t plug it in to recharge until it&#x27;s dry!    This shaver is quieter and smoother sounding (less machine like, more motor like) than the 6000 series. That&#x27;s a nice thing. Charge is similar in time and endurance. Based on the instructions, I think Philips is saving money using NiCd batteries instead of Lithium, but this is a midline shaver, so it&#x27;s important to cycle the batteries properly. The first three or so charge cycles are the most important, and you&#x27;ll likely get to the end of your warranty without problems if you do it right in the beginning... that&#x27;s only about 50 charges, and NiCd batteries are usually good for 100-200 charge cycles, so you can probably count on this to make it through a couple of blade replacements.    I like it. Amazon went nutty and put it on a crazy sale making it not much more (really) than buying a new blade/foil kit for my 6340, which I was actually here checking, when they sent the email with the sale price for a few more bucks! Glad I did it!    Oh, it seems to require less frequent lubricating (according to the manual&#x27;s schedule) so that would imply an improvement in precision for the parts, which would explain another review where the guy says it bests his 9000 series shaver from just a few years ago.    IF you can live without the little plastic stand (I can) and without a Low Battery indicator (I can), this is a wonderful shaver in the under $100 price point, is better than my much more costly Braun and Panasonics (of a few years ago) were, and is quieter than the Braun by far. The Nor-Phil 6340 is still sold at Sears and such for a very fair price, and perhaps a little lower here on Amazon, but when you find THIS model 8240 on sale here, it&#x27;s unbeatable for the money. And yes, the trimmer works well and is long enough and high enough to actually see what you&#x27;re doing, a real problem with other brands.    Highly recommended. Maybe not as good as a hot barber&#x27;s straight edge shave, but whocan afford that every day???</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for nearly four decades and until recently have always been very satisfied. The last electric razor that I purchased was in 2003. It had a numeric LCD display which told the amount of time left in the battery charge and the razor would continue to work at full strength for about 10-15 minutes past the time the display read zero. The razor lasted over eight years and continued to perform very well. By last year, the charge time had decreased significantly and the razor would not restart under the ten minute mark. I investigated replacing the battery and discovered that it was rather pricey to send it in. Replacing the battery by oneself involved a special driver to open the unit and soldering a black market battery in place. Since I was due for new razor blades, I opted to purchase a new razor. I investigated the models available and I found that Norelco had only a few models available with numeric LCD displays. They were only on the pricey pod-shaped SensoTouch models.  I opted to purchase the 8240 XL since it was similar to my previous model and Amazon user ratings were fairly good. The 8240 XL looks like my last razor but it has more plastic and seems less durable. Instead of a coiled cord which previous models had, there is a thin, straight cord which always seems to tangle in my countertop drawer. There is no digital LCD and there is very little indication of when the battery is going to die. The razor does do a very good job with shaving except for the last ten minutes prior to the battery dying at which time the razor shaves slightly less efficiently.</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Norelco shavers for over 30 years and have no major complaints with any of them.  I just bought this product recently and it works as designed--quite flawlessly.  Electric razors are not for everyone but I like to shave each and every day and the electric razor makes that chore pretty effortless.  They really are not designed to cut through a really long and thick beard so this product may be a disappointment for those who like to give the face a rest over long weekends.  I have tried a few other shaving systems but now has worked as well for me as the Phillips Norelco shavers--and this model is no exception.  Having the ability to quickly rinse out the shaving head with tap water is a big plus.  I try to stick with the mid-range product--such as this model--and hope to keep it for 3 or 4 years.  The usual lifespan of the battery--at least for me.  I would rather opt for a new shaver than replacing the battery.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the ease and convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have shaved with Norelco razors for years.  I recently ordered this one and I am amazed how cheap they can get.  It does not even come with a small plastic holder to set it in. It seems like when you shave the motor is slower.  When the charge is gone it just plain quits without any warning.  I think I will try and order some parts for my older one and use it. Should have done that in the first place but one small plastic part with shipping is almost $30.00.  Philips is not the company it used to be ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
    <li> The product is good, as the other Philips I had before.  The remarks are:   1) It seems less powerful than necessary, and less than my old 6830. Seems that in newer models they have traded power for silence. For my beard it makes a diference as it becomes lower and less efficient.  2) It is marketed as having more of a shaving surface and threfore being quicker. Did not notice any diference.  A good buy anyway.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job and I like the fact that it&#x27;s cordless.  My old one had a cord and it was a pain to use!  The pop-up trimmer works well in thinning my beard.  (Written by my son, who owns the shaver.)</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for over 1 year with no problems, comfortable shave, easy to handle, good charge, &amp; reliable.  Have used other electric razors, remington and norelco, and this is the best value I could find, worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original blades still sharp and going strong, shaving every week day, and gets the extra weekend growth fine, just takes a little longer.  Works fine on the neck too.  I am probably average as far as hair and skin sensitivity, don&#x27;t move over skin too fast and finish before the blades heat up so no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet and doesn&#x27;t sound like it is running very fast. As far as revolutions per second, I think the rating system is flawed for all rotarys, so 18,000 rpms divided by 3 heads &#x3D; 6,000 each under no load in a vacuum may be possible, but not in my bathroom.  Regardless the shave is just fine for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A battery charge indicator would be nice but I just run it till it quits and easily get 2 to 3 weeks out of a charge. It does slow down a bit for the last few shaves before the battery dies, so I do know when it needs a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problem with the storage compartment and cleaning, just rinse the heads every couple weeks and let them air dry. The trimmer works fine too, still sharp, and I expect to get at least 2 years out of the blades before needing replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This product did not do a good job just trimming very short hair and basically fell apart after a couple of uses... One of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever bought for that amount of $</li>
    <li> This Norelco 8240XL shaver was a replacement for my Norelco 7885XL.  It&#x27;s shaving quality is excellent.  I found it easier and faster to shave because the entire head more easily conformed to the shape of my face.  The case provided holds the shaver but not the charging cord.  If charged, it&#x27;s very compact and takes little room in a suitcase if you don&#x27;t need the cord along.  The charge lasted for about two weeks of daily shaves.  I found the trimmer to be adequate, but not as sharp as the trimmer on my previous 7885XL.  There is no indication of the percentage of charge left in the device. It will just stop running at which time you use the cord for the rest of the shave, and then let it recharge, which takes only about an hour. Overall I&#x27;d give this a 4-star rating based on its price/performance and ease of use benefits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved electric for going on 30 years now and had always used Braun shavers. I received this Norelco as a gift and have used it for three months. I&#x27;m disappointed with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Compared to the least-effective Braun I&#x27;ve owned, it takes much longer get an acceptable, but still less close and smooth, shave. I have noticeable stubble (my whiskers are thick and black) by noon, where I&#x27;m used to that happening late afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;* After shaving, the sensitive areas of my face (my neck, primarily) are sore. For the first time in all these years of shaving electric, I need to use an after-shave lotion to soothe my face.&lt;br /&gt;* The trimmer requires a good amount of effort and patience, as it is weak and likes to fold in against the body when in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, perhaps people who have shaved with rotary shavers for a long time have figured this out, but I can&#x27;t get the shaver to get the whiskers directly under my nose. I have to use a blade razor to get those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the market for a foil shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my older Norelco shaver just wasn&#x27;t cutting as good, and I even bought new blades for it. This 8240 shaver was way cheaper than my older 8892XL model, less than 1/2 the price. This works great and cuts faster even though the blades seem to be turning slower. It doesn&#x27;t have the charge scale lights and an adjuster, but it cuts close fast, just what I needed. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This shaver hasn&#x27;t changed in many years and each model is the same except in the way the battery functions and indicates the charge level. On this one, you have to guess when it needs charging as there is no indicator for low battery level. When it quits, it just quits.    As far as shaving goes, these are good shavers. I&#x27;ve used them for many years with no complaints except the indicator system.</li>
    <li> The shaver arrived and it looked cheaply constructed; HOWEVER; looks can be deceiving and in this case was!!!....this electric razor packs a good punch and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 8240XL shaver for 2 months now, and I have no particular complaints about it--the shaver fits nicely in the hand, is quiet, holds it charge for a week or more, and gives a decent shave &amp; trim. I suppose my tepid enthusiasm results from an affection for my old workhorse Norelco (8865XL), which worked for 12+ years, appears to be more solidly built than this new model, and may just need a new battery pack to continue working. Only time will tell whether the 8240XL will hold up as long as its big brother. Bottom line: the 8240XL is a good shaver at a good price, and comes from a company known for good rugged shavers.</li>
    <li> I received the razor on June 28 and I shave daily.  It is very quiet so I can watch CNN while shaving.  I charged it when new and as of today, July 21, 23 days later, its still running on the original charge.  A far superior product to the Remington I bought just 7 months ago.  It shaves just as closely as the Remington with a lot less noise.</li>
    <li> I use this 2-3 times a week when I&#x27;m running late and don&#x27;t have time for the old fashion. Works great, I like having the trimmer around... unfortunately so does my woman. I have clippers but the trimmer is fine for most days. The shave doesn&#x27;t burn my face or anything like that and I haven&#x27;t had to replace the blades yet. Thanks for reading.</li>
    <li> Product arrived, just as promised. Brand new in package. Even though it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s shaver, it works Great on women&#x27;s legs! Just love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a Philips/Norelco user for more that 40 years.  For the first 25, the products kept getting better.  For the last 15 I experienced shorter battery life and no improvements in shaving quality.  With this razor I am encouraged that, finally, things are improving by my standards.    I am getting a good shave in about 20% less time and I can get a full week, or more, of shaves on a charge as compared to half that with my last Norelco.</li>
    <li> Great shave!  The only thing I miss is the &#x27;time remaining&#x27; indicator.  For more than twice the price I could have that also - so I can live without it. I&#x27;ve used it for a month now &amp; haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  Much better shave than my 12 year-old Norelco that it replaced (the battery finally wasn&#x27;t holding a full charge).  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband b-day. He tried it and love it. Worth what I paid for! From now on, rather spend money on this one than the cheap brand!</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with the performance of this razor.  Charges quickly and shaves close.  The only drawback is there is no stand for the razor and the bottom is not flat for it to stand up.  So it lays on it side, big deal.  This is my 3rd Norelco (over a period of 30 years) and I am as pleased with this one as I was with the others.</li>
    <li> It is my third shaver on same brand. Nice quality and easy to operate. Great shipping from Amazon.com, taking about 4 days to deliver.</li>
    <li> The top bracket that holds in the blades on my old Norelco 8151XL broke, so I went to a local store and bought the 8240 as an emergency replacement.  It works well enough, but the motor seems a little anemic.    I have some disappointments with the product:  No stand to hold the razor when I&#x27;m not shaving.  There&#x27;s no low battery warning - it just stops running while you&#x27;re shaving.  Of course, you&#x27;re supposed to wait for this to happen before you recharge it.    I bought a repair part for my old razor, and will go back to using it.  I&#x27;ll save this one as a backup.</li>
    <li> After 65 years of using a double edge I was satisfied with this medical mandatory change to an electric razor.  It is working quite well.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco electric razor that I have had and it is the smoothest I&#x27;ve ever used.   My only complaint is that its missing a battery level indicator; this means that when I&#x27;m planning to take a trip, I always charge the battery.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased for my husband who loves the razor and is very satisfied with it, the only thing that he misses on it is the \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; indicator.  It gives him as very smooth and close shave.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco for years, after suffering a lot of razor burn from foil type razors. A year ago I switched from my trusty Philips Norelco to a Remington rotary that had two concentric rings of cutting areas and got a faster shave but it tended to bite, especially in the lip area around the mouth. Ouch! This new 8240 is still running on the original charge after 12 days of shaving, and provides the best shave ever, with no razor burn, and no biting. I bought it only because it incorporates a LiIon battery instead of the old nickel cadmium variety that failed in a couple of years, but I&#x27;m surprised and extremely pleased by the improved overall quality of this new model as well as the shave it provides. This model represents a lot of subtle improvements by Philips! Some may complain about the lack of a low battery indicator, but it will recover so quickly that this is a mute point: it really doesn&#x27;t matter because you can plug it in, do something else for 5 minutes then pick it up and shave. I highly recommend this Norelco!</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco shaver and it is improved over the other two.  It gives a good shave and is easy on the skin. The ultimate telling point will be how long it lasts.  The other two Norelcos have lasted about 4 years.  The first on the swithch broke and the second on the battery died.  The only negative I have found on the this new shaver is that it does not have an indication when the battery is low.</li>
    <li> Let me say that I usually just by a electric razor and after about 2 years buy a new one.  However, I have never replaced blades.  I don&#x27;t think this is what is intended, but it hasn&#x27;t hurt anything.  I have an old remington that I picked up on clearance in the same style as this Norelco.  I normally work 4 days a week and let the facial hair grow for the weekend.  Basically this gets used 4days a week.  With the remington with 3 year old blades I would get some pull, but it would do a quick job.  Now with this one it shaves closer, some pull near the mustache, but I have to spend over twice the time to get rid of 3 day old stubble compaired to my old razor.  I have also noticed that at the very top, where the base pivot part connects to the top plastic blade shroud, there is some overlap that catches my nostrils when shaving near the nose.  Not sure that I traided up this time.  I regret throwing away the container!  Stuck with it now and wishing I would have just got replacement blades.    Note:  It is quiet and shaves close, just not quickly.</li>
    <li> Highlights:  Quieter than most other electrics shavers I have used  Decently close shave  Down-sides:  Not really feasible if you are trying to shave around facial hair (eg mustache or beard)  Sometimes hairs can get pulled when trying to shave if they are left too long</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to rinse, hair chamber is waterproof and has built-in drainage so you can just run it under hot water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very close shave, can&#x27;t feel stubble in any direction after shaving with this*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer powerful enough to handle sideburns and if you fall behind on shaving, trims down thick beard-hair before using regular side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Three-ring blade system really isn&#x27;t all that special, more of a marketing gimmick because all three rings are actually done with one blade unit, so the rings don&#x27;t move independently.  This makes the shaver no more contour-following than any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaver tugs and pinches if you get behind on shaving.  A lot.  Have to use the trimmer first, then shave if you go a few days.  Since the \\&quot;precision cutting system\\&quot; is supposed to handle long hair, it loses a star for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery is very picky about how you charge and use it, and very unforgiving if you are loose with their rules.  Mine was shot in the first 6 months.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to leave it plugged in after it&#x27;s fully charged, but i don&#x27;t have a good block of time to sit and stare at the charge light so had to charge it overnight or while at work.  I took the second star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Could have just been me, but the one week i was at a conference and used this every morning to be as clean-shaven as possible through the whole time, my face was hyper-irritated by the end.  Could&#x27;ve just been my face and beard-type so i&#x27;m not taking stars off for that, but be advised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Caution: the closeness of this shave would probably be desired by most, but with rough, curly beards like mine it actually lead to a lot of ingrown hairs, a bad enough problem that i had to stop using electric razors.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, smooth ,shaves well, quiet, good life on batteries.  Order showed up in 3 days.  Web site easy to use and compare other products        thanks,     jar</li>
    <li> My husband is very difficult to shop for. I researched like crazy for him for Christmas. This one stood out to me and I bought it hoping for the best. He LOVES it! Here are a few reasons why: Close shave, fast, gets everything (he has a tough beard). We highly recommend this and it is a great price!</li>
    <li> ultra modern, light weight, sleek design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sturdy packaging may require a box-knife to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...a few words from Dad:  \\&quot;The Philips Norelco 8240XL, Rechargeable, Triple header, Cordless/Cord Razor can only be used dry. After the first 12-hour charge, it  is ready to go. It is easy to use with a handle grip that is comfortable. The 8240XL shaves close after several passes with it&#x27;s face contour following floating head cutting system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a spring-released pop-up trimmer for moustache and sideburn trimming. The trimmer cuts well, though a bit noisy, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is easy with the cleaning brush or rinse under the faucet using the razor head release button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessories include a cleaning brush, carrying pouch, protective cap, and AC power cord. I found the instruction guide well-written and easy to follow.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17 days of shave-time on one charge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dad, you look Fantastic!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2008</li>
    <li> SHAVING BACKGROUND    I used to use the Gillette Mach3. Then I upgraded to the Fusion (for free). I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied and wanted to go back to the Mach3, but before I did, I came across Wet Shaving.    Wet Shaving with the Double Edge Safety Razor irritated less and gave me a closer shave. The classics - who would&#x27;ve thought. I never looked back to cartridge based shaving.    At one point I did buy an electric shaver. It was a foil head one. I didn&#x27;t stay with it for long because it worked even worse than this one. After torturing my face a few times, I returned it. I always thought that this three head design would have worked better, so wanted to try it.     FACIAL BACKGROUND    I think I have sensitive skin. My hair grows from my ears toward my chin, then down to my Adam&#x27;s apple and then away from it. I don&#x27;t have straight hair. A single hair grows like a bridge. If I let a beard form, it will look curly, especially around my neck.    I don&#x27;t like to grow it because it pricks my face, so I need a easy, non-irritating shaving system to shave every day or two.    ELECTRIC CHRONICLE    I struggled with the ridiculous packaging. A Sealed plastic package within a paper package that isn&#x27;t easy to open either. And there is no easy way to cut open the package without the risk of cutting yourself - and it would be easiest to do with a box cutter (but who has one), not a scissor. I almost sliced my thumb on the plastic packaging.    21 July 2008    Shave 1 - The razor shaved well above my chin, but there are still large patches of hair that remained untouched below my chin. My face, especially the neck, is irritated to the point of stinging, even after applying a moisturizer.    Shave 2 - The patches of hair below my chin are now significantly smaller. My face is irritated. My neck stings. The trimmer on the back isn&#x27;t great for shaping sideburns since it doesn&#x27;t trim close enough to the skin.    So far the problem seems to be that the shaver doesn&#x27;t glide acrossmy face - it meets heavy resistance from a clean face and the move against the grain.     Shave 3 - Instead of washing my face, I apply some Lectric Shave, which takes care of the gliding problem. There are no longer patches of hair below my chin; instead, just some lonely hairs. My face isn&#x27;t as irritated, but my neck still stings a little.    Shave 4 - Same as Shave 3.     I&#x27;ve noticed some ingrown hairs on my neck.    Shave 5 - The razor shaved well above my chin, but there are large patches of hair that remained untouched below my chin. My face feels irritated.    28 July 2008    Shave 6 - Similar to Shave 5. The razor shaved well above my chin, but there are large patches of hair that remained untouched below my chin. My face feels slightly irritated.    Shave 7 - Same as Shave 5.    Shave 8 - About 3 days after Shave 7. There are a few lonely hair above my chin that didn&#x27;t make it and big patches of untouched hair below my chin. My face feels irritated.    I had originally planned on going for the three weeks. However, during my last shave as I was shaking the water loose from the shaver, I must have held it wrong and the head fell to the floor with the grills and blades separated. Because the manual said if the blades were swapped, I would lose my progress, I have decided to quit.    CONCLUSION    I shaved for almost two weeks, torturing my face. In the end, nothing changed. Electric shaving is faster to use than a blade and cleanup is easy because you only need to run it under hot water once when finished. However, the blade shaves closer, doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, and has a more complete shave. After walking around with an unclean shave for two weeks, I can&#x27;t wait to return to Wet Shaving.</li>
    <li> If I shave in the morning, I&#x27;ll have the makings of a five-o&#x27;clock shadow in the afternoon. I&#x27;ve always used electric razors, and I&#x27;ve used wet/dry, single blade, and rotary blade. This Philips Norelco, might just be the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It gives a clean, close shave that lasts almost all day. The quiet motor at first seems like its hardly working, but it efficiently trims my beard. The battery holds a charge for a long time. Shaving below the jaw and around the neck can be tedious, but I&#x27;ve never had a razor behave otherwise. The trimmer, however, does not work well at all and is the only problem I had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few Norelco razors, and every one that comes out is a little better than the previous model. The three round blades mold to your face so comfortably, and get every angle imaginable that you&#x27;ll have trouble adjusting to any other razor after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing keeping this from a full five stars is cleaning it. It can be a real hassle taking it apart and getting in every nook to clean it. With other razors on the market that clean themselves, this is a tedious annoyance for such a great little machine.</li>
    <li> Having not used an electric shaver for nearly 30 years, I was interested in how much they had improved (if any) in that time. This Norelco is pretty good as electrics go.    You are required to do a 12 hour charge before using the shaver to fully condition the battery (also after periods of one month or more of non-use). After that, the shaver is supposed to recharge in as little as 1 hour. I have yet to run it down enough to require a recharge, though, so I can&#x27;t comment on how accurate that is.    The shaver feels good in the hand and is easy to move and control. However, with its round heads, it is problematic to sculpt a beard or mustache. This shaver is pretty much for those who go completely clean shaven. The pop-up trimmer is just about useless, as it does not lock into place, and moves when you put any pressure on it. I took an unexpected divot out of my beard because it is so flaky. I recommend that you just ignore the trimmer in considering this shaver. The trimmer dropped this from a 4 to a 3 star review. It is pretty badly designed.    Needless to say, electrics just don&#x27;t give as close a shave as a blade, period. That said, I was able to get a clean \\&quot;looking\\&quot; shave easily with this shaver, although you could obviously feel the difference by touch. For quick touch-ups, however, this works well, and I find myself using it more and more for that.    Since I have a goatee and mustache, there are many parts of my face where this just doesn&#x27;t work. I still have to trim around the goatee with a blade or smaller trimmer (I tried a Norelco trimmer set, too, with mixed results.), so this shaver cannot fill all my shaving needs. It is good for large blocks of open face or head only.    Construction seems good, although the head seems kind of light weight. Lots of plastic parts, but a good, solid feel in general. The rotary cutters and related assembly can be replaced (annually, per the instructions). The heads track well over uneven skin for a consistent shave. Directions are included for several levels of cleaning, and they are clear and concise.    If you are clean-shaven on face or head, this could be a very useful shaver for you. If you have more sculpted facial hair, it will be less useful. I will not be giving up my blades for this, although it has become useful for quick touch-ups.</li>
    <li> This shaver does one thing and one thing only: shaves your beard. Luckily, it does it well and--this is rather important for me--reasonably quietly. The quiet part comes in handy when you have a girlfriend sleeping a few feet down the hall who has the good fortune of being able to sleep in longer than you, and you&#x27;d rather not make her cranky by waking her up with the grinding whir of a loud shaver. This one also holds a charge for a good long time (I can easily get a week out of one charge), and then, when the battery does run low, it re-charges very quickly (a couple of hours does it, rather than the 6 or 8 hours required by some older models). The reason this little baby does not rate five stars is because it does nothing else: no trimmer for sideburns, no closeness adjustments, no attachments of adjustments of any kind. You have two options with this shaver: on or off. It is so simple in fact that I find their description \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Shaving System\\&quot; sort of funny. This is a system? But, if you&#x27;re looking for a nothing fancy, no-frills electric razor, this one does the job.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives an excellent cut, and is easy to use. It is difficult to clean properly as the parts to be cleaned, unlike previous models, do not detach easily.</li>
    <li> I like the heft, styling and feel.  This Norelco seems well-built and is a good deal quieter than my old one.  I like that it can be cleaned under water but regret that there is no stand.  Leaving it lying out with the blade compartment open to dry would seem to invite damage.  While the battery life is so far as advertised (with as many as 17 shaves after being fully charged), I wish that it had a light to indicate when the battery has been fully charged and when it is close to needing a recharge.  Here&#x27;s one surprise--it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as close as my old Norelco, or it requires more time and attention to do so.  I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, like to think that my new Norelco still makes me presentable, and it&#x27;s so much easier and less expensive than a razor, I&#x27;m very satisfied!  At $80, I&#x27;d make the same purchase again!</li>
    <li> When I first got my Norelco, I thought it didn&#x27;t shave as close as my old Norelco, but I think it was just a different \\&quot;feel\\&quot; from the shaving surface of the razor.  What I really love is the clean under the faucet feature of this razor.  I think it makes for better day to day use, and is sure easier to clean than my old one!</li>
    <li> The electric razor I have had for 15 years finally died and I bought a very cheap replacement. It is horrible and I wish I could take it back - it does not cut my beard! Then I did a little research and found that this Phillips Norelco had great reviews and was not that expensive, so I thought I would give it a try. I must admit that it is even better than my old razor. It is quiet and it cuts without much effort.  I would buy it again and may actually use this as a gift in the future.</li>
    <li> I am not a spring chicken and therefore go way back with the Norelco line of electric shavers however this 8240XL steals the bacon for me. Simply put I am hugely happy that for among many reasons to bring up, this shaver performs closer than a blade.Buying blades today is a massive investment that will mirror an equity play by year&#x27;s end. I have spoken to men who purchase the bag of disposables but you better cost them out as well before you conclude that they are an economical strategy. To put things in its proper perspective, men&#x27;s shaving methods are trial and error. There are individuals who simply will never be able to go electric because of neck irritation or the idea that their beard is the wrong texture for a machine shave. That is why blade shaving is much more wide spread but not as convenient, quick and really cheap as the Norelco whose expense is a head purchase which comes up very seldom. I had purchased a very fine brand before this Norelco but it was a flat head electric. The area under the jaw is very difficult to shave and for me the flat head could not handle the slope. The Norelco, with pivoting heads and a wide surface can capture this area of your face hands down as it glides over it. My shave today was so impressively close that at midnight I still could have gone to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with a clean look. This whole thing is a caveat emptor proposition so all I can tell you is that I am very pleased with the Norelco 8240XL. Investigate the benefits for you, my razor came with some kind of trial provision. Good Luck. Jay Adler</li>
    <li> I have one word - GARBAGE. The power on this is low, and the razor accidentally and slightly bumped into something and it just fell apart. One word I say; GARBAGE!</li>
    <li> I have been using a Norelco Quadra electric shaver for about seven years. I waqs reluctant to try a differnet head type, but after talking to customer service at Norelco and reading the reiews on Amazon, I ordered the 8240XL Speed. What a pleasant surprise. The very first shave was great. The shaver is amazingly quiet. Although at first appearance one might think the quality was not as good as my old Quadra, shaving was a pleasure and quality is not an issue. It is also a great to see that the shaver is still made in Holland.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 15 years. This is my 4th one. It is probably the best one I have had. I always buy a similiar model. The company makes many improvements over the years. This shaver is probably the best one yet. I usually get about 5 years service from each one, then I keep it for a back up. One of the features I really like is the hour recharge time, also it gives a comfortable shave.  SFR</li>
    <li> Buy the Norelco 7310 for $40 less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have both and I think 7310 shaves closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco shavers have really gone down in quality of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent it back.</li>
    <li> The motor in this item seems very weak and shaving seems to take forever.  It does shave smoothly, but you will need to trim any long hairs first. Catch-22, the trimmer on this item is next to worthless.  If you have a mustache and hope to trim it with this, you&#x27;re going to be out of luck.  Luckily, I kept my old Braun, and even though the shaving parts are dull, the old razor&#x27;s trimmer is still excellent. Using both razors, I get a better shave than before, but that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be the idea behind buying this piece of relative junk.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about 30 years now, and this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had that pretty much doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.  Compared to my other shavers, this one takes about 4 times as long to cut half as well.  Absolutely terrible.  I&#x27;ll be going back to Braun.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Follow-up on 11/22/09:  I&#x27;m truly curious, can someone explain to me why my review is considered helpful to 0 out of 6 people??  I mean, if a product is a piece of junk, I&#x27;d certainly want to know about it, why isn&#x27;t that helpful?  Or is this just people&#x27;s way of saying they disagree with my review, that they love the shaver, they want my review to sink to the bottom?  Anyway, it&#x27;s a crappy shaver, don&#x27;t know what more I can add to that to make it more helpful.  Um, don&#x27;t buy it if you want a good shave.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Follow-up on 12/21/09:  Hey, at least 1 person out of 11 found this helpful, I appreciate it!  And I forgot to mention before that the mustache trimmer really sucks too, practically doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  You&#x27;d be better off going with a butter knife.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&gt; Follow-up on 1/28/10:  Now 2 people found my review helpful, woohoo!  I&#x27;m finally giving up on this piece of junk.  It&#x27;s actually getting worse, I guess the blades (such as they are) are getting even duller.  I can&#x27;t believe I put up with this shaver as long as I did, I guess I just wanted to get something for my money.  Feh!  Anyway, now I&#x27;m going with a Panasonic ES7103K, that got pretty good reviews here.  I know I said I should stick with Braun, but reviews here liked the Panasonics better.  (I&#x27;ll never learn, I suppose.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips-Norelco razors for many years, since long before Philips changed the name from simply Norelco, and this one gives the best shave yet, a shave indistinguishable from a wet razor shave.  But, the fact that this razor has no \\&quot;Low Battery\\&quot; warning light is most disconcerting.  The razor just stops, and you think something has gone wrong with it.  A phone call to Philips Norelco dispels the notion: it stops, you plug it in, finish your shave, and let it continue to charge.  No sweat--except the first time it happens.  Aside from this, it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe there are so many positive reviews for this awful product. If you&#x27;re the kind of guy that has to shave every 2 days DO NOT BUY it. I bought it brand new and it pulled my beard and made me bleed.</li>
    <li> I Bought this because read that blades rotate at 13,000 rpm and the cheapie Norelco + Remington&#x27;s I tried rotated at much lower speeds and for me was the main problem and not because taking longer is the  problem but in the same way that a vacuum with too little suction would be with not taking too long as the problem but rather unable to do the job properly at all.  So having happily owned an 800 series Norelco from 15 yrs ago (simiarly priced when adjusted for inflaion + comparable product for it&#x27;s time period) I bought this 8240XL because it said &#x27;Speed XL&#x27; with of course SPEED being my main concern.       So here is my reveiw:     If  you don&#x27;t remove the blades after every use and rinse them the shaver does not do a good job so that needs to be done and although raiser can be rinsed under water for easy cleaning you&#x27;ll want to pull out those 3 blades and individually rinse them which isn&#x27;t too hard to do.  Motor is quiet, heads pivot in a couple different ways and shaving surface is good and the right size.  Ergonomics and style are good.    What I find to be particuarly worth noting though is when running it on battery power (cordless) the job it does is just OK and perhaps a little underwhelming BUT  plug it in and the extra 5% or so more power that A/C power gives makes all the difference bringing a SO-SO shaver up to quite a good one definately worth recomending.      So in short, if you NEED to use this as a cordless shaver all the time would recomend looking into something a little more powerful but if you don&#x27;t mind plugging it in you&#x27;ll find it performs noticeably better and for me makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> The razor provides a close shave in a short amount of time.  Very good value for the money.  I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> I have been a satisfied Norelco user for several decades.  The 8240XL continues this tradition with some significant improvements.  This shaver is substantially quieter and the time I spend shaving shorter than any shaver I&#x27;ve seen or used.  The number of shaves from a single charge is also noticeably larger than my previous razors.  Rinsing the shave heads under running water is a novel feature, but whether it lengthens shaver life remains to be seen.  Overall, I&#x27;&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shaver is just ok.  it does the job but i seem to have go over my beard a few times in order to finally get the shave that is adequate.  Would like to get a shaver with a closer shave. Thought I could get it from this shaver but not so</li>
    <li> As a past user of Norelco shavers, I find this model is better than previous models for my shaving needs.  After a period of adjustment this model is faster with less abrasion.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, and so far he seems to like it. He had one complaint though, that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a separation from the motor and where the hair goes, so I imagine it&#x27;s just a matter of time before it gets too clogged up and stops running. I guess we&#x27;ll see. He likes the waterproof feature, which makes it easier to clean. It gives a closer shave than his previous electric razor and he&#x27;s had no discomfort from it at all.</li>
    <li> WORKS LIKE THE REST I HAVE OWNED.  THIS ONE IS QUIETER THAN MY OLDER MODEL AND CUTS A BIT BETTER.</li>
    <li> It shaves great.  Charge lasts well.  Little pouch that comes with it keeps razor stubble from getting all over my gym bag.  It&#x27;s tough, too.  I dropped it on the locker room floor.  It smashed and pieces scattered everywhere.  After I found them all, the whole thing just snapped back together and worked like new.</li>
    <li> I have had this item for about three weeks and really like the way it shave.  It is one of the best electric razor I have had.</li>
    <li> i like the way the whole shaving surface moves to follow your face and neck.  I have noticed after using the razor for the past few weeks that a few hairs on my neck have been missed.  not sure if this is due to the razor or me being too sleepy and being sloppy.    much better than the 46xx razor that i was using.  faster and easier to clean.</li>
    <li> The item in review is very nice and I do enjoy it. However it took over two weeks to ship it here and that is way too long to wait.</li>
    <li> I tried so many electric shavers over the years. So many brands. I always like Norelco the best. And this one is no exception. Everything about it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Well, First off, This is in the top 5 electric shavers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Took 2 days for me to get used to it again considering I hadn&#x27;t used an electric shaver in half a year or so. It does the job it was meant to do. Don&#x27;t expect it to get everything in the first go, You more than likely will have to go over spots a few times, That&#x27;s just normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not good on the neck too much but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be, works great on the face though and that&#x27;s just what I needed. Less breakouts, ingrown hairs etc. I have some what fair skin and I hate razors with a passion. Before this I only shaved every few days or so and sometimes didn&#x27;t even shave because of this fact but now, I shave every other day and no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought a brand new Remington foil electric shaver and used it one time as I did not like it. I had previously been shaving with a Norelco rotary shaver and flat wore it out. I bought this new Norelco shaver and it is even better than my old Norelco. Has extra large floating heads that cuts the hairs close without any knicking. I love it. I love it.</li>
    <li> It always leaves some hair on my face and it makes face itchy and some times small scratches. I kept using till 4 weeks to see if it got any better, No luck ! i will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m very impressed!  I&#x27;m a Norelco fan.  I don&#x27;t like blades.  I&#x27;ve used foil shavers in the past from Remington and Braun, and they always irritated my skin, missed hairs, and never shaved my neck well.  The first time I used a Norelco rotary shaver I got a close shave with very little irritation and I&#x27;ve never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an upgrade from a 4 year old Norelco 6423LC corded shaver which was a low end model.  The old one did a fine job and served me well, but this one shaves me closer with less effort and and irritation.  The pivoting head and and 3 shaving tracks are a big improvement.  I could care less that it doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator or low battery warning.  Another influence in picking this model was that it uses a lithium-ion battery which means the motor provides constant power and won&#x27;t slow down the closer you get to the end of the charge.  They also don&#x27;t suffer from the memory effect of the older technology of nickel cadium batteries in Norelco&#x27;s lower end models.  Just be sure to charge it for a full 12 hours the first time like it says in the manual to break it in and you&#x27;ll get the best battery life.  It&#x27;s also nice to be able to wash the heads out under the faucet to keep it clean, very nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the negatives, I&#x27;ve found none so far!  I read the reviews before I purchased and there are far more positive than negative on here.  As to the negative comments, I&#x27;ll say rotary shavers aren&#x27;t for everyone, just as foil shavers aren&#x27;t for me.  We all have different faces and beard types.  You just have to figure out which one works the best for you.  If you&#x27;re a rotary man, then I don&#x27;t see how you could go wrong with this shaver.  I&#x27;m in love with mine.  Excellent purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful tip if you want to keep your blades nice and sharp.  Go to Youtube and search for a video called, \\&quot;How To Sharpen An Electric Shaver Norelco Philips Rotary Kind Using Basic Household Items\\&quot;.  It involves using a ceramic plate or coffee cup and is very simple to do.  I tried it out on my old shaver and it breathed new life into it.  It shaves like brand new now without having to buy replacement heads for it.es using a ceramic plate or coffee cup and is very simple to do.  I tried it out on my old shaver and it breathed new life into it.  It shaves like brand new now without having to buy replacement heads for it.</li>
    <li> A quiet, smooth shave.  This shaver has no problem picking up whiskers.  No irritation and a very satisfactory shave.</li>
    <li> Great razor.....great price... fast delivery...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for over 30 years and loved all my previous ones.  But I wish I had never bought this model.  It is very rough on sensitive skin, does not shave very close at all and pulls on whiskers many times.  I should&#x27;ve returned it right away but I thought I could get used to it but I never have.</li>
    <li> I have only used this shaver for about two weeks and it is still on the first charge. I am very impressed with how fast and well it cuts. It is about 3-4 times faster than my previous rather old Norelco shaver. The thing that I find the nicest is how quiet the unit operates. It can hardly be heard yet it is faster and seems more powerful than my former shaver. Also the trimmer works well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, and although I have owned three previous Norelco shavers, THIS IS THE BEST SHAVER I HAVE EVER OWNED.  My last \\&quot;higher level\\&quot; Norelco died, and I was hesitant to buy another, especially with a \\&quot;lower model number\\&quot;.  But this model is a gem.  It is quiet, efficient and shaves quickly and easily.  I highly recommend this shaver.  I may even buy a second one to keep in my car (of course to shave when I am not driving).  Great product -- reasonable cost.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> I bought this Norelco shaver to replace a similiar, but older, model that I had used for several years.  Shave is great.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco electric razor I&#x27;ve owned and the worst by far. The first was a corded L1118, which although heavy and bulky, worked very well. My second Norelco, which I still have, is a 5801XL. It was, and still is, an excellent razor.    I bought the 8240XL last December but did not use it until March 2011. It didn&#x27;t take long to learn to hate this razor. There are three major flaws with this model, as far as I am concerned:    1. The release button to open the cutting head assembly is too easy to activate. I have accidentally hit this button any number of times while shaving, which caused the head assembly to pop open while the razor is on.    2. The hinge which connects the head assembly to the razor body is a friction-fit design which allows the head unit to detach all too easily. I choose not rinse my razor but tap on the head assembly to clean it. It is a given that the head assembly will fall off each time unless I hold it in place, and even that does not always work. Also, I do not bang on the head assembly, but gently tap it.    3. The locking mechanism which is supposed to keep the cutting heads secured in the head assembly is too easy to accidentally unlock when cleaning the razor. I have had it open at least three times while I was cleaning the razor, allowing all the cutters to fall into the sink. Of course, there is no way to make sure the right pieces go back together, so shaving quality immediately suffers. Norelco even recommends not mixing up the cutters and the foils for this very reason.  The locking mechanism in the 5801 has to be pushed in and turned to release the cutting heads; it is an almost perfect system and works very well, as opposed to the one in the 8240.    If I had it to do over, I would not buy this razor again, and I do not recommend it for the reasons listed above. It is poorly designed, and Norelco took a step backward as far as I am concerned. The 5801 is a much better razor, and I only bought the 8240 because buying new blades for an old razor is not a good investment after the first time. Yes, the 8240 is quiet and it worked well until it came apart the first time, but those are all the positives I will give this razor. I will look to another brand next time, unless Norelco makes some major changes in these razors.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very fast shave, I now have two of these, and will purchase again if necessary. I believe&lt;br /&gt;it is the very best model.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the purchase of the Norelco 8240xl as it performs well and is a top value for the price. I definitely would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This unit is the 3rd Norelco that I have owned.  So far, the unit works well.  Snags a little bit if I hold it incorrectly.  I purchased this because the others batteries died and it cost almost as much for new rechargeable batteries as a new unit.  I do miss one thing.  The old unit had a series of led indicators for battery life.  This has none.  So, it runs, or you need to recharge it.  Would I buy it again, yes based on the short time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
    <li> Very quite and smooth.    Close shave without pressure and excellent recharge time.    Great value.</li>
    <li> Nice shaver.  No complaints really.  A perfect size, easy to clean, good battery life between charges. Occasionally may miss a hair or two but I am satisified with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Yes I just read the glowing reviews by many people who loved this shaver .The reason is ,it&#x27;s new!! therefore it has to be decent or you have 60 days to send it back.Too bad they don&#x27;t give you six months.First let me say I consider myself a bit of a Norleco expert .Why do I say that? I have been using Norelco since the late 1940&#x27;s when they came out with the single head shaver ,the Philishave.Years later came the dual head until they started the triple head with 1 row of cutters .Today the triple head with 2 rows of cutters for more money just is not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have tried most shavers over the years ,Ronson ,Remington ,Schick ,Braun and Norelco .Now let me say ,they all suck with maybe Norelco a hair better than Braun .In fact my wife bought me a Braun for Xmas 2 years ago,a disappointment, so to get a decent shave I use the Braun then mop up with the Norelco.I bought this shaver June 2010 to use at my summer home ,so I used it for 3 months in 2010 and 6 weeks in 2011.The shaver is damn lousy .I keep going over hair on my cheek which it wont cut ,over and over ,even after useing preshave lotion .I thoroughly cleaned the unit in May which improved my shave a little .But now im ready to take a hammer to it .Folks, Norelco&#x27;s used to last 2 years and then you took it to a Norelco store for a cleaning and tuneup and you would get maybe another few years .Now if you get 3 months rejoice ,you are due for a new one ,just don&#x27;t spend $80 for this ,buy the $39.95 one with 1 row of cutters and throw it out in a few months.Yes I used an Amazon coupon worth $10 and bought the $39.95 one for $29.95 a couple of dollars more than replacement blades.Norelco is the best of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I congratulate myself not paying $100-$200 for their Artic which sounds to me like money thrown out ,after all it&#x27;s their lousy blades which don&#x27;t last ,sort of like ink catridges .One thing I notice they don&#x27;t mention self sharpening blades anymore,maybe thats why their blades don&#x27;t last!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad so many users are giving this shaver 4 or 5 stars ,wait 3 months they will be singing another tune .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 11th 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an interesting comment on Amazon ,after people complaining about the high cost of replacement blades.He said take the screens off ,get a mirror and put a little saliva on the mirror .Then run the shaver for 15 seconds the cutters pressed against the mirror ,this will hone the cutters.however it&#x27;s a bit awkward the cutters tend to drop off ,but was able to do it.It appears that seems to work somewhat ,but I&#x27;m not sure whether the fact that I cleaned the heads might have improved my shave or was it the mirror.Time will tell.too bad so many users are giving this shaver 4 or 5 stars ,wait 3 months they will be singing another tune .  Feb 11th 2012  I read an interesting comment on Amazon ,after people complaining about the high cost of replacement blades.He said take the screens off ,get a mirror and put a little saliva on the mirror .Then run the shaver for 15 seconds the cutters pressed against the mirror ,this will hone the cutters.however it&#x27;s a bit awkward the cutters tend to drop off ,but was able to do it.It appears that seems to work somewhat ,but I&#x27;m not sure whether the fact that I cleaned the heads might have improved my shave or was it the mirror.Time will tell.</li>
    <li> The shaver does a much better job than my 10 yr old Norelco (my guess is my blade had really dulled over time).    This new unit is much lighter and seems to work well.  The only drawback - my old shaver had a countdown timer estimating the remaining charge. I miss that.</li>
    <li> I just received this razor as an upgrade to the Philips Norelco 7110X which I had been using for the past 19 months.  While one would expect this razor to perform better given its list price (approximately double what the 7110X is currently), I was frankly surprised by how much better it is in almost every regard.    I previously reviewed the 7110X, so if you want to see what I found lacking in that razor the review is available under that product listing.  As to the superior qualities of the 8240XL, they are:      1.  Shaves are closer and do not require as many passes over the same area.  I still don&#x27;t think it gives me as good of a shave as a manual razor and shaving cream, but I&#x27;ve never found an electric shaver that could compete with a manual razor in terms of closeness of shave.  Sometimes I prefer the convenience of the electric shaver, however, so that&#x27;s why I use both methods on occasion.    2.  Feels more solid in the hand.    3.  While it isn&#x27;t quiet, it sounds less annoying when it&#x27;s running.    The only serious problem I&#x27;ve encountered so far is with respect to charging the razor.  The manual indicates it may take 12 hours to fully charge the razor before the first use.  I had mine plugged in for over 15 hours and the light on the razor indicated that it was not yet fully charged.  I decided to keep the razor plugged in and use it.  After I completed shaving, the charging light briefly indicated it was fully charged but then started indicating it was still charging again.  I decided to unplug the razor anyway.  I re-checked the manual.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s written to cover three different models, so not everything in the manual pertains to this specific model.  Even so, the drawings indicate charging lights on the razor that simply don&#x27;t correspond to what&#x27;s on the actual unit (for example, I don&#x27;t see anywhere on the unit that the word \\&quot;Full\\&quot; would illuminate), and there&#x27;s no indication in the manual that these drawings only pertain to other units.  Strange.      Before owning my Philips Norelco 7110X, I had also owned another Norelco model (more similar in quality to this razor than the 7110X) and some other models from Braun.  I&#x27;ve generally been pleased with Norelco electric razors, and this one is another winner.</li>
    <li> This electric razor gave a good shave, but after two years of use the shaving head frame broke, which was a real disappointment. That shouldn&#x27;t have happened on a razor as expensive as this one; I expected better quality.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me a very nice close shave fast!  Even shaves well when I skip shaving one day.  It has a pop up trimmer.  I am very glad I got it.  The instructions mention using the shaver for 2 to 3 weeks to become accustomed to the shaver.  I think this may be for someone who never has used an electric shaver before.  It gives a very nice shave right from the start.  I feel this rotary type of shaver gives a much better shave and is easier to use than a foil type.</li>
    <li> It works but seems cheap. I &#x27;ve been using it for awhile and it seems ok. I&#x27;ve had no real problems. The charging is fine and shave is not as close as I would like. I&#x27;m keeping it until it breaks</li>
    <li> Once again I&#x27;m giving a shaver review, and once again I have to say that I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric shaver that can either beat or come close to the \\&quot;good ole water razor\\&quot; brand.  If you want or need a very close \\&quot;baby\\&quot; shave (say the military or such where your face will be closely looked at a few times a day, then do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t look at electric shavers, but go with the water/razor brands).  With that out of the way, lets get on with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good middle line Norelco shaver.  There are no thrills in that you cannot adjust the cut height, it&#x27;s not one of those more expensive \\&quot;cool\\&quot; looking ones that Norelco sells (if that appeals to you) and most important is that there is no low battery indicator.  So that if you&#x27;re like me and just keep on using it not thinking that it&#x27;s not been charged, it&#x27;ll just go out while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I&#x27;ve found that I was able to get around 12-15 shaves out of one charge. So that&#x27;s not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not loud at all, compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried (even more expensive)!  If you have someone sleeping right close, they won&#x27;t even hear it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to give it a good charge before using (overnight or such), so don&#x27;t expect to open it and charge it for five minutes then use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that if you have any acne, be CAREFUL as this will give you a good cut!  Boy did I bleed after being careless and running right over a pimple that must of had skin or such sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO this shaver would make a good gift for that gentleman needing a first shaver or someone who does not like a lot of \\&quot;extras\\&quot; to fool around with on the razor.  It&#x27;s basic, does a good job, not a lot to fiddle around with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say that if you take care of it, keep it clean, and charged it will last you many years.</li>
    <li> Like any electric razor, this one takes some time to get used to if you&#x27;re used to a regular razor.  My first time using this, I was less than enthused.  I gave it time, however, and found it to be a very effective shaver.  It charges quickly and lasts for some time; I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once since I received it.  It&#x27;s also quite light compared to an electric razor I owned a few years past.  And there you have it: It performs quite well, holds a charge, and looks/feels stylish to boot.</li>
    <li> Very nice stylish looking razor. This razor is very quiet and it cuts close every time without much pressure. I like the contour shape</li>
    <li> While I understand this shaver was designed for men, this review is from a woman&#x27;s perspective. It was for my partner, but he didn&#x27;t care for it, and despite my cajoling, refused to endure the 2 weeks recommended in the instructions for adjusting from blade to electric. I myself have used mens&#x27; Norelco shavers in the past, and  I do like the flexibility of a tidy, dry shave, especially when traveling, but you never get as close a cut as with a blade razor, and this is no exception. It&#x27;s handy to be able to shave in the car (not driving, of course), and it did a nice job on my legs (though my leg hair isn&#x27;t very coarse), but was awful on my underarms. Aside from the rinse feature, which is nice, I didn&#x27;t find any improvement in use or shave over the last norelco I bought 10 years ago. I do have to note that the moustache/beard trimmer is great for quick bangs touch-ups, but overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for women.</li>
    <li> My experience with the Norelco Speed 8240 has been quite good so far. It gives a pretty clean shave, but at sometimes, it doesn&#x27;t do a great job with cutting hair in the neck area below the chin. Other than that, I am very satisfied with it. Another note, the battery life on this product is tremendous because I haven&#x27;t had to charge it for a little more than 3 weeks (and I use it everyday).</li>
    <li> *THIS REVIEW HAS BEEN UPDATED. SEE BELOW.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver to replace my 5-year-old Philips HQ7830. Yes, this 8240 is a pretty good shaver. Compared to other shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past (Remington, Panasonic, Braun), it gives a reasonably smooth shave and has a good trimmer. It is fairly light and is comfortable to hold and maneuver. It is also much quieter than the old Philips it replaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this new shaver disappoints me in several ways: In careful side-by-side tests over a month, the new shaver with its fancy three-ring heads shaved me no better than the old one&#x27;s single-ring \\&quot;7 Series\\&quot; heads that are 2-1/2 years old. In fact, I think it might be pulling my skin a little bit more, and I seem to have more ingrown beard hairs than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the new shaver&#x27;s lithium-ion battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as the old nickel-cadmium battery of the old shaver (which I maintained very carefully). Worse yet, the new shaver&#x27;s battery dies very suddenly, without warning -- there&#x27;s no battery level light or gauge, and only a barely perceptible slowdown in blade speed shortly before it stops. If you&#x27;re not with your charger and near an outlet, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old shaver sealed the motor spindles from water, so you could rinse the shaver and shake it out. The new one channels water down past the motor spindles and through the shaver body, so it drips out the bottom around the charger plug contacts. I worry about a potential short circuit when plugging in the charger when the shaver is wet, and also that the interior channels might eventually clog with hair residue and mineral deposits if water dries inside the machine. I hope the usually careful Philips engineers have thought about these issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I would recommend this shaver to someone buying their first Philips. But if you have an old Philips, consider keeping it. A new one might be no better, and maybe even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE 16 June2012: Several days ago, this shaver&#x27;s battery died for good, and rather suddenly at that. Now the battery barely makes it through one shave. This is very disappointing for a shaver that is only one year and 10 months old, and has been very well cared for. Moreover, the battery is not user-replaceable, so I&#x27;ll have to buy a new one... probably a Braun.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product, and comes at a reasonable price.  The only feature it misses, but is available in higher-priced models, is the light that tells you when it needs charging.  No big deal because if it runs out of juice a quick 3-minute charge will get you enough power for a shave, and then you can give it a full charge.  Shaves well, and a lot quicker than my old (5 years) Norelco.  I like it, and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Refer to the review by Jon Norris: this is almost exactly what my experience is, so I&#x27;d say this is a useful review.  I&#x27;m not quite as thrilled, however, since this is a pricey shaver (I paid about $90 at target in Jan. 2009) compared to my prior Norelco (a 5025X - ~$29)), due, I&#x27;m assuming, to the three rows of blades per head.  I don&#x27;t think I have a particularly heavy beard (although not light), but the assertion by Norleco that you can get the whiskers off with one pass is bunk.  It takes multiple passes on my neck and at my jaw to get the whiskers short enough that they don&#x27;t fray my collar.  As Mr. Norris observed, the ole&#x27; safety razor is not going away anytime soon.  One thing I appreciate is how quiet this is - the previous one was quite loud.  I also appreciate the fact you can rinse the heads under running water.  Of note, the instructions point out that the blades are specific to the particular holder, so if you decide to clean the blades by taking them out and applying soap or alcohol to get rid of the various buildups of oil/hair/etc., be sure to do it one at a time so you replace each blade in the appropriate holder.    I remain to be convinced that the extra money for the 3 blades per rotary is worth the extra cost.  Perhaps if you shaved once a week it would be useful, but I shave once a day in the morning 5 days a week, and haven&#x27;t found the extra blades save any time.</li>
    <li> I have owned many (New one every 3-4 years) Norelco razors over the past 30 years and I think this one may be the worst one I have ever owned. It does not give me as close a shave and it takes me longer to shave each morning. The longer shave time has led to a little bit of skin irritation.    On the plus side the battery life is great I have  been using it 3 weeks on its initial charge.</li>
    <li> I last used an electric in the early 70s when I was traveling a lot. I switched back to a blade as it was more comfortable and gave a lot better shave.    I decided to give this a try because we are having intermittent water problems; some times it&#x27;s there and sometimes not.    It does a decent job and is much better than he previous one I tried.  It is slow to get a good shave and is not as close as a blade but is more convenient.  The trimmer is OK for evening sideburns and getting hair under your nose that the shaver can&#x27;t reach but that&#x27;s it.  If you have a beard or mustache I would not recommend this as it can&#x27;t do a precise trim at an edge nor is the trimmer really workable.    Overall I give this a 4 because of the nearly limited trimmer, inability to do an edge,and because of the ecologically horrid user hostile packaging.  There is no excuse for such badly designed unfriendly packaging. Even with a case knife I had problems due to the shape of the package.  Some of my students who have bad arthritis would not be able to open the package without help.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco electric razor purchased since I started shaving over 40 years ago. They have all been very good razors and a good value for your money. They give a very good shave although not as good as a blade, naturally. This 8240xl is pretty quiet and lighter than the others I have owned. It is a basic, no bells and whistles, razor that has the triple blade in each head. It takes between one to two weeks before the heads get &#x27;seated in&#x27; and your face gets accustomed to the razor before it starts to give an optimum shave. I prefer this type of razor over the electric \\&quot;foil\\&quot; types, it seems to give a better shave and isn&#x27;t as rough on your skin. Also, I believe that Norelco has a 45 day trial period so you can return it if you aren&#x27;t satisfied...can&#x27;t beat that!!!</li>
    <li> Wow!, Quiet, easy to handle, and shaves closer and faster than the Braun it replaced. While this model is disco, Norelco has come a long way.</li>
    <li> The Norelco Razor, Model Number 8240, exceeds all my expectations.  I have used Norelco razors for years and have never been disappointed.  This one is no exception!</li>
    <li> I had an older, cheaper electric razor that was starting to tug on my beard frequently so i decided to take a dive in to the more expensive market. Glad i did because this shaver is great. It glides on my face, even after a few days of not shaving. Every now and then there&#x27;s a tug but that&#x27;s my own fault for not shaving every day or at least every other day. For the price, i recommend everyone that want an electric razor, to look in to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: As a balding guy, I decided to shave my head. I cut it short with clippers and then shaved with a blade. That got tiresome after a week, so I tried using this on my head instead. Glad I did because it makes shaving my head much quicker and cleaner.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift due to the excellent reputation of Norelco.  This shaver provides a smooth, even shave, without having to charge the shaver on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this razor.  It&#x27;s very quiet, compared to my old Norelco, and feels good in the hand when shaving.  A good deal.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor anticipating that it could replace my old manual one. I have curly facial hair, and the razor did not seem designed with curly hair in mind. It does fine when I shave from the cheek to the chin. However, when the razor encounters the hair underneath my chin/upper neck area, I have to repeatedly go over the same spot. Even with the constant go over, the razor still does not shave every hair. I suppose I got what I paid for. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I got this electric razor for my husband as a replacement for his old norelco and he really seems to like it.  Things we&#x27;ve noticed that are nice improvements over his old one:    the triple ringed heads - ie each of the three shaving heads has three rings of shaving within the head which makes shaving time much faster as it give him more coverage in the same amount of time as his single ring (triple head) shaver.    it&#x27;s so quiet I can hardly hear him shave in the morning - a great improvement over the super noisy one, especially since he gets up at the crack of dawn and I don&#x27;t.    we both love that this one allows you to rinse it clean under running water.  As the primary home cleaner, I find that means a lot less mess in the sink every morning, ergo i don&#x27;t have to clean up after him as much (woo hoo!).    the shaver also holds a charge for what seems like forever.  I think he only charges it once every two weeks or so. often he doesn&#x27;t even have to take the charger with him when he travels which is nice because that&#x27;s one more thing he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about leaving behind.    So if you&#x27;re already a user of electric shavers, you will love this norelco model.  it&#x27;s a nice close shave, quiet, efficient, easy to clean.  For those of you who prefer the close shave of a real razor... electric is just different. my husband hates real razors so this is absolutely the best solution for him.</li>
    <li> The concept is great. Maximize the number of shaver blades in contact with the skin at all times. Its smooth, quiet and easy to clean. I agree with those who say it does not cut as close a straight blade(s). I have yet to find an electric shaver that does. Never the less, if you keep it clean and lubricated it will give a close shave after several passes. No need for a mirror. No need for a bandage.   It clearly was not designed for a moustache nor for a beard. The trimmer is only designed for a basic sideburn trim.</li>
    <li> I have had purchased Norelco shavers for years but this is the best ever! I get a smooth, close shave,operates much longer without recharging and is very quiet when running. I was disappointed with the shipping time - took much longer than I expected but the shaver was well worth the wait as the price was $20.00 less than the same shaver at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor  to be used in conjunction with my Norelco 6826XL at different locations (one upstairs and one downstairs )  I COMPARED SHAVES WITH BOTH RAZORS AND DID NOT ANY SIGNIFICENT DIFFERENCE The cost was almost twice the price of my older one and I do not believe there is any difference in the final shave, I should have went with the less expensive model I think it is more durable and better construction BUT I WATCHED THEIR ADVERTISING AND WITH THE MODERN WORLD THEY WANT YOU TO KEEP BUYING NEW PRODUCTS WHICH DOES EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE OLDER ONES DO.I have been using Norelco for over 40 years or more and have been very satisfied but I don not treat it like a THROWAWAY product.I have even replaced the batteries and shaver deads in my oloder one and it still shaves as good as my newer much costlier model. I think they are making the newer ones more flimsey than the older reliable razors.</li>
    <li> For the past 25 years I have been using Remington foil shavers--most recently the Remington MS3 3700. I was always happy with them, but nothing mechanical lasts forever.  I had never used a rotary shaver before getting this Norelco 8240 last month.  I have to say I am reasonably happy with it.  Plusses include (1) It is VERY quiet, much quieter than any of my Remingtons, (2) It shaves close enough to satisfy me--almost as close as my Remington foil shavers, (3) Easy to clean.  Minuses?  Nothing big. (1) The unit has an awkward shape that makes it harder to hold in my hand, (2) The rotary shavers have a bit more trouble shaving hard-to-reach spots like under my nose.  But I am glad I bought it, and I would gladly buy it again.    By the way, I would have gladly bought the Braun Series 7 at over $200, but I was turned off by its overly-elaborate cleaning \\&quot;system\\&quot; that requires the purchase of special cleaning fluid.  Seems like Braun has made cleaning a much bigger deal than necessary. I don&#x27;t want to have to park some special cleaning stand beside my bathroom sink.</li>
    <li> I received the Norelco razor as a gift from my wife.  It gives a close shave though it takes some time for your skin to get used to it.</li>
    <li> i have a boraun 1 series, i can use it to get more out after i used this 8240.  this head tech is really not good for normal daily shaving, eventough it has 3....  this head is good for the long mustache if you shave every two weeks. for the other system such as panasonic and braun it is not very good agains the long mustache,(advanced braun system is different)  braun 1 series can beat this. the reason i give 2 star is beacuse it has a really strong battary. in this two month, i only charged it once when i open the box</li>
    <li> I bought one 2 months back.   I had never used an electric shaver before and have been using Regular three blade razors since last 10 years. The shaving with this razor is quite confortable and fast.   The shaving is not as close as a regular razor and it does not shave properly near the neck and nose.   Otherwise its a handy product to have for travelling purpose or for the time when you getting late for office and want to get ready real fast.</li>
    <li> I got mine (in fact an 8245) from Costco, with a $25 immediate rebate.  The package includes an extra set of replacement heads (Q9, costing over $30 separately).  The shave is very efficint &amp; soft, much better than the single row of blades in other models.  The shaver is very light &amp; user-friendly.  It may be washed perfectly &amp; safely under very hot water in a short time &amp; dries very quickly.  The initial battery charge of about 17 hrs. was good enough for 11 days. Successive charge takes about an hour or less.  Unfortunately it lacks the low-charge light.  So it suddenly stops in the middle of your shave, hence 4.5/5 stars.  Otherwise it&#x27;s my best shaver for almost 50 years !!</li>
    <li> This shaves very close and the battery stays up for a week or more at a time.  Very Good shaver!</li>
    <li> Received as a birthday gift, the 8240 replaces a five-year-old Norelco shaver.  I should have made the replacement long ago!  The 8240 is a much improved product, the shave really is closer than a blade, and, at least over the first month of use, battery life has been excellent with 11 or 12 thorough shaves between charges.  This product is truly \\&quot;worth what paid for\\&quot; and more.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this a lot when he got it as birthday gift. I would recomend it to other friends as well!</li>
    <li> i only had 3 shavers before, but this works the best by far. it gets a close shave, has a good lithium battery (unlike nicd which have barbaric chargers and therefore degrade quickly) easy and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> IVE USED A BRAUN FOR 15 YEARS AND DECIDED TO FIND A NEW RAZOR AS THE CUTTING HEADS FOR MY BRAUN WERE GETTING HARDER TO LOCATE.  THE KIDS BOUGHT THIS FOR ME FOR CHRISTMAS.    I CHARGED ACCORDING TO DIRECTIONS.  I HAD TO ASK MY WIFE IF SHE COULD HEAR THE MOTOR RUNNING IT WAS SO QUIET.  THE PROBLEM IS:  IT IS QUIET BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS BARELY TURNING.  IT CUTS, BUT YOU KNOW THAT IT IS CUTTING BECAUSE IT IS PULLING ON THE WHISKERS.  YOU HAVE TO GO OVER THE SAME AREA SEVERAL TIMES TO GET GOOD RESULTS.  I DONT KNOW WHY THE MOTOR RUNS SO SLOWLY.  AFTER READING SEVERAL OF THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS HERE, IT SEEMS TO BE THE NORM.    IMAGINE USING A BLADE AND PULLING IT SLOWLY DOWN YOUR FACE.  SAME FEELING.  LOTS OF RASH ON THE TENDER AREAS AS WELL.    ILL TAKE THIS BACK.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a \\&quot;blade\\&quot; man my entire life but the cost of using disposable razors has gotten cost prohibitive for a recently retired guy like me, so, after doing some online research, I took the plunge and purchased this 8240 Norelco.  I figured that the cost was reasonable and I&#x27;ve always believed that \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot; That philosophy has served me well once again.    Does it shave as close as a blade? No, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to do so. It does provide a satisfactory shave (I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard), is easy to clean, a once per week recharge of the battery has worked so far, it takes me less time to shave, saves water, saves energy (hot water), keeps my used disposable razors out of the landfill, and best of all it saves me money by reducing my shaving costs by an estimated 50% per year and that ain&#x27;t too shabby.    What&#x27;s not to like? It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for almost 30 years now.  I had Remington, Panasonic and Braun moments where I traded my face for a close shave but, in the end, the comfort of the Norelco&#x27;s always won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 8240XL about two weeks ago to replace my last one which I dropped.  Here&#x27;s my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- no quieter than any other Norelco I&#x27;ve owned.  Its quiet but no different.&lt;br /&gt;- assumed good battery life, have yet to charge it since its initial charge.&lt;br /&gt;- decent ergonomics though a bit too light for me.&lt;br /&gt;- build quality is down substantially from the last Norelco I purchased, though that was over 10 years ago.  Drop this one and I assume I would pick it up in pieces.&lt;br /&gt;- good comfort, best I&#x27;ve ever had.  No matter where I shave, no burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the bad news.  This is the worst shaving electric razor I have ever owned.  Perhaps I have a bad one but its pathetic.  Yesterday I intentionally tried to get a decent shave by passing every part of my face 50 (fifty) times.  Each time I would hear it chopping away on what was left from the last pass and after 50 passes it was still chopping away.  If I need to go out at night, its another shave - I have never done this in the past as I&#x27;m not that picky about a smooth shave.  Someone else mentioned it but this shaver appears underpowered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is being returned.</li>
    <li> I AM 69 YRS OF AGE .  I HAVE USED NORELCO SHAVERS SENSE I WAS 13YRS. OF AGE.  I HAVE TRIED OTHER SHAVERS AND NONE COMPAIR TO THE NORECO.  MY NEW MODEL IS NO EXCEPTION.  WORKS GREAT AND LAST A LONG TIME.  MY LAST SHAVER WAS A NORELCO. USED IT FOR 18 YEARS.  IN FACT IT STILL WORKS O.K.   BATTERY IS FAILING. STILL WORKS GOOD WITH THE PLUG IN.  THANK YOU.   PERRY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers for more than 35 years.  I like them and the 8240 provides the best shave of all the others I have owned.  I am disapointed, however, at the very short battery life.  I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 11 months and the battery died.  I contacted Norelco and they promptly sent a replacement under the warranty, which is all well and fine.  However, this is now the 4th Norelco I&#x27;ve had in about 5 years.  My previous model battery died after a little more than a year.  Norelco replaced it under the warranty but the replacement lasted just a little over a year.  So, I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco&#x27;s in the past 5 years that have failed prematurely.  This used to never be the case.  I used to get 5 to 7 years out of a Norelco before the battery went.  I hope the ppl at Norelco solve this problem because I&#x27;m running out of patience.  Furthermore, once the warranty is expired, battery replacement is not user friendly, you can&#x27;t just pop open the case and slide it out, it&#x27;s designed to be replaced by a technician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this shaver 5 stars for shaving performance, one star for battery life and 5 stars for Norelco customer service, thus a weighted average of 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****************&lt;br /&gt;June, 2012 UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;The warranty replacement shaver they sent me last June died this past weekend.  I am extremely disappointed in the quality of Norelco shavers in recent years.  It makes me sad because I really like the shaving performance.  However, I am out of patience and have replaced the Norelco with a different brand.</li>
    <li> This was not an Amazon purchase, but I bought a 8240XL Norelco Razor from a local store about 6 months ago. While cleaning the 8240XL on Sunday, June 5th, a \\&quot;spindle\\&quot; broke off. I called Phillips support and to my surprise I was talking to a customer service rep in less than 1 minute! Dan was great. After listening to my problem, he quickly determined that the 8240XL could not be fixed. He took my address and said that he would send a new one out on Monday. Today is Wednesday June 8th and my new (not refurbished) 8240XL arrived today. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave. Easy to use. This is the 3rd Norelco shaver I have purchased in the last 20 years. They last and last. I still have my 1st shaver, I use it as a spare. The 2nd shaver just went after 15 years. If this shaver lasts half as long, I&#x27;ll be satisfied. The only dislike, there is no warning light for recharging. It just shuts off. The 8250 has this warning, but I couldn&#x27;t find it. I even went to Norelco Philips, they don&#x27;t sell it.   For an outstanding shave at a reasonable price, this is the one to buy.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my husband for Christmas.  He loves how it shaves.  Replaced on older version, but the price was in our range.</li>
    <li> My first electronic shaving system, even for a newbie like me it works excellent, read through the manual if you are not experienced in using electronic shaver.  I guess its the best product it its price range, recommended!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver hoping it would be an upgrade from my 10 yr old Norelco 5801XL, but after using them both side by side, I concluded that this shaver was no better.  Perhaps slightly worse.  Don&#x27;t buy into the marketing hype.  The shaving heads with 3 rows might seem like a good idea, but they&#x27;re no faster than my old single row shaver.  In fact, they seemed to cause more irritation and I had to repeatedly go over the same place to pick up some of the stubborn hairs.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an electric razor then quit looking and get this one.  Amazing price and I can&#x27;t imagine a better one by anybody.  Very quiet and does a superior shave.  I am still waiting to be mobbed by young women--am sure this will happen soon. I like the fact that it has a small plug-in charging unit because I don&#x27;t want a charging stand I would have to find a place to put in my crowded bathroom AND when I travel I  want to not have to have another bulkly thing to pack.  And it came with another set of replacement blades--have never had that before.  Gotta go, someone is at the door--probably the first wave of young women.</li>
    <li> Product is excellent:  Batteries last longer then 17 days...BUT: To bad Norelco doesn&#x27;t watch their packaging.  The owner/operational manual was to some other unit and the package was so tough, had to use metal cutting tools to get into it.  Normal shears wouldn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Norelco shaver of one type or another since 1982.  This however will be the last Norelco I buy.    1. Takes forever to shave with it.    2. Low power.  3. And worst of all the head is spring loaded with a hair trigger clasp.  If you bump this razor, the head flys open, spilling the fine trimmings EVERYWHERE!    I use cordless so I can shave away from the sink.  This thing EXCELLS in spreading my beard trimmings all over my house.    Finally had enough.  Trying a different manufacturer with my next purchase.</li>
    <li> I ordered this man&#x27;s razor because all of the lady&#x27;s razors I&#x27;ve tried have been pretty much worthless!!!! This one works great. It does a much better job than  women&#x27;s razors &amp; also runs quietly. I&#x27;ll never order a women&#x27;s razor again!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the quietest electric razor I have ever not heard!  I got this to take on trips and such or for when I just don&#x27;t feel like getting out the shaving cream and razor.  I have been very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of rotary shavers over the years and this is the worst. Thankfully I have very light hair. If I had a heavier or darker beard it would look like I needed a shave every time I finished.</li>
    <li> My old Philips shaver was a HQ9070 with 2 heads and it costs more than this triple head 8240. Both have the same clean shave performance, but the triple head 8240 cuts (no pun intended) your shaving time in half.</li>
    <li> I was simply replacing a previous model come to early grief after tiny child decided it was time to trim the shrubs with it.    I was delighted to receive a far lighter, easier to use, and efficient product.  It just glides so easily as it does its work.    Needless to say it is well hidden from the grandchildren ... though I&#x27;ll be happy enough for them to have a test run themselves when their time comes.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver 5 months ago.  After the first few really fantastic shaves and 2 or 3 recharges the damn thing started giving really poor shaves.  It would take me 15 minutes of tough going to produce satisfactory results.  They were not great!  Each recharge did not last very long and each following shave was getting worse. I began using a 40 year old Braun sold by Abercrombie &amp; Fitch to finish the shave.  Time wore on and I was ready to toss it and buy another Braun foil shaver. I called Norelco and explained the problem.  They apologized for the trouble I was having and quickly replaced it with a new one.  They sent instructions, box and a mailing label to return the old one postage free.  The new one is much better and I was warned only to charge it the recommended time.  Over charging will wear out the battery quicker and the shave will be unsatisfactory due to the lack of proper power. Norelco stands behind it products!</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this shaver.   Much better than his previous NORELCO model.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a dozen Norelco shavers over the years. This particular shaver is the worst yet. No matter how many times I drag it around my face, I can never get a close shave. It seems Norelco keeps making them cheaper and cheaper as the years go by with no improvement in performance. They hype improvements, but in this case the triple bladed head leaves uncut whiskers all over my face. It has a pathetic little drive motor in it that just doesn&#x27;t seem to have enough horsepower to get the job done. Pass on this one and look else where.</li>
    <li> Much improved razor over one it replaced.  Much quieter, very smooth, close shave. Glad I decided to replace the whole razor instead of just the cutting blades on the old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with Norelco triple-head shavers a long time. The two previous ones I&#x27;ve owned each lasted for ten years or more until the Ni-Cad batteries would no longer hold a charge. The Speed XL model I bought in June 2009 has been performing well and has two advantages: the NiMh battery charge lasts much longer and cleaning is quick &amp; easy with just a daily rinse under hot water, instead of dismantling the head and brushing the blades and combs.     Room for improvement would be in the case provided, which is basically a sleeve that holds only the razor itself, not the separate charger. The specifications suggest that a full charge will last through 17 shaves (and it seems to do that), but, if travelling more than two weeks, the charger would have to be packed separately. I managed to squeeze the new shaver and charger into the old (larger) leather case that came with my previous Norelco model - a tight fit (previous models had only a cord, this one has an external transformer).    This seems to be a good product and was available at a better price at Amazon.com than at Costco or at other online sites.</li>
    <li> The Norelco 8240XL is probably the best shaver I have ever purchased. It cuts close without any irritation to the skin and is so quiet you hardly realize it is running.  Another bonus feature is that when you open the compartment with the blades, you can wash the heads without taking them out of the razor. Finally someone was thinking about the customer when they created this shaver!  It is great right out of the box.</li>
    <li> My first impression was. because it was so quiet, I thought the battery needed charging, as it sounded like my old Norelco when it&#x27;s battery was run down. However, the new razor was doing a great job cutting, where the old one wouldn&#x27;t when needing charging.    Because it is so quiet, I still don&#x27;t know how to tell when charging is required. I am sure I will learn this soon! Great cutting razor!</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace another Norelco I owned that is 8 years old. This new one, the 8240xl, does a great job but it just seems to be not as well made as the previous one. It&#x27;s lighter weight and feels like it flexes a bit when I hold it. There&#x27;s also no readout to tell you how much batter life is left, which was a great feature on my old one. All in all, it does a good job, just not as solidly constructed as the old one.</li>
    <li> I like it now - after a few weeks of using it (not at first).  I was used to the quadra action feel, but this razor feels and works fine now.  It doesn&#x27;t seem faster than my quadra action razor.  Think about it: there is additional cutting area in the speed shaving system, but since the blades angular velocity is constant, the portion of blade near the blade center is moving more slowly (measured linearly) than the part of the blade at the perimeter.  So a 50% increase in shaving area doesn&#x27;t translate to a 50% faster shave, but somewhere in between 0% and 50%.    The trimmer isn&#x27;t nearly as good as that of my quadra action unit, especially at the ends - exactly where you need the most precise cut.  So it loses a star for that.</li>
    <li> The new Philips Norelco (formerly known as just Norelco) 8240 comes to you in a box with a window that allows the shaver to be seen within its clear plastic packaging.  You will need a sharp pair of scissors and/or a Rambo-style Bowie knife to hack thru this hard plastic covering and remove the shaver.  Use extreme caution when doing so.  Once you&#x27;ve defeated the packaging, you will find the sleek, gunmetal gray shaver; a protective cap; a small cleaning brush; a curly AC power cord; English/Spanish instruction booklet and a basic black zippered nylon case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says you should plug the shaver in and let it charge for a full 12 hours before using it for the first time.  The light on mine started blinking within the first hour, but I left it plugged in overnight anyway.  When I tried the 8240 out the next morning, I was amazed at how quiet it is.  My old Braun buzzes like a lawnmower, but this thing just whispers!  The Norelco will supposedly go for up to 17 shaves before it needs recharging, and you&#x27;re not supposed to recharge it until the battery is nearly depleted.  Note that this model lacks the LOW BATTERY indicator light available on the 8250 and 8251 models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall design of this razor is quite impressive.  The three shaver heads rock all around individually and the entire head assembly pivots on side bolts.  This allows the cutters to hug your face while you shave for better results.  Best of all, there&#x27;s a latch on the front that allows the hinged top to be popped open for easy cleaning.  After shaving, you just push this button and run hot water inside the hair collection chamber and under the blades.  Then you just leave it open to air dry.  On the back of the 8240 is the standard spring release trimmer for mustaches and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can try the Philips Norelco 8240 risk-free for 45 days.  If you&#x27;re not fully satisfied after using this shaver exclusively for three weeks, you can send it back to Philips Norelco for a refund--but it must be shipped prepaid by insured mail.  So you really have nothing to lose but the cost of shipping.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  But, if you&#x27;ve got the extra cash, you might want to go for the higher grade 8250 or 8251 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;WARNING: Close supervision is necessary when this razor is used by children.\\&quot;t be shipped prepaid by insured mail.

    <li> Well I received this razor from Amazon.com in immaculate condition. I have never used an electric razor prior to this one and all I can say is electric shaving is a great alternative.  This unit is light-weight, holds a charge for weeks, and is simple to maintain.  I simply turn the unit on and run the razor over my face in small circular motions and voila! smooth clean skin free of any hairs. The unit cleans easily under running water and apparently, the blades are antimicrobial!  Now with all the rules and regulations for airline flights, an electric razor will prevent some of the headaches while traveling. Plus since this unit holds a charge for weeks, you can leave the charger at home. As for the flip-up trimmer, I have only used it once on my sideburns and found it difficult to use since it is hard to see where the blades will make contact. I&#x27;m sure with some practice it will become easier.    This is a wonderful razor and I&#x27;m glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I gifted it to my bf ...   He really likes it , as its very efficient at shaving the cheeks , but he finds it hard to shave under the chin. Keeping that aside, its awesome !</li>
    <li> IT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY WELL SINCE I HAVE IT, I LIKE TO RECOMMEND IT TO OUR FRIENDS. THE ONLY THING IT IS MISSING USB RECHARGERBILITY.</li>
    <li> This was my first foray into the world of electric shaving. It was a Deal of the Day here on Amazon and I had been considering getting one so I gave it a shot. I am pleased with the results for the most part. When given the chance it cuts very well and gets pretty smooth results. I keep a goatee and shaving around it is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I miss a day of shaving it seems to have a harder time with longer hair. That and shaving the neck is somewhat troublesome and seems to take too much time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this has done though is made me consider really looking into a great electric shaver because my first experience has been a positive one.</li>
    <li> The razor was purchased as a gift for my husband.  He has not used the Norelco before but was very pleased with how quiet it is and his ability to get a close shave in a short time.  He also likes the ease of cleaning.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for 30 years or so and this is the best one yet. Nice comfortable close shave. Easiest to clean - I really love the being able to rinse it out under hot running water. A charge is supposed to last up to a week, but I&#x27;m still on the first charge after two.</li>
    <li> After 15 years with a Braun - I opted to upgrade to a new electric shaver and I have not been disappointed. Great shave for   an electric and it holds a charge through several shaves...Great deal on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System is a very great item.And I very love  it.Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System is a very great item.And I very love  it.</li>
    <li> Does need some time to get used to it. I bought this item to make use of it when i am travelling. i think its excellent buy</li>
    <li> It is quiet, sharp, smooth, and easy to use. It keeps a charge for a long time. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Picked this up at a steal of a price as part of a Gold-box buy about a month ago.  This is the second Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an improvement over my old razor.  It does work pretty well, and it&#x27;s what I expected for the price. I don&#x27;t like the way the lights work when you charge the razor...there&#x27;s no easy way to see how much charge is remaining in the battery. My old razor had a series of lights that would go out as the battery was depleted. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these guys when it was featured as a Deal of the Day for Amazon.  I typically like to use the good old fashioned shaving cream and razor as I felt that it is just a better shave.  However, there are 2 drawbacks for this method and that the time it takes and the mess it makes.  I was hoping to use the Norelco as a stop gap when I was short on time (i.e. hit the snooze button one too many times) and also from the fact that I wasn&#x27;t tied to the sink.  Whlie the Norelco does avoid the mess, I find that I am unable to save much time.  I feel like too often there are whiskers that are missed, causing me to feverishly try to get those whiskers.  Often, I actually don&#x27;t even notice til I get to work!  Overall, it does work well, but I did have slightly hire expectations.  It is much easier to clean than I remember electric razors previously, as I am able to lightly rinse this in the sink, so that definitely is a bonus.  So I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars for still getting the job done, but docked 1 star because it still takes as long a manual shave for me.</li>
    <li> The shaver is great, however, the instructions on how to make the pop up trimmer pop up was not clear. I was about to return the shaver until I just somehow made the trimmer pop up.   That made my day. I and my wife both could not make the trimmer pop up until my accident it pop up</li>
    <li> The quality of the shave is good but I miss the bells and whistles that my old one had. The battery status on my old shaver let you recharge when the charge gets low. The 8240 just stops and you have to plug it in to finish. Trying to save some money but would get more features on my next shaver.</li>
    <li> The battery in my previous Norelco tri-head shaver died recently after 6 years of trouble-free service.  I would have kept the shaver if I could have replaced the battery.  After reading Amazon reviews of various models I decided to try the 8240. (Thanks, fellow reviewers, for steering me right.) This shaver is so quiet that I wasn&#x27;t sure it was running when I first switched it on. What&#x27;s more, it does the job in half as much time as the old one and shaves even closer -- nearly as smooth as a blade.  Being able to clean it just by rinsing with hot running water is another big improvement.  For $60 it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
    <li> The smoothest shave ever in an electric razor. The Norelco brand always a favorite for me, but this product tops them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it was the packaging or the facility it came from, but the box it came in look demolished and beat up. I had to double check my order invoice to make sure I hadn&#x27;t inadvertently ordered a used or refurbished item. The product itself seems to be working fine(though it arrived not too long ago today). I&#x27;ll write an update should I incur any problems. But with the box, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use the 8240 xl in the last month, it is very comfortable and quickly than other shaver i usedB</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  It arrived on time, carefully packed and was all that I expected.  I would not only recommend the product but also the company from which I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It worked fine from 12/12/ll until the head fell apart on 1/11/12! 1 month!  I just increased my my Philips Norelco speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving   system warranty to 2.5 years, CCRongdir4gp.  I was told that the shipping was free on my shaving system purchased from Amazon, yet I was charged $5.88 for shipping  and handling for a total of $65.87 which I paid by Mastercard.</li>
    <li> The new Norelco 8240 is a good shaver but it has to go a ways to keep up with my old one witch is 34 years old ( 1978 ) and I still use it !!!!!!!  What can I say except Norelco makes good stuff .......  If this one last 34 years and it&#x27;s still smoking in the morning, NORELCO can send me a free one next time ......  My old one came with a nice lined case to keep it in ( RED ) and I still have it ,  looks GOOD , wish this one had a case with it ......  The old one is a plug in with an adjustable three head for high and low cuts on the cutting area , this new one has a better floating head with it , witch is nice and gives you a good clean shave ......  AMAZON was \\&quot; GREAT \\&quot; with shipment and tracking during the Christmas season , my son said it only took three days to arrive by mail ......  Well , if this one last 34 years and still smokes on the face , I will buy a new one for my GRANDSON , he will not be a \\&quot; LITTLE SHAVER \\&quot; then !!!!!!!  Way to go AMAZON , good products on your net ......    B.O.B.</li>
    <li> Quite satisfied with shaving performance,it&#x27;s fast and clean.  There is one CON however: you get NO WARNING that the battery charge is low  or dead. Not much of a problem, just connect the cord.</li>
    <li> I was a razor guy mostly because I didn&#x27;t want to sink $100 into this but after 2 weeks of ownership, I&#x27;m happy I finally did. The convenient of shaving dry is totally worth it. I can&#x27;t compare this device to other electric shavers but compared to a razor it doesn&#x27;t cut as close and can be more irritating on your skin but I&#x27;m getting used to it and am so far happy with this device and my purchase. If you&#x27;re considering leaving your razor, I say go for it.</li>
    <li> Have been using various Norelco shavers for the past thirty years. Recently had to replace my shaver, and unfortunately tried another top brand. After two months of bad results I purchased another Norelco and have been extremely satisfied, especially on the neck area.</li>
    <li> I just got the 8240XL today for a Christmas present.  It replaces an old 5825XL.  Well, after the initial 12-hour charge, and with a two day growth, I went to work.  Not really work.  I got a very close, smooth shave that is as close as any blade has done.  I&#x27;ve got a goatee, so it takes a bit to shave around it, but I&#x27;ve learned how to do that with a 3 head Norelco over the years and this one works great.    I think the thing I may end up liking the best is being able to clean it by rinsing under the hot water tap.  I never liked cleaning the old one, which I had to do at least once a week.  But running it under the faucet, shaking out the water and letting it dry - fantastic.    No problem giving this one a five star.  Quiet, close shaving, easy cleaning, long life on a one hour charge (after the initial 12 hour of course).  Thank you sweetheart, for the great Christmas present.    ****    An update -- a month later and I&#x27;m still shaving on the initial charge.  Granted, with mustache and goatee, I don&#x27;t have a full face to shave, but still, a month on one charge.  It is getting a bit weaker, so it will need a charge soon, but it is still shaving good on that one charge.</li>
    <li> Husband really likes the closeness of the razor and especially that the razor heads can be rinsed.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with an electric razor. It has taken a while for me to achieve a good shave in a short period of time, but there is some learning curve and my skin had to adjust as well. After a few weeks I can get a shave that is comparable to what I got with a Gillette Mach 5. The ability to clean the razor with hot water is a very nice feature. The hair trimmer also comes in handy at times and is a decent size.     Overall I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it to others, so long as they have the right expectations.</li>
    <li> This replaced my two-year-old non-speed xl Norelco shaver and so far it works slightly better. I still find I have to shave daily for best performance. If I wait two or three days it seems to take forever to finish the job and I ultimately have to use a razor blade (ouch)to get the longer facial hairs the shaver just won&#x27;t grab. The shave is slightly closer than my older Norelco, but I  imagine it could be because the blades are new. I&#x27;ve had five Norelco shavers and have found it&#x27;s less costly to buy a new shaver after two or so years of use than to buy the very costly replacement blades. It is such a shame to have to do that but until Norelo lowers the price on its replacement heads I&#x27;ll just have to keep replacing the shaving units every few years.</li>
    <li> i have been shaving using norelco electrics for 40 years, [yikes!], and they seem to last 2-4 years before i have to replace them. i have never felt it necessary to replace the blades. when my pervious razor hit the floor for the thousandth time, and i finally couldn&#x27;t put humpty back together again, i had to buy a new one. this is one of those purchases that no one WANTS to buy, but when it becomes inevitable; [beard?], you break down, at really, at least, should check out reviews. the wrong razor can be a 3 year mistake, or a tough waste of money. well, i am happy to report, that after a moth of use, this one is the best one i have had EVER. i included my little history to help you see if we have had a common experience. it shaves close, very quiet, and today, after a month, i had to re charge for the first time. that&#x27;s probably all you need to know. feels great in my hand, light but substantial. looks cool enough. there are cheaper ones. cheaper, in this case, is probably more expensive. more expensive ones probably have bells you don&#x27;t need to ring.</li>
    <li> This shaver replaced my several-year-old Norelco.  It looked fairly similar and it is.  The new shaver is more comfortable.  The one downside is there is no indicator when the batter is about to go dead--very annoying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and I&#x27;ve had at least 10 Norelco Shavers over the last 40 years since I was 18, and I probably would rate all of them close to 5 stars. My experience is Norelco makes excellent durable products, but this one I just bought is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever have own.  My old Norelco shaver that is 2 years old cuts much better than this new model. This new shaver pulls hairs and really hurts to shave with.  It&#x27;s like Norelco shipped this one with bad blades, or someone tradded the the new blades with an old worn out set before they shipped it to me. I took this one out of the box just past the 30 return time.  I never would have guessed I would have a problem with a new Norelco shaver. If Norelco does not fix this I will order new blades to see if it corrects the problem. My best advise is try a different Norelco model or order from a different merchant.</li>
    <li> Using Norelco electric shavers for at least 16 years, had never bought too expensive ones. I would say that 8240 XL is a perfect shaver for this price.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a similar, older model.  This unit is extremely quiet (a whisper) compared to my other (3-4 year old) model.  The heads are also different and are much smoother going over the face.  This model also has a \\&quot;pivot\\&quot; to the head which makes movement over the face and neck more comfortable.  It is also much lighter.  My only complaint is that the shave is not as close as my other shaver.  I find that I have to press harder and go over the face much more to get that \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; look, otherwise, there will still be a slight stubble look to the face.  The shave also does not appear to last as long and by the end of the day the face looks a little more ragged than compared to when I shaved with the other model, which tells me it&#x27;s not cutting as close.  It is very easy to clean and looks very modern. The pop out trimmer on this model is also wider than my previous model which makes trimming sideburns much easier.  I would give it more stars if it cut better!</li>
    <li> I have very little positive to say about this razor, but with great effort I&#x27;ll try. The razor is weighty and feels like it is constructed with quality parts, and it also cleans relatively easily. Also you can use the razor while it is plugged in (very nice).    Now for the negative. The motor is obviously VERY weak and slow. The razor pulls out any hairs longer than small stubble assuming it even finds the hair. As the last sentence implies the razor misses a lot of hairs and requires multiple passes. The trimmer is near useless and appears to work only when using an upward stroke at an angle (which coincidently closes the floppy trimmer). This purchase is a serious mistake and is likely only being praised by people who have not owned a really good electric razor. At this point, I have owned 3 norelco&#x27;s and they were all pretty bad. I am starting to think that only foil razors are any good.    The best electric razor I&#x27;vd owned is the Panasonic ES8807. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. It has a super powerful motor (13,000rpm!!) that allows for fast, virtually pain-free, shaving. And the trimmer on that razor is awesome compared to the norelco one. I use it to cut my sideburns trim around my ears...whatever. The only downside with the panasonic razor is that you cannot shave when the razor is plugged in. Cleans easily too. I just open the foil, dip the razor in water, and turn it on...and tada clean.    Overall I think motor power is really important and norelco just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
    <li> It is a very good shaver. I like it so much. but it leads that I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> I rated it ok because there have owned other Norelco shavers in the past that were much better than this one. It arrived on time.  I would not recommend the product to a friend</li>
    <li> Another great product from Norelco! I have been using Norelco Shavers for years and this is another great product from them! Performed like a champ from day one, just rinse it off when you&#x27;re done!</li>
    <li> i still didn&#x27;t get it.i don&#x27;t know why.could you have a check and tell me why.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for over 50 years. Norelco&#x27;s have been my shaver of choice for most of this period. I recently replaced my 6 year old Norelco with a new SpeedXL, 8240XL. This shaver gives me the cleanest, smoothest shave that I have ever had. It provides me with \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot; closeness without any skin irritation. I have always preferred Norelco to other brands and this by far the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric razors for 15 years and this is teh best one I ever had...</li>
    <li> It was better than my previous norelco.  Shaved smoother, softer, and quieter.  charge lasts longer too.  It only gets better...</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Norelco electrics razors for years, no century&#x27;s and they continue to provide a close, smooth shave. This razor provides a very good shave every time I use it. It does not get the hairs on my upper lip next to my nose as close as my previous razor, but with time I will adapt adapt and make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the money. I use the razor daily and the charge lasts me a full two weeks.</li>
    <li> What a great shaver, even from day one I get a very close and comfortable shave, not as close as a blade but nearly. Very quiet razor, comfortable to use and super easy to clean. I also like the fact that the heads follow the contour of my face.  I have owned a Remington and 3 Brauns, but this is by far the best electric I have ever tried and for only $60!  Also, prior to purchasing, I contacted Norelco customer service (you actually get a real person to speak with)they were able to tell me the difference between the 8240 and the 7000 series models and they answer your call quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my very picky husband to replace a similar Norelco model that he had worn out.  He&#x27;s very particular about the products he uses, so I read reviews and crossed my fingers that he would appreciate the effort if not the product itself.  He loved it!  Says it&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever had.  So go ahead and add it to your cart - you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this shaver. My grandfather used Norelco&#x27;s so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Terrible! I&#x27;ve used older foils before in the 90&#x27;s and they burned my neck a bit but this rotary absolutley tore me up. I was really gonna try to give it a month for beard adaptation or whatever but had to throw in the towel after a week. It yanked half the fur on my face! I tried preshave balms, onlyu going slow and only goingg in one direction but no matter what i tried i&#x27;d constantly be flinching from the pulls. Like trying to shave with one of those electric turkey knives, lol. Stressed me out. I also tried the Braun 8000 and 9000 series and liked them alot but ended up going with the Panasonic Nano 4 series. Very pleased with it and the value it represents.</li>
    <li> I like this razor, but wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive and that it gave a warning before the battery went dead. Otherwise, it does a nice job.</li>
    <li> Generally I like this unit. You can rinse to clean it which I like a lot and it stays charged for more than a week of shaves.  Overall I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and i was blown away by how well it performed. I do not grow a lot of facial hair, but this works great for what I have. I love how quiet it is and by how well it performs. I haven&#x27;t had this baby smooth of skin for a long time, and now I see what I have been missing the whole time. This works exactly as intended and is an excellent shaver for facial hair and the underlying neck hair.  Pros:  Great Price  Great Performance  Not loud at all  Cons:  None that I can find so far!  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The 8240 is proving to be a very good shaver, and good value at the price.  It shaves even closer than my previous Norelco, runs quietly, and holds a very long charge.  It also recharges very quickly.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I went back to a razor - not the best shave</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Shaves close. A shame they don&#x27;t male this model anymore.</li>
    <li> I gave up blade razor shaving 10 years ago and have owned several electric razors, including a Norelco some years back. The batteries finally gave out on a Remington I owned most recently and I returned to Norelco after looking at many reviews. The 8240XL I got from Amazon 4 weeks ago is outstanding in every way. It gives close, comfortable shaves, is compact and easy to clean, and has amazing battery life. I have charged it once since purchase and it continues to operate with plenty of power. I am very satisfied and Amazon delivered it without delay in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going back to my blade. I tried this product hoping that I would get away from the ingrown hairs that I keep getting. My facial hair is very curly and I get a lot of ingrown hairs. But I just could not get all the hairs with this electric razor. I will give it to my son who has a better time with electrics.</li>
    <li> Unit does an ok job but not the closest shave. My old Norelco, a 7825XL shaves much closer. I should order new batteries for the old razor and send this 8240XL back.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco Speed 8250XL, for the price, is the best shaver around. I decided, many years ago, that Norelco was the best.  Phillips Norelco has really outdone themselves, in closeness, shaving comfort, and battery life.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it and so far there haven&#x27;t been any problems. Seems to be doing a better job then the cheaper ones I bought from Wal-mart. I guess I&#x27;ll know in a few months if it craps out like they did.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, but the model number is not the same as the manual info. DO NOT let this shaver stay plugged in. Run it all the way down. My husband loves how it works, and it is fabulous!!&lt;br /&gt;It does not take long to recharge. And you can rinse it under water!!</li>
    <li> I am 70 years old and have used electric shavers most of my adult life. This shaver is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. The last one I kept only one year. I believed a consumer article that said you did not have to spend a lot of money for a good shaver. This is quiet, smooth, and charge lasts for over a week.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco shavers for about 40 years and this one is the smoothest and fastest shaver I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works.  The person I gave it to seemed very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but with the good reviews, I tried it.  I have medium thickness hair but it swirls on my neck and lays down so it is hard to get.  I was very skeptical of this razor and tried it right out of the box and thought, OK, at least there is a 30 day return policy.  But then I gave it a charge and as recommended, said I would try it for 30 days to get used to it, well on the second day I was sold!  It shaves close, fast and effortlessly and is super quite.  The rpms are low, which I thought was odd, but it makes sense when you think about the cutting process it uses.  Cleans in a snap and even the side cutter is accurate and sharp!    Overall, blown away and love it, just about 30 days in and I am extremely pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for almost two years now, I bought it here on Amazon. The battery still lasts a bit over a month for me and I use it for about five minutes every morning. The shave quality has dropped off a little bit, but since you are supposed to purchase new blades yearly that&#x27;s my fault. It still does a good enough job for me so the spare blades I bought sit next to the razor still in their package. I wonder if I should buy a second one for if/when the one I have dies. Odds are mine will die after they stop selling them.</li>
    <li> i have been using this norelco shaver for the last month and its great ,alot quieter ,easy to clean,and i hardley ever charge it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is everything it is advertised to be. I was skeptical when ordering but after using it I am totally satisfied.</li>
    <li> Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;ve never been a fan of electric razors. I understand the appeal, that you can get a quick shave with less mess, but they&#x27;ve never worked well for me. I have a very thick beard and in each case, I end up having to go back over everything with a standard razor. I decided to give the Philips Norelco 8240XL a real test and put it up against a week&#x27;s growth. I know that&#x27;s not a typical real-world test unless you&#x27;re lazy (like me), but if it could tackle that, then I&#x27;d be sure I could recommend it to tackle day-to-day shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to report that the 8240XL performed more than adequately. While the going was a bit slow at the get-go, the razor didn&#x27;t seem to struggle cutting my beard, and with a little extra time, it took care of my beard. After subsequent uses, I&#x27;ve decided that it works a bit better using some kind of pre-shave lotion (or just soapy water in my case). It works well enough dry, but it&#x27;s a bit better with some help. Using it for a wet shave also cuts down on the minor neck irritation that seems to accompany using it for a dry shave. The trimmer/edger gave me no problems at all and seemingly works better than my Panasonic ER389K beard trimmer for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because that despite the fact that it&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor, it still doesn&#x27;t do the job that an old-school razor blade can do (if I want a really close shave, I still have to go back over my face with my trusty Sensor). As far as electric razors go, I&#x27;ve never used a better one, and I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I switched to using electric razors exclusively about 5 years ago due to the fact I have very sensitive skin and normal razors and shave gel irritate and cause red marks on my skin. My main problem area is the skin under my neck. Over the years I&#x27;ve owned about 5 different electric razors. The first was a 3 blade rotary razor very similar to this one. It was one of the worst razors I&#x27;ve ever used so I switched to using the alternate style electric razor which has a straight razor covered by foil guard and had avoided designs similar to the Norelco 8240xl ever since. I&#x27;ve spent probably $200 on different electric razors over the years and I&#x27;ve never been fully satisfied with them. In fact, I was looking to replace the electric razor I owned now with something new, before I was given an opportunity to review this one.     The main problem I have, again, is the hair under my neck is troublesome. With my previous electric razor it would never give a clean shave under my neck and I would have to go back to using a straight razor and gel again. With my previous electric razors I never got smooth action when I would shave. It was always quite rough and I always had patches of hair left on my face when I&#x27;d already spent several minutes shaving. With the Norelco 8240XL though, I&#x27;m extremely impressed with how smooth the action is against the grain of my beard. There&#x27;s no tugging or anything like that. No rough bumps but incredibly smooth and slick action that I am not used to at all using an electric razor. At first I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed with how close the shave was but after using it for several days, it now shaves closer than any electric razor I&#x27;ve used before. It&#x27;s not baby bottom smooth however, but it&#x27;s smooth enough for me that you can&#x27;t notice beard growth for 24 hours. I also had a bit of irritation one day after using the razor but I think this was because I was using too much pressure as I applied it to my face.     This is by far the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used so far and I&#x27;m kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t try a design like this sooner because my last Braun razor was very poor in comparison.</li>
    <li> Hi, Just received the product yesterday and it was nicely packed by amazon and received 2 working days later than what was estimated. Thanks I received in good condition,    About product : looks like it is pre charged  but still went ahead with power cable and charged it but within 15-20 minutes the LED blinked ..so stopped charging and used immediately on my little grown beard...wow nice clean , non hurting shave...I am sure this shaving effect will improve more I use this shaver...    In the end thanks to Philips for such a nice product..I wonder where can I get mineral oil for cheap though..I have many such devices which recommend using it after interval...    DISADVANTAGE: at the moment only that a little costlier compared to other low end shaver and not sure if it performs well lower part of face..front neck may be ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for about twenty five years, with the last one, a Norelco 5800 series, for the last eight years. I was pleasantly surprised and amazed that the 8240XL gave me a closer and more comfortable shave in half the time. I definitely like being able to wash it out under hot water to clean it. I usually do it after every second or third shave. Great shaver!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Norelco 8240XL shaver that I bought on Amazon.com. It feels comfortable in my hand as I&#x27;m shaving. I had a Norelco 8940XL for 8-10 years that performed flawlessly. The 8240 XL shaver is sooo QUIET! I had a top of-the-line xxxxsonic for a few weeks and gave it to my son, as it was way too LOUD! The shave on the 8240XL is really close, and without any effort.   I am so happy that I bought the 8240XL</li>
    <li> My first one died after 3-4 years and one replacement head. Got this slight update to it and it&#x27;s been very reliable. Shaves close, reasonably fast, and extremely quiet. Once a week I thoroughly clean it (as suggested) by washing and brushing the the blades and cups. Then I dry them and place them face up on kleenex and spray with lubrication.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco 8240 to replace a Norelco razor that finally died after nearly 8 years of constant use.  My experience has been that Norelco razors last a very long time if you take care of them.  The 8240 has concentric razors in each head which increases the amount of shaving surface.  This results in a quicker shave, as advertised.  The Li-ion battery has very long battery life and the flip-top system makes cleaning easy.      There are a handful of small regressions compared to previous generations of Norelco razors.  The precision razor has a tendency to move towards the &#x27;closed&#x27; position when shaving upwards, which is not new, but on previous models the precision razor could easily be kept in the open position while shaving upwards by placing your thumb against the switch that releases the precision razor.  Unfortunately that trick doesn&#x27;t work on the 8240 since the switch that releases the precision razor is mechanically different from previous models.      My last complaint is that the carrying case is too small to fit the charger, unlike my last Norelco razor.  These are relatively small complaints though compared to the quality of this razor.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked perfectly, as expected. The charger and cord were ackward to use, so I used the charger and coiled cord from my old shaver. No problem.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot quieter and easier to clean than my old Norelco, which I must have had for 10 years. More importantly, it gives me a clean shave. What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> I replaced my 15 year old Norelco shaver with this one. I did a lot of research and decided on this model. I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. The things that I like about it:  1. Very close shave and much faster then my old Norelco  2. Does not make a lot of noise  3. Light weight  4. Really holds a charge. I have shaved about 20 times with it on the original charge.   I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The razor works as described and gives one of the closest shaves i have had in recent years. I would recommend to anyone that uses electric razors.</li>
    <li> The item was shipped promptly and arrived in time. It is quieter than the older model but I thought it would have given me a much closer shave. I quess my expectations were a bit high based on previous reviews.</li>
    <li> The last time I used an electric razor was before the fax machine was invented! All aspects of the new design and functionality have come a long way! Having said that, I have not made the leap fully. I use the device as a touch-up for the early morning before my shower. I still use a traditional wet razor with shaving cream after the shower.  The electric is smoother -- less abrasive -- and more ergonomic than I remember it&#x27;s predecessor to be. It also has amazing battery life, but at the end of the day, I still get a better shave with even a cheap disposable &amp; Gillette foamy! I will keep the electric for touch ups and travel. I confess that I did not follow the instructions, which dictate a trial period of a least several weeks using only the electric system to allow the beard to adjust. Guilty as charged, but I just feel cleaner, and get a closer shave with water......  If the process is not broken, why fix it?</li>
    <li> I just purchased the shaver, and charged it overnite as required, and used it today for the first time. The results where great, I have used philips norelco razors for all of my shaving years, And this one rates at the top of the list I have used. I had a Cool Skin most recently until it started to fail I started to shop for it&#x27;s replacement. I have read several reviews and decided on the 8240XL and am very glad I did. I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to the fullest extent for anyone shopping for a great electric shaver</li>
    <li> The shaver works good. I still own the old Norelco 4604X which I still have. One thing I noticed is that the old shaver has a more powerful motor and shaves faster. The 8240XL shaves a bit smoother especially under the chin but does not have enough RPM. I would have prefer a more powerful motor, the noise is not a problem for me as I want performance.    The ability to rinse the shaver heads under a hot water tap is very convenient. I like the fact that you can use the razor as a corded shaver if the battery runs out. No need to wait an hour for a recharge to use it again.    A trick I discovered when using Norelco shavers over the years is that by applying baby powder to you face will prevent the heads from sticking when shaving. The powder provides a dry surface for the shaver to glide.    Its a nice shaver I just prefer if it had more horsepower.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace my aging Norelco Quadra. The first thing I noticed was how much cleaner, faster and quieter it shaved - miles above the Quadra even with new blades. I believe this is largely due to the newer design of the shaving heads which have increased cutting areas. Also, there&#x27;s a considerably deeper clippings reservoir which allows for more shaving and less emptying. But while overall it&#x27;s better, it has a couple downsides.    First, the single-level low charge indicator, while at least it has one, is somewhat ineffective because by the time the amber light comes on the shaver is &#x27;already losing steam.&#x27; That&#x27;s usually how I know the charge is getting low. What would help is an accompanying &#x27;audible signal&#x27; like a simple beep. I mean, an indicator light is great but I can&#x27;t see it unless I &#x27;look at the unit.&#x27; And generally it dies before I can finish shaving, which is a real problem when running behind or in the car. Even a multi-level LED indicator would give some idea of how much charge is left, something the pricier models have.    Secondly [and most annoyingly], unlike the Quadra model if I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple days it &#x27;snags&#x27; whiskers. This can be incredibly irritating [and frustrating] depending on how bad it is [the longer the whiskers, the worse it is]. However, if I shave daily this problem is virtually non-existent. Interestingly, no matter how long I go before shaving my head it never snags [perhaps because the hair is not as thick as a whisker..?]. Some reviewers have stated that the &#x27;SensoTouch&#x27; models don&#x27;t have this problem [as their Speed XL did as well] and I may try one just to see for myself. Fortunately Norelco has a 30 day return policy which makes the decision a little easier because the upper-end shavers are not cheap [especially if you want more convenient features].    All-in-all the Speed XL is a better shaver then its predecessors, at least in my opinion. It&#x27;s closer, faster and quieter. Yet the annoyances I have experienced and design shortcomings keep it from getting anything higher than 3 stars. I look forward to trying a newer model, but going to first review a lot of user feedback. For me a good shaver is more like a long term investment, especially if I&#x27;m going to spend $150 and up.</li>
    <li> This 8240 was an upgrade for me after my  cheaper Norelco died. Unlike other reviewers,  I guess I have the right combination of bone structure, skin and beard to make it work well for me. It charges quickly, it is nice and quiet and it takes half the time to shave as my last shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my first Norelco shaving razor. I dragged it many times on my face but did not get close shave. This is completely useless below the chin areas. I had to drag many more time to get a decent shave there which resulted in many cuts and redness. I am disappointed. Can i return this after one use?</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive about this shaver from some of the other reviews but I&#x27;m happy to say that next to a straight razor, this gives me one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had. As far as the trimer .... it works beautifully for me, trims my mustache, van dyke beard and sideburns like a charm. You do have to be careful triming BUT .. you have to be careful with scissors and a regular razor too. As far as some others saying the trimer doesn&#x27;t stay up, the trimer pops up out of the back and they are evidently going the wrong direction with it. I&#x27;m a happy Camper.</li>
    <li> This shaver is as good as thy say it is. Use on my face and head daily and there are very few times now that I actually use a razor. It&#x27;s so quiet that I thought ther was something wrong with it the first time I used it. A great buy at a reasonable price!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever purchased. It is almost as close as a safety blade razor, and it is also very quite. The cutting head follows the contour of your face and gives a smooth cut over the entire face.</li>
    <li> I had another norelco razor, but it was getting a bit dull, so i figured i&#x27;d just buy a new razor since the battery life on my other razor was fading.  This one seemed to have good reviews - and it proved to be a good purchase.  I would buy it again.  It shaves closer than my old norelco.  It&#x27;s a pretty simple gadget, but gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Not the best razor I have ever purchased from Norelco. Low speed and hort battery life earn this razor a moderate rating. Spend the money and getting something further up the line.</li>
    <li> Having been a non-electric shaver for years now, I yearned for the simplicity of an electric razor, but worried about the problems I&#x27;d had with previous electric razors: razor burn.  I&#x27;m happy to report that after nearly a month with this razor, I&#x27;ve had not a single instance of that, and had very close shaves as well.  Maybe not as close as a blade, but close enough that I don&#x27;t complain and, more importantly, my wife doesn&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This close shave appears to be due to the flexibility of the head design - all three razors display a great deal of movement, but on top of that, the entire head assembly can pivot to help keep the blades flat against difficult areas like the neck/jawline, which is where I typically suffered the most with previous electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fast and quiet - just a light whirring purr as it gobbles up the stubble, and when you&#x27;re done, just rinse it out under the running sink.  It can&#x27;t get much easier than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have to register a minor complaint, and it is that Norelco saw fit to leave out low-battery warning lights.  This is cheap of them.  At the price they are asking, this razor should include that.  I scrambled to finish my shave the other morning when I realized that the motor was quickly dying - not realizing (having already lost my instruction booklet - PDF versions can be found on the Norelco site) that I can run the razor on the cord for a quick shave.  It also would have been handy to include some kind of stand.  After rinsing out the razor, it simply lays on the counter, dripping all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, however, I&#x27;m very pleased.  I&#x27;m actually prepared to put away my four-bladed razor and shaving gel at this point.</li>
    <li> My husband looked at me funny when I gave him this new norelco because I&#x27;d just given him one last christmas - thought it was wasteful to use it because the other one wasn&#x27;t broken or old yet. I convinced him to charge it up and use it and much to his surprise and mine he thanked me over and over for giving it to him saying it really DOES work 50% better and that it made shaving his neck much easier... thanks for a great product update Norelco !</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older shaver in the same line that I had used for over ten years.  It&#x27;s battery finally wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.  The new one has a nicer shape and is much quieter.  The pivoting head is a minor advantage. I see no need for anything fancier.</li>
    <li> Very light and easy to use. Holds charge very long time. Close, fast shave. Easy to clean under tap. Wish the charger fit in case for travel but not even needed for short trips since it holds charge so long.</li>
    <li> I had been surviving with a Remington foil shaver, and it was poor. If I didn&#x27;t shave with reading glasses on, the shaver would leave hairs, which soon grew into monsters. The trimmer got more work than the foil head. Missing my old Norelco Spectra, I decided to go back to Norelco, and settled on the 8240 for the new head, that has a lot more slots.     It cuts everything in sight, and its so quiet you think its getting ready to die. Plus, its so light, it feels cheap... but it isn&#x27;t. The battery has memory, and is depleted by:  -overcharging, so you shouldn&#x27;t leave it plugged in beyond the charge.  -using the &#x27;corded&#x27; feature too much. Using it plugged in is nice, but don&#x27;t rely on it.   -and not letting the shaver die to the last drop, before recharging.    I don&#x27;t miss the &#x27;low&#x27; indicator of the 8250&#x27;s, which lights when you have about 5 minutes left. If you get stuck, you can always use the cord, or do a &#x27;quick charge&#x27;, which gives you 3 minutes of shaving for 3 minutes of charging. Enough to get you through. In any event, this battery has a long life.     Unit can be rinsed, or the blades can be CAREFULLY taken apart for separate cleaning. They each have their own spot.     Norelco has a good guarantee. Keep the receipt in your shaver&#x27;s travel bag, just in case. But giving it 3 weeks to condition your face is good advice.     Don&#x27;t need higher models with stands/chargers/cleaners. Counter space is at a premium anyway, and this model travels easier. The models with cleaners get real expensive: you have to rinse the thing out every couple of weeks, and buy new cleaner every month at $5 a pop. Its a gimmick, and you don&#x27;t need it.     No negatives to report.      Shave quality is awesome, and I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better. Paid $94 at Wal-Mart, plus tax. Probably cheaper online, but who wants to wait for a good shave?</li>
    <li> Worked OK for a few months then one of the heads broke off.  Kept hitting the button that opens the top when I put it in the drawer dumping shavings all over.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews i chose this razor and am happy with my purchase. The shave was quick and easy. Only issue I have is the sideburns and beard trimmer is kinda flimsy so it doesn&#x27;t shave as well. Would recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The best Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Refined motor and easy cleaning system. Unless you&#x27;ve got a top of a line razor, don&#x27;t bother buying replacement parts. Get this razor and throw the other ones away.</li>
    <li> Quiet, Quick and Close. If you miss the performance of your old Norelco, this is the one for you! Smoothly cuts your beard even if your have a heavy beard. Quiet and powerful. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product.  Priced right.  It is very quiet, you don&#x27;t know you&#x27;re using an electric razor!  Shaves close and does it quickly.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that this shaver gave a bad shave for the 3 years I had it.  It was OK.  But the longevity of the shaver leaves a lot to be desired.  I just took it into a repair facility, since it would no longer hold a charge.  They said:  1.  This shaver has a tiny one cell battery, as opposed to two large cells that some other Norelco&#x27;s have.    2.  The battery is soldered into the circuit board.  Hence, changing the battery means changing the circuit board.  3.  The repair cost exceeds the value of the shaver.  4.  Additionally, they diagnosed that my shaver had a \\&quot;bad segment\\&quot; in the motor.  It wouldn&#x27;t start, even though the button was on, but when the repair facility popped off the heads and just twisted one of the head drive shafts, it started running.  I asked what caused a bad motor segment.  The repair facility said, \\&quot;wear, but a shaver that is only 3 years old should not have this problem.\\&quot;  Looks like Norelco has cheapened their shavers to the point that they don&#x27;t last, and it is not cost effective to repair them.</li>
    <li> This was not a new shaver.  The package was opened, the manual worn, the cleaning brush was missing.  This is not acceptable for a personal hygene product.</li>
    <li> Battery life is excellent.  Shaving daily results in a very pleasant shaving experience.  Shaving every 2 days results in some pulling, but then that is my problem.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers all my life and have used Norelco shavers for over 10 years because I find that they give me a closer, faster, and more comfortable shave. Although my previous one was satisfactory, I decided to try the 8240XL primarily because its info said it could be cleaned under running water which would be quicker than the disassembly and brushing required with my older model.     This series comes in a number of models; the 8240 is the least expensive. There are also an 8250, 8260, and 8270 series. All use the same shaving head, what you get for the extra money is more LEDs to tell you how much charge is left in the battery, and a stand.    I was pleasantly suprised when I saw how much improved this was over the previous models I have used. The biggest improvement is in ths shaving head. Norelco shaving heads flex to the contours of your face or neck; this model has greater range of movement with less pressure required than previous models. The shaving comb incorporates both holes and slots (holes give closer shaves but have trouble catching longer hairs; slots catch and cut the longer hairs) so that it gives a closer, faster shave. It also has a larger chamber for holding the shaved hairs. By moving the some of charging electronics to the plug on the charger cord, they made the shaver smaller and lighter and more comfortable to use.    Cleaning it every day or every few days is much easier. Just push the button to open the head, rinse it with hot water, shake the water out, and set it aside to dry. (In the previous models the head had to be remover from the shaver, disassembled, and brushed out.)    The result of these improvements is that I got a closer, more comfortable shave with less time and effort than I had been getting with my older Norelco.</li>
    <li> Philips Norelco recommends using this razor for 21 straight days before deciding if it&#x27;s right for you.  It only took one shave to realize my Mach 3 days were over.  This \\&quot;made in Holland\\&quot; razor is great. While it does not shave quite as closely as the Mach 3 it shaves closely enough that I feel totally comfortable walking out every  morning in my suit and tie knowing my face looks clean shaven.    My beard is tough, too. On my neck, especially, the whiskers go every which way and are thick.  The Norelco chops them all down with no problem.  On top of that, my skin is sensitive.  I could count on nicking myself about one in ten times I shaved with the Mach 3.  The Norelco does not nick, pinch, burn, or feel uncomfortable in any way. It even handled two days growth without causing any irritation to my skin.    The lightness of the razor is a plus.  Lightness here does not equate with cheapness as the razor seems solid and durable.  It is also very comfortable to hold and emits only a low buzzing sound.  It recharges quickly and, so far, at least, holds its charge well.  Cleaning under the bathroom faucet is quick, easy, and thorough.      After a little over two weeks of using this razor I am very pleased with it.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to rid themselves of old fashioned blades and shaving cream.  The only problem I have with the razor, and it is a slight one, is getting the area just under my nose.  However, that is also a problem area with most old fashioned razors, as well.</li>
    <li> Every upgrade that Norelco makes in its electric shavers is worth the time and money and the Philips Norelco 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System is no exception.  In the past users have gotten better grip, LED lights and a movable shaving head.  With this newest generation shaver we now get a bigger shaving head surface and a head that moves in and around the shavers face.  If you have never used an electric shaver before you will get a wonderful shave from this unit which is easy to use, quick to clean and keeps a long lasting charge.  Norelco has long made the best electric shavers on the market and this tradition continues with this great addition!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> Well I have been using my new Norelco 8240 for about a month now and it is ok.  Previously I used a Norelco Advantage that I had for at least 5 years.  This thing had to be left in the charger each night and I could get one decent shave.  Ya it was time for a new one.  In comparing shaves I find that if I skip a day of shaving the 8240 is pulling out hair.  I by no means have a Grizzly Adams type beard, but my Advantage never gave me problems like this until I skipped a full 3 days.  I think it must be finer shaving surface and the fact that there is a shaving head within another shaving head. Additionally, by noon I have 5PM shadow on my chin.  Never had that problem with the Advantage.  The battery of the 8240 obviously lasts longer and it is very quiet, but I am really not sure this was the best razor available for me.</li>
    <li> i have had several norelco razors and this one hurts to use..  i think the new blade design is what causes the problem.  i still have my old norelco - and it works fine.  sending back to amazon.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite model of Norelco, not just for shaving performace, but because the battery lasts so long you can take it on a trip and not have to recharge it for days.  So he requested a second one as a spare.  Amazon had the best price by far, and there was a free shipping deal to boot.</li>
    <li> First time electric shaver user.I was tired of the manuel shaving,nicks,cuts and if you didnt have time to shave it sucked.So i bought the Philips Norelco speed 8240.I was very hesitant purchasing this product&lt;br /&gt;but i read all the reviews and i got to say i was impressed with my new electric shaver.Shaves well on the neck and cheek bone area.Easy to clean just rinse&lt;br /&gt;under warm water and your good.I have only had it for 2 months.will give a review in about 10 months,but so far so good!!!</li>
    <li> No problems with the purchase.  It arrived fast - ordered Sunday, arrived Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;This razor provides a fast, close, gentle shave.  The batteries last much longer than my last Norelco when new.  Maybe the motors are more efficient.</li>
    <li> It was a gift, but I heard no complaints</li>
    <li> It looks like the batteries don&#x27;t live as long as it is announced in manual ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All other specs looks like OK !!!</li>
    <li> Bought it two years ago and the battery still holds at least 6 weeks of charge and it works great.</li>
    <li> Having been a avid fan and user of a Braun Syncro shaver for countless years, I decided to give this shaver a try.  All in all the quality of the product is quite nice - it is very well built, looks nice, has a solid feel, and appears to be a shaver that is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave itself, I must say that it actually performed much better than I could have ever anticipated.  The 3 heads, with their contour following system and lift and cut technology really are a little powerhouse.  I was able to shave quite the stubble in no time with very little effort, and subsequently with very little irritation.  This was a big plus for me, as I have ultra-sensitive skin that seems to be sensitive to the slightest bit of irritation.  The shave itself lasted for a reasonable amount of time when compared to my normal routine, and I have no complaints there either.  The cleanup is a breeze with a quick rinse under running tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason that I did not rate this as 5 stars is the fact that the shaver itself is a bit awkward to store when you are done with it; it will not stand up on its own, for it&#x27;s not made to.  You must lay it on its side to store or to charge.  I don&#x27;t really like that, as it just looks a bit unkept laying around on the counter.  I would like to see a stand included, or at least a base at the bottom that would allow it to stand on its own when you are done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price, this shaver performed better than expected, and was well worth the money spent for the price paid as it was purchased as a Gold Box Deal of the Day on Amazon!  You really can&#x27;t go wrong on those deals when a great one pops up!</li>
    <li> I want to make three points:&lt;br /&gt;1. Shavers are very individual. What works on one man&#x27;s face may not on another&#x27;s. So quality of shave may not be completely revealed by the reviews (although other quality issues probably can). If you have used Norelco rotary shavers before to your satisfaction, you will probably like the 8200 series, especially if your former Norelco used the same head (here, the HQ9).&lt;br /&gt;2. Almost every shaver I have ever owned seemed better than the previous one, but that is likely a new blades vs. old blades reason.&lt;br /&gt;3. If the overwhelming number of reviews are positive then quite likely the unhappy purchasers got a bad production model. Quality control seems to be a common issue with most products.</li>
    <li> Good product, great service.</li>
    <li> My husband had had the same shaver for many years. We researched the heck and tried to find one he could be happy with for years to come. This one fit the bill. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Works well, holds a long charge and is easy to clean.  It&#x27;s pricey , but worth it for a quick shave.</li>
    <li> after the 3 week trial period I am very satisfied with the performance. close shave and holds the charge well extremely quiet</li>
    <li> Cleaning is easy and this shaver hasn&#x27;t pinched or pulled any hairs on me (yet). It gives a decently close shave and pivots around my face nicely..</li>
    <li> Always used Norelco shavers from 1961. I bought 8240XL shaver last month and this one is giving me quick smooth shave better than all of my old shavers. It is a great shaver.  I recommend everyone to try this shaver.</li>
    <li> It does not have all the bells and whistles but gives a great shave.    Bob</li>
    <li> A former 40+ year blade user I switch to electric seven years ago to eliminate the early morning mess of a wet shave.  The tipping point for me came when electric razors became washable.  For those of us old enough to know, electrics previously required tedious cleaning with a brush and cleaning fluid.  I&#x27;ve sampled both Remington and Norelco. This Norelco is the best quality electric I have owned an opinion shared by many on this page.  In my opinion, the triple head technology is fastly superior to the foil razor in comfort.  In addition, the shave can be as close as a blade which leads me to my tip of the day.  Initially, I prep my face with the Total Shaving Solution brand pre-electric solution. After several minutes of shaving, I stop to wet my face with soap and water before completing the shave.  The Norelco glides effortlessly over the wet face resulting in a real close shave without irritation. Thus far, wet shaving with this electric has not harmed my razor, and I have been using this method for a solid year.  Happy shaving.</li>
    <li> I am 52 years old, and have owned every expensive electric shaver out there in an attempt to get a shave as close as a blade.&lt;br /&gt;All have fallen short, and aggravated me over time because of the poor shave.&lt;br /&gt;My advice, do not waste your money on an expensive Braun, Remington or such.&lt;br /&gt;This Shaver is super quite, lightweight, and most importantly it shaves like a blade!&lt;br /&gt;And, all of this comes at a price substantially lower than my past \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot;shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well.  It provides a very close shave without irritating my skin.  I do wish it was a tad faster.  With a name including \\&quot;SpeedXL\\&quot; I expected it to shave faster than it does.  This shaver omits some of the useless features that are not important.  As a result it is reasonably priced.  You can&#x27;t go wrong since it can be returned it if it does not work well for you.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Lightweight and powerful but quiet. Gives me a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> i bought this shaver a month ago,  it&#x27;s a good razor, but not great. this one is a replacement to an older one that shaved closer.  this has a close shave, but it takes alittle longer.  over all i am happy with it.</li>
    <li> good shaver... quiet....  leaves skin smooth...,holds charge for a long time......... one of many phillips shavers a had over the years!!</li>
    <li> The metal case that pops open for cleaning won&#x27;t stay closed.  It popped up continuously and the blades flew in all directions.</li>
    <li> this razor is lousy. it has low power and the blades do not shave at all. i have had norelco shavers before that worked fine but this one is a real loser. too late to send it back so it is going in the trash. i called the company about this situation and they basically said that sometimes that happens. nice touch on their part.</li>
    <li> For the low price of 40 dollars, this razor is decent for 2-3 years. Not outstanding long term quality but cheap price makes it value.</li>
    <li> The razor is ok , But it is not the one as was described online there are many features as pictured / described that&lt;br /&gt;are not included on this model as advertised . Didn&#x27;t know how to dispute the purchase or return the product..</li>
    <li> It is doing a satisfactory job and I don&#x27;t have any complaints that come to mind. I have not cleaned the heads by rinsing with water because I can&#x27;t set my mind to cleaning that way plus I don&#x27;t want to be washing my beard down the lavatory drain.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable Philips Norelco Speed-XL 8240 gives a fairly close shave. I just wish that the pouch/carrying case that comes with it would also hold the AC cable/cord.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas a few Christmases ago. It&#x27;s lasted a few years with frequent use and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged constantly. I like it because it&#x27;s quiet so it doesn&#x27;t wake me up if he has an early morning. It gives a close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  It performs better than my old Norelco.  Battery life is excellent.  I would recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is actually my first shaving system. The battery lasts a long time. I use it for daily shaving. Shaving is fine but make sure you change the blade after a period of usage.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I hate shaving with my straight razor. I figured that this would make things fast and easier. I was wrong. The first time I used this razor I thought everything was fine, just a little hair pull. Then about 5 min. later my face was bleeding all over in different spots. I was gonna give up on it but the instructions said to try it for a while until your face gets used to the new product. I used this for about 2 weeks and just couldnt handle it anymore. I was very happy to go back to my regular razor. It did shave farily close but guessing by the blood, too close.</li>
    <li> The blades were great and the shave was very smooth.  The battery or the recharger were obviously broken.  After about 4 or 5 uses, the unit would not recharge or work.  I was immediately referred to the manufacturer, not the seller.  I actually feel somewhat cheated over this.</li>
    <li> I bought two shavers for my and my girlfriend&#x27;s father. They shaved very quick and clean. It was a good deal for me not just for $[...] coupons but in China this model is sold beyond 200 bucks.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men&#x27;s Shave Model #8240xl]]  I have had 4 earlier Norelco Shavers.  I like the product. But this is the best, fastest, closest-shaving shaver of the lot.  The Amazon price is the lowest I could fine - saved 25% over department store/drug store price.</li>
    <li> I had used Braun for years. Two diferent ones. Current one was a 5000 series Braun and had to replace the foil head almost once a quarter because it would cut a hole in it!! Very expensive and then add in the cleaning fluid for the cleaning system.    After a lot of research I bought the 8240XL. Although I have only had it for a week, I am impressed. It is very quiet, little hard to get use to, because my other shaver was that quiet, it was dead!!! I like the feel of the handle. I like how it hugs the chine and atoms apple. I shave my head and really like how it hugs my head as well. It appears to be really easy to clean with just running under water. Have been using it for over a week and no indication that I need to charge it.    Only complaint and why I didn&#x27;t give this shaver a full 5 stars is, even with Electric Shave, I feel it could save a little closer, but that is really being picky and as my skin gets use to it more that may improve. But even if it doesn&#x27;t I am still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased as a my first upgrade from the $30 razor level and I am thoroughly disappointed.  The shave is the same quality as a $30 razor.  In addition, every time I shave little bits of hair cover my sink when I am finished.  I have to admit that the Philips Norelco customer service dept. was very generous by sending me another razor after I told them of my troubles.  Unfortunately, the problems persisted with the new razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for christmas.  It arrived very quickly so I was pleased about that.  He has always used an electric shaver but the last one got old and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. When he opened it on christmas morning he said he really didn&#x27;t need one. After using it for the first time he was raving about how quiet it was and how close it shaved. he also likes the convenience of being able to rinse it under the water.  Needless to say he is very happy with his new shaver.</li>
    <li> I have two of these Norelco shavers, but only one came with several LED batter-charge status lights.  I don&#x27;t know why this model does not.  It&#x27;s nice to have a day or two of warning before the battery goes dead on business trips (if you leave the charger at home).</li>
    <li> Although I like the design of this product, I am not satisfied with its performance. It does not shave the neck area properly and almost all the time, I had to pick up my razor back to shave the areas which this product could not clean.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice Razor for the money!  I have had it for a month and have only charged it once.  The blades seem to be sharp and there is not much of a mess to clean up after shaving.  I would buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I like this shaver. It is lightwheight and easy to operate. It gives smooth shave, but I was hoping much closure shave. ventually, according to manufacturer, I would get smoother shave. I hope so.</li>
    <li> Found this shaver to be very good. Quiet, gives a close shave, and holds a charge well. Only complaint is the charge cord is not coiled.</li>
    <li> Owned several Norelco shavers and this one for a couple years now.  Not a bad price and it does shave, but I am moving on.  It just takes too much time to shave with this razor.  Either wake up early or set aside some time in the evening because shaving with this bad boy requires multiple passes and a lot of patience - not good when you are already running late to work or dinner.  It is best to shave before a shower too, in order to let the razor burn cool off!  But, if you are patient, enjoy looking repeatedly at every part of your face in the mirror, and are in no rush to shave this is the shaver for you:  a close shave with minimal burn in just under 20 minutes.  Not me; my patience is up.</li>
    <li> This is an impressive device. Note that I&#x27;ve only ever used blades (Gillette Mach 3, Sensor, etc.), so I was skeptical. When I was a teenager (20+ years ago) I tried using my older brother&#x27;s Norelco on my peachfuzz and was unimpressed. I resolved only to use quality disposable blades and have held to that until now. The Norelco 8240XL has won me over. I can shave in my free moments now, instead of setting aside 3-5 minutes for a good wet shave. It does a great job, shaving even closer than my Mach 3. There can be irritation, but I can keep it in check by applying Aveeno Intense Relief moisturizing cream immediately after shaving. If I don&#x27;t, my whole face will burn and itch like crazy, but with the cream there&#x27;s no problem at all. I expect this need to diminish as my skin acclimates further. Even if it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m fine with using moisturizer (it&#x27;s probably beneficial for my skin health anyway). This is a quality product and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised that I like it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great!  Easy to use, easy to clean and does a great job with my heavy beard.  I highly recommend the razor.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is very fussy about his electronics, so I tend to avoid surprising him with them. I told him that I was going to get him a new electric shaver, and he requested that I get one with more shaving area. Oh gosh, look what I found on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver came in its packaging, as displayed, and was delivered promptly. I subtly replaced my boyfriend&#x27;s old shaver with this one and when he finally saw it and tried it out, he loved it. He loves the increased shaving area (he was twisting his old one around a lot because of the single ring of shaving space) and says that it&#x27;s so much more comfortable and easier to use. It looks really good too, and the little carrying pouch that comes with it is great for travel - something he didn&#x27;t have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good buy :)</li>
    <li> I purchased these many times, use the same one, works great. I love it! Smooth. You don&#x27;t need anything more expensive, this works fine!</li>
    <li> The entire face of all three heads shave, unlike lower-priced models, which only have a ring of shaving surface on each head.  I especially like the 7 LED power indicator lights that let you see when battery charge in dwindling, and there is one indicator light that officially tells you when to re-charge.  Easy to clean after every shave by simply running hot running water through the heads and into the hair chamber (simply air dry by leaving shaving-head compartment open for whatever time it takes for water to evaporate).  Battery charge lasts a long time (they say one hour of in-wall charging time yields 17 days of use before re-charging).</li>
    <li> Phillips Norelco still makes the \\&quot;best\\&quot; electric razors in the world.  I have been using them for almost 50 years and I have never been disappointed with their quality or performance.</li>
    <li> Every time I use it, I hope i can get a close shave before the charge runs out.  For a $100 shaver it stinks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for close to 40 years and this is the best one I&#x27;ve had. It shaves closely. It&#x27;s quiet. And it&#x27;s fast. At 7:00 AM that and coffee are all I want.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the razor, gives him a close smooth shave, much better than his old razor.  He doesn&#x27;t like that it does not have a charging cradle for the razor to sit in - it comes with a charging cord you plug into the bottom of the razor to charge.  But it holds the charge well, and you don&#x27;t have to charge it but once a week.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco razors since the 60&#x27;s so I have some experience with them.  Every 5+ years a newer model is purchased.  This new fast shave razor takes about three times longer to shave than my last model 6886XL.  Have to keep going over areas on my neck and face multiple times.  It has no gage for the charge left so it will just stop without warning.  Hope your not rushing to work...  It feels and sounds lightweight and cheap.  Cheap... Expect it to stop working right after the warantee expires.  If this is the way Norelco is going it will be my last shaver from Norelco.</li>
    <li> As stated in a previous review...there is no low battery warning - it just turns off.  The shaver&#x27;s pivoting heads chassis pinches and pulls on side-burn hairs.  Otherwise, it does a pretty good job and it runs quietly.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used and I have been using electric shavers for 50 years.  The key is in the shaver head.  The cheaper models have a single circle of cutters.  This shaver has three rows of cutters and that makes a world of difference in getting a quick and effective shave.  The shaver is very quiet and the charge is sufficient for three weeks.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Before buying this Norelco 8240XL shaver, I bought the Panasonic ARC IV shaver.  The Panasonic shaver was so loud that I was afraid to use it.  I thought it might damage my hearing since it would be right next to my ear.  Without even using it, I packed it up and returned it to Amazon.  I then bought the Norelco 8240XL and it is 75% quieter than the Panasonic.  The Norelco gives a close (not super close) shave and it is QUIET.  I am happy with the Norelco.</li>
    <li> This razor is exactly what I expected.  It does a good job every single day, and the shave seems to last better than other electrics I have used.  It certainly holds a charge much longer than others and takes about 20 seconds to clean.</li>
    <li> First some background. I&#x27;m a long time electric user. I&#x27;ve never had a fancy electric razor. I used an inexpensive corded Remington for years before I got tired of the cord and switched to a basic cordless Norelco (model 5601X to be exact). My Norelco has worked just fine for many years. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades on my 5601X before, and now, I realized it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close and decided that rather than replace the blades, maybe it was time to check out one of the many newer Norelcos that have come on the market since I bought mine.    I chose the SpeedXL. The concept of the triple heads with multiple size screen slots sounded like it might offer an even better shave than my trusty 5601X. Well, after a month of using my SpeedXL, I have discovered, that for me, it shaved no better than my 5601X with *old blades*. In fact, I decided to go ahead and replace the blades on my 5601X, and well, I hate to say it, but for my face my old 5601X with the new blades actually does a better job. I even went so far as to shave half of my face with one and the other half with the other on two different occasions, then asked my wife which side felt smoother (without telling her of my test). One time, she couldn&#x27;t tell the difference (that was before I replaced the blades on the 5601X). The other time, she picked the side I shaved with my old Norelco.    So what&#x27;s the moral, and what should you do? Well if like me, you had an old Norelco that uses the HQ 5 blades, you might want to consider just getting new blades rather that purchasing the SpeedXL. However, if you don&#x27;t already have an HQ 5 based razor, or yours is dead (aka battery no longer charges) then this is a fine, albeit not fantastic, electric razor. That said, I&#x27;d be tempted to buy a less expensive Norelco that uses the HQ 5 blades, or consider a completely different model.    Of course, all this ignores some of the extra features of the SpeedXL that may benefit you. For instance, the triple blades/screen design might work better on your stubble. Or maybe the ease of cleaning the SpeedXL appeals to you. If you value some of those other features, then this may very well be a 4-star razor for you.    That&#x27;s my story, hope it helps.</li>
    <li> This razor is wonderful!  I bought it to replace an older model and I am not disappointed.  My older razor&#x27;s battery life was a week.  This one is two weeks.  This razor shaves the neck without creating irritation - the first razor I&#x27;ve had that didn&#x27;t.  Overall I am very impressed and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just replaced an older Norelco shaver with this model and am truly impressed by how much better the shave is: it&#x27;s the most blade-like shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric. I also find the shave more comfortable and less irritating, both when used for daily shaving and when mowing through a few days growth. Previously, I have used shavers with the HQ6 and HQ8 heads, and the HQ9 heads used in the 8240XL are substantially different and, at least for me, better; they are definitely worth trying if you have only used shavers with the older heads.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I dropped his old one a few months ago, and while it still works as good as it always has, the pop-up clipper was damaged.  I decided to buy this particular model based on previous customer reviews.  It received higher stars than some of the higher-priced fancier models, and my husband has always preferred the Norelco brand.  He says it&#x27;s the most reliable brand he&#x27;s used.  While I can&#x27;t comment on the product itself, I&#x27;m sure it will be just as dependable and easy to use and clean as his old one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m busy and shave only when meetings necessitate it.  The Norelco 8240XL completely meets my needs.  It gives a close shave, cuts efficiently, is quiet and compact.  Cleaning it is a slight concern.  Since I haven&#x27;t yet convinced myself it&#x27;s OK to use the water option for cleaning, I clean the shaver by gently tapping it and then use a brush.  When I tap it as I&#x27;m cleaning it, I do worry that the razor head, with the cutters, moves a bit too much and I wonder if I&#x27;m damaging the hinge.  So consequently, I just tap it very lightly and use the brush more as I clean it.  I&#x27;ll try the water cleaning option shortly.  I found that the trimmer works well for my purposes - to trim hair starting to grow over my ears.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the Norelco 8240XL.</li>
    <li> I have had two.    One purchased in 1999 and it has worked great for  10 years with no battery changes.   did replace cutters.  hope this  model is half a good.   the shave seems to be much closer and more  comfortable.  have a tough beard.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m 18, so I&#x27;ve only used 4 brands and my disclaimer: I don&#x27;t have a really, really thick beard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying out the Phillips Norelco, I was using the [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] and before that, a cheap Norelco that my dad picked up at Wal-Mart; before that, God only knows what piece of junk my dad gave me to use.  The Wal-Mart Norelco was bad enough, but the Braun was awful.  I cut myself constantly; forget about getting a smooth shave on the neck and any area that required any special contouring was just off limits.  I had so many ingrown hairs on my neck, it looked like a bad case of acne and it hurt to even try to shave, no matter how many different things I tried to put on my face to fix it.  The razor clogged constantly, despite their claim that it washed clean and it never held any reasonable charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got this Norelco.  Wow, it was like night and day.  The very first shave, straight out of the box, I had no cuts, my neck was cleanly shaved for the first time since I&#x27;d been growing a beard.  I had no problem in more of my usual hard to shave areas, like around my nose or under my jaw and it was so quiet.  I never even had realized my other razor was so loud.  I was used to grinding my old razor over my face for more than five minutes, but this took care of four days worth of growth in just a few.  It&#x27;s continued to do the job over and over and cleaning it up is no problem either; I&#x27;m a fan now and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had even more words to say how much I like this razor.  My face, for once, wasn&#x27;t covered with red spots, it didn&#x27;t hurt and there weren&#x27;t places where the razor just wouldn&#x27;t cut the hairs.  It may not have all the bells and whistles the more expensive models have, but for this price, this is a really great razor.</li>
    <li> This is the third Norelco shaver that I have owned. They have each been better than the last. Close shave with very little effort. No skin irritation. Quiet</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for a good many years.   This model is providing the closest most comfortible shave yet.  It is very quiet and is very easy to clean under hot running water.   My only gripe is the charger is built into the power cord and takes up more room than the older models.  The carry bag is too small for the power cord.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about two weeks now, and so far, it&#x27;s pretty good. On my face, it cuts smoothly, missing virtually no hairs; a great shave.    However, on my neck, where my hair grows horizontally, it misses about 10-15 hairs consistently. No matter how many times I go over the spots (which are in the hollow of my neck and where the jaw meets the neck) or how many different ways I try to move the shaver, they never get cut. It&#x27;s unfortunate, because this gives your shave a very unprofessional look, and in my line of business, that&#x27;s a no-no. So, I have to run over those spots with a traditional razer.    I&#x27;m not saying that this is a direct result of poor razer design, after all, my skin may still be getting used to the shaver, but it remains an inconvenience.</li>
    <li> Used it very lightly for the past two years, maybe once or twice a week. Held a charge for a long time and was a great quality razor, very close to a real shave for the time I was able to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to write the review after it died but it just seemed with such occasional use that it would last forever. It was never dropped or abused but simply just ceased to work at all. Deserved a 5 star rating until it just dropped dead.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY 4TH NORELCO AND BY FAR THE BEST.  ALWAYS LIKED THE NORELCO SHAVERS BUT THIS ONE CUTS SHORT OR LONG WHISKERS, EVEN ON MY NECK CLEANLY.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  ONLY NEGATIVE WOULD BE THE CHARGING CORD, I LIKED THE OLD COILED ONES BETTER.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric razor that I bought and have heard great things about Philips Norelco razors, so I went ahead and bought this one.  The razor does a great job, but my only negative is that in a can take a while t shave even with a short beard.  However, no nicks or cuts is always a positive.</li>
    <li> This razor was purchased to replace a 9 year old norelco that was used primarily for days I just wanted to be presentable.  I always used a blade for social and week-end events.  I have found this new razor superior to the old in so many ways.  It shaves close enough for any occasion, is super quiet and holds a charge to shave my light beard for 2 weeks. Superior to my son&#x27;s Braun in every way.  I love the water clean up big time, but be sure to use hot water!!</li>
    <li> Good product, but not as good as the really old all metal ones</li>
    <li> has a few more holes for hair to go in during shaving, that doesn&#x27;t really increase the shaving speed that much. it does work quite well.  I had a norelco that I just loved (lost it in a fire), and wanted to go back to another (I had one right after the fire and was very disappointed in it). this one works better than the more expensive brand I was talking in to buying prior to it, and loads better than the cheaper electric ones I bought before (trying to save money, ended up costing me more).  while much better it still doesn&#x27;t do the job well. Found myself reaching for a blade to finish the job after using this.</li>
    <li> Got this for a gift for my husband to use while traveling. He uses a razor at home--too much to pack and take along cans of shave cream. He doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave, but it&#x27;s quick and easy and easy to pack up in its pouch. He said he&#x27;d never use an electric shaver, but has changed his mind for travel.</li>
    <li> Great product! arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> Best shaver you can get but not worth the crazy price of $175.00 wait till price is around $90.00. Second best shaver At830 or 4100 series philips nerelco also great body and head shavers as well</li>
    <li> I believe the product was faulty. Better quality control may help spot items like this. Razor was fully charged but stopped while I was shaving.</li>
    <li> I find that the shaver&#x27;s head speed seems slow compared to my other older Norelco. It loses head speed after only two days of shaving (approx 1 minute, 30 second shaving per day).  As it slows, I begin getting whisker pulling. Maybe both issues are associated with a bad battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may attempt to install new batteries though I suspect will involve soldering. A pity.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Norelco I&#x27;ve bought. Shaves close for me. Charge holds up good.  Overall it&#x27;s a good razor.</li>
    <li> It caused irritation in my skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelco electric shavers for decades.  The one I just bought from Amazon.com meets these high standards - excellent!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby and he loved it. After using my pink Remington for two months I was starting to really dislike it. One day while shaving with mine, I thought I should try his. Holy cow! This thing is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t scratch while I use it, like the Remington. It also gives a much closer shave. It does seem slow, but I don&#x27;t mind that at all. Women&#x27;s shavers are not as sharp as men&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m wondering why they don&#x27;t give more color options of the men&#x27;s shavers and just put \\&quot;for her\\&quot; on the box. There&#x27;s a money maker right there.</li>
    <li> Manufacturer claims 17 shaves before recharging.  I never got more than 5 shaves. Besides, this particular razor is &#x27;dull&#x27;, and hardly cuts.  Have to go over face several times and still need a shave when I think I&#x27;m finished.  Previous models were much better.  This is the second of the 8240 series purchased. Thought this one might be better but it&#x27;s not. My next shaver is not going to be a Philips-Norelco.  Too bad. In closing: There was a $5.00 rebate offer. The rules were \\&quot;only\\&quot; stated on the inside of the package and indicated that Post Office Boxes were excluded as addresses. I live in a town of about 2000 inhabitants where there is no USPS delivery to residents as well as to business establishments. That in itself is a real &#x27;Sham&#x27;. Don&#x27;t buy these products or you may also be sorry. Finally, this product cost more than indicated when I got to the close-out on the Internet. Good bye Philips-Norelco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after reading many reviews.  I previousely owned a Norelco that lasted 5 years.  This shaver does everything it says in the manufactures   notes.  I would purchase this product again and reconmend it.  Also Amazon was spot on with delivery and also free Have to love Free</li>
    <li> Purchased mine in 2009 and it has been used at least 5 times a week, every week for the passed 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves pretty well, as long as your face is accustomed to electrics. I use a shaving lotion, like the ones from Nivea or Neutrogena, to get a closer shave. Theyre thinner than the usual shaving creams you would use with a razor, so they dont clog up your shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make it a point to always buy shavers with a pop up trimmer. Very handy for keeping sideburns in place. This one works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find I always have trouble getting the stubble on the base of my neck and chin, so I keep a cheapy disposable for quick clean ups. Aside from that, it does the bulk of the shaving quite nicely and quickly. Thats why I couldnt give it a full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This is money very well spend!  My first one is still working after 2 or more years, just the blades do not cut as well - they cannot cut well two or more days old beard.  If you do not shave under running water or under water, then you could save tons of money buying this shaver.  Its head is found only in the top Philips/Norelco new models starting at $199.  The new thing on these models that they are pushing is the &amp;#34;shower&amp;#34; shaving.  With the 8240 you could still wash the shaver under the tab (I do it with hot water) and then you don&#x27;t need to brush it clean as often.&lt;br /&gt;The full model name is 8240XL – 8240 is not a “scaled down” model, I think people simply do not write the XL on the back, so you will be getting the same deal.&lt;br /&gt;I very highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He was disappointed in it but will use it since it can&#x27;t be sent back.  He wanted one that he could emerse head in water.</li>
    <li> one stop working a week after i had it.i push the start button and nothing happen.have no return address/?yhank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 3 years now, and can say that it is a good electric shaver for the price. I do not have much experience with different electric shavers (I&#x27;ve used them off and on over the years), so this review is simply my thoughts about this shaver. I have no idea how it compares to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good build quality.&lt;br /&gt;- Good close shave (good enough anyway).&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used cordless or with the cord (if the battery is dead).&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Battery has held up very well over the last 3 years (I only charge it after it&#x27;s completely dead).&lt;br /&gt;- Blades have lasted me quite a while (I&#x27;m still using the original but it&#x27;s overdue for a replacement).&lt;br /&gt;- Replacement blades are reasonably priced and easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The large rotary head can be uncomfortable in tight spots (my big nose gets in the way), and can be difficult to navigate around a goatee, sideburns etc...&lt;br /&gt;- Does not do a very good job with longer hairs. (best results if you shave daily)&lt;br /&gt;- I have a hard time with my neck area, which equates to more passes and more irritation. (I have sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;- Does not have a stand, so after it&#x27;s daily cleaning it lays at the edge of the sink to dry or lays on the counter top to charge and just creates more clutter.&lt;br /&gt;- No wet shave option.&lt;br /&gt;- Is not loaded with a bunch of fancy features like the newer high end models, but it&#x27;s reflected in the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Despite my general satisfaction with this shaver, I have decided it&#x27;s time to upgrade. I ordered a new blade for this one and will keep it as a spare and/or go back to it if I don&#x27;t like my new one; but I have found myself wanting a little more. I will try a foil shaver (the Braun 790), as I believe it may be less irritating to my sensitive skin and the smaller head will be more comfortable in tight areas. I am also drawn towards the cleaning/charging base.</li>
    <li> GOOD BUYS FOR THE MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;WILL CONTINUE DOING MY SHOPPING AT AMAZON.COM.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDING TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS IF THEY ARE SEARCHING FOR GIFTS.</li>
    <li> This product lasted 6 years and I&#x27;m not sure if that is good or bad.  It did a good job but ended up not a complete shave on one charge.</li>
    <li> My old razor was just giving out and I needed a new one. The old and the new are the same make and model. I see no need to change as this model works great for me.</li>
    <li> Much improved with a closer and more comfortable shave. Tends not to miss difficult areas. It is also a lot quieter. I only wish that I had gotten the next model with the battery indicator. This just stops when the battery is low without any warning.</li>
    <li> little disappointed, seemingly no advances in shaving performance over my 5 year old corded model.  Battery life is excellent, unit is very light.</li>
    <li> my third razor by phillips norelco.  This one shaves great and quickly as the others have.  The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t have a battery indicator to warn of low battery so I have had a dead battery on the way to work a few times.  Battery does last around 2 weeks with 10 mins of use everyday.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shaver. Great value for money. I definitely recommend it.     I chose it for 2 main reasons:  1. It is a Philips - I have an old Philips, now 15 years old that is still working. Great longevity.  2. It can be used while plugged in - VERY important as when the battery dies in a couple of years you can still plug the shaver in to use it for many years afterwards. NOTE: Many of the more expensive models DO NOT offer this very large advantage.   &gt;&gt;&gt;Consider that if you have a cordless-only shaver, that has a bulky charging station, and you want to travel, then you have to take that stupid charging station with you. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the fancy pretty charging station gimmick.    Pros: Excellent shave that is much improved over the old model I have. Very close to a razor-type shave. Can be used corded OR cordless. Easy to wash with hot water from the tap. Simple to use. Quiet.  Cons: The only bad thing is that the pop-out trimmer is fairly rubbish. You can cut sideburns, but it is not good enough or sharp enough to carefully cut the edges and ends of sideburns very neatly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this upgraded Norelco shaver in July, 2010 for a closer shave than I had been getting from lower priced Norelco shavers; but this one is less than a year old and does not cut as close as my old one that I had to get out of the closet to start using again.  Why don&#x27;t these blades stay sharp longer.[[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> ITS MY FTH ONE AND YES OF COURSE ITS THE BEST EVEN THOUGH I PAID MORE FOR SOME OTHERS.  KEN B</li>
    <li> Although the razor was just like the old one I had, arrived promptly and works well, I had to use the power cord from my old razor as the one that came with the new razor did not work.  Lucky thing that I had kept the old power cord!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not as good as my safety razor.  Maybe it&#x27;s a matter of getting use to it.  I will stick to my safety razor for the   time being.</li>
    <li> I need an electrical razor which can be used daily and on the go. At the same price range, I chose this over 1150 as I don&#x27;t feel any electrical razor can really replace the manual ones. Therefore \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; is the key word I am looking for. Actually this one shaves very well. It charges very fast, and does not need a bulky stand which I hate very much, and it is not trivial in bathroom as too many charge stations are already there. Very happy with my choice.  Update: I agree with Jamie701 that the charger is bulky; should be just a cable. So I want to reduce my stars to 4 and half.</li>
    <li> The Norelco shaver 8240 is an excellent shaver and priced just right.  It shaves close without any skin irration, quiet and holds it charge quite well.  The only two things Noreclo could improve on is the soft traveling case does not provide space to store the battery charger which must be carried separately and no shaver stand is provided for home use.</li>
    <li> I had not used this type of razor for a while and I forgot how limited the power is. It took a long time to get a complete shave. It is worth investing in a higher end shaver (like a Braun) if you want a good shave, or switch back to the hand-held with a good lotion (like King of Shaves).</li>
    <li> Provides a nice shave (so says my husband), but the easy open top (for cleaning)is a little too-easy-open, and it can dump the shavings everywhere.  You have to put it away carefully to avoid this.</li>
    <li> Background- This is my 3rd electric in 4 years. My first was a Remington rotary R-650. That was my first try at the world of electric shavers and I was very pleased with it. I had to replace it because the battery would no longer hold a charge. But I did note that the shave I was getting was not as close as a regular straight razor would do. Of course it is obvious as to why - the bade on an electric is never actually against your face so the result cannot be the same. In trying to get a bit closer to the shave from a straight razor I tried a highly rated micro screen razor. That shave was better but at a cost. Since the foil screen is thinner than the heads on a rotary, the shave is necessarily closer. But I found there was a cost to that closeness and that was far more irritation. Indeed in the area of the upper lip I was left with redness which lasted for hours. And if the razor accidentally touched my nose, I actually wound up with an abrasion. So I continued with my older rotary  which does do a better job than the micro screen on certain contours of the face) and only used the micro screen when a wanted a particularly close shave. But I needed to replace my rotary so after reading a bunch of reviews I choose this one.  Other Reviews - first let me weigh into some of the negative reviews. I get about a month of shaves on a charge and I shave with a relatively heavy beard once a day. I have never suffered from this razor pulling hair nor do I  have the sense that the motor is slow. It seems to run fine. But I never used it to shave anything more than a 2 day growth which only happened once. Perhaps if I waited longer to shave it might pull but it doesn&#x27;t on a daily shave regimen. Also, the release mechanism DOES NOT OPEN PREMATURELY! If your razor does it is either broken or you have a very weird way of shaving. Also, I have never had the heads   fall out when cleaning it. You really have to affirmatively, and with some effort, move the holding mechanism to remove the heads. Also, those complaining about having to go over your face several times, may not be used to the world of electric shaving. I have found the need to do that with all the razors I have. I even did that a bit with a straight razor.   As to features - The only real negative, and it is not really a problem, is the lack of a low charge warning. But if you shave at home it really serves no purpose since you can always plug in and shave that one time with the cord. And if you shave in the car, well that is probably worse than texting - since you need 2 hands to use the razor correctly, Yes there is no shaving stand but my wife doesn&#x27;t really like my razor decorating the vanity, also,  it would take up more room when I travel. I see no need for it. Finally, all my razors are cleanable under water.  I would never buy one which isn&#x27;t. Although I would not fully immerse the razor in water, it is very washable and the design actually let&#x27;s the water drip out the bottom. Also don&#x27;t waste your money on cleaning solutions. I wash mine daily and once or twice a month I open and clean the heads and the individual blades (btw, make sure you replace to blades in the head they came from) anything more is unnecessary.  The Shave- when I first started using this razor I was very disappointed. It did not seem to measure up to even  my old single   blade Remington. but they say give it time and I did and I find the 2 razors generally equivalent.  But I would give the slight edge to the Norelco. The shave improved markedly when I use a pre shave lotion  such as Williams Lectric shave and indeed, over time, I feel with the pre shave lotion,  the result is better than my older razor  of course, my older razor also has older blades). Without it the shave was disappointing. Note, I feel I have a relatively heavy beard and I require a shave every day. This razor has 3 tracks of blades and I felt just that alone should have yielded a better shave. But the inner most  blade track hasvery tiny holes that a hair has to get through to impact the cutting blade. I don&#x27;t see how that happens effectively, but I guess the designers have tested this and someone must think it works. The middle track has some of the same small holes and I have the same concern re that. Maybe those holes are designedf for shorter hairs and it is likely the reason I find I have to go over my face even more times  than with my single blade Remington -which had longer and wider slots to permit hairs to enter. Not sure which design is more effective.  My Rating - I gave it a 3 star rating for several reasons. First it does not measure up to a straight razor. So comparing the 2 finds the electric coming up short. Also, since I never tried the highly rated Braun or the top of the line Norelcos, which have different technology in the shaving heads, I felt it unfair to rate this on any higher.</li>
    <li> I really wish I had not purchased a rotary shaver and had gone for the straight line cut instead. Do I get a \\&quot;do-over?\\&quot;  Bob</li>
    <li> I have only used Norelco razors since I started shaving over 30 years ago.  I really want to give this razor 5 stars but can&#x27;t.  It does give you a good, close shave, if you have the time to do it. It gives a close, quality shave but the speed (RPM) of the shaver is so much slower than my old Norelco that you have to go over the area multiple times.  The shave heads are very smooth and much better that my old razor.  This razor is still better than a high-end Braun razor that my son bought at the same time I got this razor.  I tried my son&#x27;s Braun razor and it gave me the most horrible shave that I have ever had with an electric razor.  It missed some many whiskers that I had to get the Norelco back out to finish the shave.  Pro:  Good, quality razor; excellent shave heads (smooth, not irritaing versus my old Norelco), close shave, long battery life  Con:  The speed of this shaver is much slower than  my previous one.  Takes more time to shave as you have to go over the same area several times.  If this razor had a different motor (higher RPM), I feel that it would be the best razor that I have ever had.</li>
    <li> This is my third Norelco Electric Razor that I have purchased. This particular razor was purchased to replace an Norelco 8150 that I purchased 5 years ago. It dropped and the switch became intermittent. So far the 8240 meets my expectations and it did not require me to break the bank. It has all the features you would like, the lift and cut technology, floating cutters, and contour following head. The three cutting heads, with the three speed Xl system allows you to shave faster without having to make sure the cutting area is aligned with the wiskers. I would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a Norleco Razor. Just an FYI... I still have the original Razor that I purchase 14 years ago. It also works good, just needs a need internal battery. Norleco makes a reliable product.[[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men&#x27;s Shave Model #8240xl]]</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor with free blades for a very good price.  So good in fact that I bought two.  Immediately disappointed with the performance.  Given the geometry of the heads they must flex to make full contact.  Problem is the amount of pressure it takes to make them flex. Only way I can get this razor to perform is using one head and move it in tiny circular motions.  I preferred the one head method to smashing it into and dragging it around face ,which besides being very uncomfortable is also not very effective.  Anyways after 12 minutes of abuse I achieved an adequate shave and red irritated face that still stings as I type.    Norelco suggests using the razor for 3 weeks before evaluating.  I assume this gives your skin adequate time to toughen like leather.  If you hate someone buy them this shaver.    I will update this review in 3 weeks..............</li>
    <li> The product has worked great so far without any problems! Would definitely recommend this to anyone that needs to upgrade to a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. My father in law recommended it after getting one for Christmas and I was hesitant because I was looking to replace a Norelco that was twice the price. I shopped around and looked at reviews and thought i&#x27;d give it a try. Good choice. It shaves close to the skin, is easy to use, fits well in my hand, and covers the contours of my face.  My facial hair isn&#x27;t super thick, but on my neck it grows in a weird circular pattern that makes it hard for electric shavers to catch all the hairs. This shaver does a great job in that area. My father-in-law&#x27;s beard is very thick and he says it works great for him as well. Give it a try!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Work well, but there is no indicator to indicate the level of charge.</li>
    <li> I have use Norelco for 20 years.  Always a great product.  Battery lasts over a week.  Very reliable and rugged.</li>
    <li> My complaint is I have to run this shaver over my face 6 to 8 times before I can&#x27;t feel the stubble any more. I have used Norelco shavers for years and they were suitable, but not this model. I think it is the heads/Blades system on this model that is \\&quot; really sorry\\&quot;. I even bought a new set of heads for it, no change! I am looking for something else now. I will try and find the old style heads on a new shaver. As far as the battery,trimmer and everything else, No problem, IT Just Won&#x27;t cut my beard like the old one I had. I wish I could find the old type of heads to fit it but it doesn&#x27;t list any anywhere that I could find it. Norelco has a take back 30 day guarantee but I waited too long to use it.</li>
    <li> My existing Norelco shaver is about 8 years old and still works great. However, it needed new blades and rather than replacing them I decided it was time for a new one. I have been very impressed with this razor so far. It cuts much closer than the older one and is super easy to clean. If it holds up over the long term, I will be more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> i am having trouble with the left side of my face shaving with this razor, the right side of my face is great but the left side i have trouble getting the stubble in the shaving heads and end up pressing too hard and getting a little irritation. i tried using lectra shave but it has way too much alcohol in it and drys my skin. overall i like the electric shaver just wish that the left side of my face would turn out as good as the right side.i had to stop using razors as i was getting bad razor burn, not so much with this razor, its worth a try, maybe if you have a tough beard you should move up and spend more money on a razor , the higher end ones got great reviews too.hope this helped.</li>
    <li> I like my Norelco electric razor very much. It is easy to clean under running hot water and although the charge lasts only about one week, it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> This is a very good cordless shaver for the money. It was still going strong four weeks after I bought it on the initial charge. The ONLY reason I cannot give this five stars is because there is no &#x27;low battery&#x27; light. I cannot imagine it would cost very much at all to include a low voltage warning. That is a big let down to an otherwise excellent razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and is quite satisfied with it.  Its so easy as each weekhe rinses the blades under hot water to clean.  He always had a Norelco so we knew of their performance and they have even improved on that too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m unfamiliar with electric shavers in general: this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever used, so I wasn&#x27;t totally sure what to expect. First off, the operation and maintenance of this device was quiet simple and self-explanatory. After an initial 12-hour charging time, it was up and running for a 2-weeks+ charge. Cleaning the blades is also easy -- a latch beneath the head pops it open and the stubble falls right out; a light rinse and the unit is clean and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first few shaves, I experienced some tugging and irritation, but I think this may be because I have a fairly thick beard, and thick, strong hair and stubble.  But when I followed the instructions and pulled my skin taut, I found it easier to press the head against my skin, and to get a closer shave. I experimented with different contours and motions, and started to figure out the best way to shave with or against the grain of my face. The shave wasn&#x27;t as close or as thorough as a regular safety razor, but it was good.  Although I think I prefer blade I could easily see this as a backup -- while traveling or at the office on days when you&#x27;re running too late to shave at home.  Glad I checked it out!</li>
    <li> Using this electric shaver has been a pleasure. It quickly and easily adapts to your face, the heads seeming to instantly respond to the contours, crevices and hills that make shaving such an adventure. The shaver holds its charge for several weeks once it is properly charged. I find it necessary to recharge every 14-18 days, on average. It seems to remember the shape of your face, as shaving becomes easier over time. There were very few incidents of the shaving heads grabbing skin once I&#x27;d gotten used to applying the proper pressure. The shave is close and smooth and quite fast. I am completely satisfied with the Philips Norelco shaving system, making my return to using a regular blade extremely unlikely.</li>
    <li> So, yeah I&#x27;m not a guy so I didn&#x27;t actually use this product. But my husband sure did. So I will tell you a little about him.    He likes elec shavers, but his skin is so sensitive to them. He used to have to go 3-4 days without shaving because of the pain. When he finished shaving, he always looked as if someone had hit him, or burned him with something. The entire area was red. Also when I touched his face it was always prickly.     He had tried numerous shavers. At least a new one every few months. It got expensive. So we tried this one. I have to say it is the best thing out there right now. He was able to use it and it didn;t leave his face red. When touched, his face is baby smooth. Definate plus!    He is now able to shave every day and not have to worry about the redness and tenderness. This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have been trying out new razors, getting a charge out of all the different designs that have been coming out, and have gotten a lot of experience along the way. Amongst the types I have tried are : The tri-heads with and without foaming action, the newer heads that set like they are on a platform, and a few different types of clippers. Out of all the razors I have tried I like this one the best, and the reason for that is because I (1) like the mixture of old and new, (2) like the length of the long-hair trimmer, and (3) like the way the extra pivot works on this razor. It feels like an old friend, but with a better smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not really any downsides on the razor that are glaring to me, so I&#x27;ll list the positives I have noticed. First, there is a new pivot that allows the head to move forward and backward and does not make the head stationary. That means that more ground is covered and a better shave is given. A second thing I like is that the length of the long-hair trimmer has not changed. On many of the newer models, the trimmer has been shortened. This leads to a trimmer that is harder to see, one that doesn&#x27;t do as much work, and one that can break easier. So, the staying with the same build is a good thing. Next, the charge the item carries is long-lasting, making it a great tool to travel with. I have a problem with forgetting my cord, I already did that once with this model, and it did not matter. I was away for a week and still I got a good shave. And, lastly, it is does not throw too much glam t you and try to make something shiny to hide flaws in the design. As I said before, it is an old design but with some newer additions to make shaving better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good shave and need something new, you should try out this razor. It has been tough, has been reliable, and has been the one razor I have liked after the newness has worn away. That says a lot about something: when the newness of something becomes day-to-day, what is it, really? For this product I would have to say \\&quot;a little over five stars in my book.\\&quot;this product I would have to say \\&quot;a little over five stars in my book.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The razor is compact, quiet during operation as compared to other razors used and quite durable.  I dropped it removing the charger (fell about 4 ft) and nothing broke or came loose and it&#x27;s still working fine.  It charges in less than 2 hours and has a compact carry case if you need to travel.&lt;br /&gt;The razor provides a close, clean shave.  After using a couple of weeks a slight rash appeared but easily cleared up and there have been no further problems so I don&#x27;t think it was the razor that caused the problem.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great razor.</li>
    <li> I tried the super fancy Phillips Norelco arcitec model and was very disappointed. It looked cool but just didn&#x27;t work well and wasn&#x27;t comfortable. This one works great! Wish they could combine space age looks with functionality.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a razor that will give me a good shave around my neck area for a long time. I found this razor online, and after looking at the reviews decided to buy it. When I used it the first time, I was shocked at how quiet it was compared to my old Braun razor. Thanks to the maneuverable blades, I was able to get the best shave I have ever gotten on my neck!</li>
    <li> I have used a norelco shaver for years.  Usually I buy close too the cheapest one they make but this time I up-graded to a much fancier shaver.  It was well worth the extra cost as it gives me the best close shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I recommend the Philips Norelco 8240XP to anyone looking for a really well made product that does the job it was designed for almost perfectly.</li>
    <li> After I have I have to go back and use my $ 29 Norelco to remoive the stubble.  Overpriced JUNK would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace by Braun 7500 razor that I had been using for 5 or 6 years.  After looking and all the reviews and shopping around, I decided to try a rotary razor as these were supposed to get the longer hairs and coarse hairs better than the foil types.    Buying this razor was a great purchase.  It is so much quieter than my old razor.  It took a while to get used to the quiet but I no longer wake my wife by shaving. After about a week by skin became used to the new style of shaver.  I&#x27;ve cut my shaving time down by half with the Norelco!  With the Braun I had to go over areas multiple times to get all the difficult hairs.  The Norelco seems to get everything on the first pass or too, even the coarse or longer hairs.  Even when I don&#x27;t shave for two or three days, it still cut close and quick.    I also like rinsing the shaver under the faucet instead of the cleaning station the braun had.  I no longer spend $10 every two months buying the cleaning solution and my wife appreciates not having the \\&quot;spaceship\\&quot; taking up room on the counter.    If you are looking for a good electric razor this is one to buy.  Good price, good performance, quiet operations, and easy cleanup.</li>
    <li> Norelco was once a fine company that made the best shavers. Something must have happened. Did they sell the company to someone else? This shaver is perhaps the worst I&#x27;ve ever used. One Star is charitable.</li>
    <li> My husband has tried several electric razors through the years but was very unhappy.  This is the best!  He won&#x27;t use it daily as he uses a regular razor, but this is perfect for his purpose.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver for the price. I bought this one which replaced an identical Norelco 8240 that I bought several years ago and literally wore it out. I have a fairly heavy daily \\&quot;beard\\&quot; to dispose of, and this unit performed great.</li>
    <li> Love this razor!  I had a Remington &amp; it never shaved close enough. Remington wasn&#x27;t sharp so it left like a rug burn.  Not the case with this Norelco.  It shaves very close, fast and keeps a good long charge!</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver, subsequent to being put on a blood thinner, was a Philips Norelco.  I have had two replacement shavers since that time and have always used the Norelco. This one gives a nice close shave and was a gerat price!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the shave it gives.&lt;br /&gt;Have always used this product and it has yet to fail me. Will  stay with it.</li>
    <li> This razor not only delivers a very close shave, it does it without any discomfort or searching around for settings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Panasonic es7103 and it was so bad.  I recently bought Philips and it is so different !  This Philips 8240 much better ! I love it ! :)  I would recommend this item to my friends. I gonna buy second one as a present.</li>
    <li> I found Philips Norelco 8240 somewhat irritating unless I used a good creamy shaving lotion.  That is my recommendation for this product.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco model 8240XL electric shaver is an excellent men&#x27;s shaver considering the relatively modest price of $69.99 that I paid for it.  I chose this particular model based on a very high rating given by a well-known consumer products reporting organization.  It is lightweight, made of durable materials, and comfortable to hold in the hand.  It provides a quick, close shave that is comparable to my old Norelco shaver that I paid $80 for six years ago.  This shaver is very easy to clean.  The travel pouch is almost form-fitting but does allow enough room to store the little cleaning brush that comes with the shaver.  It would have been nice if the travel pouch had enough room to include the battery charger/adapter but if you are only going to be taking it on a trip of less than three weeks in duration you don&#x27;t need to take the charger anyway--just make sure it nearly has a full charge before leaving.  Although I&#x27;ve only been using this shaver for about three weeks now (since mid-Dec 2011) it has proven to be a high-quality product just as I expected from Philips Norelco.</li>
    <li> Much better than I expected. I have been using the same old, cheap electric for about 5 years. The blades were worn smooth. I started skipping shaving a day or two, or three. Tough on my neck and shirts. When to a safety razor, good shave but soon back to the two or three skip practice. I read the reviews, and got a fair price ( to me). This new razor is faster, easier on the skin, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It is convenient to use, and it is relatively fast. It is also easy to clean, so I like it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for my husband in 2010 for Christmas.  It is now 2013 and he has used it everyday with no complaints.  I&#x27;m not sure he has even had to change the shaver blades, which I also purchased for him at the same time.  When he uses this shaver his face is smooth and does not appear irritated.  In addition to the three shaver things there is also a trimmer which easily pops up and back down with a simple touch.  Definitely a worthwhile investment!  When (or rather if?) the day comes we need to buy a new one I will definitely be looking at Philips Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> First off let me say that although this is rated as a dry shaver that can be cleaned under water, you can actually use this as a wet shaver just fine, for me it shaves closer and more comfortable as a wet shaver.  Also I just finished comparing this shaver to one of the new 3-D models, the 8240 was the better shaver for a variety of reasons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s MUCH cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You can use this as a wet or dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Much easier to clean where the whole head flips out vs 3 heads on the 3-D.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Bigger grip.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Cheaper replacement heads and they make a Vollco sharpener for these heads if you want to go down that road, not the 3-D heads.&lt;br /&gt;6.  The 8240 shaves AT LEAST as close and comfortable as the 3-D, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;7.  If the battery goes dead you can shave right off the power cord, you can&#x27;t do that with the 3-D.&lt;br /&gt;8.  To charge the 8240 you just, well, plug it in...to charge the 3-D model you have to break out this quirky charging stand they designed and use that, a pain to travel with the charging stand as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might consider getting one of the higher end 8000 models for a few more bells and whistles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have have...good luck</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor about a year ago.  Seems to do a fairly good job and the battery has held up well.  My only MAJOR complaint is the razor top seems to open too easily if bumped, dumping out all the clippings.  Also when emptying the razor the entire head unit separates from the base when giving it a little shake or tap to get everything out.  Overall build quality seems to be good with the exception of the two above issues.</li>
    <li> I wourl spect more power and faster spins put is noise less, and more precision the the other one with only one blade</li>
    <li> Norelco shavers always seem to give the cloest shave and smooth too.  The only reasaon I give it a 4 instead of 5 star,  there is nothing showing the charge left for the battery.  It just stops working.  No gradual slow down it just quits.  It will run with the charger plugged into the wall though.  This model is one of their top line models.  I think other than that you will like it alot.</li>
    <li> I dropped it from small height, the top has become separated from the body and the shaver can no longer be used.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for a few years now and love it. Saturday after church I came home to 25 pieces of razor and a guilty poodle. I can&#x27;t find it any cheaper locally, so back to amazon. I tried one of the new Norelco 2Ds but was unimpressed. It&#x27;s going back as soon as my package arrives.&lt;br /&gt;This razor charges fast, holds a charge, cuts well, and travels well. Apparently, there is a newer version, but since this one was awesome, why change. As I stated in a previous review, the newest version isn&#x27;t always better.</li>
    <li> I used this product a lot and it did an adequate job.But it did not shave as close as I would like so I have dropped back to using my older Norelco.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who is in a health facility. His old shaver was making sores on his face. I took this one to him and after they began using this one, his face has been very smooth. He also likes it cause it&#x27;s quiet. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Husband with health issues has used a Norelco shaver since shaving otherwise was unsafe. Old razor had gotten to where battery would not hold a charge. Got this one as replacement and he LOVES it. Same great shave but can rinse head under running water to clean  and the price was RIGHT!  Would order another today!</li>
    <li> The well-groomed man needs a comfortable, close shave. My guy says this one (the first electric one he has tried in a couple of decades) gives him the clean finish he likes without having to use shaving gel or soap which irritated his skin.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended this to my husband and as I said in the above recommendation we were very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> My husband purchased this product or a version of it around 2004. We have replaced it through Philips/Norelco multiple times (at least 4) because it just stops working. Believing in the Norelco product, we accepted their assurance that each time was just a fluke. Some service representatives also suggested that it was the power coming into the house, although no other appliances have problems. But as my husband said today, it is statistically impossible that he always receives a razor that stops working after a year and a half or so. Called Norelco (Philips) today and they said that although they stand behind their product, since they replaced/upgraded his razor in the fall of 2011 and his original purchase was in 2004, they only stand behind PURCHASED products for 2 years. We are switching to Remington!!</li>
    <li> This shaver is just what I was looking for.  Works and feels great, holds a charge, easy to clean.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Has no light letting you know when it needs recharging and it gets you into trouble.  I have been using Norelco for many years and if the others were like this, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004EXGN8W Philips Norelco 8240XL Speed-XL Shaver]]  My husband needed a new electric shaver.  I got him the Norelco 8240 for Christmas.  He uses a disposable blade razor most of the time and just wanted the electric for touch ups when he didn&#x27;t want to shave with the razor.  I&#x27;ve asked several times how he likes the Norelco and his answers were that it&#x27;s a good shaver and that it gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> After 50 plus years of razor blades, I decided to try the Norelco speed 8240 electric shaver from Amazon. I have used it for three weeks. They are correct when they say you need to use it  for 2-3 weeks to get accustomed to the way it shaves. Overall, the shaving quality is very good. It shaves close without irritation. In most areas of my face and neck  I am getting a somewhat closer shave than with a blade, except in the area of my upper lip. Here I find it somewhat difficult  to get as close a shave, mainly due to the size of the shaving heads and the contours of my face. Note- The use \\&quot;Williams &#x27;lectric shave,\\&quot; or a similar product, prior to shaving seems to produce a much better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like trimming attachment. I find it possible to get my sideburns cut much straighter than with a normal safety razor. It does take me longer to shave using the electric shaver. Cuts and nicks  are hopefully a thing of the past. A great plus with a cordless electric razor is that you can \\&quot;shave on the go,\\&quot; a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; at any time without the need of a sink and water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very satisfied with this product, and as a bonus, when I registered the item online they extended the warranty from two years to two and a half years.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband who had not used an electric razor in thirty years. He could not believe how close the shave was and the quietness of the product. The charge lasted him for at least 7 days so a good long battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband on Christmas 2011.  He absolutely loves it.  It also is so quiet I hardly can hear it compared to other shavers he has had. Great product.</li>
    <li> Great shave, no nicks, smooth. Like the 2 week charge time and the ability to rinse the shaver is a big help in keeping things clean and efficient.</li>
    <li> It stop working!!! after the first three months,but they send me a new one,which was different model !! I wasn&#x27;t happy!</li>
    <li> Is a dependable product, it provides a close shave for an electric razor with little to no razor burn. Like most electric razors I have had, after about 10-11 months it doesn&#x27;t hold the charge as well as it did.</li>
    <li> I bought this about a year and a half ago and brought it with me to China. I hadn&#x27;t thought ahead about the fact that everything in China runs on 220v. So, I bought myself an adapter. I fully charged it, and then forgot about it until I had to charge it again last week. It lasted 10 months of once weekly use. Other than the amazing battery life, it also gives a great shave.</li>
    <li> This razor seems pricey, but it is by far and away the best razor. I bought a similarly riced foil razor with ckleaning/charging system - hunk of junk. This shaves MUCH closer, is MUCH quieter, and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one</li>
    <li> Perhaps I just got a lemon, but this razor doesn&#x27;t cut well at all.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for years and had always been happy until now.&lt;br /&gt;This &#x27;system&#x27; simply doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do. I&#x27;m fed up with my family and friends telling me I missed yet another spot, so I&#x27;m off to buy a new razor.  This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is my third or fourth Norelco. I did change to a Braun about 8-9 years ago and found it an excellent product. However there was one part of my neck that it could not get. Norelco did the job first time. Good product at a good price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d just have to say that modern &#x27;shavers&#x27; just aren&#x27;t holding their own in material or durability nor functionality of ones made years ago. They&#x27;ve gotten cheaper, but keep charging us more for them. It&#x27;s quite a scheme they have going! Knowing full well, people like to be shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one holds its own well enough. Of course, blades dull rather quickly, and sometimes requires multiple passes to get patches it missed. Kind of sucks. Is it so hard to build a functioning razor as they should be doing? Not at all. Is it going to happen? Not likely. So until they stop being greedy, I have to say this one&#x27;s decent in a bunch of rotten technology.</li>
    <li> Christmas gifts for my son &amp; nephew.  Haven&#x27;t given them to them till Christmas...But i know my boys they will love it!</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco Razors for 50 years and don&#x27;t like any other shaving tool. Clean shave&#x27;s, long service and replacement heads are readily available.</li>
    <li> This razor worked fine but only lasted 35 months before the switch stopped working.</li>
    <li> chops the paper quick, just feed it one after the other, it wants more. it really works 2 3  5 sheets it eats it all.</li>
    <li> First, I will never use shaving rasors as Gillette, Wilkinson, etc. Electronic shavers are better and cheaper to use. I used Braun Pulsonic - one of the most expensive from Braun shavers. It was OK but very loud -- my little baby woke up every time I used it. My friend recommended me Philips. It was not expensive, about half the price of my Braun. The comparison looks like that: Braun shaves faster, more accurate-closer, gives less irritation to the skin but it is very LOUD. Philips is quiet but slower, less accurate and more irritating to the skin.</li>
    <li> AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING  FOR  A CLEAN COMFORTABLE SHAVE ITS STILL  A  PROBLEM  !!!!!!!/???????&lt;br /&gt;HEADS DEFECTIVE????????,HAD TO GO BACK TOA BLADE.  THIS IS MY 3rd NORELCO SHAVER,AND,IT HAS A PROBLEM</li>
    <li> This Razor worked allright but was not impressed with the cutting system,did not seem to cut as well as other razors I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Been using this item for a year now.  It produces a nice clean shave and is easy to clean with running water (one of the reasons I purchased it).  This is best electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco 8240XL is a nice mid level shaver. It gives me a good shave and is a nice solid unit. It comes with a nice protective case that will keep it safe in your travel kit. Had I not moved up to a top of the line shaver before getting this unit, I would have been very happy with it. It will be a big upgrade to my travel kit. It is a lot nicer than the shaver I used just 2 years ago as my main one. It doesn&#x27;t have the digital battery level indicator or stand that I&#x27;ve gotten to like in my other shavers so I miss those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main shaver is the [[ASIN:B000PKKAGO Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] which is awesome. It is also twice the price. I also use the [[ASIN:B000UK2VRK Philips Norelco 8040X Moisturizing Shaving System]] in the shower, or when I want to shave with shaving gel. It gives an incredibly close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely impressed with the Philips Norelco line of shavers. If you are in the market for a mid level shaver, then the 8240XL is a solid choice. If you are ready to spend the money to get a top of the line model then the Arcitec 1090 is a great choice. I love mine. I&#x27;m also becoming very fond of the wet dry 8040X system.</li>
    <li> I recently received this product and am very satisfied!!  We decided that I would shave my Hubby&#x27;s face (he was very scared but allowed me nonetheless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good points:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unlike our older Norelco circa 2003, everything is ONE uniform piece.  The other shaver had soooo many pieces to keep track of that it became cumbersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shaver head contours and flexes to the shape of your face and neck.  Anyone who shaves regularly knows how difficult it can be to get every little hair.  This system provides a clean, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. On the back of the shaver there is a button that when pressed a small tripper conveniently pops up.  We used the trimmer to trim his sideburns and mustache.  VERY USEFUL... opposed to looking for that little scissor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Quick charge; right out of the box only charged for one hour and we were able to shave his face.  About 15-20 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. EXTREMELY EASY clean up of the head.  Just push a button, the head opens and you run under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Also comes with a nice little brush to use pre-wash for clean-up of the excess hair.  Not for your face, but for the trimmer and shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so bad...&lt;br /&gt;1.  The reason it is missing a star is because I miss how my old Norelco had a little compartment for the Nivea shaving gel/lotion.  The trimmer takes the place of that slot.. so it is worth it even though I miss that cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend at a great price!!  We are loving this Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit to add that my husband has sensitive skin and even when he would use all those shaving creams, regular blades, quadruple blades and even my Intuition razor; this one did not cause any sort of a break out or bumps.  We shaved him dry... that is great!</li>
    <li> I rarely use an electric shaver, so I may not be the best to rate this as opposed to other shavers. However, I do grow facial hair and need it cut.... so, I can rate it from that aspect.  This razor did a very nice job at shaving. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I am liking it. It seems sharp even after a months use. Cleans easy enough with a rinse, occasional brushing out helps keep things running smooth also.  It has a nice fit in my hand which makes it easy to work with, having arthritis. And it does seem to follow the contour of my face well enough that I&#x27;m not having to go over a number of areas and having to change how I hold it. I like the fact of antimicrobial coating on the inside, where moisture and hair and dead skin collects. I just wonder how long it lasts.  All in all, I would say this is a good purchase and worth the money.</li>
    <li> The shaves I got were pretty good and the charge lasted about a week, and I really liked being able to rinse out the heads with water, so I was happy with it. However after about a year of use it suddenly died without warning. I took it apart to see if the battery is user-replaceable and it is not (soldered in), and when I tested the battery its voltage was fine. It appeared that water had gotten inside from the rinsing, which is probably why it died--it was not well sealed. I forgot that it had a 2-yr warranty so I threw it away and bought the newer model, AT830, which should be better sealed against water (can use it in shower).</li>
    <li> I have used many Norelco electric shavers over the years. I find this XL 8240 to give a close and much faster shave due to the increase in cutting surface on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second XL 8240 Norelco which I purchased to go in my travel bag. A once a week charge gives me 7 days of fast close shaves at home and on the go.</li>
    <li> Works well, and is easy to clean. worth it for a quick shave.</li>
    <li> Shaves pretty well, holds a nice charge and gets the job done</li>
    <li> Bought. This shaver for my hubby because his other Norelco had died. He is a long time Norelco user, and he really likes this shaver. It shaves him close, and clean.</li>
    <li> This shaver maintains the high standards of Norelco which I have enjoyed using for decades.</li>
    <li> This was a gift fro my husband and my husband loves this razor especially because he has sensitive skin and can not use shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Very much satisfied with this shaver as I have always been with other Norelco shavers that I have owned.          [ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco SpeedXL 8240XL Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
    <li> My 10 year old Norelco shaver far superior to this one.  Mine shaves closer in less time,  recharges in half the time, more sturdy, sliding on/off button.  I&#x27;ll stick with mine instead of trying to improve.  Only advantage is being able to wash  the newer version under the tap, however mine can be cleaned with brush.  Quite disappointed!!</li>
    <li> As a long time Norelco user, I have come to expect a no hassle, effective product.  As with every new shaver, it seems a bit easier to use and shaves a bit closer.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true or it just seems that way...no matter.  It&#x27;s a good shaver at a good price.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this shaver for a while now and likes it a lot.  Holds its charge for several days.</li>
    <li> My Norelco was over 10 years old so I went looking for a new. I went to Costco and Sears. I returned both shavers ($79 and $89.00). The Norelcos they sold were just junk and ripped out my beard. Hard to believe Philips would allow such cheap a product to be sold with their name on it. Each of three heads had one cutting ring. But the XL 8240 has three in each head (9 rings in all) and shaves great!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I took them back and went looking on Amazon to find this 8240. It is very similar to my old one and works even better.&lt;br /&gt;Do your self a favor get this one and leave the junk to Costco and Sears. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I was using a remignton one and feel it dont work very well, so i switch to this model and im very happy. one dog eat the power cord and i ordered a replacement. now i have 3 years with this shaver and im still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I change the blades every year!!</li>
    <li> It gives me a very close shave with a minimum of effort and is easy to maintain and easy to carry</li>
    <li> My husband was born with a mild disability that made it difficult to use a normal razor.  Norelco is one his most favorite electrical shavers because of its&#x27; close shave.  I will always buy Norelco when he needs one (usually for Christmas).  It continues to be a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and have had no problems with it. The item works as described as the seller stated.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to clean as well as to keep clean, which is nice.  It is not as good at cutting longer hair, and will pull if hair is too long.</li>
    <li> Phillips norelco is always a good product &amp; this one is better than the previous model.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price &amp; a close shave.</li>
    <li> Great service. My husband loves this shaver!!!! He likes the fact that you can wash it out and don&#x27;t have the messy hair to have to use a brush on.</li>
    <li> As the title says, I purchased a complete shaver rather than spring for an over-priced cutter blade package.  As expected, the blades lasted about a year and I&#x27;m now in the market again for either another shaver or replacement blades, which ever is less.</li>
    <li> ever since phillips bought into norelco or into magnavox the brands I used to put high on the quality/value list are dissapointing, common denominator is the philips name.  that said, I do like the flexible nature of the head on this razor, doesn&#x27;t seem to power the blades very well but cuts the beard pretty well if done daily, for the price it gets 3 stars, shopped around and bought it at lowest price i could find, around 70-75, beware some sellers charged much more, 120+ range I remember, so I expected more in quality.  The main plus is it works pretty well even if I use it after a shower, my last razor didn&#x27;t, but worked great on a dry face</li>
    <li> It does a good job. I have owned one like it in the past, but gave it to my son.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition. Exactly as pictured and described. Very pleased with purchase. Was a gift. My dad loves it.</li>
    <li> Gives pain when removing  thick beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job! I like this items very much!!!</li>
    <li> This Norelco shaver is the fourth one of the Norelco series I have owned. They are the only shaver I can use with satisfactory results. The battery in the 8240 seems to last for many more shaves than the previous models but it would be nice to know when the charge is getting low! I Liked my previous model 8160XL in this respect. It had a 5 segment light with all LCDs lit for FULL and only the bottom light lit for LOW. I always knew EXACTLY when to recharge the battery! I would definitely like to see Philips Electronics put this HIGH-LOW indicator system on ALL of its Norelco shavers.</li>
    <li> does the same job that 200 dollars machines do at a third of the price, very happy with it, will come back to this great vendor</li>
    <li> Bought a more expensive version of this years ago and this model has the same shaver heads.  This works just as well as mine (this was a gift for my son).  Very smooth shave with floating head system.  Never have found a better shaver in my life than these Norelcos.  Son loves it as well.  Very fast.  Replaced the heads after about five years as they were getting a bit dull and it took longer to get a shave.  Worked as good as new with new heads.</li>
    <li> For all the hype this shaver has been given, I found it no better than models half the cost. I do not recommend this shaver as it is highly over priced and does not deliver the results expected.</li>
    <li> it was right and corect . Evrythig  was right .I am as Bayer satisfied with this Product high quvality it is ok</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for over a year now and it has worked pretty well. The old single track Philips Norelco I used to have seemed to give me the same shave in a quicker time though. Odd.</li>
    <li> its fast to use and has given me good service. its time for me to buy new cutter heads for it do to having it fur over a year</li>
    <li> I do not have a very tough beard , probably just average but this thing does a reat job.  The flip top makes it very easy to keep clean and a single charge of the batteries lasts several weeks for me.</li>
    <li> I have to remain clean-shaven for my job and I was curious to see if an electric razor would work better than the blades I was using previously. Unfortunately even after the break-in period of my skin getting used to the razor this still provided an unsatisfactory shave. With a little bit of stubble the shave still left me with a five o&#x27;clock shadow, same with a days worth. If I had even a little bit more than a days worth it would tug and pull at my hairs which was very painful. Even after giving it extensive opportunities to prove itself I had to give up and go back to my regular razor.</li>
    <li> This was great to send as a gift.  Served the purpose well.  Would recomend Norelco to anyone interested in an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> The product arrived as advertized, on time, and in tact. I love it. It works perfectly and stands up well to every day conditions. Not a bad price too.</li>
    <li> Here I don&#x27;t have record of ever having made this puchase. May have looked at it and not purchased so can&#x27;t really rate this offering. We have had a similar unit for about four years and it has served my husband well.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Norelco in 40 years.  Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Husband has gotten very good use out of the shaver.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Does not shave close at all.  It was a total waste of money.  I will never buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Perfect and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I still have a working 8825XL but I bought the 8240XL on a whim thinking that after a few years just maybe...it&#x27;s a little better. Although it&#x27;s probably better than its competition it just isn&#x27;t the same as my 8825XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, actually it&#x27;s almost identical in almost every way but, after 3 days of grown only the 8825XL can handle the whole beard and still remain cool to the skin. It also handles the longer hair much better in that it takes it in and shaves it off with fewer passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, the 8240XL is best for a daily only shaver then you really cannot go wrong. If you don&#x27;t like to shave often or just catch yourself doing so every couple of days then keep on the hunt for the older 8825XL as for the longer growth it&#x27;s just nicer to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if someone can suggest something significantly better than these that still keeps relatively cool then I&#x27;m very interested (without shaving in the shower).</li>
    <li> I have had 3 other Norelco shavers oveer the past 55 years and this is by far the best one yet. Shaves the closest, no irritation and clean up with a hot water rinse. Love it</li>
    <li> My husband loves it.  He&#x27;s had several in the past and likes the closer shave he gets from this one best.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver almost three years ago when Amazon put it on sale. My wife objected, she said I already had a Norelco shaver. I told her my old one was getting old, it was on its second set of heads, it was plug-in only, and besides that, I couldn&#x27;t resist a bargain! So, I relegated my old one to use in our RV and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been and still is a surprisingly good shaver. I have owned quite a few electric shavers over the years, but this is the first one that has had tree rows of cutters in each head. They are quite effective. I can get a reasonably close shave in less time than any shaver I can remember and far quicker than with a safety razor. It is disarmingly quiet. You might thing it has inadequate power, but it does not slow down shaving a heavy beard or when trimming sideburns with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is washable. The instructions say wash the heads only but it is possible by being careful to wash away all of the cuttings without running water into the shaver. (I&#x27;m not recommending this, but it works for me.) I also like the fact that the battery charge lasts quite a while. I use it every day, but charge it once a week. I forgot one week and the charge lasted almost two weeks before it finally quit!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother. He has thick hair so it took a little while to have a clean shave with this but did the job!</li>
    <li> I have owned Norelcos for years and have not been disappointed in this recent purchase. A good close shave and long lasting battery power.</li>
    <li> Shaver came timely - still testing it;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing as charger wasn&#x27;t working from the first use (Good that we have Philips shop near and I&#x27;ve purchased new charger) can&#x27;t tell that it shaves clean as a quality razor, but shaving every day is more effective than shaving every 2 or 3 days;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s see how long battery will last...</li>
    <li> This is the first Norelco shaver that gave me as good a shave as the two headed originals that I used 50 years ago.  The earlier lift and cut of recent years were the worst.</li>
    <li> how many volt need this product 120v or 230v? I bought if for europe and will i use it or not?</li>
    <li> This razor was shipped and received as advertised. The razor itself works great. I have only had it for about a month but no issues. I bought it to replace an older one and did not realize how dull the older blades were on my old razor.It takes a 3 day growth with no issues. Since i used this type of razor before i did not have to adapt to the style so my results were immediate. Very happy so far. Money well spent.</li>
    <li> The Philips 8240 shaving system is not so strong and the battery is very weak. When I travel I have to use my old shaving system...</li>
    <li> IT, LIKE MOST NORELCO PRODUCT IS VASTLY OVER PRICED.  THIS IS WHERE THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY.  IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT, I THINK IT SHOULD LAST LONGER, GUT NON THE LESS I AM HAPPY WITH IT</li>
    <li> Am happy wit my new product it shaves as I expected,tnx norelco I recomend it to any who needs a close baby shaving.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for 2 years with out an issue.  It still cuts great and I never have a charging issue.  Always&lt;br /&gt;has a full charge.  I would buy this razor again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this 8240 to replace a 8150XL and it hasn&#x27;t lived up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves hairs behind,like cutting down a forest and leaving complete trees behind.&lt;br /&gt;I when back to the old razor and would return the 8240 if I hadn&#x27;t thrown the packaging&lt;br /&gt;away.I don&#x27;t know the difference between the two but there&#x27;s something.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the ease and comfort this device offers to get a good shave.  Cleaning is very quick &amp; easy and recharging is fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this razo for $48.00 and it is a great razor the low price. I would recomend this razor to anyone. Plus shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> The the norelco shaver is the best shave I ever had from an electric razor,I would recomemd this razor to everbody.</li>
    <li> I really like this item. It has very high quality and beautiful design. I gave this to my husband for gift, he also likes it very much.</li>
    <li> Very well made. Charge lasts for 6-9 days</li>
    <li> It was a good price for the quality. Close shave for an electric razor.The charge lasts for many days of shaving.</li>
    <li> They claim the blades last a year before they need replacement. I have serious doubts. Used it for less than 6 months and I feel it is doing a terrible job of a close shave now. Was pretty good initially, maybe once your skin gets used to it it can&#x27;t do a good job anymore?&lt;br /&gt;Switched back to Gilette Fusion.</li>
    <li> it has held up well and works for all beard thickness. i would definitely recommend this product to my friends</li>
    <li> i am using Phillips electric shavers every single day for more then 50 years and, in my opinion, among the Phillips line of electric shavers,  Phillips Norelco XL-8240 is the best choice in terms of value for money.</li>
    <li> This XL 8240 replaces a well used Norelco 5605 whose old NiCd batteries finally gave up the ghost.  I am very pleased with this new Norelco.  I found it a better value  This basic model does everything  that the XL 8250 does, which offers mostly useless bells and whistles for quite bit more (except for the Lo-Battery light which is missing from the 8240).  A MUCH better value than so many pricier models that really don&#x27;t add anything significant to the use and service of this more basic model.  (One feature that seems to be popular in the more expensive models is the ability wet-shave with gel if you wish, something that some people might enjoy.) The 8240 has Lithium batteries like its pricier cousins, a newly designed floating head and screens.  Very quiet.  Does a nice close shave.  Note that the use of a &#x27;pre-shave&#x27; like LectricShave will render an easier, closer shave with any electric razor.  For those of you who&#x27;ve never used an electric shaver before bear in mind that your skin will need a week or so to get used to a very different technology.  The shave may not be quite as close as a trusty triple razor but, if you use it regulalrly it is almost just as close (AND it will never cut you!).  When I consider that you could easily spend more than $230 for a new fangled device with unnecessary accesories I am very happy with what I purchased.  As it is I purchased this thru Amazon from a third party for less than $80.00.</li>
    <li> Extremely quiet shaver that gives a good, close shave. The box was missing the shaver cover, but I called Norelco and requested one be sent.  About a week later, the shaver cover arrived.  The Norelco customer service associate I spoke to was extremely helpful, apologized for the missing shaver cover, and said they would send one out to me.  I am very satisfied with the company and the shaver itself.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> the razor that I ordered is what  i got and seems to work good.  I would recomend this razor to others</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a couple of years and have loved it (best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric).  On top of the close shave it has great battery life.  But I wouldn&#x27;t have thought to write a recommendation here until I had a problem with it (my fault entirely).  I called up Phillips and they got it fixed immediately, no fuss (thank you Mick in customer service).  It is so rare to call a company these days, immediately get a human being and a human being who can immediately solve my problem.  They&#x27;ve just made me a long time Norelco customer.</li>
    <li> Reliably good and long lasting electric shaver!  There is an adjustment  period of three weeks or so  for the razor to orient itself to the hair growth.</li>
