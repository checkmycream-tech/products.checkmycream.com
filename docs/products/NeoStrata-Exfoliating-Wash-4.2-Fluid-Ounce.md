      <li>Previously I used  rodan &amp; fields (and have tried many others), and I like this product line better.</li>
      <li>Great product, half the price of my esthetician!!</li>
      <li>The NeoStrata leaves your face feeling clean and smooth without making your face feel dry... ready to apply your make-up or just going to bed with a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it leaves your skin so soft and smooth, just like a baby&#x27;s.</li>

      <li>I like the Exfoliating Wash but not as much as the Foaming Glycolic wash.  </li>
      <li>You only need a tiny bit to get a nice wash too.</li>
      <li>A younger person with very oily skin might be able to use it daily</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a little strong for my face to use it that often.</li>
      <li>I broke out the first ten days I was using it and panicked a little; but it turns out that&#x27;s what happens when the alpha hydroxy acid first goes to work on the junk that&#x27;s hiding under your skin.</li>

    <li> neostrata skin active exfoliating wash is a great product.  it leaves your skin so soft and smooth, just like a baby&#x27;s. like it a lot.</li>
    <li> This works great on my skin. I love that it is soap free and it gently exfoliates away dead skin, preparing it for serums and creams so I get the most out of my expensive skin care routine. It also works well on mild acne.</li>
    <li> I tried it, then left it off for a few days, and found that when using it my skin was clearer.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I know a product is good if I buy it more than twice in a row when running out.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been using the skin active line for about a year now. A little goes a long way. Previously I used  rodan &amp; fields (and have tried many others), and I like this product line better.</li>
    <li> I recommend I like it</li>
    <li> Love the product and pricing - it is as advertised</li>
    <li> My face definitely feels very clean after using this. Its nice and foamy and does not feel like it scratching at the skin. After rinsing you feel the skin tightening. Great daily product.</li>
    <li> I like the Exfoliating Wash but not as much as the Foaming Glycolic wash.  I use it only before using the Neostrata Peel once a week.  A younger person with very oily skin might be able to use it daily but it&#x27;s a little strong for my face to use it that often.</li>
    <li> I just love this face wash.  My face feels so nice and clean and soft when I&#x27;m finished.  You only need a tiny bit to get a nice wash too.</li>
    <li> so far I love this product</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist to use in the AM. It is a foam and very refreshing in the morning.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and it is a Fantastic facial wash - makes my face feel so fresh and clean and my problems cleared up right away; I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Had trouble with dry skin as I am getting older and I was told to try NeoStrata products and this with the lotion has helped my skin a ton!</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of NeoStrata&#x27;s Exfoliating Wash.  Used at least once daily on my very dry skin,  there&#x27;s noticeable improvement in both complexion clarity and texture, without any excessive dryness. Especially love the pumped foam, which makes 4.2 ounces of product. last for weeks and weeks!  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this in a Beauty Tube order and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The exfoliator comes out as a foam, only takes 2-3 pumps to wash your face. The NeoStrata leaves your face feeling clean and smooth without making your face feel dry... ready to apply your make-up or just going to bed with a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to add: I have had the 1.3 oz. bottle for almost 4 months now using it once day.</li>
    <li> My skin is super fair, sensitive, dry, and prone to red spots.  In combination with the NeoStrata Eye Therapy and NeoStrata Ultra Smoothing Cream, this face wash has really made my skin bright and glowing.  It diminished the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth in fewer than two weeks.  Just bear in mind that this stuff will sting and irritate for the first week or two of use.

    <li> feels great in my skin and i use it every day&amp;#62; i woudl recommend it to people to try it</li>
    <li> Love this - makes my face feel very clean.  Only takes a little bit and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I first tried this product in my Beauty Test Tube and loved it so much I had to buy the full size. It exfoliates without being harsh. It leaves your face feeling clean and looking polished. Once you try it, you will want to make this product part of your regular beauty routine.</li>
    <li> Very good wash. Neither stripped my face nor irritated it.</li>
