    <li> Really cute, decent size for a small bag. I just wish the bottom were firmer so it held its shape better.</li>
    <li> Held lots of my lipsticks, I bought a few of them.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR A BDAY GIFT FOR MY GOD-DAUGHTE AND IT WAS A HIT! I AM GOING TO BUY MYSELF 2 OF THESE! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> It is a nice looking make up bag. Bought for small granddaughter and she loves it. The zipper foes &amp;#34;catch&#x27; somewhat.</li>
    <li> granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> Cute. My daughter uses it to hold her hair clippers</li>
    <li> Love this little bag. Nice for vacation</li>
    <li> Poor product! Wasting of money.</li>
    <li> I love this bag!  The price was right..it was sturdy and not made out of junk material..perfect to add to my collection of makeup bags that i have.  I like to organize my makeup by eyes, lips, face and what not..it just makes it easier to not lose stuff</li>
    <li> Bought this for my niece and she loves it. It is the cutest little makeup/nail polish bag. Smaller than I originally thought even with looking at the dimensions clearly stated in description. I purchased the fuchsia bag and was actually sent the red one but the plastic bag it was in did say fuchsia. Amazon returned my email within minutes and fixed the issue for me.</li>
    <li> Great size. Was able to fit 2 makeup bags into this one! :) I love the pink and it&#x27;s so girly.. fits me perfect!</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas present for my 9 year old daughter. It is just as shown,  she loves the bright pink color of it! Perfect first make-up case for a young girl!</li>
    <li> Just The Cutest Thang  Perfect FOR The Make Up.Love It</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed because it us red not pink on the outside. It is pink on the inside only. It will serve it&#x27;s purpose though and I have plenty of room for my makeup. It is worth the money...just wish it was the color in the picture.</li>
    <li> Fell apart at the seams!</li>
    <li> okay was not what i expected when opened the package I thought I had ordered this pink one but got a red one instead but no problem it worked</li>
    <li> Nice but not as big as i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my bridesmaids. I also bought one for myself, and I love it! I use it when I travel and it&#x27;s become very useful. It is spacious, fits all my travel makeup with some left over space.</li>
    <li> The outside is super cute. My only complaint is the hearts are smeared as if they were painted on. The inside however is why I give it 2 stars. I haven&#x27;t used it yet and the insides are ripped and look like the cheapest fabric I have ever seen. I would strongly recommend not wasting your money on this.</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece and she loves it. she puts all her make up in it and takes it everywhere she goes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something small that would hold the essentials for a 7 day trip and this was perfect!</li>
