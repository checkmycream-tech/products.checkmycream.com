<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this scent and it&#x27;s hard to find at the stores.  For such a good price I got a very good sized bottle and now I can wear it more regularly rather than stretching it out like I did before.  I&#x27;m not good at describing scents, but it reminds me of high quality perfume you can buy at the mall.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perform! I original bought a sample size from Target and recently purchased the 3.4 ounce bottle from Amazon.</li>
    <li> At front store in amazon the mechant AAA Perfume Merchants LLC offers the Curve Connect Cologne For Men by Liz Claiborne with FREE SHIPPING, so when you add the item to cart and procced to checkitout there is no free shipping option, so appears an extra charge of aproximate 6 usd FOR EACH PRODUCT in the shipping concept, although the items are in the same order.    At beggining i just think that´s was a mistake, but in many tries at differents times and products from the same merchant occurs the same situation.    Whats is happening with that??    The AAA Perfume Merchants LLC. FREE SHIPPING IS A JOKE?      NOTE: I choosse 1 star because amazon have no currently implement zero stars or negative stars ranking</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!The smell is so fresh!!! you can use it any time. I bought my first bottle in May and in June bought 2 more just to make sure that I always have it!!! I am very pleased with this purchase. I recommend it to every body!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t smelled this before I bought it, but from reading all the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a chance.  It smells absolutely wonderful.  It&#x27;s a subtle smell that it totally girly and a bit familiar...great for daily wear.  This will become another of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I love it! Will never change the way I smell. Until I get bored and want something new, but this stuff, it&#x27;s good. Yassssss.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, but I did not like something that came and went as uncovered .. everything was fine ..</li>
    <li> I Love it because I get so much complement.</li>
    <li> I read all the other reviews and thought that this would be great since I love the crush sent, but it just was not for me.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to purchase this parfum. The smell is very fresh, so you can use it daily.</li>
    <li> love the scent and needed to replenish my dwindling supply. great size for a remarkable price. Carrying case can be used for storage purposes.</li>
    <li> my new favorite Curve... i love the smell</li>
    <li> This was my first time trying Curve Chill. It has a refreshing clean scent that I absolutely love. And the price is great too. I am going to order another bottle just so I won&#x27;t run out. I love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a delicious fresh scent!  I am more into citrusy perfumes, not floral or musky and \\&quot;Chill\\&quot; is absolutely perfect.  I own 8+ perfumes that I love but I&#x27;ve been wearing this one everyday!</li>
    <li> love it found it at a shop in K.C. but now can&#x27;t find it except on Amazon!!!!! Thanks Amazon you rock</li>
    <li> I love this curve, cologne always irritate me and trigger off my migraine but surprisingly the curve chill is just right! It have a very nice mild scent so those of you who are allergic to strong scented perfume can definitely try this one.</li>
    <li> love it good price and good cologne will re order when this runs out wife and daughter both use it</li>
    <li> Great scent!&lt;br /&gt;Superb price!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller!&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear it I receive complements! Great perfume, love it! Will keep coming back.</li>
    <li> What can I say, my fave and great price!!</li>
    <li> Curve chill smell ok. ok but not that good. May be because I expected too much but I should have known eariler from the price. Good for everyday use but nothing that special.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of curve chill. Not a strong smelling perfume and I get  asked by people what  kind of perfume is that cause it smells so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a couple of my girls.they both like it. Great product would definitely buy again. Stay up player.....</li>
    <li> love the fragrance and the price is much better as opposed to buying it locallly! will definitely buy more liz</li>
    <li> it smells nice, its not super expensive and it comes in a cool bottle and a nice little tin can you can use for other things later. I got it for my mom because she loves the smell. i wanted to buy her estee lauder (her #1 favorite perfume) but couldnt afford it so I got her her 2nd favorite. its a big bottle for a small price. good deal on amazon. its more expensive in other places.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it but a bit too much of a flower sent, prefer more of a musk, powder sent...</li>
    <li> This Exceeded my expectations!! I would recommend this item at anytime to everyone. It is also a great price too.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smell. This is my favorite perfume. I have been looking everywhere for this all over. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Purchasing this perfume was a good call.  I bought it based on another customers review.  Absolutely satisfied because it is a BEAUTIFUL scent.  Definitely a summer fragrance but has the vibrancy to be worn throughout the year.  Elated with this purchase and I own 20+ perfumes.</li>
    <li> My Favorite Perfume and this is the cheapest.</li>
    <li> First off its soft, sensual and sweet. This is my second time having this perfume. Price is nice as well. This could easily be my favourite Liz Clairbourne perfume.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter in law and it smells great.  I know she will love it very much.</li>
    <li> This product was amazing for the price.  I was so happy to see that for the normal price i pay for a very small bottle I was able to get this big bottle! It is my favorite scent and used to be sold in Walmart stores but no longer is. :-( So happy i was able to find it here!</li>
    <li> been using it recently, love the fragance and it seems that people love it on me too... So I think I&#x27;ll use it a lot</li>
    <li> Based on other reviews I bought this perfume, I had always liked the regular curve but it made my allergies act up. This one has a fresh clean smell, perfect for everyday wear. And no problems with allergies! Will become a must have smell!</li>
    <li> Crisp, fresh smell.  It goes on a little strong after about 3 small sprays, but it settles in smoothly to a point that I can still smell it at night when I&#x27;m ready to go to sleep.  Packaging was wonderful - container was thoroughly wrapped with bubble-wrap and it was received on time.</li>
    <li> I love it so much. I&#x27;ve been searching for this for ages! Thank you!(:</li>
    <li> Item was as described, i love curve so i got this for a friend and she too loved it.&lt;br /&gt;As described and as expected, Reccommednded!!!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped in a timely manner</li>

    <li> This product was amazing. It was authentic and everything I expected. It smells just as I remember, you should definitely buy it!</li>
    <li> Excellent choice for a present. It was chosen by me as christmas present for my older sister. She loved it and now is her usual fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love it, get alot of compliments when i wear curve chill or regular curve. &amp; it is very reasonable priced.</li>
    <li> I am a full CURVE guy!! And now even my kids are following in my footsteps after lots of occasions of coughing them spraying my own. Finally thought it was time to get them their own....</li>
    <li> So this order here I received very quickly, way before the estimated delivery date. Free and fast delivery gets two thumbs up in my book. This spray is exactly as I ordered it, it didnt come smaller then the description, it was the right size and the best part is IT SMELLS AMAZING!!!!! After opening a few other horrible smelling products I order I expected that this to would smell bad but I LOVE it, I&#x27;ve worn it everyday since I opened!! End result Great product, awesome delivery! Its a breath of fresh air when things work out so simple. THANK YOU!!!</li>
