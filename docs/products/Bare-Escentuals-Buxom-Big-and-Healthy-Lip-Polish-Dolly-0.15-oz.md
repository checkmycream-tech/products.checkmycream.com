      <li>: I have fair skin.</li>
      <li>Not a fan of that sensation, and it just can&#x27;t be good for you.</li>
      <li>It even smells and tastes good</li>
      <li>Additionally Retinyl Palmate is a wonderful anti aging and anti acne ingredient rarely found in lip gloss.</li>
      <li>I have the Buxom gloss in the color \\&quot;Tonya\\&quot; and I love how to color works - not too bright, but with good color payoff.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>I tend to have blackheads around my lips-and I can honestly say I have never had a break out because of this product, and I attribute that to the formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also, the light plum color of this shade looks good against my fair skin.</li>
      <li>This is a nice shade but very light color.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quite shiny &amp; I absolutely LOVE the tingle feeling</li>
      <li>My favorite online store.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients in this product.</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>I wear this on top of my lip conditioner and over my lipstick.</li>
      <li>It had a lovely tingle that plumped my lips when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>I love this lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>This color is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Although very fun to change colors from season to season.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Buxom!</li>
      <li>Not too darker or light.</li>
      <li>I usually enjoy mauves.</li>
      <li>I am not a gloss girl, but I have to get dolled up every now and then-so I purchase lip gloss for special occasions.</li>
      <li>Buxom Big and Healthy has shimmer and a sheen in it, but I cannot feel the minerals and it goes on very smooth.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this lip polish in the color \\&quot;Sugar.\\&quot; Not realizing it was a lip plumper at first, I started freaking out  bit when my lips started to tingle and almost BURN.</li>
      <li>The size of the lip gloss is worth the price.</li>
      <li>Love the color, it looks natural.</li>
      <li>A great natural shade of pink and has just the right amount of tingle to it.</li>
      <li>have been buying this brand in so many different colors (esp.</li>
      <li>I first tried this lip gloss as a sample.</li>
      <li>you apply it, it glides on very smooth and so soothing to your lips that you feel it and do not feel like you need to re-apply it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product at Ulta in the past and loved it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much plumping - just burning.</li>
      <li>I actually used up the sampler and have since purchased a full tube.</li>
      <li>Although there is not an SPF rating, there is titanium dioxide in the ingredient list which makes me think using it along another sunscreen gives more UV protection than your average drug store brand lip gloss.</li>
      <li>Faced Glamour gloss was a better option for me - less sticky and the plump does work without searing my lips.</li>
      <li>I have had sensitive lips since I was in Junior High</li>
      <li>It has a slight pleasant scent-a combination of fruit and flowers, with a little mint, nothing that will bother you or taste on your food/</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any major plumping of the lips, but I did like the sheer color and gloss, which was flattering and stayed in place longer than many other glosses.</li>
      <li>a dark ruby (matte) lipstick and the Katie shade looks amazing over it and does not cause my dark lipstick to smear.</li>
      <li>The order arrived within a couple of days,faster than if I had ordered directly from the company.  </li>
      <li>so much that they stay red overnight and became chapped in the morning.</li>
      <li>I have full lips already, but I can feel and notice a difference even when applied over a few layers of lip product.</li>
      <li>The slight tingle makes my lips feel fresh and reminds me it&#x27;s there</li>
      <li>Over the course of a regular night out (drinks, appetizers etc) I reapply this about every two hours, whether I am wearing it on bare lips or layered.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am very disappointed. I had bought this product years ago and I loved it.  It had a lovely tingle that plumped my lips when I put it on.  This one has no tingle at all.  I feel like a got ripped off.  I loved the tingle!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! A great natural shade of pink and has just the right amount of tingle to it.</li>
    <li> I have had sensitive lips since I was in Junior High and this is the only lip gloss that I can wear that does not make my lips and surrounding lip area break out from sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it, it glides on very smooth and so soothing to your lips that you feel it and do not feel like you need to re-apply it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been buying this brand in so many different colors (esp. Dani!) for so long that I have not even looked at another brand. Why change when you have found your ultimate lip gloss! Although very fun to change colors from season to season.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Buxom!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype with this lip polish, to me is is a lip gloss and does not plump. Others I&#x27;ve tried that work are Pout pump, Victorias Secret and Vernal.  This is a nice shade but very light color.  I like it just as a gloss.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this lip polish in the color \\&quot;Sugar.\\&quot; Not realizing it was a lip plumper at first, I started freaking out  bit when my lips started to tingle and almost BURN. Not a fan of that sensation, and it just can&#x27;t be good for you. I didn&#x27;t notice any major plumping of the lips, but I did like the sheer color and gloss, which was flattering and stayed in place longer than many other glosses. So, if you don&#x27;t mind the tingle, this product may be for you.</li>
    <li> Love the color, it looks natural. It doesnt make make my lips sticky or look gunky. LOVE this product. The size of the lip gloss is worth the price.</li>
    <li> The color is great! I usually enjoy mauves. Although the product is a bit sticky, it stays on great, smells &amp; tastes good. It&#x27;s quite shiny &amp; I absolutely LOVE the tingle feeling it creates. I think it&#x27;s expensive &amp; I purchased it only because I had a gift card. But I would definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years. Great color &amp; wearability. The slight tingle makes my lips feel fresh and reminds me it&#x27;s there so I don&#x27;t lick it off.</li>
    <li> I first tried this lip gloss as a sample. I absolutely love it!  I actually used up the sampler and have since purchased a full tube. I don&#x27;t like lipstick or bright lip gloss colors. Plus, I didn&#x27;t want anything that I would reapply so often. This is my go to everyday. I actually  have been complimented on the color. so this stuff is a must try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! You can feel a tingly sensation as it plumps your lips. Also, the light plum color of this shade looks good against my fair skin.</li>
    <li> Great staying power for a gloss, the color is very nice.  The only criticism I have is it&#x27;s stickiness.</li>
    <li> I love this lip gloss.  The order arrived within a couple of days,faster than if I had ordered directly from the company.  Thank you Amazon.  YOU ROCK.</li>
    <li> I am not a gloss girl, but I have to get dolled up every now and then-so I purchase lip gloss for special occasions. Because I wear it for nights out and not during the day-I cannot speak about it as a long wear lip gloss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I wear this on top of my lip conditioner and over my lipstick. I usually wear a dark ruby (matte) lipstick and the Katie shade looks amazing over it and does not cause my dark lipstick to smear. I have full lips already, but I can feel and notice a difference even when applied over a few layers of lip product. The few shimmer glosses I have tried in the past I have disliked because of the \\&quot;minerals\\&quot; in it, and I have been able to feel the gritty specks when I apply it or press my lips together. Buxom Big and Healthy has shimmer and a sheen in it, but I cannot feel the minerals and it goes on very smooth. It has a slight pleasant scent-a combination of fruit and flowers, with a little mint, nothing that will bother you or taste on your food/drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Katie shade is a little lighter than I expected-but I generally like it. Although I usually wear it over lipstick, I have worn it on bare lips a few times and my lips have stayed moisturized throughout the night. Over the course of a regular night out (drinks, appetizers etc) I reapply this about every two hours, whether I am wearing it on bare lips or layered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I love the ingredients in this product. Although there is not an SPF rating, there is titanium dioxide in the ingredient list which makes me think using it along another sunscreen gives more UV protection than your average drug store brand lip gloss. Additionally Retinyl Palmate is a wonderful anti aging and anti acne ingredient rarely found in lip gloss. I tend to have blackheads around my lips-and I can honestly say I have never had a break out because of this product, and I attribute that to the formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a four and not a five because I think this product (usually about $18) is a little on the pricey side-although the tube is quite large and mine has lasted over a year!</li>
    <li> This color is fantastic! I&#x27;ve bought this color and brand 3 times already.  It even smells and tastes good which is a plus if you get kissed! It is shiny but not glittery.  I think it&#x27;s the perfect pout shine.  Btw: I have fair skin.</li>
    <li> I have the Buxom gloss in the color \\&quot;Tonya\\&quot; and I love how to color works - not too bright, but with good color payoff. The color lasts a loooong time, but I feel like the gloss is too sticky and the plumping effect burns my lips - so much that they stay red overnight and became chapped in the morning. I didn&#x27;t notice much plumping - just burning. I think the Too Faced Glamour gloss was a better option for me - less sticky and the plump does work without searing my lips.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product at Ulta in the past and loved it. Ulta is no longer carrying it,so I went with my staple for purchases lately;Amazon. It seems that the product has chanched after applying it two times I got the feeling and appearance of windburn on my lips. It took the problem about one week to heal. I had to use the Vaseline product for lips about twice daily for the week. It eased the discomfort while helping to resolve my problem. I,sadly,won&#x27;t be applying it again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister for her birthday she loved it.</li>
    <li> I used to purchase this in my hometown, but they quit carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;Checked on here and found it to be cheaper than what I had been paying.&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect. Not too darker or light. Have received a lot of compliments on the color since wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon. My favorite online store.</li>
