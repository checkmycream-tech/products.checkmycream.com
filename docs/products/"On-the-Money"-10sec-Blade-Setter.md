      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for now.  </li>
      <li>The blade doesnt fit securely in it and it slides.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, it&#x27;s just a smooth piece of plastic and the free razor is not useable.</li>

<li> now im back to setting all the other barber students trimmers to perfection .</li>
<li> your T-Trimmers , my only complaint is that I let another barber in my school use it and when it was returned the plastic piece that holds the back of the blade firm into the slot was partially broke , I am unsure if the problem was user error or if it was just a manufacturing deffect .</li>
<li> but it makes my edger to sharp it cuts me</li>
<li> br /&gt;It gives a sharp line with out cuttin the clients it works for kids too</li>
<li> I had to do it a few times.</li>
<li> My clippers went from cutting to snagging the hair and barely cuts.</li>
<li> Terrible product.</li>

    <li> I was happy to recieve it then when I did every step on the directions &amp; I tried it on myself &amp; it still bites. It left cuts on my neck(since the neck is the most sensitive). I used it to adjust my T Outliners. Just sticking to the Wahl Hero 5 Stars</li>
    <li> It works great to zero gap your T-Trimmers , my only complaint is that I let another barber in my school use it and when it was returned the plastic piece that holds the back of the blade firm into the slot was partially broke , I am unsure if the problem was user error or if it was just a manufacturing deffect . Either way I am still happy with the product , I put a few drops of superglue on it and now im back to setting all the other barber students trimmers to perfection . I highly recomend this product , plus the free MD Barber Suppy Razor alone is worth the price of the blade setter.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Revived it very fast. But it does not work. My clippers went from cutting to snagging the hair and barely cuts. Now I can&#x27;t get them set back correctly</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you I&#x27;m happy I got them now time to get the rest of them</li>
    <li> I had to do it a few times. The teeth on the blade sink into the plastic on the setter. I camt imagine getting much use out of this setter. Eventually the blades will carve a notch. A tougher material might fix it</li>
    <li> Greatly appreciate the product and that u were on point with the item. Love it</li>
    <li> The thing broke the very first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Works great. Only had to use one time and my blades are set to zero.</li>
    <li> It feels cheap and is made of thin plastic. It did work on my blades and I actually used it on my m3&#x27;s and super liners too. I just wish it was metal can&#x27;t really see the plastic lasting too long</li>
    <li> helps get clipper to zero gap</li>
    <li> I am in barber school and this setter came in very handy .great buy</li>
    <li> I love this tool and I got it way before it said it woul come good lookin to my boi chuka Torres and mdbarbersuppy&lt;br /&gt;It took me less the ten seconds to adjust my t outliner and my lines been more sharp and persist&lt;br /&gt;It gives a sharp line with out cuttin the clients it works for kids too</li>
    <li> Works Great, don&#x27;t care for the straight razor to much. But they both work well</li>
    <li> Good concept , better than the Andis zero gapper but it&#x27;s not going to get your blades good enough for a professional shave . I used brand new t trimmer blades</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for now.  I&#x27;m still playing around with it.</li>
    <li> The blade setter live up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the quality</li>
    <li> Used it but it makes my edger to sharp it cuts me</li>
    <li> Excellent. Thanks for the extra straight blade that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Like it a lot but didn&#x27;t receive the free blade</li>
    <li> The back piece that snaps the blade into place was too brittle and shattered the first time I used it. Nice concept but not a long lasting or quality product. I still thin the andis zero gapper is the best.</li>
    <li> It will do the job I guess but I think it cost too much for a small piece of plastic. It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture, it&#x27;s just a smooth piece of plastic and the free razor is not useable. The blade doesnt fit securely in it and it slides.</li>
