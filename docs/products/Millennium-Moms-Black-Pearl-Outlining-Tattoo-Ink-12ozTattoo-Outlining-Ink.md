<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very happy with this purchase.....100% authentic Moms !!!!....MFG date 1/2015 now that&#x27;s NEW &amp;  just as described !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Worst fu*** tattoo ink ever. It&#x27;s fake Don&#x27;t Buy. Most of these reviews are fake too.</li>
    <li> Best ink wish I would have bought it sooner</li>
    <li> Good for amateur tattoos.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Nothing damaged upon delivery. Very satisfied with purchase.</li>
    <li> As An Apprentice, Dude I Was Learning From Kept Stealing It.</li>
    <li> The item was received fast and I am very satisfied with it. The item received was the one I ordered. Thanks again for the great deal.</li>
    <li> Very good ink. But there was a typo on the expiration date. It says it expires the same month it was made.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good black ink. I believe there are better brands out there, but this is good for the price.</li>
    <li> Nice Consistency Great Bold Color... Goes into the skin nice &amp; easy. Also good as a base for making grey-washes.&lt;br /&gt;Mom&#x27;s Tattoo Inks pack a punch. They are loaded with pigment,Note if you are having problems with whites,yellows,greens. Mom&#x27;s is loaded with pigment. In my palette are Mom&#x27;s, Eternal, Star-Brite, Alla Prima, Arcane, Intenze Inks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Tip -How to Make Grey-Wash From Out Lining Ink, &amp; Grey Wash Methods&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several methods for making Grey Wash.. The best &amp; easiest IMO is the bulk method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You will need : a measuring cup &amp; or a medical syringe for measuring ounces. a mixing container, witch-hazel,sterile water,medical grade glycerin, rose water.  a Stirrer - a Sterile fork or cut the tip off a needle bar &amp; use that. 4 sterilized containers for the grey wash solution.  Another container to mix your Cutting Solution in, &amp; another small bottle to put the rest of this in. I like the Percentages Method. It is easy to grasp &amp; hard to F&#x27; up. So We will simplify it further by using a portion of the previous solution to make the next solution. This keeps every thing is half &amp; half ratio (ie) 50% + 50% Ok...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the largest amount will be the darkest to least amount the lightest shade.  Start out with black Out-Lining Ink, Mom&#x27;s Black Pearl, ia best or other out-lining ink.  Pre-Label Your Grey wash Bottles 50% Darkest Grey Black, 25% Dark Grey Black, 12% Medium Grey Black, 6% Light grey Black, 3% Lightest Grey Black.}  Mix for Cutting Solution,as follows witch-hazel, sterile water, medical grade glycerin, rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What each of these does: medical grade glycerin, thickens the mixture &amp; helps to keeps it moist &amp; helps deliver ink &amp; reduces bruising as well as reduces inflammation of the skin that causes scaliness, itching and rashes; rose water is a natural healer for the skin, helps prevent inflammation,anti-septic &amp; anti bacteria properties. witch-hazel : reduce puffiness in skin, reduce bruising,helps prevent itching, sooth irritated skin,it also has anti-septic &amp; anti bacteria properties.Sterile Water Medical Grade water, no bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe for * { Bill&#x27;s Miracle Solution \\&quot; } *  Mix Cutting Solution: 45% Water 50% witch-hazel 5% rose water. &amp; a few drops of  medical grade glycerin,This is your Cutting Solution (ie) Diluting agent. \\&quot; Bill&#x27;S Miracle Water \\&quot; This can also be used on top of ink caps when doing color work to prevent ink from drying out. Also in ink bottles that are starting to crystallize, the \\&quot; Bill&#x27;s Miracle Solution will bring them back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Place in Container &amp;  Mark  \\&quot; Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution.\\&quot;  Now For the washes: 50% Black Out-Lining Ink 50% Cutting Solution. Next mix fill container labeled 50% Darkest Black Grey. with the rest yes mix more (ie) 50% more than the next bottle size. Measure out 50% of this &amp; add 50% cutting Solution. Place part of that in the bottle labeled 25%Dark Black grey.  Next Measure out 50% of this &amp; add 50% cutting Solution.Place in the bottle marked 12% Medium Black Grey.With the rest :Measure out 50% of this &amp; add 50% cutting Solution. Fill the bottle marked 6% Light Black Grey. Measure out 50% of this &amp; add 50% cutting Solution. Place this in the bottle Labeled 3% Lightest Black Grey. Now You have some bottles pre mixed of your washes. Plus Your Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. You can fill a caps of this when doing grey washes as well as use it either on top of colors in the ink caps or in them. This helps prevent inks from drying out. only a drop or 2 is needed. You can also add this to your Sterile Water Cup at your station for washing out your tube. Only a few drops. Do Not for Get to also fill a cap or 2 of solid black out-lining ink when doing grey wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Next method Direct Drop Ink Cap. several ways 2 drops 4 drops etc.. Here is an Easy one: Have your  Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution Mix as above. Place 1 drop out-lining ink in an ink cap fill rest with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution.  Next 2 drops out-lining ink in an ink cap fill rest with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution.out-lining ink in an ink cap fill rest with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. Next . Place 3 drops out-lining ink in an ink cap fill rest with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. . Place 4 drops out-lining ink in an ink cap fill rest with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. Again do not forget to fill one cap with straight black out-lining ink. &amp; one with Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. NOTE: Large Ink Caps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These Next Methods are advanced &amp; should not be attempted until you have a firm grip on the black &amp; grey wash system. Some Artist just do it in the tube mixing between Black &amp; Bill&#x27;s Miracle Cutting Solution. or Sterile Water. Some Mist the skin with a spray bottle filled with Sterile Water or  Distilled Water. Again  Sterile Water is better &amp; in NY is the only water allowed. I&#x27;am in Maryland but use the Sterile Water. &amp; with a combination of mixing in the tube between black &amp; water &amp; water on skin &amp; reduced stretching of the skin &amp; or reduced needle depth &amp; or increased hand speed. Achieve a grey wash. You will see a lot of Traditional Japanese Tattoo artist use this method &amp; they apply it to color inks as well. Some Artist Just use the Color Black &amp; The Color Grey to achieve a grey wash effect. You can also use different companies blacks to create a grey wash effect.(ie) Tonal Value. Darkest to Lightest in the Brands. These all work.It is an individual preference.  Although you not gain the respect of traditional black &amp; grey artist un-less you can use a grey wash system. { Not the Black &amp; Grey Color Ink }&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Note: their are several pre made washes: Eternal ink&#x27;s : Marshall Bennett Grey Wash System. Intenze ink&#x27;s : Mark Mahoney&#x27;s Gangster Grey, &amp; Bob Tyrrell Advanced black &amp; grey. Alla-Prima- Black Works a black &amp; grey system.  Silver Back&#x27;s Black &amp; Grey Washes. Next a new Company Fat Boy Ink. They Have a Cool Grey Wash System. I have not as of yet used their inks so I can not say from experience here. However I have spoken with the owner of the company &amp; it is rather unique formula. he worked with several medical doctors &amp; scientist as well as a chemist. For his inks &amp; carrier solutions. That sounds cool especially since he said they have a ingredient in them used on cancer patients to promote healing.  Next thing I liked about them was they are using a artist&#x27;s grey scale the 5 Shades of Grey.{  the 5 shades of grey scale, look it up on google etc. There should be a few color charts on art sites. } He also has a few educational videos on tattooing on his site. He uses a reverse method if you will. By this I mean he first does his lighter areas then moves to his darker areas. For Him this works. Remember each artist has his or her way of doing things. Once You know the rules &amp; can preform the work. Then you can bend &amp; even break the rules. I think his method would actually be better for beginners. Since you can always go darker but you can not go lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Superior Tattoo Supply Has a video on its site &amp; on its you-tube channel on black &amp; grey shading. Note the Whip Shading. This use to be called called sweeping. Some Artist work in small circles from wrist, some like siring cake-batter involve the arm. Almost like an artist with a brush this creates an oval or oblong pattern. Remember tight small ovals or circles. There is also cross hatching, back &amp; forth then up &amp; then up &amp; down. Like Cross Hatch Shading in Drawing. Then you have the scrubbing motion. a back &amp; forth motion. Most use circles. The best can do all prefer a few methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To me black &amp; grey should be mastered before color. It lays the foundation of light &amp; dark &amp; variations in-between. Read Art Books Learn Shading. Take up graphite pencil drawing. This will all help. Joshua Carlton does black &amp; grey in each portrait &amp; then lays the color down over it to create depth. then Nikko Hurtado, does itby placing the colors in small areas &amp; then blending them. Different Methods Both work. Bob Ross &amp; Bill Alexander Painters, Painted Alla-Prima @ once They would do as in paintings  Nikko Hurtado does in color tattoos. All at once They finished a painting in a single pass. Then you have Artist - Paul Targgert &amp; Jim Mc Vicker&#x27;s, They paint in a multiple pass system laying under-tones first than gradually adding layers to the painting. { Layers in a painting means once dry 1 layer } They use up to 12 Layers. Ross &amp; Alexander used 1 layer. Both are correct. Just a different approach. Look up The artist Paul Seurat- his style of painting is like tattooing. small dots &amp; dashes close together in order to form a picture. One More thing white can be used on some pieces of Black &amp; Grey Wash to create Highlights. Just a little.  Next :  FREE EDUCATION on Grey Wash Technique. You Tube Channel:TattooSuperior 1 Has 2 Good Videos Grey-Wash.  **  Good Luck !  Bill  **m. I have not as of yet used their inks so I can not say from experience here.

Note the Whip Shading. This use to be called called sweeping. Some Artist work in small circles from wrist, some like siring cake-batter involve the arm. Almost like an artist with a brush this creates an oval or oblong pattern. Remember tight small ovals or circles. There is also cross hatching, back &amp; forth then up &amp; then up &amp; down. Like Cross Hatch Shading in Drawing. Then you have the scrubbing motion. a back &amp; forth motion. Most use circles. The best can do all prefer a few methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; To me black &amp; grey should be mastered before color. It lays the foundation of light &amp; dark &amp; variations in-between. Read Art Books Learn Shading. Take up graphite pencil drawing. This will all help. Joshua Carlton does black &amp; grey in each portrait &amp; then lays the color down over it to create depth. then Nikko Hurtado, does itby placing the colors in small areas &amp; then blending them. Different Methods Both work. Bob Ross &amp; Bill Alexander Painters, Painted Alla-Prima @ once They would do as in paintings  Nikko Hurtado does in color tattoos. All at once They finished a painting in a single pass. Then you have Artist - Paul Targgert &amp; Jim Mc Vicker&#x27;s, They paint in a multiple pass system laying under-tones first than gradually adding layers to the painting. { Layers in a painting means once dry 1 layer } They use up to 12 Layers. Ross &amp; Alexander used 1 layer. Both are correct. Just a different approach. Look up The artist Paul Seurat- his style of painting is like tattooing. small dots &amp; dashes close together in order to form a picture.

    <li> fantastic, excellent product. I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy something of quality ..</li>
    <li> Normally my shop has run Kuro Sumi outliner.... I was in process of ordering a 12 ounce bottle of black, now normally I get my equipment from my suppliers, but some of them require 100 dollar order, others are less, but I find when I need just 1 or 2 things to hold me over till I make a big order it&#x27;s easier to order here.  So when I went to order the Kuro Sumi I saw the Mom&#x27;s liner was only 2 dollars more for the same size.  I&#x27;ve loved every ink I&#x27;ve ever used from Millenium, this was no exception.  Needless to say that for black outliner I&#x27;ll be ordering strictly MOMS Black Pearl it&#x27;s noticeably better quality.</li>
