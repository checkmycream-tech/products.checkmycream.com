      <li>Overall good product.</li>
      <li>This looks phenomenal over ANY saturated polish color --- my fave of the moment is a classic bright red.  </li>
      <li>The different shapes and sizes of the &amp;#34;glitters&amp;#34; make for a very interesting look.  </li>
      <li>IT IS MY NEW FAVORITE, GOES WITH EVERYTHING.</li>
      <li>It dried quickly, and was a good, easy to apply polish.</li>
      <li>The application is fairly easy considering that it is really chunky.</li>
      <li>Buyer was great, but nail polish was more clear than chunks of black and silver</li>
      <li>Not very thick, but you don&#x27;t have to fight to get the speckles out like most of these types of polishes.</li>
      <li>It really gives off an 8o&#x27;s look especially over bright colors.</li>
      <li>Just so fun and festive, and anytime I wear it, I get a ton of compliments.</li>

      <li>Coat it on top of a solid color</li>
      <li>At first I thought this would be a problem</li>
      <li>This top coat is so pretty it has various shapes and gives the impression of an adorable Asian motif I think.</li>
      <li>With many different shapes.  </li>
      <li>But the black and white looks great too if you put it with the right colors!</li>
      <li>goes great over neon colors like yellow and pink.</li>

      <li>That&#x27;s just how fast it was.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be very versatile</li>
      <li>Once it on, nails feel very roughy and even snags on material.</li>
      <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
      <li>very well* for being a chunky glitter with bars.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This polish looks great on so many different colors. Very versatile and fun! I would recommend this one for your nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Buyer was great, but nail polish was more clear than chunks of black and silver</li>
    <li> goes great over neon colors like yellow and pink. theres different size glitters in it . looks very cute like you put alot of effort in it when all you do is put a coat over the color you want and your done . that simple.</li>
    <li> I tried this out over an orange base, and it&#x27;s going to be a perfect Halloween polish.  The different shapes and sizes of the &amp;#34;glitters&amp;#34; make for a very interesting look.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This maybe my fault but from the picture I thought the chunks were more of a charcoal color. But the black and white looks great too if you put it with the right colors! I like using it with a teal or a bright purple! (:</li>
    <li> Horrible!  Very hard to put on, you almost have to dab it on to place more evenly. Once it on, nails feel very roughy and even snags on material. Don&#x27;t even like the look, almost looks like a child&#x27;s arts and craft project.  Don&#x27;t like anything about it and I usually love everything about China Glaze polishes but this was disappointing!</li>
    <li> Very pretty! The only thing like any other glitter polish, It&#x27;s a task to remove! Other than that, the dots are so cute. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This polish is pretty good.  You need at least 2-3 coats to really make it pop like it should.  I have a different polish from a woman in Indiana that actually makes her own and it&#x27;s similar to this one.  I like the other one better but this is a back up if I run out of the other!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get any of the white dots/pieces to get on the brush, so I&#x27;m disappointed with the product because I can&#x27;t use as intended.</li>
    <li> This polish is super pretty in the bottle, but not as pretty on the nail. I still like it a lot though and I&#x27;ll use it sometimes too!</li>
    <li> I learned how much I hate bar glitter with this polish. Its ok I just have a hard time with the bar glitters in it.</li>
    <li> China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.</li>
    <li> In order to get more than a single piece of glitter on my nails, I had to gloooooop it on really thick. In the end it worked out, but kind of a pain. I wish there was more glitter!!!</li>
    <li> This China Glaze color is amazing a must have for any polish addict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resembles what the indie companies are trying to do with their polish lines in terms of glitter.</li>
    <li> Ugly and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> I love China Glaze nail polish, it&#x27;s one of my top go to polishes. I gave this one a 4 out of 5 because it found it a little hard to get a good coat on. You have to kind of place them yourself.</li>
    <li> Creates pretty designs over a solid color. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was very excited that the product arrived in my mailbox earlier than expected but I was not satisfied with the product at all. I like the colors of the glitter a lot, but there is hardly any glitter in the bottle at all. It seems very diluted with clear nail polish. Not happy :(</li>
    <li> When you read the other reviews about how difficult this is to apply ----- OMG,listen to them and don&#x27;t get this.  It does not apply evenly and on top of that there are pieces that stick up here and there and they are difficult to flatten out --- even AFTER you apply a top coat it still snags on things and snags certain fabric like thin leggings.  I would not recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> Really interesting, trying to figure out how to use it</li>
    <li> I bought this polish because I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. I love this! I always get asked what I am wearing and it is very easy to apply over a color.</li>
    <li> Did not get the results I was hoping for.  The glitter is big as shown, as I wanted.  But only received one or two per application.  Kept it, but went to the store to purchase actual glitter to be applied.</li>
    <li> This is a top coat which I was not aware of until I got it. I guess it could be used alone. It is cute and fun to use. You can use any color as a base and put this polish over it. It is a clear topcoat with these small plastic white and black circles and different geometric shapes. I love it. Also is like the glitter polish when removing it so you have to soak it a little to get them images off. I had to come back and add a note to this. I found the second time I used this it did not work as well. Hard to get the plastic pieces on the brush. For that reason I lowered it to 3 stars. Worked nicely the first use. Now seems to be settled on the sides and bottom. You have to dig for the pieces to get them on the nail.</li>
    <li> I adore the effect of the mixed glitter shapes - you never know what you&#x27;re going to end up with on each nail. I will mention however that it takes about two coats to get an even application of glitter on all of your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore two coats of this over &#x27;For Audrey&#x27;, another polish by China Glaze, and the glitter contrasts beautifully against the light blue! Will definitely purchase again once I run out.</li>
    <li> Despite the other reviews, I really actually like this polish. It really gives off an 8o&#x27;s look especially over bright colors. Not very thick, but you don&#x27;t have to fight to get the speckles out like most of these types of polishes.</li>
    <li> One of my first China Glazes and I am not disappointed! It&#x27;s smooth and comes with a good amount of small black hex &amp; bar glitter, with the occasional large white hex. Easy application and good coverage! Perfect for artsy designs!</li>
    <li> China Glaze Whirled Away is a great nail polish. I don&#x27;t use it alone but rather over another polish. Looks great over a color and not black</li>
    <li> I love nail polish. This was just another item to add to the many I already have. Black and white &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; comes out well. Personally I definitely think this needs a bottom coat under it. I like it best over pale pink or white.</li>
    <li> especially when worn over a bright contrasting color.  This top coat is so pretty it has various shapes and gives the impression of an adorable Asian motif I think.</li>
    <li> Very pretty in the bottle but hard to apply to have it look like it looks in the bottle. That being said, I am a huge fan of China Glaze nail polishes. They have a great variety of color and seem to last longer on my nails.</li>
    <li> Various sizes of black and white hex shapes, bars and dots, whirled away in a clear lacquer.  Fun in a bottle.  Looks great when applied over a candy red apple, sparkling nail color.  Works best when pick shapes out and apply with a stylus or orange stick before brushing on.  Thick consistency works to level out chunks.  Like confetti for nails.</li>
    <li> it reminds me of those indie polishes everyone is crazy about. mine came with a bit missing but its ok. if you are unsure of what a polish will look like go to google and search up swatches. not that hard</li>
    <li> It cannot be seen if you paint over black unless you get a lot of the white hexagons on the brush, in response to a previous comment.. Better looking to paint over lighter colors or just on plain nail.  It unique at its competition nothing like a plain glitter, gives nail a new kind of look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this got any good reviews.  It&#x27;s really ugly.  I thought I would love it but it appears (even in person) to have a black or dark base.  It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a clear base.  The only way you could pull this off is over an neon color to do a 80&#x27;s-90&#x27;s style nail.  It&#x27;s got black and white hex pieces, some strip glitter, small glitter...it&#x27;s just too all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you google this color you can see some images of it on people.  Check them out because I know I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because I have so many specialty top coats and finishes, but I am so glad I did!  This looks phenomenal over ANY saturated polish color --- my fave of the moment is a classic bright red.  Applies *very well* for being a chunky glitter with bars.  You get a nice randomness with the glitters.  The base is crystal clear so it doesn&#x27;t change your base color.  Not too lumpy when dries, only requires a single top coat.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice polish. I enjoy the chunky glitter flakes. They are huge! At first I thought this would be a problem but it really wasn&#x27;t. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS POLISH IT IS MY NEW FAVORITE, GOES WITH EVERYTHING. PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY OR A NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN. THIS PRODUCT IS A MUST BUY.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t want just a color on your nails and you&#x27;re not good with sticker decals, gems, or fancy nail art? One coat of this and you get something awesome without a lot of effort! It&#x27;s a great umf for your nails.</li>
    <li> The glitter polish is gorgeous and me being as good as I am with nails I Know the secrets to getting hard polishes on to the brush. It looked exactly like pictured here which I was super happy about. And even though the product itself only gets 4 stars the seller however gets 5 stars from me. It shipped to me in 2 days and that wasn&#x27;t even me picking a different shipping option. That&#x27;s just how fast it was. I was super happy about that. Overall good product. I like it!</li>
    <li> I do like this polish but its hard to get the flecks onto your nails.</li>
    <li> Cute and adorable. Almost looks like nail art over pastel and bright nail colors. Got it for a lower price.</li>
    <li> Such a fun polish topper. Goes great over neon colors especially. (PS if you are new to buying beauty products on line go to Google type in the product name along with \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; or \\&quot;review\\&quot;, and click Images. And save yourself some trouble :D)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great deal! You have to use a good base color before using this product. I used a red and it turned out great.</li>
    <li> This is a very beautiful chunky glitter.  With many different shapes.  Yes, the white glitter takes a little bit of work to get out, but that comes with the territory.</li>
    <li> This is another China Glaze color I am happy to have in my collection. I&#x27;ve found it to be very versatile - I&#x27;ve worn it over bright pinks and yellows for a neon 80s inspired look, and also over maroons and deeper reds for a fun pop over a sophisticated &amp;#34;work friendly&amp;#34; mani. It&#x27;s a chunky mix of black and white large hexes, bar glitter, and smaller pieces, all in black and white. For people complaining that it was difficult to apply and that lots of &amp;#34;Fishing&amp;#34; was required to get glitter out - try setting the polish bottle upside-down for a few minutes, or shaking it upside-down gently. Some difficulty comes with the territory in glitter polish placement, but it wasn&#x27;t hard for me to get out a fair amount on the brush at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a chip resistant polish, it lasted 3 days on me with no topcoat - and I&#x27;m hard on my hands! It dried quickly, and was a good, easy to apply polish. I use 2 coats.</li>
    <li> Looks great over literally any color. Just so fun and festive, and anytime I wear it, I get a ton of compliments.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this after seeing it swatched at the mall. It takes so many coats to even get a substantial amount of the flakes onto your nails, so that bummed me out a little bit. It&#x27;s also really hard to remove. I like it, but I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
    <li> The white specks don&#x27;t come out often so I usually end up with only one nail having one white dot on it which looks very weird....</li>
    <li> Bought this from Ulta, not Amazon. Thought I&#x27;d write a review here. I put this over a dark grey polish and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. Design polish includes large white dots, like a 6 sided shape (sectagon?), small black dots and black lines. Only complaint is a couple of the lines peeled off a little, but this polish is definetely worth getting and I highly reccommend it. It&#x27;s cute but not too childish, like glitter.</li>
    <li> Wow---I feel that the photo is a complete misrepresentation of the actual product. In the photo, the polish looks black with silver confetti. Had I read the one review that was written after my purchase, I would have known better; alas, it was not there at the time of my purchase. In reality, the polish is clear, and the confetti is not silver, it&#x27;s black and white. It is every bit as disappointing as the previous reviewer states, but I have to say that to me, it simply looks like dirt specks on otherwise unpainted nails--in a word: GROSS! I wrote to Beautyland to ask for a refund, so we shall see if they are customer oriented. Given that the photo is completely different from what the polish actually looks like (I have no idea how it appears black and silver in the photo), they should have provided a description. My experience with them will follow...in the meantime, this polish is a big FAIL!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like a dandelion was blown all over my finger tips. Looks great with any bases color. Yay yeah review yeah!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  My girls love it and it truly dresses up any plain nail polish.  Coat it on top of a solid color and it&#x27;s brilliant!</li>
    <li> I love it best glitter polish ever I was looking for a chunky polish like that n I finally found it  it&#x27;s looks a lot like one of the indie polish but I love it I really recommended</li>
    <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this based on so many bad reviews I read mostly on nail blogs but I caved in the end and I am glad I did! The application is fairly easy considering that it is really chunky. There was some fishing required but it was minimal. I experienced  some bubbling that I attribute to the fact that I tried placing the glitters instead of just painting like you normally would. Next time I will try a different tecnique. But this is so gorgeous on the nail that even with bubbles I loved it. I love how indie it looks. If you are on the fence about getting this, I&#x27;d say give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I really like this polish however you really have to work at getting the white glitter out of the bottle. I resorted to using a tooth pick to place the glitter.</li>
