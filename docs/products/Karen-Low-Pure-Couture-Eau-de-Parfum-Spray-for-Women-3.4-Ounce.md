      <li>He told me this would be a one time thing, of course, but I just have to commend Amazon on their excellent customer service, as I&#x27;ve never had a business go above and beyond to help me like that!&lt;br /</li>

      <li>Well, I realized it was actually the Pure Crystal I liked better</li>
      <li>and I knew I liked one more than the other) and it looked like the correct packaging judging by the photo.</li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t believe I could have gotten such a better deal on it!</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed the Pure Couture and Pure Crystal on my wrists I thought the clerk misheard me as they had a very strong &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
      <li>but it was SUPER early so its not a bad thing</li>
      <li>I first smelled this fragrance in the mall.  </li>
      <li>it is exactly what I want</li>
      <li>stay clear from this cheap knock off</li>
      <li>Smells exactly like juicy couture.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and much cheaper compared to if I buy from regular store.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Pure Couture  </li>
      <li>Resigning myself to just wearing the Pure Couture instead, I was about to thank the Amazon employee for his time and hang up when he told me that although he couldn&#x27;t exchange it for me, he would refund my money and I could purchase the correct item and just keep the one</li>
      <li>Cost 4 to 5 times as much in retail.  </li>
      <li>It is very feminine.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend originally purchased this for me for a birthday present and not only did he like the smell (always important)</li>
      <li>Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it wears off too quickly.</li>

      <li>I love this scent and its usually out of stock everywhere...</li>
      <li>Pure Crystal for day, and Pure Couture for night, and Amazon now has a lifelong customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
      <li>Same as in the store, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last so much.</li>
      <li>Amazon.com also offers gift wrapping and a card telling you who has sent your gift.  </li>
      <li>A couple hours later, I got a whiff of something that smelled like heaven while sitting at my desk at work, and it turns out that after sitting on my skin a few minutes, the Karen Low perfumes had reacted to my body chemistry and smelled good enough to</li>
      <li>I went to my local perfume wholesaler to purchase my usual Ralph by Ralph Lauren but asked if there may be any other perfumes with a nice clean, not powdery scent and the salesperson recommended the Karen Low collection.  </li>

      <li>Not great quality, smell goes away very quickly.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, I was shocked and very happy, and upon hanging up immediately ordered the Pure Crystal perfume.  </li>

    <li> My boyfriend originally purchased this for me for a birthday present and not only did he like the smell (always important) but I did also. My mom asked me what perfume I was wearing because she loved the smell as well so I purchased this to gift to her. Long lasting and you don&#x27;t need to reapply through out the day. One time spray will last you hours!</li>
    <li> Great product and the fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas and my mom loved it. She has asked for her own bottle. Haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very soft and feminine fragrance. Very beautiful bottle. And wonderful for such a low price!</li>

    <li> My other fragrance was discontinued and I was on the search for a soft scent that was not over powering.  This was it!  I love it!</li>
    <li> If you like sweet-smelling perfumes, you will probably like this! It is WONderful, and this is a great price for it, too!!</li>
    <li> Regarding the time of delivery...i was expecting it to arrive after xmas but it was SUPER early so its not a bad thing AT ALL that i got it earlier than i anticipated....I love this scent and its usually out of stock everywhere...I have gotten several compliments from passersby (all male) that i have assisted in finding the perfect gift for their significant others because they love the scent...5 STARS all day for this one Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I went to my local perfume wholesaler to purchase my usual Ralph by Ralph Lauren but asked if there may be any other perfumes with a nice clean, not powdery scent and the salesperson recommended the Karen Low collection.  When I first sprayed the Pure Couture and Pure Crystal on my wrists I thought the clerk misheard me as they had a very strong &amp;#34;baby powder&amp;#34; smell.  I bought my Ralph Lauren and went on my way.  A couple hours later, I got a whiff of something that smelled like heaven while sitting at my desk at work, and it turns out that after sitting on my skin a few minutes, the Karen Low perfumes had reacted to my body chemistry and smelled good enough to eat!&lt;br /&gt;  I immediately went on Amazon, and imagine my surprise when I discovered that although they were going to be $59.00 at the &amp;#34;wholesale store&amp;#34;, Amazon had them for $15.00!  I purchased the Pure Couture  (I couldn&#x27;t remember which perfume was which on my wrists and I knew I liked one more than the other) and it looked like the correct packaging judging by the photo. Well, I realized it was actually the Pure Crystal I liked better once I received it and sprayed it.&lt;br /&gt;  I called Amazon to see if I could exchange, and was informed they couldn&#x27;t accept opened perfumes ( I didn&#x27;t think they would but thought I&#x27;d try).  Resigning myself to just wearing the Pure Couture instead, I was about to thank the Amazon employee for his time and hang up when he told me that although he couldn&#x27;t exchange it for me, he would refund my money and I could purchase the correct item and just keep the one I had!&lt;br /&gt;  He told me this would be a one time thing, of course, but I just have to commend Amazon on their excellent customer service, as I&#x27;ve never had a business go above and beyond to help me like that!&lt;br /&gt;  Needless to say, I was shocked and very happy, and upon hanging up immediately ordered the Pure Crystal perfume.  I am in love with both; Pure Crystal for day, and Pure Couture for night, and Amazon now has a lifelong customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I ordered these perfumes from Amazon and shipped by Amazon, not a 3rd party seller</li>
    <li> it is exactly what I want</li>
    <li> nice soft pleasurable scent</li>
    <li> The Best Parfum Ever!!! I Love it!!! Buy iy from Monterrey México</li>
    <li> A bit more of an evening smell.  I&#x27;ve received compliments from females, but my boyfriend says it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The price was awesome. I get so many compliments about this perfume.  The scent is perfect its not too strong and it has a great blend of scents.</li>
    <li> This was just great. The bottle was larger than I thought. It came on time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive perfume that smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Bought it as a gift for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;Sells at malls for triple the price. Definitely will by again!!!</li>
