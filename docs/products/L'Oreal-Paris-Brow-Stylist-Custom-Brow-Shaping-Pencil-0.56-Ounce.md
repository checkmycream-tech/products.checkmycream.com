      <li>very easy to make up.</li>
      <li>Excellent price compared to my local store.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>Paid way more in the store and then saw this one on Amazon and decided to keep spare.</li>
      <li>so I have to clean it when I use it as to not get pencil shavings throughout my makeup bag and honestly can&#x27;t even remember how they wore/lasted</li>
      <li>actually was very good.</li>
      <li>Great color for lighter brown complexion and for those who need a red prominent tone.  </li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t apply smoothly and pull on the skin during application.</li>
      <li>Sharpens well and that is important.  </li>
      <li>compact and very useful for styling my brows.</li>
      <li>These colors are nice because they are pretty close to the color of natural marks like freckles.</li>
      <li>Glides on easily and looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt look natural and comes off easy</li>
      <li>I would definitely buy more when i do run out.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly but not so soft it wipes off.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t opened it because I haven&#x27;t finished the first one.  </li>
      <li>This color is more red than I need, but I will buy the dark brown set and combine the darker of the two pencils with the dark brown set to make the best match for the L&#x27;Oreal brow pencil I used to use that is discontinued, Espresso.  </li>
      <li>This makes a clean point and no waste in the sharpening process.  </li>
      <li>I like the fact that it comes with two shades so they can be blended to look real.</li>
      <li>It works really well on eyebrows and makes your eyes Pop-POW out.  </li>
      <li>The colors were not compatible with each other, so I wound up using only one and the color still wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
      <li>This product may work for someone, but not for me, the color was not right and it did not glide on easy.</li>
      <li>The color looks natural and distributes evenly and hasnt smudged or anything from me scratching my eyebrow area.</li>
      <li>it is a natural fill in between or extend the end of brow pencil without looking drawn on.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than in the local stores.</li>
      <li>Natural brown.  </li>

<li> Natural brown.  </li>
<li> The pencils themselves are short and do not last long, the sharpener isn&#x27;t encased in anything</li>
<li> gives a soft subtle eyebrow that looks realistic.</li>
<li> I use the darker medium brown one with the dark blonde pencil and these really work and are not too harsh looking.</li>
<li> I found the pencils to be quite dry.</li>
<li> I recommend it to anyone with dark blonde to medium brown eyebrows.  </li>
<li> I heard that brow pencils tend to smear less and last longer than eye liners.</li>
<li> This works as i expected it to.</li>
<li> I was initially a little disappointed in how small the pencils are, but the color is really easy to put on and it&#x27;s well worth the few dollars!</li>
<li> The sections of the makeup that were down my neck did wear off by the end of the day but those sections were also rubbing on clothes.</li>
<li> Have purchased brow pencils when you sharpen the wood grinds down and the pencil crumbles away.  </li>
<li> I buy these whenever I run out, they are an everyday staple in my cosmetics.</li>
<li> U have to press down hard to get any color</li>
<li> their a little too hard for me.</li>
<li> The color isn&#x27;t the fake red brown</li>
<li> At least it wasn&#x27;t an expensive purchase</li>

    <li> The colors were not compatible with each other, so I wound up using only one and the color still wasn&#x27;t good.  The pencils themselves are short and do not last long, the sharpener isn&#x27;t encased in anything so I have to clean it when I use it as to not get pencil shavings throughout my makeup bag and honestly can&#x27;t even remember how they wore/lasted/went on because I was frankly just trying to use it up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  It works really well on eyebrows and makes your eyes Pop-POW out.  Who needs eyeshadow?!  I recommend it to anyone with dark blonde to medium brown eyebrows.  :-D</li>
    <li> The tip of the pencils were broken,plus it looked like the package had been open and then taped shut. Would never order these again on-line. Look at the product in person before buying. At least it wasn&#x27;t an expensive purchase</li>
    <li> I actually bought these to do some costume makeup. I heard that brow pencils tend to smear less and last longer than eye liners. They did a good job. The sections of the makeup that were down my neck did wear off by the end of the day but those sections were also rubbing on clothes. The sections on my face lasted all day. These colors are nice because they are pretty close to the color of natural marks like freckles.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Perfect color.  Glides on easily and looks very natural.  That is a &amp;#34;must have.&amp;#34;  AAAA</li>
    <li> their a little too hard for me. U have to press down hard to get any color</li>
    <li> The product arrived within the stated amount of time.  Excellent price compared to my local store.  This color is more red than I need, but I will buy the dark brown set and combine the darker of the two pencils with the dark brown set to make the best match for the L&#x27;Oreal brow pencil I used to use that is discontinued, Espresso.  Great color for lighter brown complexion and for those who need a red prominent tone.  I recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> This works as i expected it to. Comes in a light brown and darker brown color and also came with a very handy pencil sharpener. The color looks natural and distributes evenly and hasnt smudged or anything from me scratching my eyebrow area. I would definitely buy more when i do run out.</li>

    <li> Doesnt look natural and comes off easy</li>

    <li> Thank you L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetic... I like your products... good job..</li>
    <li> Natural brown.  Goes on smoothly but not so soft it wipes off.  Sharpens well and that is important.  Have purchased brow pencils when you sharpen the wood grinds down and the pencil crumbles away.  This makes a clean point and no waste in the sharpening process.  The color isn&#x27;t the fake red brown it is a natural fill in between or extend the end of brow pencil without looking drawn on.  This is my second purchase.  I haven&#x27;t opened it because I haven&#x27;t finished the first one.  Paid way more in the store and then saw this one on Amazon and decided to keep spare.</li>
    <li> I was initially a little disappointed in how small the pencils are, but the color is really easy to put on and it&#x27;s well worth the few dollars!</li>
    <li> This product may work for someone, but not for me, the color was not right and it did not glide on easy.</li>
    <li> This is good quality product. My friend use it and she is very glad with it. This pencils don&#x27;t liks and even - pencil sharpener as a gift. Great!</li>
    <li> I use the darker medium brown one with the dark blonde pencil and these really work and are not too harsh looking. gives a soft subtle eyebrow that looks realistic. I buy these whenever I run out, they are an everyday staple in my cosmetics.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as I wanted</li>
