      <li>Stings a little, but is nice and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any lines being diminished though.</li>
      <li>I purchased another eye cream on Amazon and much preferred the results.</li>
      <li>At least the price is good.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes or make them itch and burn like most other products.</li>
      <li>I was not sure if this eye cream will be any good especially for the price</li>

      <li>but it works almost as good as my expensive eye cream.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results as far as wrinkles with this eye cream, though it does seem to moisturize well enough.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; gives a slight cooling effect when first applied.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed, but my skin is very dry, so although the eye cream did its job, I find that my skin was very dry in that area.</li>
      <li>The skin around my eyes is very dry, and I have spent a lot of money on very fancy eye creams that didn&#x27;t work too well.  </li>

    <li> Under eyes are moist and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a positive change when using this product. I purchased another eye cream on Amazon and much preferred the results. I like the natural ingredients of this product but it doesn&#x27;t perform as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results as far as wrinkles with this eye cream, though it does seem to moisturize well enough. It&#x27;s as good or better than others I have used, but nothing extra special. At least the price is good.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if this eye cream will be any good especially for the price but it works almost as good as my expensive eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have used the eye cream for only 3 days.  It is too soon to tell if it will help diminish all the lines around the eyes, forehead, and lips.  Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Yes,  I would recommend you try this eye cream.  It is natural, not made with chemicals!</li>
    <li> Light, creamy and absorbs quickly.  Would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love the way this product goes on - not greasy - smooths into the skin.  Great value&lt;br /&gt;for the price and works better than my last expensive brand.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, it does what it says it does and it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin around my eyes or make them itch and burn like most other products.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, but my skin is very dry, so although the eye cream did its job, I find that my skin was very dry in that area. But, it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, and it works!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I use on my eye lids.  I had a upper eye lift, a few years ago, and with out this product, the dryness around my eyes, brothers me.  I use this product everyday, and makes the top of my eyes, feel great</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes is very dry, and I have spent a lot of money on very fancy eye creams that didn&#x27;t work too well.  I read about this in a magazine, and decided to try it.  I found that it does a better job of lubricating the skin around my eyes than some of the very expensive name-brand products that i have purchased.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t cake up or leave a residue, as some of the other brands do.  Will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> I used this for only three days &amp; I swear I see a noticeable improvement already! My eyes are VERY sensitive to EVERYTHING and this does not bother me at all. I wear it under my makeup too. It&#x27;s not greasy &amp; gives a slight cooling effect when first applied. I absolutely love this stuff!  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I noticed absolutely no different from this product. It was also watery and did not easily absorb into my skin. I threw it out after using half of the bottle.</li>
    <li> This is a nice cream.  I don&#x27;t know if it &#x27;does anything&#x27; for me in the long term, I just want moisturizing that won&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and this fits the bill just fine!</li>
    <li> An excellent product!!!</li>
    <li> I have mature skin, so this may work for a person looking for a lightweight product for young skin. It is non-greasy, absorbs quickly but does not really do a thing for fine wrinkles or other aging issues. Also, the tip &amp;#34;plugs&amp;#34; up and dries though cap is on and it is used daily. Nothing wrong with it, just not enough for my skin.</li>
    <li> Stings a little, but is nice and moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any lines being diminished though.</li>
    <li> I am updating my review because I&#x27;m ordering another bottle of this eye cream. Perhaps I was premature in my findings but after using this eye cream for almost four months, I have to admit my skin looks great around the eyes and I am about to turn 60! I have tried all the major department store serums and creams that cost over 40.00 and this is just as good. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this! Plus it lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I have not found a Nature&#x27;s Gate product that I did not love</li>
