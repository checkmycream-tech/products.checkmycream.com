      <li>I Have tried many Mascaras and intill</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I took off one star was because I feel like this mascara does give you awesome length on the lashes, but it does not give volume.</li>
      <li>I like most of this, but it takes the curl out of my lashes, and should be reapplied during the day.  </li>
      <li>MOST WILL FADE AT THE TIP, NOT THIS ONE.  </li>
      <li>I love Mary Kay products and have been using those products for years.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this product that i will not wear anything</li>
      <li>this day i have not found a mascara i like more than this one.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better mascaras I have used.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara...</li>
      <li>This one is the best, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
      <li>I have been on a quest for a long time for the perfect mascara.  </li>
      <li>I received this very quickly and love how it makes my lashes nice and full.  </li>
      <li>This mascara is my favorite - no clumps, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You might find it that mid-use the brush starts to get sticky, all you need to do is clean it with water and make-up remover!</li>
      <li>This product has some issues with clumping and does not have a brush that is easy to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The brush needs to be redesigned and the formula redone to correct this product.  </li>
      <li>Removes easily.  </li>
      <li>It comes off easily with my make-up remover wipes.</li>
      <li>I wonder if i got an old package of it since there were so many good reviews here</li>
      <li>the brush separates and thickens lashes perfectly, no annoying fragrance.  </li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>I was out and needed it fast!!!  </li>
      <li>It lasts a long time and looks great on her.  </li>
      <li>ALways shipped super fast!!!</li>
      <li>Nothing special at all.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it dries out that quickly as others have said.</li>
      <li>Quick and efficient service, no need to have a Mary Kay lady in your contact list with prices like these on Amazon.</li>
      <li>No other mascara works as effectively as this one for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have very full lashes, and this mascara works really well for me without having to deal with that clumpy look that I so often have to deal with.  </li>
      <li>Really Like the way it looks and the price!!</li>
      <li>Nice big wand that dispenses the mascara well.</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump (unless it&#x27;s been open for 3-4 months) and goes on nicely.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s nice to knoe I can order and have it just days later!!!</li>
      <li>I love the mascara because it makes my lashes more visible than any other brand.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice mascara, but I get just as good results with Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous Carbon Black for less.</li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m happy about or not.</li>
      <li>Put on top lid only.</li>
      <li>Pretty shine</li>
      <li>This was my first Mary Kay item.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite mascara for several years.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many mascaras, and can&#x27;t come to appreciate any as much as MK Ultimate mascara.</li>
      <li>easy to apply and last all day</li>
      <li>fast shipping from the seller.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes too much even at the end of the day when I&#x27;ve rubbed them (oops).</li>
      <li>My wife really loves this mascara.  </li>
      <li>Does smudge after many hours but perfection cannot be expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth spending a few dollars more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure and maybe try other products by Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this mascara.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands; from cheap to super expensive - I always go back to this one.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes lashes longer &amp; is moisturizing</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I have found that I like , it&#x27;s not too thick and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy and it lasts me all day.</li>
    <li> I Have tried many Mascaras and intill this day i have not found a mascara i like more than this one.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It is one of the best non-waterproof products out there. It&#x27;s worth spending a few dollars more. The seller delivered it sooner than expected. By the way, my name is not Carl, but I was unable to edit that part  :-)</li>
    <li> I had tried L&#x27;oreal, Mac, Revlon before and none come close to this mascara! Love it! Does not clump, lashes won&#x27;t stick together, is not heavy and stays curly (other brands would &#x27;straighten&#x27; my eyelashes after using the curler), adds volume, is a bold black!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might find it that mid-use the brush starts to get sticky, all you need to do is clean it with water and make-up remover! Also, it&#x27;s good to take off excess mascara in the brush before applying - do it on the tube itself. These tips apply to any mascara, though.</li>
    <li> Not sure about this yet, bothers my eyes. Is waterproof but can be irratating. Put on top lid only. Pretty shine</li>
    <li> Very good mascara stays on until you want it to come off no peeling or flaking, great color.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I were very pleased with the mascara. We look forward to purchasing more Mary Kay products from this site. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Best mascara out there.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin and eyes...the brush separates and thickens lashes perfectly, no annoying fragrance.  Best brush for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its me or what but every brand i&#x27;ve tried the past few years all start out great then after 2 or 3 uses they get clumpy and flaky, same with this. I wonder if i got an old package of it since there were so many good reviews here</li>
    <li> I like most of this, but it takes the curl out of my lashes, and should be reapplied during the day.  I&#x27;d like more lengthening to it, too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes, so for me to find a mascara that does not flake and is actually meant for sensitive eyes is very difficult! This mascara is black, but not extremely black..which I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m happy about or not. However, I do love the texture of the mascara itself on my eyelashes. I feel as if though the formula does not make my eyelashes &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; if you know what I mean, and the formula is also very wet for anyone who has not bought this product yet - just so you know! The only reason I took off one star was because I feel like this mascara does give you awesome length on the lashes, but it does not give volume. I had to use another mascara for the second coat. I would purchase this again though.</li>
    <li> I cannot be without this mascara and it&#x27;s nice to knoe I can order and have it just days later!!!</li>
    <li> I love the mascara because it makes my lashes more visible than any other brand.  However, it is not clear if it&#x27;s waterproof or not.  I read reviews and some people said it was, some people said it was not waterproof.  It is not.  Therefore with my allergies I was unable to wear it.  Did give it to my sister who can though.</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay Mascara. Have been using it for a few years now.  Have tried other, less expensive mascaras and keep coming back to this one. Doesn&#x27;t clump (unless it&#x27;s been open for 3-4 months) and goes on nicely.</li>
    <li> It goes on smoothly. I usually  only need one coat. It does not smudge. The price was very good also.</li>
    <li> MARY KAY MASCARA IS NOT CLUMPY IT GOES ON VERY SMOOTH I WOULD RECOMMEND IS 2 EVERYONE FOR THE FINSHING TOUCH ON YOUR EYES I WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  Never clumps or smears.  Does smudge after many hours but perfection cannot be expected.</li>
    <li> I think this product is OK. Its &#x27;thick&#x27; and stubborn to get off. I am admittedly not one to wash my eye makeup off at night because it usually takes care of itself my morning anyway but this product doesn&#x27;t and is still on and still pretty thick in the morning. Not a fan of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not give you length, just volume. So if you have average length lashes like I do and are looking for a miracle mascara, this is not it! However, if you already have long lashes this should work pretty well for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara, and I think&lt;br /&gt;I have found it!! Really Like the way it looks and the price!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Mary Kay mascara! This came on time, brand new and for a far cheaper price than purchasing it through a Mary Kay person.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara I would have given it five stars if it was the color I ordered.  I ordered black but I received black brown.</li>
    <li> I have been in the market for a good mascara for some time. My lashes are your average-everyday lash. This mascara brings my eyes to life. My lashes do appear longer and fuller. I do not have issues with the mascara being clumpy or flaky. I give this review 4 stars because I ordered black and received brown. Believe it or not, I did not notice a difference between the two colors. In case that is an issue for another buyer, I thought I should make mention. I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and last all day</li>
    <li> Mary Kay mascara is great for a dramatic eye and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;People always assume i&#x27;m wearing false lashes when i use this product.</li>
    <li> The color, texture and smoothness is impressive,  makes thin lashes appear thick and long without looking like a clown!  Ordered by mistake and am glad I did! Iam hooked.</li>
    <li> I LOVE MARY KAY PRODUCTS!  FOR THE PRICE, I HAD TO TRY IT!  STAYS ON WELL, SEPERATES YOUR LASHES, AND COMES OFF WELL.  I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT STAYS ON &amp;#34;ALL&amp;#34; YOUR LASHES.  MOST WILL FADE AT THE TIP, NOT THIS ONE.  ITS A WINNER!</li>
    <li> Great mascara, I have used all brands. This one is the best, lasts long and doesn&#x27;t flake off. love it!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay; not great for the money</li>
    <li> Nothing special at all.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara...</li>
    <li> This mascara is a little clumpy and hard to wash off. You have to use makeup remover. I like there old line better.m</li>
    <li> As expected ,shipping was fast</li>
    <li> This item took the longest to receive and was hard and almost dried out.  The packaging appeared to be new but the product definitely was past its expiration date.</li>
    <li> Great service and product!!!</li>
    <li> love this item. Never leaves marks on eyelids, goes on great. fast shipping from the seller.</li>
    <li> My favorire mascara ever!!!  ALways shipped super fast!!!</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay mascara!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite mascara for several years.  It does not leave heavy black smudges on face if you don&#x27;t remove it and does not run when wet.  Is a little pricey though</li>
    <li> Best mascara, but dries up too fast in the tube. Then starts flaking.</li>
    <li> While this is my favorite mascara ever, I will never order online again. Came in dried out. I added saline drops to help try and make it work until I can get to Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have very full lashes, and this mascara works really well for me without having to deal with that clumpy look that I so often have to deal with.  It is a bit spendy though.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. No other mascara works as effectively as this one for me. It seems to improve when it dries out a bit over time. Makes my lashes stand out and look long. I don&#x27;t even need to use a curler.</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly and love how it makes my lashes nice and full.  It is a nice mascara.</li>
    <li> This is just as advertised.  Quick and efficient service, no need to have a Mary Kay lady in your contact list with prices like these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I use this mascara every day after getting a sample of it. I don&#x27;t think it dries out that quickly as others have said. I use it everyday and definitely don&#x27;t regret making this purchase.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, it&#x27;s to pricey, and it doesn&#x27;t do any better then what you can get @ the store. You have to apply alot to your lashes to make it look like you have mascara on.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was a Mary Kay Sale associate and gave this to me as a gift.  I am so pleased with this product that i will not wear anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever......</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara - so glad that Amazon had it - don&#x27;t know any reps to buy from.  This mascara is my favorite - no clumps, doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  Goes on thick with one coat.</li>
    <li> This product has some issues with clumping and does not have a brush that is easy to apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;The brush needs to be redesigned and the formula redone to correct this product.  I still use it but I am looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t go on good as I would like</li>
    <li> Product very dry, likely expired product.</li>
    <li> As listed, will buy again.</li>
    <li> this is good mascara i tried alot of kinds this is far the best loved it dont know what else 2 stay</li>
    <li> I have tried many mascaras, and can&#x27;t come to appreciate any as much as MK Ultimate mascara. I recently tried a new FiberLash mascara, which is intended to make your lashes look fake. One coat of my MK Ultimate gave me the same effect as the 3 layers it takes of the FiberLash. Nothing compares to this mascara.</li>
    <li> I was out and needed it fast!!!  I love Mary Kay products and have been using those products for years.</li>
    <li> The BEST mascara :)  makes your lashes look fabulous.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands; from cheap to super expensive - I always go back to this one.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, it&#x27;s a MUST try</li>
    <li> I have been on a quest for a long time for the perfect mascara.  They often cake, flake, and smear.  This is the first mascara that I have used that does none of the above.  I don&#x27;t have to deal with a consultant either!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the better mascaras I have used. It glides on, doesn&#x27;t clump (I always use dry bristle toothbrush to separate as well) and adds length to lashes. Nice big wand that dispenses the mascara well. Would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I was ordering another Mary Kay mascara and read the reviews about this product and ordered it based on the reviews.  I have loved it and would buy again.  Makes my lashes lush, thick and long.  Removes easily.  Being able to purchase Mary Kay through Amazon is convenient since I don&#x27;t have a consultant.  Would recommend trying this mascara.</li>
    <li> Perfect-does not clump or stick together.</li>
    <li> This was my first Mary Kay item. I have been searching for a good mascara.  I have fair skin. This brush defines and separates nicely. It lasts a long time. Doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes too much even at the end of the day when I&#x27;ve rubbed them (oops). It comes off easily with my make-up remover wipes. I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure and maybe try other products by Mary Kay.</li>
    <li> My wife really loves this mascara.  It lasts a long time and looks great on her.  The price is a little high but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I will order again from this supplier.</li>
    <li> Hard to find mascara I like that doesn&#x27;t run or clump.  This is one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever had! It is awesome!!! I love it.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice mascara, but I get just as good results with Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous Carbon Black for less. I just wanted to see if I could get a better mascara.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever!!! Have used it for years... I have sensitive skin, as well, &amp; I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this.</li>
