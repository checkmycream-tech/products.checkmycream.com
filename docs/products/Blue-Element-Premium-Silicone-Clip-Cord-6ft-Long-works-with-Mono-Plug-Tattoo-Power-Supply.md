    <li> Awesome cord! I like the look and feel of it. Works great and its an awesome color blue. Just what the picture shows</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
    <li> The clip cord don&#x27;t even work. Not returning it cause I don&#x27;t have the time to go buy a box, pack it, pay for the shipment to be sent back and wait for another one to come that won&#x27;t work either...</li>
    <li> Hooks are too long. They fall over and ground to the machine when turned to the side.</li>
    <li> Present so no complaints yet</li>
