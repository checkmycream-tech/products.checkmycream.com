      <li>and they informed me of this), so I ordered these in substitute and they fit perfectly!</li>
      <li>This curler is perfectly rounded for my eye shape and the replacements are great and so easy to find now on Amazon when I could not find many stores that had them in stock.</li>
      <li>These were priced just right and were perfect for what I needed.</li>

      <li>The good thing about the silicone refill pads is that they don&#x27;t break my lashes as easily.  </li>

      <li>It is old, but is still the best for me.  </li>

      <li>Hopefully I can find a replacement that works better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am glad I ordered them.  </li>
      <li>And I believe that they curl better.  </li>
      <li>And okay, they more &#x27;crimped&#x27; than &#x27;curled&#x27; my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Was so pleased to find these.  </li>
      <li>Also, you&#x27;d think because there are 2 that it&#x27;d be top ad bottom, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler, but otherwise OK.</li>
      <li>so I assumed the refills would fit.  </li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t fit my curler, but that was probably my error.</li>
      <li>They fit my Kurlash metal eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler</li>
      <li>These Maybelline eyelash curler refills fit the Maybelline eyelash curler I purchased.  </li>
      <li>Check to see which curler these will fit before you buy.  </li>
      <li>Sure, they didn&#x27;t fit the Maybelline eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned and loved for 15 years as well as the white ones did.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also good bc when the rubber gets old, it kinda automatically pops out.</li>
      <li>They fit easily into the curler, but seem to be too soft to be effective.  </li>
      <li>first they seemed okay.</li>
      <li>As others have said, the old white pads worked flawlessly.</li>
      <li>Fits in my old (favorite) Kurl Lash curler!</li>
      <li>Lasts longer than the white rubber refills.......but doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the lash as well for a good curl. ??</li>
      <li>But the real deciding factor between being &#x27;just okay&#x27;</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit any of my 3 eyelash curlers, including the maybelline one, fell right out.</li>
      <li>refill is not long enough and shifts side to side (at best), but really it just falls out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The refills fit in my various eyelash curlers (why do I have so many??).  </li>
      <li>The Refills are ok, The curler was better then other I have bought.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they come in different widths, so be sure to buy these for the Maybelline curler not another brand.</li>
      <li>I bought a new curler just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my old one that was causing the issue.</li>
      <li>This was the best when the pads were white, now the silicone pads slip out every single time I use the curler - and my eyelashes never get curled properly.  </li>
      <li>Total junk, didn&#x27;t fit in my eyelash curler, either.</li>
      <li>This product is only made to fit a Maybelline eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that they don&#x27;t stay in securely and I have to adjust the refill whenever I use the eyelash curler.  </li>
      <li>They curl up and don&#x27;t even fit the eyelash curler properly.</li>
      <li>You HAVE to know these are junk and don&#x27;t work with your old eyelash curlers!!!</li>
      <li>These are silicone, and not rubber like the older refills.  </li>
      <li>M Maybelline New York Expert Tools, Eyelash Curler Refills]]</li>
      <li>Neith had the necessary indentation to fit on the upper blade of the curler.</li>
      <li>I will buy a new eyelash curler that is NOT maybelline and hope it works like my old Maybelline.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no middle slot for the top of the curler to come down and curl your eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Definitely beats buying a whole new curler.  </li>
      <li>There are a few problems with how they fit:&lt;br /&gt;The refill is not wide enough to fit snug in the slot, therefore I had to hold it in place with my fingers to get it to stay put in the right</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I needed refills and checked everywhere</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money one these, however.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve developed a relationship with this one I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
      <li>Not to much to say about this product, just a standard eyelash curler refill.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t curl lashes like the older white refills.  </li>
      <li>Eyelash curler refills that fit are hard to find, I took a chance on these for my very old Cover Girl eyelash curler, which was made in Japan.</li>
      <li>at first you will need to hold it clamped closed for a longer period of time to curl your lashes.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some other reviewers, I like these silicone refills very much ...</li>
      <li>at least they fit the curler and worked.</li>
      <li>These refills are too small to fit a standard eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>I used to use the old white ones made out of rubber - they always ended up with a groove from use and quite a lot of my lashes were literally cut off.  </li>
      <li>but they never fit right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash curlers, this one was by far the best with the old pads - now it&#x27;s just as bad as every other brand.</li>
      <li>Please bring back the old version that actually worked.</li>
      <li>I have even tried going to other brands of eyelash curler to get away from this issue, but unfortunately I have had my good old Maybelline curler since my teens and it&#x27;s hard to get used to a new brand.</li>

<li> you just have to remember to squeeze hard and long (about 60 seconds).</li>
<li> was when I realized after a few uses that some of my eyelashes were being cut in half.</li>
<li> After a number of uses it starts to get a little softer.</li>

    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit any of my 3 eyelash curlers, including the maybelline one, fell right out. Also, you&#x27;d think because there are 2 that it&#x27;d be top ad bottom, but it&#x27;s not. Neith had the necessary indentation to fit on the upper blade of the curler.</li>
    <li> I only like the Maybelline eyelash curler and I have tried to use other replacements in it but they never fit right. Also other curlers are different shape than Maybelline and always pinch my eyelids which hurts a lot. This curler is perfectly rounded for my eye shape and the replacements are great and so easy to find now on Amazon when I could not find many stores that had them in stock.</li>
    <li> These refills weren&#x27;t as thick as previous ones I have purchased, but it was impossible to find them in any retail store in my local area.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler</li>
    <li> Eyelash curler refills that fit are hard to find, I took a chance on these for my very old Cover Girl eyelash curler, which was made in Japan. They require a very thin refill, and most refills that are sold at the drugstore are way too thick. The only issue I have is that they are a bit short so there is about a 1 mm gap on each side. It doesn&#x27;t affect the performance though, so happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> So good!!!! So good that I have subscribed these to get delivered every three months! It&#x27;s also good bc when the rubber gets old, it kinda automatically pops out. That&#x27;s when u Kano it&#x27;s time for a replacement!</li>
    <li> Not sure why some are saying that these are awful.  I think they are perfect.  I used to use the old white ones made out of rubber - they always ended up with a groove from use and quite a lot of my lashes were literally cut off.  These are made out of silicone, which does not wear down into a groove.  And I believe that they curl better.  Very happy that Maybelline changed their product and made it so much better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl lashes like the older white refills.  Won&#x27;t buy any dark ones again in case they are made of this same material.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect fit for my lash curler.  These are almost impossible to find locally so I&#x27;m glad to have found a source!</li>
    <li> Total junk, didn&#x27;t fit in my eyelash curler, either. Save yourself--just go to the drugstore. I can;t believe I paid shipping!</li>
    <li> Was so pleased to find these.  Can&#x27;t seem to find them locally.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my eyelash curler, but otherwise OK.</li>
    <li> This is a NO STAR review. ------------------ That space represents NO STARS. What&#x27;s the deal,Maybelline?? You HAVE to know these are junk and don&#x27;t work with your old eyelash curlers!!! I will buy a new eyelash curler that is NOT maybelline and hope it works like my old Maybelline. Go back to your white ones....at least they fit the curler and worked. This horrible black one slips, doesn&#x27;t fit, falls out, doesn&#x27;t curl the lashes. Yet....stupid me, I keep trying every day. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you have a Maybelline eyelash curler!! I plan to go on every site that sells this junk and write this same review.</li>
    <li> Revlon doesn&#x27;t offer refills for their eyelash curlers (I contacted the company and they informed me of this), so I ordered these in substitute and they fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> They fit easily into the curler, but seem to be too soft to be effective.  Please bring back the old version that actually worked.</li>
    <li> Lasts longer than the white rubber refills.......but doesn&#x27;t seem to grip the lash as well for a good curl. ??</li>
    <li> I bought these to fill my shu uemura curler, but the refills are too narrow and fall out all the time. I didn&#x27;t realize they come in different widths, so be sure to buy these for the Maybelline curler not another brand.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I think that the NYC eyelash curlers are the best ever!  Finding refills for them so we can extend their use is great :) :)</li>
    <li> Been using this product for decades!</li>
    <li> They do not fit the Maybelline eye lash curler that I have.  It is old, but is still the best for me.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the correct refill or even another eye lash curler that I like.  Check to see which curler these will fit before you buy.  They should change the description to reflect the correct curler.</li>
    <li> It is too small for my existing lash curler</li>
    <li> I own a Maybelline eyelash curler so I assumed the refills would fit.  Unfortunately, they are too small and easily fall out of the curler.  Too bad, was hoping they would work.</li>
    <li> Not made like they use to be; a bit softer. Not as firm and seems thinner which you then have to press harder to curl your eyelashes. I&#x27;ve used Maybelline since I was 15; I&#x27;m 60 now. So I miss the white firm refills. The way these are made now, it seems that you go through a lot more of them these days. And you can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore. Ugh!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Have used Maybelline for over 50 years.  Love it.[[ASIN:B00133CB8M Maybelline New York Expert Tools, Eyelash Curler Refills]]</li>
    <li> Not to much to say about this product, just a standard eyelash curler refill. It works as expected.</li>
    <li> These refills are too small to fit a standard eyelash curler. There are a few problems with how they fit:&lt;br /&gt;The refill is not wide enough to fit snug in the slot, therefore I had to hold it in place with my fingers to get it to stay put in the right position.&lt;br /&gt;The refill is not long enough and shifts side to side (at best), but really it just falls out.&lt;br /&gt;There is no middle slot for the top of the curler to come down and curl your eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why Maybelline went to these black refills. They are junk! They curl up and don&#x27;t even fit the eyelash curler properly. I wish they still made the \\&quot;old\\&quot; white ones. I have even tried going to other brands of eyelash curler to get away from this issue, but unfortunately I have had my good old Maybelline curler since my teens and it&#x27;s hard to get used to a new brand. Do not waste your money one these, however. Shame on you, Maybelline.</li>
    <li> These Maybelline eyelash curler refills fit the Maybelline eyelash curler I purchased.  It is a very cheaply-made model, so I am unhappy with the entire purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits old Maybelline eyelash curler perfectly.  Yes, it is stiffer, so at first you will need to hold it clamped closed for a longer period of time to curl your lashes.  After a number of uses it starts to get a little softer.</li>
    <li> The refills fit in my various eyelash curlers (why do I have so many??).  The only problem is that they don&#x27;t stay in securely and I have to adjust the refill whenever I use the eyelash curler.  But that isn&#x27;t too big a hassle, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Great buy! fits Maybelline eyelash curler perfect and works great. Lashes curl without clumping. Will be re-ordering this item as needed.</li>
    <li> These things are junk; they do not work.  Why would you fix something that wasn&#x27;t broke and replace it with something that is?  I&#x27;m trying refills from other companies.  If that doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere than Maybelline for not only the refills, but also the curler.</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere for a great item</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t fit my curler, but that was probably my error.</li>
    <li> Fits in my old (favorite) Kurl Lash curler!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this product. It does what it is supposed to do. I like that it is eligible for subscribe and save because I enjoy that 20% discount!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize Maybelline had stopped selling the white rubber refills until I needed to replace mine (they held up for a good 2 years) and couldn&#x27;t find them in any stores. I settled for these new silicone ones after reading poor reviews. I gave them a shot because I didn&#x27;t really have any other option, and could they REALLY be as bad as everyone said?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first they seemed okay. Sure, they didn&#x27;t fit the Maybelline eyelash curler I&#x27;ve owned and loved for 15 years as well as the white ones did. And okay, they more &#x27;crimped&#x27; than &#x27;curled&#x27; my eyelashes. But the real deciding factor between being &#x27;just okay&#x27; and &#x27;boy, these are total crap&#x27; was when I realized after a few uses that some of my eyelashes were being cut in half. I look like I took scissors to sections of my lashes and whacked away.  That NEVER happened with the white ones. And these are promptly going in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware. Hopefully I can find a replacement that works better than these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I contacted Maybelline about this issue.  They sent me an email that basically said, \\&quot;We&#x27;re sorry our eyelash curler pads cut your eyelashes off.  Could you email us a picture of the damage? Kthxbye.\\&quot;  Sorry, Maybelline.  They had grown back by that point and I wasn&#x27;t about to reenact it for you.</li>
    <li> I have some really old eyelash curlers and hesitated in buying the refills because of the bad reviews.  I am glad I ordered them.  They work and fit perfectly.  Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> These are good eyelash curler refills at a very good price. They fit my Kurlash metal eyelash curler.  A few reviewers said that they don&#x27;t curl your eyelashes very well.  These are silicone, and not rubber like the older refills.  I find that I have to crimp the eyelash curler longer when using silicone refills; I would say to crimp it for about 60 seconds on each eye.  The good thing about the silicone refill pads is that they don&#x27;t break my lashes as easily.  One other thing, you need to squeeze really hard to make these curl your lashes; if you don&#x27;t they won&#x27;t work.  Again, because these are silicone, they won&#x27;t won&#x27;t break your lashes when you squeeze hard.  Unlike some other reviewers, I like these silicone refills very much ...you just have to remember to squeeze hard and long (about 60 seconds).</li>
    <li> I was surprised when I needed refills and checked everywhere I could think of (Walmart, Target, Ulta and the drugstores) to find replacements without having to purchase another curler. These were priced just right and were perfect for what I needed.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Too bad you can&#x27;t purchase refills at the store.  Definitely beats buying a whole new curler.  I&#x27;ve developed a relationship with this one I&#x27;ve had for years.  Only thing... the refill sometimes slips out in my makeup bag.  Not a big deal for me though.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my eyelash curler, but unfortunately, they were too small. This product is only made to fit a Maybelline eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> As others have said, the old white pads worked flawlessly. This was the best when the pads were white, now the silicone pads slip out every single time I use the curler - and my eyelashes never get curled properly.  I bought a new curler just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t my old one that was causing the issue. The pad doesn&#x27;t grip my eyelashes when I curl them - so it&#x27;s useless. I&#x27;ve tried other eyelash curlers, this one was by far the best with the old pads - now it&#x27;s just as bad as every other brand. If anyone finds another brand that actually works, please post!</li>
    <li> Is perfect for my curlash</li>
    <li> worked for what I needed.</li>
    <li> The Refills are ok, The curler was better then other I have bought.</li>
    <li> These are way to thin, do not curl your eyelashes,pop out when you use them, hate them, hate them and just put my old ones back in and they are great !!!!!:(&lt;br /&gt;sorry but that&#x27;s what they are NO GOOD</li>
