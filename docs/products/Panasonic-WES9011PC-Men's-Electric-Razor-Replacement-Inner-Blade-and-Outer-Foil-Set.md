### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Replacing the foil along with the blades returned this shaver to one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been one of the best buys we&#x27;ve had.</li>
      <li>Without a doubt it is the best electric shaver on the market.</li>
      <li>But the order I made this year (Feb 2014) isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>When I bought this shaver, it was great.</li>
      <li>One month after using the replacement parts, the shaver continues to perform well; I would happily recommend this set to anyone keeping up with Panasonic&#x27;s suggested replacement schedule for their shaver.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>I use liquid soap to lather, and that technique works great for shaving.</li>
      <li>Very nice price</li>
      <li>Price was fair, and it was delivered in a timely fashion.</li>
      <li>Good factory replacement head.</li>
      <li>Panasonic makes the best electric shavers and for the cost of 2-3 haircuts, you can buy the replacement foil and blade set so you&#x27;re guaranteed that smooth feel all the time.  </li>
      <li>WES9011PC Replacement blades and foil fit perfect for my Pnasonic ES-8168.</li>
      <li>This set of items, WES9011, is perfect replacement for the original parts of a Panasonic shaver with a linear motor model ES 8164.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>You get a much better shave too!</li>
      <li>It is working nice.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement that gives a great shave.</li>
      <li>My exshaver Panasonic ES8176 is working again very smoothly.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say more than that.</li>
      <li>Lamdash ES8195 electric shaver purchased in Japan and these blades and foil work flawlessly, despite the packaging not specifying support for such.</li>
      <li>Having not replaced blades or screen for over two years, I was pleased but not astounded with the improved performance.  </li>
      <li>I have a model ES 8807, but I believe this works on many Panasonic models.</li>
      <li>This time it was my ES8168, and they fit perfectly and have brought my shaver back to my expectations.</li>
      <li>Used to get a great shave from my old Panasonic ES8162.</li>
      <li>Worked fine</li>
      <li>Ordered this replacement set for my husband&#x27;s shaver (Panasonic model: ES8807) and it works just fine with no problems at all.</li>
      <li>As I expected, it is very good.</li>
      <li>The item I received was a genuine Panasonic Foil and Blade Set.</li>
      <li>Definitely works great.</li>
      <li>Always nice to get a new combo pack every year or so.</li>
      <li>With the replacement price of these foils and blades and a 5-month useful life, it&#x27;s actually more economical to switch to the Dorco Pace 3 -</li>
      <li>Plus it keeps my shaver clean, aftershaving</li>
      <li>I just use water to rinse and, \\&quot;presto\\&quot;, blades are clean.</li>
      <li>The return process was very smooth however and I received a replacement very promptly.</li>
      <li>What to tell here - replacement was easy and the razor shaves now like new :)</li>
      <li>My personal opinion is that this blade system is superior to Panasonic&#x27;s newer designs.</li>
      <li>Several years ago I bought replacement foil and blades for my ES8068 from Amazon, and was appreciative of them having something so obscure available for purchase.</li>
      <li>The new ones came quickly and once installed reminded me why I love this razor.</li>
      <li>It was original I will buy again thanks...</li>
      <li>The WES9011pc replacement set easily restores the ES8807 to like new condition.  </li>
      <li>Amazon doesn&#x27;t always list the razor models that the different and various kits fit, so it is wise to verify the correct model at the Panasonic website.</li>
      <li>Not only does it cut better and faster (saving enough battery power for 2 more shaves per charge) but it is substantially quieter now.</li>
      <li>It was worth ordering it, thanks.</li>
      <li>: it&#x27;s just like when I first bought it.</li>
      <li>I was in love with my Panasonic razor initially but noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore</li>
      <li>The 2 old blades pull off easily and the new blades snap into place.  </li>
      <li>, I really was looking to make sure the quality is high enough.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Panasonic and Amazon</li>
      <li>Cuts much closer and faster in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I had forgotten what &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; could really feel like, now my face feels like the proverbial &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for stocking replacement parts like this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It came in fabricated original box.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to spend 40 bones when a complete new shaver is only three times that much, but I&#x27;m glad I took this route -</li>
      <li>Quick, simple installation and your razor performs like new again.</li>
      <li>(Maybe it&#x27;s time for me to move on to a shaver of new model altogether.)</li>
      <li>Cleaned up the shaver a bit, installed the new foil and blade and</li>
      <li>The new foil comes pre mounted in a new head.  </li>
      <li>It makes your old razor work like new again.</li>
      <li>Pull off the old blades and click in the new ones.  </li>
      <li>The shaver has been restored to its original cutting performance, providing the smooth, close cuts it once did when first used.  </li>
      <li>My blades and foil were 3 years old and needed replaced.</li>
      <li>After 2 years I decided to replace the blades in my razor and it really did make a big difference.</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t even wait for the old one to reach them before they shipped the replacement.</li>
      <li>I should change the blades and foil before that happens because it&#x27;s a big difference in performance when the new blades are in.  </li>
      <li>so I bought these new blades about a year later.  </li>
      <li>This kit contains new blades and foil with housing for specific models of Panasonic mens electric shavers.</li>
      <li>No surprise nicks and easy to buzz your entire head even without a mirror - dry or wet!</li>
      <li>Either I have the world&#x27;s most coarse facial hair or the blades quickly dull.  </li>
      <li>However, lately noticed it is not as smooth as before.</li>
      <li>Not much else to say about it, really.</li>
      <li>I got a much closer shave with the new blades than I was getting with the old, dull blades.</li>
      <li>My razor was one and a half years old and I replaced both - and now it cuts like new again.&lt;br</li>

    <li> When I bought this shaver, it was great. Without a doubt it is the best electric shaver on the market. When it got dull, I purchased just the replacement blades. I installed them but was never satisfied with the shave. After 6 months I had enough and decided to buy the foil and blades together. Eureka, that did it. Replacing the foil along with the blades returned this shaver to one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Good factory replacement head. Worked fine</li>
    <li> Ordered this replacement set for my husband&#x27;s shaver (Panasonic model: ES8807) and it works just fine with no problems at all.</li>
    <li> WES9011PC Replacement blades and foil fit perfect for my Pnasonic ES-8168. I use liquid soap to lather, and that technique works great for shaving. Plus it keeps my shaver clean, aftershaving I just use water to rinse and, \\&quot;presto\\&quot;, blades are clean.</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best electric shavers and for the cost of 2-3 haircuts, you can buy the replacement foil and blade set so you&#x27;re guaranteed that smooth feel all the time.  No surprise nicks and easy to buzz your entire head even without a mirror - dry or wet!</li>
    <li> This kit contains new blades and foil with housing for specific models of Panasonic mens electric shavers. Quick, simple installation and your razor performs like new again. Amazon doesn&#x27;t always list the razor models that the different and various kits fit, so it is wise to verify the correct model at the Panasonic website. You&#x27;ll also see the savings before ordering. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> After 2 years I decided to replace the blades in my razor and it really did make a big difference. Not only does it cut better and faster (saving enough battery power for 2 more shaves per charge) but it is substantially quieter now.</li>
    <li> I have the National (\\&quot;Panasonic\\&quot; in North America) Lamdash ES8195 electric shaver purchased in Japan and these blades and foil work flawlessly, despite the packaging not specifying support for such. The shaver has been restored to its original cutting performance, providing the smooth, close cuts it once did when first used.  One month after using the replacement parts, the shaver continues to perform well; I would happily recommend this set to anyone keeping up with Panasonic&#x27;s suggested replacement schedule for their shaver.</li>
    <li> According to Panasonic, you&#x27;re supposed to replace the shaver foil once a year and the blades once every two years. My razor was one and a half years old and I replaced both - and now it cuts like new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, Amazon shipped this to me in a non-rigid bubble pak, and the shaver foil was badly dented on arrival. The return process was very smooth however and I received a replacement very promptly. They didn&#x27;t even wait for the old one to reach them before they shipped the replacement.</li>
    <li> I changed it and using it for several months. It is working nice. You may want to replace yours too.</li>
    <li> The item I received was a genuine Panasonic Foil and Blade Set. I got a much closer shave with the new blades than I was getting with the old, dull blades. Not much else to say about it, really.</li>
    <li> It was original I will buy again thanks...</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is the second time I have ordered it. It makes your old razor work like new again. You don&#x27;t usually realize how bad it has been since you first use your razor. I don&#x27;t usually make this purchase till I see actual holes developing in the foil. It would probably be smarter to get it before that happens, as by then you may be nicking yourself. Definitely works great. I have a model ES 8807, but I believe this works on many Panasonic models.</li>
    <li> This razor does hard work every week.  I use it to shave my husband&#x27;s head so the foil eventually wears into a hole.  I should change the blades and foil before that happens because it&#x27;s a big difference in performance when the new blades are in.  These are the easiest things to change out.  No tools required.  Pull off the old blades and click in the new ones.  We&#x27;ve had this razor for years and this is the only thing that gets changed out.  It&#x27;s been one of the best buys we&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> Either I have the world&#x27;s most coarse facial hair or the blades quickly dull.  I was in love with my Panasonic razor initially but noticed that it wasn&#x27;t getting it done anymore so I bought these new blades about a year later.  Initially they seemed to do the trick but after just a few weeks I&#x27;m back to being disappointed.</li>
    <li> Several years ago I bought replacement foil and blades for my ES8068 from Amazon, and was appreciative of them having something so obscure available for purchase. This time it was my ES8168, and they fit perfectly and have brought my shaver back to my expectations. I was hesitant to spend 40 bones when a complete new shaver is only three times that much, but I&#x27;m glad I took this route - it&#x27;s a quality shaver with plenty of life in it still. I had forgotten what &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; could really feel like, now my face feels like the proverbial &amp;#34;baby&#x27;s bottom&amp;#34;. Thanks Amazon for stocking replacement parts like this. Recommend. Kia ora, GW</li>
    <li> Used to get a great shave from my old Panasonic ES8162. However, lately noticed it is not as smooth as before. With the replacement price of these foils and blades and a 5-month useful life, it&#x27;s actually more economical to switch to the Dorco Pace 3 - [[ASIN:B008O86E7I B008O86E7I]] You get a much better shave too!</li>
    <li> what i need thank you</li>
    <li> Hmm. For the past 5 years, I order one about once every year. Usually they become dull before I have to order a new replacement. But the order I made this year (Feb 2014) isn&#x27;t very good. Just under 7 months later, the foil broke last week which left a small whole in it. It&#x27;d cut my skin so bad I had to stop using the shaver. I wonder whether it&#x27;s just a random thing about the foil I bought, or the quality of the replacement has gone downhill. (Maybe it&#x27;s time for me to move on to a shaver of new model altogether.) But I will give it one last try. I just ordered another one. Let&#x27;s see.</li>
    <li> This set of items, WES9011, is perfect replacement for the original parts of a Panasonic shaver with a linear motor model ES 8164.</li>
    <li> Always nice to get a new combo pack every year or so. I don&#x27;t think you can get these from any other manufacturer so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them to. So I would recommend these if you have this razor.</li>
    <li> Having not replaced blades or screen for over two years, I was pleased but not astounded with the improved performance.  Check the Panasonic website for compatibility as the Amazon listing does not identify all covered shavers.</li>
    <li> The WES9011pc replacement set easily restores the ES8807 to like new condition.  The new foil comes pre mounted in a new head.  The 2 old blades pull off easily and the new blades snap into place.  A simple replacement for the 3 key parts of this shaver.</li>
    <li> Very nice price, I really was looking to make sure the quality is high enough. It was worth ordering it, thanks.</li>
    <li> My blades and foil were 3 years old and needed replaced. The new ones came quickly and once installed reminded me why I love this razor. I won&#x27;t wait as long to replace them next time.</li>
    <li> What to tell here - replacement was easy and the razor shaves now like new :)</li>
    <li> My personal opinion is that this blade system is superior to Panasonic&#x27;s newer designs. Cuts much closer and faster in my opinion.</li>
    <li> As I expected, it is very good. It came in fabricated original box. My exshaver Panasonic ES8176 is working again very smoothly. Thanks to Panasonic and Amazon</li>
    <li> Cleaned up the shaver a bit, installed the new foil and blade and: it&#x27;s just like when I first bought it.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement that gives a great shave. Price was fair, and it was delivered in a timely fashion. if you have a Panasonic razor that&#x27;s not quite getting the job done the way it used to, it&#x27;s time to change the blades. Can&#x27;t say more than that. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
