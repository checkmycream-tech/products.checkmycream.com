      <li>Very nice shaving balm that really smells great and protects your skin!</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I have already re-ordered (before running out) and turned my straight-razor friends onto this amazing product.</li>
      <li>It really is amazing.</li>
      <li>The one thing that is also amazing is that there is no burning after application.</li>
      <li>I had been using Dreanought&#x27;s shave cream for a while and really liked it, so I decided to spend some cash to pick up a jar of this as well.</li>
      <li>I shave with a straight razor, so this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used for post shave &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Good fragrance and feels refreshing after you shave.</li>
      <li>Really nice balm.</li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency and smell.  </li>
      <li>I get razor burn on my face very easily</li>
      <li>But honestly a lot of pros are concerned about the amount of chemicals in this stuff claiming it doesn&#x27;t seem safe or they wouldn&#x27;t put it on their face.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn at all, but provides a very welcome tingling sensation, putting the proper punctuation on a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very smooth at application and does not have any sting or burn.  </li>
      <li>A very light smell so its not overbearing.  </li>

      <li>After 3 days use, my skin looks better.  </li>
      <li>I love the feel of it on my skin after a shave.</li>
      <li>Too many chemicals in this.</li>
      <li>Has a jelly-like consistency and a great, clean, mild scent.</li>
      <li>It is soothing if you routinely get razor burn, but  if razor burn relief is what you are going for you would be better off getting a bottle of witch hazel for 1/3 the price.</li>
      <li>I promise that you will love it.</li>
      <li>and I love the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>He says this one works ok.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different shaving products but this one is the best post shave balm that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Love this better than the cream.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of a post-shave balm but this one will not be my go-to.</li>
      <li>I gave this a try along with the Dreadnought shave cream and love it.  </li>
      <li>It is ok.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>It seems to work pretty well, and feels good going on.</li>
      <li>Works great, nice feeling after i shave, no burning, no funny smells.</li>
      <li>Cool, smooth, and love the scent.</li>
      <li>Very important to use a fresh, quality razor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells good and no bumps so far.</li>
      <li>I will likey use it more in the hot summer months.</li>
      <li>Goes on quickly and smoothly, and leaves my face feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>I guess I haven&#x27;t ever used any other after shave balm to compare it to, but compared to nothing this stuff works great</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, despite the bad-ass name, it has a mild scent, so you won&#x27;t be walking around smelling like a cloud of axe body spray.</li>
      <li>and this make the rash go away and soothes my skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this item based off of the excellent reviews that it has recieved from various wet-shaving web sites and the ones off Amazon only to be dissapointed.</li>
      <li>After a few uses, I was extremely impressed and will be ordering more when my current jar runs out.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey but great product.</li>
      <li>The stuff has the consistency of hair gel, which gives it a slimy feel going on your face, but it is quickly absorbed.</li>
      <li>Good scent that last, really moisture well the skin, no greasy</li>
      <li>Keeps my face looking fresh</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s powerful burning sensation)</li>
      <li>I also use their shaving cream, which is good, but this puts other stuff to shame.</li>
      <li>Still it really does the job better than any aftershave I have used, so give this product high marks and will continue to keep some in my shaving kit.  </li>
      <li>The product is also very safe and free of any parabens or excessive chemicals.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to Art of Shaving when this is done, even at twice the cost.</li>
      <li>This soothes my skin and for the first time in probably twenty years I don&#x27;t have razor burn on my neck.  </li>
      <li>First off this stuff looks like semen.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alright, nothing special, pretty watery - make sure that lid is on tight!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Pleasant clean manly smell, maybe a little bit strong - but</li>
      <li>I find it very calming to the skin.  </li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>and he seems to really like it.</li>
      <li>Best applied after rinsing your face with cold water.</li>
      <li>Very chemically smell.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>Just for those curious as to my background of shaving, I have used several products from The Art of Shaving and E-Shave and have been wet shaving since 2009 and this is the first time I have experienced this in an after shave.</li>
      <li>The scent is also not very strong, and isn&#x27;t really noticeable for very long, so if you&#x27;re like me, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
      <li>This balm i bought for my better half</li>
      <li>Just returned to shaving with a safety razor and have been researching a lot of men&#x27;s products associated with classic shaving.  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product along with their shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Although the alcohol provided a nice sting after the shave and it left my skin feeling decent afterwards, I noticed a white film left over on my face after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I normally like alcohol based balms because they feel like they are doing something.</li>
      <li>His face did feel very soft.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried this product and for the last three days I have been using it</li>
      <li>its second nin place to my favorite jack black.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if I just got an old sample.</li>
      <li>ive tried a variety of shave balms for my sensitive skin, and i&#x27;ve settled on Dreadnought.</li>
      <li>but I lately I have been becoming more cautious when unnecessary chemicals in my products.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As the companion to Dreadnought shaving cream this Post Shave Balm is an excellent choice. They are two great products that do what they say.</li>
    <li> Excellent, clean feeling after the shave!</li>
    <li> Supposed to be the American equivalent to Bluebeards Revenge. I found the scent to be close but not quite the same. The balm itself seemed to watery. It is ok. I am wondering if I just got an old sample.</li>
    <li> smells/works great on my man</li>
    <li> PROS: Good scent that last, really moisture well the skin, no greasy effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: A little bit over priced to my opinion</li>
    <li> Really nice balm. Good fragrance and feels refreshing after you shave. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best after shave I have ever used in 40 years of shaving, that includes face and head.  Will not use anything else.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  IT smells great and feels great to put on my face.  I get razor burn on my face very easily and this make the rash go away and soothes my skin quickly.  I will definitely be using this product in the future and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaving balm that really smells great and protects your skin! best balm I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
    <li> I guess I haven&#x27;t ever used any other after shave balm to compare it to, but compared to nothing this stuff works great and I am very pleased with it. It definitely helps reduce razor burn and irritation. The scent is also not very strong, and isn&#x27;t really noticeable for very long, so if you&#x27;re like me, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> Smeels good... it gets 3 stars due to my sensative skin.  I can&#x27;t use anything with a fragrance or my skin will look like I hit it with a sand blaster. its second nin place to my favorite jack black. If younhave triedjack black the you will luv this stuff</li>
    <li> Really good tingle. Love this better than the cream.</li>
    <li> ive tried a variety of shave balms for my sensitive skin, and i&#x27;ve settled on Dreadnought. It has a great fragrance that doesn&#x27;t aggravate or annoy my sensitive skin, it lathers wonderfully, and provides an amazing shave! I&#x27;m a fan for life now. beats the hell out of the generic&#x27;s i&#x27;ve used all my life previously!</li>
    <li> The best stuff to put on your face, period. Has a jelly-like consistency and a great, clean, mild scent. spreads super-thin and sooths immediately. I normally like alcohol based balms because they feel like they are doing something. This doesn&#x27;t burn like alcohol (there is none), but feels like it&#x27;s doing something anyway. I have already re-ordered (before running out) and turned my straight-razor friends onto this amazing product.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and for the last three days I have been using it I really like it. It smells good and no bumps so far.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  Leaves my face feeling very smooth.  A very light smell so its not overbearing.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The only drawback here is the price.  It lasts as long -if not longer- than my shaving soap. A little bit goes a long, long way.  It has a nice consistency and smell.  Best applied after rinsing your face with cold water.</li>
    <li> This balm i bought for my better half and he seems to really like it. He has recently gotten into shaving supplies for a hobby and he has a lot of different brands. He says this one works ok.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different shaving products but this one is the best post shave balm that I have ever used. It&#x27;s a little pricey but the pot lasts a long time and the instant relief after shaving makes it worth every penny. I am a customer for life.</li>
    <li> This made my neck break out and itch. The smell isn&#x27;t great either. I love the idea of a post-shave balm but this one will not be my go-to.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend for a gift. He read about it in a magazine. I work for a luxury retsiler and he has used every brand out there. Art of Shaving. Jack Black, Kiehls, Clarins etc he said nothing has compared to the shave he got with Dreadnought. His face did feel very soft. I&#x27;m. Going to order for use on my legs.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s a runny jello consistency and I&#x27;m not impressed overall. The wife likes the scent of it so I will use the rest of it but probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great, nice feeling after i shave, no burning, no funny smells.</li>
    <li> Little or at least not much smell, but does the job.  I prefer to have some scent, so do not use every day.  Still it really does the job better than any aftershave I have used, so give this product high marks and will continue to keep some in my shaving kit.  I will likey use it more in the hot summer months.</li>
    <li> Because the aftershave scent is so strong, I&#x27;m unable to use this product so don&#x27;t know how well it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  My husband usually does not like to use any type of post shave balm because it causes such discomfort but this balm makes his face feel wonderful!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I had been using Dreanought&#x27;s shave cream for a while and really liked it, so I decided to spend some cash to pick up a jar of this as well. Let me tell you, this was a great purchase! I shave my head as well as my face, so razor rash and skin irritation are obvious concerns, but between this and the shave cream, those concerns have been eliminated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving and giving my skin a good rinse with some cold water, I apply this stuff - a little goes a very long way! - and my skin feels awesome! It doesn&#x27;t burn at all, but provides a very welcome tingling sensation, putting the proper punctuation on a nice shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is on the expensive side, but it will last you a VERY long time and it is worth every penny. I promise that you will love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, nothing special, pretty watery - make sure that lid is on tight!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item based off of the excellent reviews that it has recieved from various wet-shaving web sites and the ones off Amazon only to be dissapointed. In my ignorance I ordered this item not looking at it&#x27;s ingredients only to find isopropyl alcohol as one of the listed ingredients. Although the alcohol provided a nice sting after the shave and it left my skin feeling decent afterwards, I noticed a white film left over on my face after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon closer inspection it was my skin, which was dried up after using the post-shave balm. Just for those curious as to my background of shaving, I have used several products from The Art of Shaving and E-Shave and have been wet shaving since 2009 and this is the first time I have experienced this in an after shave. Even when I was using Aqua Velva&#x27;s Ice Blue (which is infamous for it&#x27;s powerful burning sensation) I never experienced this dried skin after effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with anything other than oily skin and requires the disinfecting effect of alcohol.</li>
    <li> Just returned to shaving with a safety razor and have been researching a lot of men&#x27;s products associated with classic shaving.  This balm is unscented.  It&#x27;s very smooth at application and does not have any sting or burn.  I find it very calming to the skin.  Sometimes during the day, especially in these dry winter days, I&#x27;ll put on another application just to hydrate my face.  I have a heavy thick beard, but some skin sensitivity.  This product works wonders.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but great product. I will definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> First off this stuff looks like semen. Gross. It smells AWFUL! I can&#x27;t describe it, it&#x27;s like bad lotion or gross petroleum jelly. Very chemically smell. Consistency is that of jelly or gel-like almost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually burns a bit when you apply it, so I guess that means it&#x27;s working. I used this for a few months and seemed to lighten my hair growth as advertised. But honestly a lot of pros are concerned about the amount of chemicals in this stuff claiming it doesn&#x27;t seem safe or they wouldn&#x27;t put it on their face. So I ended up throwing this stuff away, seemed wasteful but I lately I have been becoming more cautious when unnecessary chemicals in my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not bothered by chemicals or bad smell this might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish Dreadnought/Bluebeard would either make this unscented or make different scents, that would solve 99% of this products problems.</li>
    <li> I went out on a limb and ordered this product with little to no knowledge of Dreadnought.  After a few uses, I was extremely impressed and will be ordering more when my current jar runs out.  The product is hair-gel like, but when applied to the face, it gives your skin instant relief and protection and dissipates within seconds without a funky smell.  The product is also very safe and free of any parabens or excessive chemicals.  I would definitely recommend this product for any one that uses a double-edge razor and for those of you out who cut their face up with a ten-blade disposable.  This balm helps reduce any redness or irritation, as well as razor burn.  My wife also loves using it on her legs (great gift idea gentlemen!).</li>
    <li> I have not used aftershaves or anything in years as they all irritate my skin and/or smell ridiculous.  I gave this a try along with the Dreadnought shave cream and love it.  This soothes my skin and for the first time in probably twenty years I don&#x27;t have razor burn on my neck.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Do yourself a favor and start using this stuff asap... It really is amazing. I also use their shaving cream, which is good, but this puts other stuff to shame.</li>
    <li> The stuff has the consistency of hair gel, which gives it a slimy feel going on your face, but it is quickly absorbed. The scent is reminiscent of premium bug repellent which seems to please some women. It is soothing if you routinely get razor burn, but  if razor burn relief is what you are going for you would be better off getting a bottle of witch hazel for 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I love the feel of it on my skin after a shave. The one thing that is also amazing is that there is no burning after application.</li>
    <li> I found that putting on a little organic vegetable oil, coconut oil, avocado oil in just a thin film does better at protecting my skiing w/o the burning, and my skin looks young.  Too many chemicals in this.</li>
    <li> After 3 days use, my skin looks better.  Smoother skin, smaller pores, and the beard shadow stays away longer.  I also use the dreadnought shave cream, and a good razor.  Very important to use a fresh, quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant clean manly smell, maybe a little bit strong - but my 5 yr old daughter hasn&#x27;t complained about it.  And she doesn&#x27;t complain about my whiskers anymore.  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Art of Shaving aftershave balm, which is wonderful. This one leaves a stiffness on my skin as it dries. It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to Art of Shaving when this is done, even at twice the cost.</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty well, and feels good going on. I haven&#x27;t used shaving balm for years, so it&#x27;s hard to say how it compares to other products. Nonetheless, despite the bad-ass name, it has a mild scent, so you won&#x27;t be walking around smelling like a cloud of axe body spray.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is now obsessed with this. It smells great. Win, Win.</li>
    <li> Goes on quickly and smoothly, and leaves my face feeling refreshed. Would highly recommend this product along with their shaving cream. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of their pre-shave oil.</li>
    <li> Love it! Cool, smooth, and love the scent. It&#x27;s like putting cold gylcerine on your freshly slashed skin (that may sound worse than I meant). I shave with a straight razor, so this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used for post shave &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. Keeps my face looking fresh and I love the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell (so does my wife)</li>
