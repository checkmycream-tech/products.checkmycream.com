      <li>I think the company must have paid people to write good reviews.  </li>
      <li>I loved this product.</li>
      <li>Results are good, but they don&#x27;t stay put.</li>

      <li>You are better off going with cooled cucumber patch over your eyes.  </li>

      <li>These eye patches are nice and cooling, first of all, and they really do deliver moisture--and whatever else--through the skin.  </li>
      <li>I just wish it was more reasonably priced</li>
      <li>Going to try the full mask.  </li>
      <li>Also, with similar products, you see immediate improvement, which is what makes this kind of product great to use prior to events.  </li>
      <li>The half hour is a great time to just relax and enjoy some peace and quite time.</li>
      <li>I liked this product so much I purchased them for my whole face.  </li>
      <li>and I am also older, so the puffiness in the AM may have a lot more to do with aging now versus lack of sleep.</li>
      <li>I had smooth toned skin after just the first use.</li>
      <li>It really works to smooth and plum</li>
      <li>the most sensitive under eye area.</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference right away</li>
      <li>if you have eye issues, you will be able to see it pretty clearly.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, it is nice to give yourself a reason to lie down for a 20 minute break, and the pads are cool.</li>
      <li>I saw a difference in my under eye bags after the first use.  </li>
      <li>The instructions say that these can be reused up to two more times if they are washed, put back in their package and sealed in a ziplock bag.</li>

      <li>The skin looks so smooth, soft and no bags or wrinkles.</li>
      <li>These really make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>That may not be good, because they dry out a little and aren&#x27;t as easy to reuse?  </li>
      <li>You definitely see results the puffiness is visibly reduced as well as fine lines.</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t really care; the gel-like slippery slimy eel leech silky squish feeling of them is my FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These really work.  </li>
      <li>I have re-ordered this product because i do see a difference after I use it; smoother skin under my eyes with less fine lines.  </li>
      <li>They are exactly the same as the spa, but they don&#x27;t have the spa name on it.  </li>
      <li>Do not ordered this lifting Anti-Collagen Eye Patch with Bio-Gold and Hyaluronic because it  DONOT work.please do not waste your money.</li>

      <li>You are instructed to lie flat while they are on, so although they would likely stay afixed, you really can&#x27;t do much moving once they are on.</li>
      <li>They felt cold and soothing &amp; I really loved them for any days you wake up for an event or in general and have puffy eyes that you want to soothe and get rid of!</li>
      <li>It also forces you to relax for a little bit, but I notice a difference right away.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. My eyes looked tired and dark due to 5 hours of sleep each night. I bought these patches in hopes of a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I put them on for 20 minutes in the morning before applying makeup. I noticed a the puffiness was gone! I have read we can re-use up to 3 times. I have used 2 packets and I will re-order again. I like the moist feeling around my eyes. Not greasy at all. Well hydrated and less puffiness. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the second item ive gotten products from this company and there great. This product is not only low cost but really works. Ive used eyedews before and this product is better. Its reuseable, reduces puffiness and fine lines. Feels great too.</li>
    <li> These are a great way to start the day - each can be reused 3x and make a noticeable difference to the under-eye area.</li>
    <li> These are so nice and soothing.  It also forces you to relax for a little bit, but I notice a difference right away. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Results within first use and better with each use.  Going to try the full mask.  Tightens skin around eyes and diminished dark circles.  Get three uses out of each pair.  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I really like these! I am getting ready to turn 40 and trying anything! I was happy w these. Very refreshing - skin super smooth after using - will get again!</li>
    <li> A plus for tired eyes . I noticed the dark circles under my eyes lighten up. They are easy to use and non irritating.</li>
    <li> Wanted something to reduce puffiness when awakening and found these.. They are wonderful and even help you sleep better as very soothing to the eyes</li>
    <li> Great product! Got it very quickly and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love these eye patches, it feels refreshing while wearing the patches.  The skin looks so smooth, soft and no bags or wrinkles. It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
    <li> I liked this product so much I purchased them for my whole face.  The packaging is very classy with beautiful silver foil design and everything is packaged airtight for sanitary product. Nice presentation. Shipping was as stated.</li>
    <li> These did not do a thing for my eye bags</li>
    <li> I loved this product. My eyes look much better. The half hour is a great time to just relax and enjoy some peace and quite time. I usually will do this first thing when I get up.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these at a Spa here in California for $15.00 for one treatment.  They are exactly the same as the spa, but they don&#x27;t have the spa name on it.  They can also be used more than once if you put them back in their container.  I put them in the fridge.  Love them and always will.  I&#x27;m very happy I found them online.</li>
    <li> You are better off going with cooled cucumber patch over your eyes.  This product is all about esthetics and lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I have notice some reduction of puffiness around my eyes. However, not a drastic change. I will to continue to finish the product.</li>
    <li> Nice product! They feel really cool and refreshing. I saw a difference in my under eye bags after the first use.  The instructions say that these can be reused up to two more times if they are washed, put back in their package and sealed in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> I do see improvement in under eye darkness but I do not like that I have to lay down for 20/30 minutes to use this.  If you try to sit up, they migrate down your face.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference right away</li>
    <li> This is an interesting concept, but I honestly saw no results. In fact, they made my eyes tear up a bit, which left them smaller than usual. These are swoosh-shaped, gel-like patches that stick to your skin, with no adhesives. You are instructed to lie flat while they are on, so although they would likely stay afixed, you really can&#x27;t do much moving once they are on. For under eye dark circles, the effect was zero. Nonetheless, it is nice to give yourself a reason to lie down for a 20 minute break, and the pads are cool.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing and super good quality.</li>
    <li> do not see any difference after applying it for few days...</li>
    <li> These really make my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Best eye de-stressors I&#x27;ve ever used!!! The fact that you can use each one three times is a great bonus. I will definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have tried several eye products as I have hereditary dark circles as well as getting some wrinkles. I noticed a difference even from the first use. My eye area is lighter and wrinkles are not as deep.  I will continue to use this product for sure.</li>
    <li> These really work.  I have deep hollows under my eyes that collect wrinkles when I&#x27;m dehydrated and also get puffy and horrible when I sleep poorly or eat late at night or drink alcohol.  Anyway, they are the bane of my existence.  These eye patches are nice and cooling, first of all, and they really do deliver moisture--and whatever else--through the skin.  The moisture--or whatever--plumps the wrinkles and fine lines out beautifully, and removes the baggy puffy thing that sometimes happens to me.  I have been using these whenever I want to turn things around within the hour.  They stay well enough on my face that I don&#x27;t have to lie down while I have them on, so I will just walk around with them, or watch a movie on the laptop, and keep them on for an hour.  That may not be good, because they dry out a little and aren&#x27;t as easy to reuse?  But I don&#x27;t really care; the gel-like slippery slimy eel leech silky squish feeling of them is my FAVORITE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  shocking, I know, but these completely work and if you have eye issues, you will be able to see it pretty clearly.</li>
    <li> Is the first time that i use this product and its good to use.  I recommended to womens who have an damage eye area.</li>
    <li> This really works!&lt;br /&gt;You could keep the patches longer if keep it in their trays and add few drops of water and keeping those in the refrigerator after using a set.</li>
    <li> These totally work. Love them!</li>
    <li> These were really good for puffiness under the eye and were very soothing as well.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> They do just what they say they will, I plan to buy more of them. Just love this product.</li>
    <li> I had smooth toned skin after just the first use. I felt great. I did notice that the second time I used them it interacted a little with the stalatic acid products ive been using. There was a little peeling in the area of application but im not a profesional so im sure it is a combination of something I did with all my products so I give this five stars. Im ordering another pack as I type :)</li>
    <li> These are horrible.  I think the company must have paid people to write good reviews.  They are so wet on first use that they don&#x27;t stay on your face even when laying down.  Also, with similar products, you see immediate improvement, which is what makes this kind of product great to use prior to events.  However, these do not provide any immediate effect.  I&#x27;ve used one packet three times so far.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. I wish I knew more about the company and how it produces these masks, as they are made in China. I keep these in the fridge, along with a de-puffing eye cream. I re-use them until they break(hint: keep a bit of water in the tray they come in; keeps them hydrated. They will dry out fast, otherwise) . I keep late hours and I am also older, so the puffiness in the AM may have a lot more to do with aging now versus lack of sleep. Putting these on cold with the eye cream helps considerably.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
    <li> Ive found others that slip off your face and can&#x27;t be worn during activities, these however do a good job of staying in place and allow you to continue with your day while you wear them around the house.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised that this product really hydrates and smoothes undereye lines in just a few minutes. You can use same patches for several days.  I will definitely be re-ordering this products.  And they feel very soothing!</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered this product because i do see a difference after I use it; smoother skin under my eyes with less fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been trying to use it 2-3 times a week.  They can be reused, but I&#x27;ve noticed the best results are after 1st time use.</li>
    <li> Got these for myself and all my bridesmaids for the morning of my wedding! They were so refreshing and helped the eye puffiness we were all experiencing and were a really fun gift! They felt cold and soothing &amp; I really loved them for any days you wake up for an event or in general and have puffy eyes that you want to soothe and get rid of!</li>
    <li> Do not ordered this lifting Anti-Collagen Eye Patch with Bio-Gold and Hyaluronic because it  DONOT work.please do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Feel good and relaxing on but haven&#x27;t really seen any changes or improvements.  But they feel good while on :)</li>
    <li> Liked the product and it did as promised - hydrate under eye area. However they slide around and had to adjust often. Wish they would stay put!!</li>
    <li> Results are good, but they don&#x27;t stay put.</li>
    <li> These are okay. I had used another brand but cannot remember the name of them that i really liked but these are okay!</li>
    <li> These eye pads are super moisturizing, and definitely make my bags less noticeable! I use them before events where I know they&#x27;ll be a lot of photos taken; weddings, parties etc.</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this product. It really works to smooth and plum the most sensitive under eye area. Even if it does not last long. The scent is relaxing and the cooling feeling gives me a spa-like experience. I just wish it was more reasonably priced so I could use it more often.</li>
    <li> You definitely see results the puffiness is visibly reduced as well as fine lines. I would recommend for quick more youthful eyes</li>
    <li> Have only used several times and I am not sure what I think of them as I have not seen a difference.</li>
