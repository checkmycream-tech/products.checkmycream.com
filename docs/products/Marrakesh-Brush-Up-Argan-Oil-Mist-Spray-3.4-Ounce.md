      <li>Smells lovely and does what its meant to do!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love it!!</li>
      <li>The scent is nice and it reduces static and frizz.</li>
      <li>If your hair is sensitive to humidity this line of products, when used in their recommended amounts, can give excellent results.</li>
      <li>A couple sprays of this and smoothing down my hair, and it&#x27;s great all day and a wonderful scent to boot!</li>
      <li>I love this for my hair</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>It will work better for me to spray on a brush or spray in my hand then run it through my hair.</li>
      <li>Tons better then the spray tip that came with the brush up in the gift set I ordered.</li>
      <li>I simply love this product.</li>
      <li>more straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Priced perfectly, and regardless of its smaller size, it lasted me about 2 and a 1/2 months (using it every day on shorter hair and twice a week on my arms and legs as a moisturizer).</li>
      <li>#60;3 Tames al the frizzies &amp; makes my hair super soft w/ perfect curls.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so silky soft and made my hair look great.</li>
      <li>but baby fine.  </li>
      <li>It soaks into your skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of like when you go swimming too many times and your hair feels gross and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>how cool is that?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is such a lovely, lush, fragrant way of loving my curls!</li>
      <li>it super shinny.</li>
      <li>but I love it more as a facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It smells very much like hemp, kind of deep and woodsy.</li>
      <li>I wish I could put it all over my body too - leaves a nice light shine in the hair, not too heavy</li>
      <li>My hair stylist recommended the de-tangler, then I discovered their whole line of hair care products!</li>
      <li>It has a really smoothing effect that gives me just the right finished look.</li>
      <li>Lightly scented (not as strong as the other products).</li>
      <li>It makes hair very shiny and healthy looking once brushed in.</li>
      <li>Seems too much oil when one applies.  </li>
      <li>Really like the smell too.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t really used it much.</li>
      <li>Absolutely perfect...Don&#x27;t think.</li>
      <li>The first time I use them my hair feels ok, but by the 2nd application of any of their products my hair feels coated and weighed down.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t make hair look oily (as long as you are holding it more than a foot away from your hair when spraying it on dry hair).</li>
      <li>Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It really sets off my slightly curly hair.</li>

<li> Definitely need to use sparingly so will last a long time.</li>

<li> It definitely has helped with rough areas on the back of my scalp that I lay on at night while I sleep.</li>
<li> This product does work but the Styling Elixir allows you to target specific trouble spots rather than a general area.  </li>

<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I use this product along with Marrakesh shampoo &amp; conditioner, and combing my wet hair has become like 75% easier!!</li>

<li> I usually use a sheen spray, like Lusters Pink.</li>
<li> use this on my dd very long curly thick hair</li>
<li> This product is a little too heavy for my hair.</li>
<li> I thought it would be heavy and make my hair look greasy after awhile</li>
<li> have to shampoo a few times over a few days to get the feeling to go away.</li>
<li> Not sure what this product is supposed to do</li>
<li> I usually just get the Marrakesh Argon &amp; Hemp Oil Styling Elixer but wanted to try this out.</li>
<li> It can make you look greasy if you go overboard.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s no good.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s very thick</li>
<li> Not recommended for people with thin hair.  </li>
<li> This is nasty and makes hair oily</li>

    <li> I use this after my hair is dry or any time I see frizz. You only need a little bit. It can make you look greasy if you go overboard. The smell is wonderful!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended the de-tangler, then I discovered their whole line of hair care products! I am now a total fan of all their products. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Not sure what this product is supposed to do but it just made my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> This product is a little too heavy for my hair. Definitely need to use sparingly so will last a long time.The scent is nice and it reduces static and frizz. I usually just get the Marrakesh Argon &amp; Hemp Oil Styling Elixer but wanted to try this out.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Insense,spicey,kinda like an unlit cigar but in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my dd very long curly thick hair it just soaks this stuff up it is great when I braid her hair&lt;br /&gt;makes it super shinny. We also use it on our skin quality stuff.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS ALL THE TIME AND I LOVE IT.  KATHRYN BILELLO THEWES</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to, but it will leave your hair oily.</li>
    <li> For some reason I recieved this product in my set (when it was not included... how cool is that?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, it works amazingly and smells perfect. It makes my fly-away hairs stay down and my &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34; little hairs around my face more straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But mostly, it smells so amazing that I don&#x27;t care if it didn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Ummm...YES!!! This product is amazing! I usually use a sheen spray, like Lusters Pink. But this stuff is absolutely delightful! It smells very much like hemp, kind of deep and woodsy. It makes hair very shiny and healthy looking once brushed in. This doesn&#x27;t make hair look oily (as long as you are holding it more than a foot away from your hair when spraying it on dry hair). It definitely has helped with rough areas on the back of my scalp that I lay on at night while I sleep. It has helped prevent split ends as well. I highlight my hair and that can be an issue for me, so this has helped quite a bit. Also works wonders on my skin. I use it on my arms and legs as a moisturizer. Priced perfectly, and regardless of its smaller size, it lasted me about 2 and a 1/2 months (using it every day on shorter hair and twice a week on my arms and legs as a moisturizer). Absolutely perfect...Don&#x27;t think. JUST BUY IT. You won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! Love, love, love it!! &amp;#60;3 Tames al the frizzies &amp; makes my hair super soft w/ perfect curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add-on to the gift set purchase. Great smell. Haven&#x27;t really used it much. Couple times I used it seams to do what it says. The mister spray on this one is great. Tons better then the spray tip that came with the brush up in the gift set I ordered.</li>
    <li> This product s amazing!! I have waist length highlight blond hair, it&#x27;s very thick but baby fine.  It&#x27;s always been quite the effort to comb it after I wash it.  I use this product along with Marrakesh shampoo &amp; conditioner, and combing my wet hair has become like 75% easier!! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist used this on me. I thought it would be heavy and make my hair look greasy after awhile but it didn&#x27;t. I absolutely love it. My hair felt so silky soft and made my hair look great. Really like the smell too.</li>
    <li> I simply love this product. The smell is amazing! It has a really smoothing effect that gives me just the right finished look. Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely and does what its meant to do!</li>
    <li> Not heavy, doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely, lush, fragrant way of loving my curls!</li>
    <li> This oil smells so delicious I wish I could put it all over my body too - leaves a nice light shine in the hair, not too heavy</li>
    <li> This is nasty and makes hair oily</li>
    <li> Not recommended for people with thin hair.  Seems too much oil when one applies.  I only use it once after purchasing.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do, reduce the frizzies. Smells incredible. Use it with the rest of the line.</li>
    <li> I notice these products coat my hair in some sort of plastic feeling? I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. My hair just feels unnatural after using the marrakesh products. The first time I use them my hair feels ok, but by the 2nd application of any of their products my hair feels coated and weighed down. It&#x27;s no good. It feels like it&#x27;s covered in silicone or something? I&#x27;ve never had this experience. It&#x27;s kind of like when you go swimming too many times and your hair feels gross and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to shampoo a few times over a few days to get the feeling to go away. I won&#x27;t be using this product ever again.</li>
    <li> This product does work but the Styling Elixir allows you to target specific trouble spots rather than a general area.  If your hair is sensitive to humidity this line of products, when used in their recommended amounts, can give excellent results.</li>
    <li> I love this for my hair but I love it more as a facial moisturizer. It soaks into your skin and makes it silky smooth.</li>
    <li> A bit heavy for spraying directly on my thick, but fine textured hair. Lightly scented (not as strong as the other products). It will work better for me to spray on a brush or spray in my hand then run it through my hair. It really sets off my slightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate for those of us that have fly-aways.  A couple sprays of this and smoothing down my hair, and it&#x27;s great all day and a wonderful scent to boot!</li>
