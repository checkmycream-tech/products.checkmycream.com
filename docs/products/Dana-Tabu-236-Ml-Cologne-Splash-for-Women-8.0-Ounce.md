      <li>It&#x27;s soooo nice to find a bottle of splash cologne (not spray)!</li>
      <li>i love it and it smells wonderful on me.</li>
      <li>This cologne smells so good, I use it in a perfume mister that I purchased separately.</li>
      <li>I have always loved Tabu, but not used it in years.  </li>
      <li>originally created by Jean Carles,  legendary in the perfume industry.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love the product, have used it for over 30 years and get compliments all the time on how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>strongly suggest not to buy this product as there is point in using something that smells good, but leaves stains all over your clothes.</li>
      <li>THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!!!</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Cindy :)</li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>It was my mother&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
      <li>so glad that I found where I can purchase it.</li>
      <li>I love this splash bottle!!!I have been looking for this forever....</li>
      <li>I used this for many years, then it disappeared.  </li>
      <li>I am so wanting to smell the original Tabu which owned the room!  </li>
      <li>This size bottle makes it easy to use, and the fragrence just lasts and lasts.</li>
      <li>It is one of the classic fragrances that women have loved for over 50 years.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as the spray.  </li>
      <li>It makes this older lady feel good.</li>
      <li>it came quickly!</li>
      <li>I just wish I had ordered it in spray...but that still doesn&#x27;t change how fantastic this cologne is.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t enjoy this scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is classic, and no matter where I go, I never cease to get compliments and admiration for this amazing fragrance.....</li>
      <li>So, I was excited when I saw it again.</li>
      <li>It also has this ghastly orange color not in keeping with the original Tabu.  </li>
      <li>I could see the cologne stain on the box and knew right away it had leaked.</li>
      <li>the other reviews are true and people have been comfortably using it for many years, I wonder If amazon sent me a duplicate piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this has absolutely no semblance to the original lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>My hubby &amp; I have been married for 50 yrs.</li>
      <li>long lasting and smells great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong, and not a good strong.</li>
      <li>Thanks, Barb</li>
      <li>I wish the body lotion would become available in larger sizes as well..</li>
      <li>It is impossible to find the 8 ounce bottle in stores in my area, so I was very excited to find it at Amazon at such a great price.</li>
      <li>I only had old bottles left that did not smell any more.</li>
      <li>and I love the scent as it is not overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Very upsetting, but with that scent I really don&#x27;t mind that some of it was wasted.</li>
      <li>It smells nothing like the original, the fragrance disappears as soon as it dries &amp; has no redeeming qualities.</li>
      <li>The scent is a little different than my other tabu perfume, more of a hint of cinnamon ,not sure I like it as much</li>

    <li> I personally don&#x27;t enjoy this scent. It&#x27;s very strong, and not a good strong. The packaging was anything but well-packaged. I could see the cologne stain on the box and knew right away it had leaked. When I opened the box, about a quarter of the bottle was spilled. Very upsetting, but with that scent I really don&#x27;t mind that some of it was wasted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as gift for my mother. She been using it for years but past few years we couldn&#x27;t find it. Im so glad that I found where I can purchase it.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells so good, I use it in a perfume mister that I purchased separately.</li>
    <li> The scent is a little different than my other tabu perfume, more of a hint of cinnamon ,not sure I like it as much</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Dana Tabu ! ! I remember this from when I was a teenager, and it came in the case with the little black cat with glitter on it. I have used this perfume for years, and there is simply nothing else that compares with the fragrence of Tabu. It is one of the classic fragrances that women have loved for over 50 years. This size bottle makes it easy to use, and the fragrence just lasts and lasts. Perfect for a gift, and perfect for yourself....</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I received the package because part of the cologne had leaked out.

    <li> I have been wearing Tabu by Dana since 1965. Everyone who knows me knows when I enter the room they can tell I have been there because of my Tabu fragrance. It&#x27;s me. I love it. I only had old bottles left that did not smell any more. So I ordered it. I feel lost with out my Tabu. It makes this older lady feel good. My mom used to say why use only one type of perfume. i love it and it smells wonderful on me. It came in great shape and smells wonderful. Great job. Just love it.</li>
    <li> i loved it! it came quickly! THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH!!! best prices! awesome!!! Again, i would recommend this site to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bought this after reading the reviews. when I opened the bottle a few drops fell on my clothes and it turned in to an orange colored stain.&lt;br /&gt;Thought the stain will go away as it evaporates. It had been 3 hrs now. I still see the ugly orange stain on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the other reviews are true and people have been comfortably using it for many years, I wonder If amazon sent me a duplicate piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest not to buy this product as there is point in using something that smells good, but leaves stains all over your clothes.</li>
    <li> long lasting and smells great.</li>
    <li> I used this for many years, then it disappeared.  So, I was excited when I saw it again.</li>
    <li> What can on say about TABU....originally created by Jean Carles,  legendary in the perfume industry. Established in 1932 in Barcelona, Spain but later moved to Paris. In 1940 it came to America during the German occupation of France in World War ll. It&#x27;s advertisement is from a 1901 painting, inspired by the same title as Tolstoy, The Kreutzer Sonata by Rene-Xavier Prinet, depicting \\&quot;a violinist, overcome with passion, breaking off his performance to embrace his female accompanist\\&quot;. Titled \\&quot;Tabu, the forbidden fragrance\\&quot; is considered a classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is classic, and no matter where I go, I never cease to get compliments and admiration for this amazing fragrance.....</li>
    <li> My mom loves this perfume.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Tabu, but not used it in years.  It was my mother&#x27;s favorite.  I wear it and Chanel no. 5 exclusively.  Big difference in price.  I will continue to buy Tabu from you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this all of my life (I&#x27;m 47) and my mom before me.  I have always gotten compliments on this cologne.  What I like best is that I can literally douse myself in it and I do not smell it on me.  It&#x27;s been around since the 1930&#x27;s and is a great smelling, inexpensive cologne.</li>
    <li> I love this splash bottle!!!I have been looking for this forever....I hope you will always continue making this available!!! I wish the body lotion would become available in larger sizes as well.. A very happy customer! Cindy :)</li>
    <li> My mother smells the same as she did when I was a little girl. This perfume/cologne isn&#x27;t something you can find just anywhere..</li>
    <li> Perfume my mama allways wore.</li>
    <li> Dana Tabu Cologne is the only fragrance and I love the scent as it is not overwhelming. I just wish I had ordered it in spray...but that still doesn&#x27;t change how fantastic this cologne is. Love it! Get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Great for my Mom who adores this scent.</li>
    <li> mixed with Chantilly, it is a dream; I spray it around the house</li>
    <li> raised on this scent -  wearing since the 60&#x27;s</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soooo nice to find a bottle of splash cologne (not spray)! I refill my small atomizer with this cologne, to carry in my purse...</li>
    <li> Awesome. I have used nothing but Tabu since I was in my 20&#x27;s. I am 69 and would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as the spray.  I am disappointed because I was so excited to find such a big bottle.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Just had my 69th b&#x27;day &amp; have been wearing Tabu since I was 16! My hubby &amp; I have been married for 50 yrs. &amp; he won&#x27;t let me wear any other fragrance!!! So, please don&#x27;t stop making it! Thanks, Barb</li>
    <li> terrible! this has absolutely no semblance to the original lovely fragrance.  This was my mother&#x27;s signature fragrance and I so missed it I thought I would give this a try.  I am so disappointed!  It smells nothing like the original, the fragrance disappears as soon as it dries &amp; has no redeeming qualities. It also has this ghastly orange color not in keeping with the original Tabu.  I am so wanting to smell the original Tabu which owned the room!  Please save your money as well as the remembrance of a superior fragrance not to be confused with this terrible &#x27;wanna be&#x27;!</li>
