<li> Non organic NOW oils have a strange chemical smell to them, its very subtle but its there.</li>
<li> I defuse this almost every day especially now that it is cold season and stuffie noses</li>
<li> I have done this for at least 4 months now</li>
<li> Needless to say, it tends on not having a welcoming smell!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the peppermint in my bath, in my laundry (to scent unscented detergent) and on my face and scalp.  As a woman over 40 I&#x27;m always looking for tricks to improve my skin and keep it healthy looking.  This has become one of them.  I use it this way once or twice a week.  Although I&#x27;ve never seen anyone advise on using Peppermint oil on the face, I have found that a tiny drop mixed with jojoba oil or grapeseed oil revitalizes my skin.  When I wake up in the morning my skin seems to have a glow, and looks a little plumper too.</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Use it for toothpaste and deodorant. Good size for the price.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Very concentrated and is certified organic</li>
    <li> I use this in my DIY toothpaste, which is just coconut oil, baking soda, and peppermint oil. It has the loveliest smell.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for mice, I have tried everything else so I hope this works. This is a great price I got some at a health store and paid a lot more than amazon.</li>
    <li> Since it&#x27;s concentrated, the smell is VERY STRONG!&lt;br /&gt;I dab some over a q-tip swab and the smell is still very strong....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good though ;) just too strong...</li>
    <li> I have a photography studio in a room in a large 60+ year old shed in the back of my property.  It often gets a musty smell.  It also shares a wall with my husbands workshop which smells of wood shavings and gasoline as well as a plethora of other odors!  Needless to say, it tends on not having a welcoming smell!  We also tend to have seasonal field mice who tend to want to live there in the fall and winter.  I have read that this is a natural mice deterrent so thought I could get double benefits, to try to improve the odor while deterring the mice.  I put some oil on cotton balls which was easy to do with the plastic insert in the top so it did not all pour out.  I put them in the corners of the room, and re-placed them every 3-6 weeks.  I have done this for at least 4 months now so it&#x27;s given me a bit of insight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*The studio did start smelling much better and fresher.  I was not worried when I had a client coming over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;*The fresh peppermint smell varied based on how recently I put out new cotton balls.  Sometimes it was a bit strong, and other times it was not as noticable.  While I would have preferred it to be more consistent and to last longer I can understand there are limitations so did not take away a star for this.&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t think it worked as well on the mice as I would have hoped, as I still found signs of them being in residence.  Perhaps I needed to refresh the cotton balls more often?  I will try this next fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general I am satisfied, yet not thrilled.  I will continue to search for a better natural mice deterent.</li>
    <li> Love NOW oils and the fact that they have an organic option for the peppermint</li>
    <li> Use this on a cotton ball, and spread on all entrances for keeping out bugs and mice. Mix blends for pain. Put in diffuser for a &amp;#34;pick-me-up. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best! Helps when I have tension headaches. Makes my feet feel clean. And has a wonderful smell!</li>
    <li> I defuse this almost every day especially now that it is cold season and stuffie noses</li>
    <li> Love it.  Perfect for chocolate making where extract wouldn&#x27;t be ideal because water is an issue.</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff!!! 😃</li>
    <li> Wonderful for stomach/ nausea problems</li>
    <li> I love the organic peppermint oil. I love peppermint smell and this product is great.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Has a cleaner smell than the NOW non-organic peppermint oil.</li>
    <li> Tired of buying countless wax scent tarts, I purchased this.  One or two drops on the heated wax and my office smells great and keeps me energized all day.</li>
    <li> i love how versatile peppermint oil and now is such a trusted brand. such a great product, thank you. :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  I use absorb it into my mouth and spit it out.  Better than coffee.  Great for digestion and liver.  Super price</li>
    <li> If you want good oil and don’t mind lousy shipping, get this.  The warehouse just tosses these oils in a bag, the tops come slightly loose, and oil get everywhere.  I complained, got an apology from Amazon, so I gave them a second chance.  The next time the exact same thing happened.  Good luck…</li>
    <li> Iv bought numerous peppermint essential oils over the past year from different brands, and this organic peppermint has, in my opinion been the highest quality. Non organic NOW oils have a strange chemical smell to them, its very subtle but its there. the organic ones smell great..potent&lt;br /&gt; oils. I&#x27;d recommend and i will be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I chose the rating, because I have been using this product for years, for headaches, I would recommend for those, that like Natural living.</li>
    <li> came when expected and was as described</li>
    <li> We want to give you 5 stars AND we feel you ought to know NOT to use plastic at this point, please use hemp</li>
    <li> Nice and strong, but a little looser than I expected.  I&#x27;m used to a thicker peppermint oil in the non-organic brands.  This was quite loose. Almost watery, but not in scent.</li>
    <li> This oil is very potent in scent and efficacy. I use the product mainly on the skin and hair end five drops provide me with desired effects.</li>
    <li> No alcohol, as I needed it, to make my Organic hemp oil tooth soap, which sells for $50 for an 1 oz on the internet. I also made my own similar form of Cannadent rejuvenating toothpaste as well. Works great. I&#x27;ll be purchasing as needed.</li>
    <li> The Now Peppermint oil is also very nice in fragrance to work with this holiday season. It also keeps the little mice out of the house as they detest mints.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil, looks and smells like the pricier oils.</li>
    <li> High quality. Plan to order again.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wholefoods sold for twice the price, thank you Amazon. Product would of gotta five stars but it took two weeks to be delivery.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand and type of essential oil. USDA certified too!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews before I buy anything. There were mixed reviews concerning NOW EO&#x27;s but I purchased it because of the price. I can truly say this is no watered down oil. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. You do not need very much of this for whatever you&#x27;re making or doing. I bought this for my homemade toothpaste and its heavenly. I HIGHLY recommend this product and brand.&lt;br /&gt;With all that positivity said, I did not give 5 stars since the bottle was opened upon arrival (the seal was NOT cracked but somehow it was untwisted a tad and some had leaked out...BUT my mailbox STILL smells like Christmas haha!).&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this EO!</li>
    <li> Great quality, great price, what else can I say?  I use this as a refresher by placing a few drops in a bowl with water and ice cubes.  I place a wash cloth in the bowl and place it on my head on hot summer days.  Ahhhhhhhhh refreshing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, to keep my hair and scalp feeling fresh between washes (I go to the gym daily), I place a few drops of organic eucalyptus and jojoba oil on my finger tips and massage my scalp.  Very cooling, very refreshing.</li>
    <li> works great, strong aroma and flavor.</li>
    <li> I use this on my son mostly for his ADHD it really calms him and makes him happy! When he feels like he needs his oil he ask me for it, so i feel it must be working if he notices it! Love the NOW brand great on my budget!</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and really like the smell and quality.  I use it for a product I make.</li>
    <li> very fresh. I like this &#x27;NOW&#x27; brand... you get what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> I dilute this oil and add it to my oils for a scalp treatment whenever I feel like the shampoo is drying out my scalp or if I have product build up. A little goes a long way and there is an eye-dropper like dispenser attached to the bottle which limits the amount of spilling that can occur.</li>
    <li> great to make your own mouthwash and after dinner mint...</li>
</ol>
