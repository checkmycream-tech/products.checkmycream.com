<li> came with hairs inside the tube packages, one had some green in it like a leaf or something.. not convinced they are sterilized and sent them back.</li>
<li> The needles are shoved so far down into the tube, all the way to the weld, that the whole setup is worthless.</li>
<li> These needles suck bottom line, half the needles were barbed, and the rubber grips slide off like they are to big.do not buy....</li>
<li> Not many other disposables can compete.</li>

<li> Not every package is like that though and for the money I can stand a few lemons.  </li>
<li> The tubes are poorly made,specially on the tip end.</li>
<li> i might consider you again, when i need the wrong size...</li>
<li> SERIOUSLY!!!!!!</li>

    <li> Great product and easy to use. perfect for fast use and clean up, very convenient and nice when you want to keep cranking out tatt&#x27;s</li>
    <li> Not all packages are fully sealed.  The safety label didn&#x27;t turn and still shows that the product is not sterilized. Not every package is like that though and for the money I can stand a few lemons.  That being said, I don&#x27;t use them daily, their typically on smaller pieces that aren&#x27;t as technical and don&#x27;t need a better setup.</li>
    <li> Regular needles and good grips.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY!!!!!! The picture shows that these tubes expired in 2013!!!! How can you legally or even consciously/morally sell these !?!? show proof that they&#x27;re not expired and I will remove this post. you have nothing in your ad or description that says they are an expired product. In most states it is illegal to use These as packaged.</li>
    <li> I got the right needles inside good packaging, but recieved the wrong size needles...thanks anyway i might consider you again, when i need the wrong size...</li>
    <li> 1inc grip was perfect! Item came pretty fast. Overall is better Quality for an online purchase.  I would recommend it to fellow artist.</li>
    <li> it came fast adn the pacakge was ...well it was ok but still wort the money  the expirence day was for 2013  and the needdles are very nice so you should try</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> They came in the color blue. I love them. Will definatly order from them again. Fast shipping and had no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Ive never used grip/needle combos. I like it but the only draw back is that you have to pull the needle out to bend it then re insert the needle again. Basically defeating the purpose of having a pre inserted needle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no needles are bent or balled. Im happy with the product</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! Came quickly in mail, no defects in packaging, good grips and fits anything.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Good item. Good Seller.</li>
    <li> Very few disposables meet my standards as far as quality. These tubes are quality at its finest. Not many other disposables can compete.</li>
    <li> The tubes are poorly made,specially on the tip end. Where there is burr left from the mold,so the needle did not run smoothly.</li>
    <li> The needles are shoved so far down into the tube, all the way to the weld, that the whole setup is worthless. The needles are cheap and blunt. Paid extra for next day delivery and received them three days later. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time.</li>
    <li> These needles suck bottom line, half the needles were barbed, and the rubber grips slide off like they are to big.do not buy....its like that old saying.......you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Came fast but didn&#x27;t fit my O Ring for the needle.</li>
    <li> WILL DO BUSINESS WITH AGAIN</li>
    <li> came with hairs inside the tube packages, one had some green in it like a leaf or something.. not convinced they are sterilized and sent them back.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to other places</li>
    <li> First off its a great price, and the needles are not that bad. But this package was not up to par. 9 of the tube/grip/needle combo packages were open. Those were trashed. Not sterile. Now I have to question buying from seller again. Buy with caution.</li>
