      <li>I use it daily - great product!</li>
      <li>Love the product!&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I wish the the highlighter was a tad more luminous.</li>
      <li>I truly love ALL their products.  </li>
      <li>The colors are phenomenal.</li>
      <li>and I love them ALL.  </li>
      <li>And am I glad it did.  </li>
      <li>Love the bronze/coppery blush color.</li>
      <li>Love, wish the picture was more accurate</li>
      <li>So thrilled that I chose this for my first of many sets to come.</li>
      <li>good product its very pigment</li>
      <li>so one has to go in light with it.</li>
      <li>The colors are rich.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>I suggest doing an image search on Google to see true image.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m lucky Sleek</li>
      <li>First time an eyeshadow has produced that effect for me, no joke!  </li>
      <li>Other than that, blends beautifully and very silky to touch.  </li>
      <li>Aww who am I kidding.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you like something compact, all in one, high quality and easy to use contouring and blush/bronzer palette.</li>
      <li>Definitely make sure you use primer</li>
      <li>Exactly what I ordered</li>
      <li>is, dare I say it???, better pigmented and longer lasting....</li>
      <li>Great for me for the long run though as product will last FOREVER, literally!  </li>
      <li>Really fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I like that I am able to still use it and it does not have to wait until next spring to use again</li>
      <li>I will definitely be purchasing more Sleek makeup.</li>
      <li>The Sleek Makeup Face Form is exactly what I need for filming my training and marketing videos.</li>
      <li>Delivery was super fast thanks.</li>
      <li>The powders blend very well.</li>
      <li>It works great, only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
      <li>This is my first Sleek product and kudos to Global Beauty Store for a super fast international shipping - exactly 7 days</li>
      <li>Highly pigmented.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend $20-$40 for high end contouring palette</li>
      <li>I started off using just the highlighter and the dark brown, I have an olive complexion and it worked great, I would finish off with a little blush.</li>
      <li>Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the pictures should be more true to shade.</li>
      <li>I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK.</li>
      <li>I watch a lot of YouTube and saw it being used quite frequently so</li>
      <li>So far I have purchased the Au Natural Pallet, the Storm Pallet, the Blush by 3 in Lace, and the Face Form Contour</li>
      <li>my nice dark complexion has diminished and my face in dull, so I now use the bronzer and highlighter and it is not too much for my winter color skin.</li>
      <li>It is highly pigmented so you might wanna be a little careful the first time you use it, try it on your arm first to know how much you have to pick up with your brush, other than that</li>
      <li>If this ws not clear, I ordered the medium at first and the dark later on.</li>

    <li> Really fast shipping! Got it in no time! I love this palette! Contouring is really easy now!</li>
    <li> Loving my sleek face form palette!! Especially the contouring powder and the bronzer!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;Pigment is great! Item is easy to blend! Medium would be great for most skin tones.  I am golden brown and this works great on me!</li>
    <li> It works great, only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like. Definitely make sure you use primer</li>
    <li> I loooooove this.the best so far. Delivery was super fast thanks.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a powder contour, saw this recommended on you tube and order this product and I&#x27;m very happy.  In the future I intend to order in a darker shade</li>
    <li> I am not really a make up person but because of Sleek, I am now! This is my first Sleek product and kudos to Global Beauty Store for a super fast international shipping - exactly 7 days and I am in Hawaii. I will definitely be purchasing more Sleek makeup. The Sleek Makeup Face Form is exactly what I need for filming my training and marketing videos. Highly recommended if you like something compact, all in one, high quality and easy to use contouring and blush/bronzer palette. So thrilled that I chose this for my first of many sets to come. I don&#x27;t just like it - I love it!</li>
    <li> I just wanna say this product is the BOMB! I watch a lot of YouTube and saw it being used quite frequently so I decided to give it a try.  And am I glad it did.  This is the only product I use for contouring.  It blends well ands last all day.  I would highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I started off using just the highlighter and the dark brown, I have an olive complexion and it worked great, I would finish off with a little blush. Well now that we are in the dead of winter my nice dark complexion has diminished and my face in dull, so I now use the bronzer and highlighter and it is not too much for my winter color skin. I like that I am able to still use it and it does not have to wait until next spring to use again</li>
    <li> I recommend it. Good product.</li>
    <li> Use this often love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I got it in Medium shade and it works great for my tone skin (medium).  It is highly pigmented so you might wanna be a little careful the first time you use it, try it on your arm first to know how much you have to pick up with your brush, other than that, it is great, very high quality!</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I wanted don&#x27;t think its dark enough for me to contour with.</li>
    <li> good product its very pigment so one has to go in light with it. Blush color should have had more color though looks like an extra bronzer.</li>
    <li> This is the best contour palette I&#x27;ve ever used. I want to say that the bronzer is basically useless for me as I don&#x27;t use it. However, the contour and highlight colours are PERFECT for my tan skintone. For reference, I&#x27;m an NC40 in mac and south asian. The powders blend very well.</li>
    <li> Loves the texture of these powders...they blend like a dream.</li>
    <li> OMG! Received today ... got in a week. The colors are phenomenal. Perfect with my skin tone (medium to olive--depending on season). The colors are rich. Now I understand what everyone is talking about. My only regret--I ordered other products throughout the summer ... trying, testing, mixing, matching. Sleek is a one stop, final platform for me! I just ordered additional face form to change things up a bit as well as the Havanna lip pallette. I am so looking forward to my next delivery.</li>
    <li> Great pigmentation and quick shipping! Arrived in 1 week and its an international shipment. I ordered another product internationally the same day and I have yet to receive it. Great matte contouring color but I wish the the highlighter was a tad more luminous. Still an awesome highlighter, nontheless. Love the bronze/coppery blush color. Exceptional!</li>
    <li> Excelente súper bueno ilumina muy bien</li>
    <li> I like the two lighter colors and they show up beautifully on my skin. Not too thrilled with the darker color. But for the price I am far from disappointed.</li>
    <li> Provides awesome contouring and was shipped before the estimated arrival date!</li>
    <li> These shades are amazing and have very good pigmentation. They are a bit smaller in person than they look online. Also instead of trusting the above images I would recommend looking at the shades on the official sleek website but still coming back and buying from this seller! I live in the United States and my package arrived within 5 days from the UK. I was amazed. Everything was also packaged VERY well and professionally.</li>
    <li> GREAT product, great seller. Came weeks before the estimated shipping. Coming from the UK to the US it took about a week. My only complaint is that the pictures should be more true to shade. The contour shade on the medium palette looked dark on the picture, but ended up being my skin tone. It is the summer, so I think it will work for me in the winter months. But the pictures should definitely be updated. However the product was satisfactory and the customer service was great, so I did not mind purchasing this palette in &amp;#34;dark,&amp;#34; Best band for mu buck, and I&#x27;m CHEAP. Made a great first contour palette but I would buy it for anyone. If this ws not clear, I ordered the medium at first and the dark later on.</li>
    <li> Good pigmentation and color selection for contouring and highlighting. Didn&#x27;t want to spend $20-$40 for high end contouring palette so I&#x27;m lucky Sleek has this product in trio colors. Definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> Love, wish the picture was more accurate</li>
    <li> Highly pigmented.  A little goes a looooong looooong way.  I had to get used to dipping my makeup brush ever so slightly into pot.  Great for me for the long run though as product will last FOREVER, literally!  Other than that, blends beautifully and very silky to touch.  Oh and best part is, I&#x27;m a waitress at a very popular bar here in Hawaii and it LASTED THE WHOLE SHIFT WITHOUT CAKING!  First time an eyeshadow has produced that effect for me, no joke!  Love the beautiful color pallets.  So far I have purchased the Au Natural Pallet, the Storm Pallet, the Blush by 3 in Lace, and the Face Form Contour and I love them ALL.  Currently working on purchasing the Oh so special and maybe the Arabian Nights or Bad Girl.  Aww who am I kidding.  I&#x27;m probably going to purchase them all.  If you want bang for your buck, you need to try Sleek.  I truly love ALL their products.  I can absolutely guarantee you will not be disappointed!  Oh and almost forgot, a lot of these colors are dupes for Mac and Naked eye shadows except Sleek is, dare I say it???, better pigmented and longer lasting....lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are not the greatest for showing what eye shadow pallet or blush colors really look like.  I suggest doing an image search on Google to see true image.</li>
    <li> I use it daily - great product! Exactly what I ordered</li>
    <li> I used this color for contouring. The color lasts la long time through out the day</li>
    <li> its perfect, i love it</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this contour kit! I have no reason to use any other kid. Love love love!!</li>
