      <li>This Is a great shaver.</li>
      <li>My daughter says it works great, but if you have any aversion to even the slightest of pain, it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
      <li>For an inexpensive item, this did quite a good job.  </li>
      <li>Though it was quite inexpensive, so I guess that should not be surprising.</li>
      <li>Still, it does a good job at getting rid of hairs.</li>
      <li>You will be completely satisfied!  </li>
      <li>I am an avid tweezer, so this is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I liked the item, so I thought I got a defective product, returned it, and ordered it again.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how good this works!!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>This thing is very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I am returning it and spending the money on a better one.</li>
      <li>Just a fantastic product that will get in those itty bitty spots!  </li>
      <li>With this price I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality...</li>
      <li>I was mostly satisfied with this product until it quit working.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed using this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the job it does.  </li>
      <li>Still glad to have it, I must learn to work it better.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m looking for one of better quality.</li>
      <li>which is not so good.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and will get a better one.</li>
      <li>Incredible because of how sensitive my skin is and having rosacea.</li>
      <li>and it surely does the job for me.  </li>
      <li>I so wanted to love this.</li>
      <li>I am glad I purchased it</li>
      <li>Great item fast delivery</li>
      <li>this was my first epilator works good for me...</li>
      <li>Very cool to have something that makes my grooming routine easier.</li>
      <li>Works better than the cheap ones in the stores.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, though I&#x27;ve had some issues with it causing breakouts.  </li>
      <li>for me, it was easy to get over, the discomfort, as I was use to plucking hairs, ...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for why I purchased it.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my eyebrow and lip areas, where it works fine.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The hairs on my face are fine.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had some problems with the on/off switch not fully engaging.  </li>
      <li>This newest model is much much better than the first.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the most intense pain you can experience without waxing.</li>
      <li>and thought this might be more gentle on bikini lines and underarms.</li>
      <li>But this thing really does remove the hair, and although it hurts a bit, it&#x27;s more of a pinch here and there - not nearly as painful as waxing.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me</li>
      <li>Had the larger model for legs for many many years.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this item and would recommend it.</li>
      <li>After a couple of uses the facial hairs came out more easily.  </li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to expensive waxing and can be done in the privacy of your own home.</li>
      <li>product is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I can easy remove hair quite quickly and it is certainly not as messy as waxing.</li>
      <li>RIGHT AND DOES</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so fine that waxing doesn&#x27;t work, and depilatories irritate my skin, even the mild ones meant for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Great product, but be prepared for a little pain!</li>
      <li>I have very fine facial hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27; m upset with myself thinking something that cost less will do a good job.</li>
      <li>Regular tweezers were a joke trying to get fine hairs!</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>VERY EASY TO USE AND THEYLAST A LONG TIME.</li>
      <li>Good price for a little tool like this</li>
      <li>No complicated.  </li>
      <li>First time I bought anything like this.</li>
      <li>I now can get rid of hair in just a few minutes without any need for bright lighting or to wait for the hair to grow out.  </li>
      <li>Worked great the first couple of times, and slowly died.</li>
      <li>Expect the results to be better after several uses.</li>
      <li>so I got this thinking it will help well first off</li>
      <li>This is my first Epilady purchase.</li>
      <li>The slower you go the more of a chance there is that it will pick up the hair obviously.  </li>
      <li>I had been having more facial hair than I wanted and it had become unsightly.  </li>
      <li>The first time I bought it it broke after the first use.</li>
      <li>Price is surely right and it works very well.</li>
      <li>I was expecting the unit to be more sensitive to my sensitive areas.</li>
      <li>a few days later I honestly think its better to shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;it was so easy to remove my facial</li>
      <li>I have some fine, blond hair on my upper lip and at the corners of my mouth.</li>
      <li>This little tool is so easy to use and clean.  </li>
      <li>Still pinches the skin, but doesn&#x27;t remove the hair very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made and won&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take off much hair.i</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this epilator!</li>
      <li>Looks very cheap..and it works with 1 AA Battery.</li>
      <li>I must say it works very well.</li>
      <li>I really like this</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
      <li>so I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would require as much work as it does, but it does.  </li>
      <li>this worked better than i expected</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice, just because I haven&#x27;t needed it more frequently.</li>
      <li>With just a regular battery, this thing lacks power, but is able to hande sensitive spots.  </li>
      <li>Not very powerful, but ok for the money.</li>
      <li>It works good on the really small facial hairs, but above my lip requires more work, and even so I still did not get all of the hairs.  </li>
      <li>It takes some time and you do have to go over areas a few times but it is very easy.</li>
      <li>that is small and handy and no longer having waxing expenses.</li>
      <li>I found it to work best on skin that has just been washed and dried, before any moisturizer or other facial products are applied.</li>
      <li>The only reasons I did not give it 5 stars are that it did not remove 100% of the hair, especially the finest hair, and it seems pretty cheaply made.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with this little gadget.  </li>
      <li>Spend a few $ more and get a plug in type.</li>
      <li>I placed a new AA battery in it as soon as I received it.</li>
      <li>It can hurt like the dickens in some spots like the upper lip area but it does exactly what you want it to do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First time I bought anything like this. So, I went for the least expensive. I must say it works very well. The few hairs I need to get rid of stay gone for a lot longer than plucking them. I may buy others now!</li>
    <li> It can hurt like the dickens in some spots like the upper lip area but it does exactly what you want it to do. It gets the hair out and what grows back is finer each time you use it. Eventually there will be no hair. Very cool to have something that makes my grooming routine easier.</li>
    <li> Looks very cheap..and it works with 1 AA Battery. ..which is not so good.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and will get a better one.</li>
    <li> This epilady does not work.  The wheel stops when I put it up to my chin.</li>
    <li> Broke after one short use.  DO NOT BUY! Spend a few $ more and get a plug in type. This battery operated one was a complete joke.</li>
    <li> Epilady EP-803 Face does not have enough power with only one battery. It slows down with the least bit of pressure on the skin.</li>
    <li> This thing is very cheaply made. I placed a new AA battery in it as soon as I received it. It failed to start. I tried a different battery. No go. I am returning it and spending the money on a better one.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> This product really deserves 0 stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for this since I had previously used an Epilady on my legs - which worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face and it did NOT remove 1 single hair for over 10 minutes.  And I know there were plenty of hairs, because I randomly (without looking) took a tweezers to my face and pulled out a bunch of hairs.  I&#x27;ve used it several times since, and it still doesn&#x27;t work  I think it may have pulled out 1 or 2 hairs after repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hairs on my face are fine.  This is what is listed on the package, \\&quot;Removes even the shortest and finest hairs by the root ....\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did NOT work for me at all!!!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive item, this did quite a good job.  Have only used it twice.  Expect the results to be better after several uses.</li>
    <li> this worked better than i expected</li>
    <li> It never worked, even after I just opened. I complained to amazon and got a new one, that one stopped working after 2 uses and even then it did not work that well.</li>
    <li> I had read all the reviews before purchasing this in fact I was on the fence. Then I decided to purchase it. My was a kit and it came with legend 4th generation . I have  given this 4 weeks and this is a joke. I have very fine facial hair and yes it hurts but it wouldn&#x27;t be bad if the pain showed results. I&#x27; m upset with myself thinking something that cost less will do a good job. I could have applied my $$ to the no no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money.  Item not as described, does not remove any hair.</li>
    <li> This product seemed to cut the hairs instead of pull them from the root....I sent it back and 4 weeks later they are saying it wasn&#x27;t received... I will probably get charged for an item I don&#x27;t even have anymore!!!!</li>
    <li> With this price I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality... but it works great ! Had the larger model for legs for many many years.</li>
    <li> Worked great the first couple of times, and slowly died. I tried replacing the battery and it still isn&#x27;t working.</li>
    <li> This did not get every hair, which I was surprised because the hairs I was trying to get were long and thick. Also, it was waaaaay more painful than waxing. Totally abandoned and going back to waxing.</li>
    <li> Do you like the feel of a voracious creature biting, pinching, and tearing flesh off of your body? If not, then you will probably not enjoy this device. It literally tears the hair off you. I bought it for my wife and she only used it for 3 seconds. Don&#x27;t reccomend, however it does do what it says it will do.</li>
    <li> This Is a great shaver. I like it very much. It does everything they said it would. I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
    <li> When you use this, the hair grows back slowly and is very fine.  Easy to use and easy to maintain.</li>
    <li> Not very powerful, but ok for the money. However it stopped working completely after less than a month. And yes I changed batteries. I&#x27;m buying another today but it won&#x27;t be this brand.</li>
    <li> I am an avid tweezer, so this is awesome.  I use on my face all the time.  It does not hurt and it saves a lot of time versus the tweezers.</li>
    <li> My chin literally goes numb trying to get the hair off. It does not work. I still have to pluck out the hair, so I stopped using the Epilady.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item twice. The first time I bought it it broke after the first use. I liked the item, so I thought I got a defective product, returned it, and ordered it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second product broke after about 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase this. It&#x27;s cheaply made and won&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it.  It only worked four or five times and then it died on me.  Now I&#x27;m looking for one of better quality.</li>
    <li> This gets the job done...but, one can not be afraid of some mild discomfort... for me, it was easy to get over, the discomfort, as I was use to plucking hairs, ... this makes the plucking less painful over all.</li>
    <li> I was expecting the unit to be more sensitive to my sensitive areas. But it is rather rough as the blades turn so fast.</li>
    <li> Just a fantastic product that will get in those itty bitty spots!  You will be completely satisfied!  Can&#x27;t say enough!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and would probably return the item except it is a personal item that should not be returned.</li>
    <li> It does hurt a bit in the beginning but once you get use to it it works great. I am glad I purchased it</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I have facial hair that I had shaved off and now it grows longer faster and darker and its ugly and no I have to shave it off every couple days and I don&#x27;t have the time so I got this thinking it will help well first off it does hurt but not like oters were describing it stings like an ant bite and only for a second and although I did see hair inside the machine I still had a tone of hair all over I tried it on my legs and same thing it took 10 times longer than shaving does and I still had hair everywhere then what little hair it did pull out grew back a few days later I honestly think its better to shave I think I will try a higher powered epilator because this one sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not good at all for thick hair on face.</li>
    <li> I really like this and it surely does the job for me.  Price is surely right and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I so wanted to love this. It just simple is junk. Needed it for facial hair, it jerked a few out once. Next time I tried it, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on! Changing batteries was of no help. Very disappointed, and wondering what is worth trying next.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about trying this after reading the negative reviews for this product, but I&#x27;m glad I tried it anyway. I have some fine, blond hair on my upper lip and at the corners of my mouth. It&#x27;s so fine that waxing doesn&#x27;t work, and depilatories irritate my skin, even the mild ones meant for sensitive skin. But this thing really does remove the hair, and although it hurts a bit, it&#x27;s more of a pinch here and there - not nearly as painful as waxing. It left my skin a bit red after I used it, but that went away quickly. It does take longer than waxing, and you do have to go over the area multiple times to pick up the hair. It also works best if you hold the skin taut, as recommended in the instructions. The only reasons I did not give it 5 stars are that it did not remove 100% of the hair, especially the finest hair, and it seems pretty cheaply made. Though it was quite inexpensive, so I guess that should not be surprising. I found it to work best on skin that has just been washed and dried, before any moisturizer or other facial products are applied. If my skin is too moist, it just slips around and does not catch the hair. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased with this item and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It worked poorly, even with many passes on skin.  It just didn&#x27;t remove any hairs well, not just the really short ones. Returned it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the most intense pain you can experience without waxing. I don&#x27;t recommend using it if you have a really sensitive face. I tried using it on my mustache area and nearly cried. However, it works great on the rest of my face. It gets rid of all the little hairs on my face and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that much at all. It takes time and you also run the risk of getting in grown hairs which can cause unsightly bumps that takes a week to go away. By the way, even make-up doesn&#x27;t cover up the bumps. Still, it does a good job at getting rid of hairs.</li>
    <li> It works good on the really small facial hairs, but above my lip requires more work, and even so I still did not get all of the hairs.  I am leery of pressing any harder.  I am blonde so I wasn&#x27;t thinking it would require as much work as it does, but it does.  Still glad to have it, I must learn to work it better.</li>
    <li> OUCH horrible product, don&#x27;t waste your money.  Hurts and still didn&#x27;t remove my facial hair.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how good this works!! And now I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it! Regular tweezers were a joke trying to get fine hairs! It&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable to use at first, but no worse than waxing and you get used to it! A must have to get rid of those pesky facial hairs!!</li>
    <li> not what I expected,  but does the job</li>
    <li> Having waxed (expensive) for years - I recently found the Epilady line of products. I have several different models and have found them to work well. This is a great alternative to expensive waxing and can be done in the privacy of your own home.</li>
    <li> Sucks.....does not remove facial hair fast enough and not good quality.</li>
    <li> My daughter had to have this, but said it was too painful for her.  We ended up giving it to her Grandma and she loves it.  My daughter says it works great, but if you have any aversion to even the slightest of pain, it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
    <li> This is my first Epilady purchase. Prior to I was waxing and it was getting expensive. If you can handle waxing you can handle this. It takes some time and you do have to go over areas a few times but it is very easy. I have used it for my bikini line with no problems.</li>
    <li> I had been having more facial hair than I wanted and it had become unsightly.  Waxing has too harsh for the sides of my face as I have very sensitive skin.  I had been using tweezers on my upper lip and did not want to \\&quot;shave\\&quot;.  This was the perfect solution! No problems at all!  Incredible because of how sensitive my skin is and having rosacea. After a couple of uses the facial hairs came out more easily.  I highly recommend this epilator! I was hesitant when I ordered it, but having put it to the test; it proved to be just what I needed!  It far exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> just what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> this was my first epilator works good for me...but i have to move again and again in the same place,picks the hair well...over all nice,worth the money.</li>
    <li> This newest model is much much better than the first. I can recommend it.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought (for travel).  The original model was not very good at all.  I still have it.  Had to take the roller shield off to get it to work at all, even on long hairs, and now the button sticks.</li>
    <li> The Epilady  I purchased did what it was advertised it would do.  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love! Once I turned 40 the hair on my upper lip and chin started to grow. Lucky for me the hair is blond, so less noticeably, but it still shows. I&#x27;ve been waxing my lip and chin for a number of years. It is hard to wax the curved areas of the chin -- the epliady face epil can get those curves that are hard to wax. I didn&#x27;t have any pain using this on my upper lip and chin -- it might be because I&#x27;m used to waxing. I can easy remove hair quite quickly and it is certainly not as messy as waxing. I use this once a week or so to keep you with hair growth. Some have said after lon-term use the hair grew back slower, I&#x27;m waiting to see if that will happen for me. I am very please with this purchase and highly recommend it for anyone with upper lip of chin hair.</li>
    <li> I use the larger epilator an my legs etc. and thought this might be more gentle on bikini lines and underarms. Still pinches the skin, but doesn&#x27;t remove the hair very well. I&#x27;ll stick with the larger one.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some problems with the on/off switch not fully engaging.  Sometimes it stays on, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s easy to use, though I&#x27;ve had some issues with it causing breakouts.  This is probably due to me holding it incorrectly.  All in all, it does o.k.&lt;br /&gt;for the price.</li>
    <li> I like it, it seems to do the trick if used regularly.</li>
    <li> I was truly hopeful that this would work on my facial hair. Not only is it painful, it didn&#x27;t remove the thick coarse hairs I needed it to, but my skin broke out in the areas it did remove. Haven&#x27;t tried bikini line yet &amp; I&#x27;m not optimistic.</li>
    <li> Sorry but I feel like I wasted 20.00 as this doesn&#x27;t do a thing to remove facial hair. Also batteries don&#x27;t last long in this.</li>
    <li> this product does not get the short hairs off the face.  I have to go over and over the spot to remove the hair, but the short hair is still there.  I have to end up using tweezers.</li>
    <li> It feels like a cheaper version of the larger Epilady, although it worked well,  for a week. Then it completely stopped working. Save all of your packaging for a while after you buy this, because you cannot return it without unfortunately. .</li>
    <li> I have used a different tweezer epilator that removed most of the hair I wished to epilate but this product, which I thought to try because it was an Epilady brand, was quite disappointing.  It only removed a few hairs while leaving most intact.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this product.&lt;br /&gt;it was so easy to remove my facial hairs.&lt;br /&gt;It was painless.&lt;br /&gt;it was faster and safer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to remove facial hair. Does it work? Well, it does remove facial hair. But not like I expected. It really doesn&#x27;t take off much hair.i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this .</li>
    <li> Great item fast delivery</li>
    <li> ordered it and it stopped working after once use.  Returned it and it stopped working just after the return policy expired.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting - but that was not it!!!!</li>
    <li> With just a regular battery, this thing lacks power, but is able to hande sensitive spots.  I would hesitantly recommend.</li>
    <li> Works better than the cheap ones in the stores.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY LADY WHO HAS A &amp;#34;MOUSTACHE&amp;#34; OR BUSHY EYEBROWS.  iT WAS&lt;br /&gt;PRICED RIGHT AND DOES A WONDERFUL JOB.  VERY EASY TO USE AND THEYLAST A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Super-fast delivery. Everything just as presented!</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this little gadget.  I can&#x27;t believe how long the hair removal lasts. I&#x27;ve only used it twice, just because I haven&#x27;t needed it more frequently.</li>
    <li> Before purchasing this product I wasted too much time on a daily basis plucking hairs off my face and neck often missing several --particularly under my chin-- due to poor lighting.  Personal waxing didn&#x27;t work and I couldn&#x27;t grow out the hair for a professional wax without looking like a 16 year old boy working on his first goatee.  The skin under my chin became bumpy and blemished from frequent plucking at the skin. This epilator changed all that.  I now can get rid of hair in just a few minutes without any need for bright lighting or to wait for the hair to grow out.  I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the &amp;#34;smooth as a baby&#x27;s bum&amp;#34; feeling after just a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers say that the product stalls out if you push too hard, but I find that a light touch grabs the hair more frequently than pushing into the skin like you&#x27;re trying to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;This product is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great product, but be prepared for a little pain!</li>
    <li> I was mostly satisfied with this product until it quit working.  Only lasted about 4 months</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine for why I purchased it.  Takes a bit of time to get some hairs and others it just won&#x27;t grab.  But since it wasn&#x27;t expensive, it&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Terrible waste of money</li>
    <li> This barely works. It maybe takes a couple hairs out. I can leave it on for a minute and it probably only gets about half the hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Epi before, but this product doesn&#x27;t measure up.  It is flimsy and not very efficient.  The off/on button broke on my third use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this version.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t try to use this on your sensitive areas, trust me.  I use it on my eyebrow and lip areas, where it works fine.  It&#x27;s not adequate for underarms or pubic area unless you are a natural blond or someone else with very fine, sparse personal hair.  It&#x27;s just too small and the whirring drum is too weak.</li>
    <li> This little tool is so easy to use and clean.  I love the job it does.  I keep it in my living room (out of site) and use it while watching tv.  No more having to wax or find each hair with the tweezer.  I bought it for my upper lip which is mildly hairy and almost every day I find at least one stray coming out of my chin area now that I&#x27;m in my 40s.  Not sure how it works entirely but it does the job. You should go over a spot a few times holding it in different directions so you are sure to get the hair you are looking for but its not problem and hardly an inconvience.  The slower you go the more of a chance there is that it will pick up the hair obviously.  I also suggest you hold it at an angle as instructed witht he on button facting up because you want to go in the opposite direction of hair growth.  No complicated.  However, I did find the second time I used it that maybe I used it for too long (5 minutes) because the next day I woke up with little pimples all over my neck and chin.  I assume it irritated the areas where it plucked hairs.  Hopefully this won&#x27;t happen as my skin gets use to it.  It does prick a little if you get a long or thicker hair but its no more than a tweezer would hurt.  The fine little hairs don&#x27;t hurt at all.  Good price for a little tool like this that is small and handy and no longer having waxing expenses.</li>
