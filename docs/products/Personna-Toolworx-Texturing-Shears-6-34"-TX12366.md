      <li>I love these and am so surprised of the quality given the cheap price.</li>
      <li>sharp good fit</li>
      <li>and these seem pretty comfortable.</li>
      <li>not professional, I think is good for me</li>
      <li>Great little device--wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
      <li>I find that I can texturize my hair nicely in between my regular haircuts at the salon.</li>
      <li>Originally had different pair of more expensive thinning shears in basket but saw reviews for this after my purchase and was able to switch the items thanks to Amazon&#x27;s excellent service.</li>
      <li>I only cut once as a previous reviewer said too many cuts will not be good.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty chunky fingers</li>
      <li>Worked exactly as they should</li>
      <li>so they don&#x27;t cut in extremely obvious layers, but between large and super fine.</li>
      <li>Sharp, nicely oiled.</li>
      <li>Works wonders, is nice and sharp</li>
      <li>These scissors are not only very well made and feel super durable but they provide a more finesse and textured cut then if you just lop your hair with normal scissors.</li>
      <li>Well made, I didn&#x27;t have to tighten the screw, because it was easy to open close.</li>
      <li>my ponytail used to be huge and now my hair looks like a normal person&#x27;s hair :O</li>
      <li>I really like the shape of my hair after using these.</li>
      <li>It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>SO much easier than going to salon every 3 weeks for trim.</li>
      <li>( i think, i don&#x27;t really have much to compare with).</li>
      <li>FYI: never cut straight across as you would do to trim off length.</li>
      <li>You may be surprised how much hair comes off in the shower the first time you try this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not a hair stylist but the result is pretty professional looking.</li>
      <li>At this price, I was expecting some cheap dull shears but still decided to try due to the good reviews.  </li>
      <li>But you have to be careful that the teeth are dense, so it is easy to get your hair over thinned...</li>
      <li>They cut really well so far.</li>
      <li>i started cutting just over my ears so now the top has more body</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and store - saves quite a few $ when I can&#x27;t go to the salon.  </li>
      <li>These have pretty big teeth and kind of thin your hair in chunks.  </li>
      <li>to be honest you can get the same type of tool at the same price or less at wal mart.</li>
      <li>They came in clean unused condition and were very sharp.</li>
      <li>I have not used professional grade version of texturing shears</li>
      <li>Pull a chunk of the overly thick hair and point the tip of the shears straight in towards your scalp and lightly snip.</li>
      <li>I have thick, spiral curls that as my hair gets longer and heavier the top of my head gets straighter.  </li>
      <li>These work great to thin areas that are heavy and pulling on the curl.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> At this price, I was expecting some cheap dull shears but still decided to try due to the good reviews.  I love these and am so surprised of the quality given the cheap price.</li>
    <li> These scissors are not only very well made and feel super durable but they provide a more finesse and textured cut then if you just lop your hair with normal scissors. For the price they are OUTSTANDING--most scissors like these go for $100 and up, I&#x27;m not even kidding. They also have a lot of teeth so they don&#x27;t cut in extremely obvious layers, but between large and super fine. I never cut my hair with anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> Nice n sharp good fit</li>
    <li> I like these a lot. The teeth are fairly spaced and the material is solid. Worked great for thinning out and texturing</li>
    <li> Pretty good. Nothing special. I use it.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for the price. I have pretty chunky fingers and these seem pretty comfortable. Love that the thumb hole is elongated. They cut really well so far.</li>
    <li> I used this one one time but I liked it! Good quality! It was my right chose to buy it!</li>
    <li> These scissors work well and have a nice width between the tines. I am not the best home hair cutter, but these make blending easier than with straight shears.</li>
    <li> Worked exactly as they should</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad for the price, just make sure to clip the hair, don&#x27;t pull the scissors through it.  It will take off a lot of hair but add texture.</li>
    <li> These worked great. They came in clean unused condition and were very sharp. I had no problems using these shears.</li>
    <li> These have pretty big teeth and kind of thin your hair in chunks.  I believe smaller teeth might thin more subtly and that would have been my preference.  They do appear to be well made - I just don&#x27;t love the way they work.</li>
    <li> This is great, considering its price. The blade is sharp. But you have to be careful that the teeth are dense, so it is easy to get your hair over thinned...</li>
    <li> The stylists out there are probably going to be aghast, but here goes: My hair is short, thick and layered. Less than two weeks passes after a haircut when I&#x27;m feeling like my hair is too swollen and thick again.  I decided to try these texturizing shears out and I&#x27;m very pleased with them.  I went to youtube and found a video on how to use them and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. FYI: never cut straight across as you would do to trim off length. Pull a chunk of the overly thick hair and point the tip of the shears straight in towards your scalp and lightly snip. I find that I can texturize my hair nicely in between my regular haircuts at the salon. Though I have nothing to compare them to, I find the shears to be sharp and they do exactly what I had hoped. Great little device--wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
    <li> Good price, works very good, are sharp, work whit the money.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not professional, I think is good for me</li>
    <li> I use this to add texture and thin my family&#x27;s hair. It works great and worth every penny. I&#x27;m not a professional and it does the job well.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair, and gets pretty heavy after a couple of weeks. I use this now every 2-3 weeks to just take the bulk out. Works wonders, is nice and sharp ( i think, i don&#x27;t really have much to compare with).</li>
    <li> Nothing is as good as it seems beforehand. Careful attempt, don&#x27;t take too much out. It is difficult to operate.</li>
    <li> These are nice shears, just be aware that they do remove a good chunk of hair when thinning.  They work fine but use care.</li>
    <li> Not sure how long they will last but they do what I expected them to do.  Very light weight if that&#x27;s a factor for you.</li>
    <li> I gave this for a Chistmas gift. The receiver was not thrilled with the scissors. Not good quality and did not cut like she wanted.</li>
    <li> I think it was my mistake. I don&#x27;t have the hair texture for these scissors. I need pointed tip...but they also seem ok quality - not great.</li>
    <li> okay product - just have to be gentle with them...After two uses, the scissors would not close - so I had to get my husband to work on them.  He said that as you use them, the screw loosens making the blades scrape on one another - which results in them not closing well.  He filed them and was able to get them working again.</li>
    <li> I compared these to texturing/thinning shears that came with a kit I had and I was amazed at how superior these were. They cut easily and give a nice textured cut.</li>
    <li> Is made of good materials, I just don&#x27;t really know how to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you have a better luck</li>
    <li> These are surprising good quality for the price. Definitely not up to par with top-end products, but works quite well and doesn&#x27;t snag or rip.</li>
    <li> I love to cut my own hair and now I am trying to grow it out.  I have thick, spiral curls that as my hair gets longer and heavier the top of my head gets straighter.  By texturizing during the trims, my hair stays curly all over and looks great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions carefully, a little snip goes a long way.  You may be surprised how much hair comes off in the shower the first time you try this.</li>
    <li> This works well on long hair.  Good for cutting bangs with dementions tothe style.</li>
    <li> Bought it to thin a double-coated breed (collie)without having a chopped up look. I&#x27;m sure the biggest benefit will be in summer. They&#x27;ll come in handy.</li>
    <li> Sharp and well made, should last for years and years.  They appear to be a quality product and cut hair well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great for the price and very professional. SO much easier than going to salon every 3 weeks for trim.</li>
    <li> These are good mid-range shears.  I have very thick hair that requires thinning in order to get any body and lift at all.  These do the trick without taking huge bites.  Just remember that one &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; does it.</li>
    <li> I have not used professional grade version of texturing shears so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to but I like these a lot. They allow me to cut my son&#x27;s thick hair without making bad mistakes. Cut small sections at a time or you will see a line but nothing like if you used a standard scissors. I use them on my long thin permed hair too to thin the ends and saved a lot on not having to go for trims or cuts so often. I would buy again and recommend them to a casual cutter.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair.  These work great to thin areas that are heavy and pulling on the curl.  I only cut once as a previous reviewer said too many cuts will not be good.  They worked great!</li>
    <li> Sharp, nicely oiled. Good condition. Decided to spend a tad more and get a set I wouldnt have to replace by buying these.</li>
    <li> Perfect, if you want layers, or a cute flip out/under look!!! Very easy to use!!! I recommend everyone who does women&#x27;s cuts, know how, and use texturizing shears!!!</li>
    <li> Needed some texturing shears and found these on this site.  They are lightweight, and very easy to use.  I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> Sharp, inexpensive. Works well for me, just what I was looking for. Originally had different pair of more expensive thinning shears in basket but saw reviews for this after my purchase and was able to switch the items thanks to Amazon&#x27;s excellent service.</li>
    <li> Works well. Does a good job.</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive shears for home use. I bought these and a pair of regular hair cutting shears so that I could learn how to properly trim my bangs (to save money on haircuts), and these really make the difference in giving my bangs that professional finish.</li>
    <li> this is a good product. looks like picture. arrived on time. sharp. to be honest you can get the same type of tool at the same price or less at wal mart. be careful tho not to get scissor happy .... its very easy to do. &amp;#60;- if you&#x27;re trying these for the 1st time.  use a light hand.</li>
    <li> my hair is insanely thick and these really helped remove a lot of the bulk. my ponytail used to be huge and now my hair looks like a normal person&#x27;s hair :O what!? they were really easy to use. it took me, i want to say, about 10 minutes to do all of my hair and it turned out great. i started cutting just over my ears so now the top has more body and it thins out as you go down my hair. I really like the shape of my hair after using these. good luck to you guys.</li>
    <li> Instead of wasting your money on this just get a blade and start thinning your hair trust me it works better!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for. I like layers and this helped with getting rid of the heavy layers so I have some volume.</li>
    <li> I bought these scissors to cut my dad&#x27;s hair and they were just what i was looking for.  Scissors that are of good quality and that feel sturdy.  I recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of texturing scissors.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t cut well for my dog&#x27;s hair . Would not buy it again .not  good , would not recommend these</li>
    <li> This works perfectly for me as I&#x27;m able to save myself a few weeks in-between necessary haircuts as I gain more bulk than length...might be a learning curve but Google some info on the best method to do what you need these to do...works for me</li>
    <li> I  was able to thin out my bangs with ease. they are sharp and worked well without pulling. Happy with the order.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle and store - saves quite a few $ when I can&#x27;t go to the salon.  I also use it on the dogs and that saves even more:)</li>
    <li> CUTS MY HAIR JUST WELL. If you are a beginner buy it!</li>
    <li> Price more than what is deserve</li>
    <li> Love these shears!  Worked great on my hair.  Very sharp and easy to use and great price and good quality.</li>
    <li> The shears are very wide and cut a large chunk of hair which is perfect if you need a good thinning that blends easily without showing a line of where you cut.&lt;br /&gt;These are very, very nice and sharp. Well made, I didn&#x27;t have to tighten the screw, because it was easy to open close. I really can&#x27;t tell you how nice these are.&lt;br /&gt;But since they have a few teeth, they do thin a lot. If you are looking for shears to thin bangs or the ends of your hair, these are a no-go. the chops will be noticeable at the ands and cut off a lot of hair on your bangs.</li>
    <li> For the price, I should not have expected professional hair-texturing scissors.  Silly me!  These scissors may meet your needs if you are not looking for barber-quality shears.</li>
    <li> I used this on men&#x27;s hair to soften the edge between hair clipper cut and scissors cut.  It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is solid and it&#x27;s plenty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it, I made a mistake of cutting everywhere, which thinned out the volume too much and the short hairs stick out.  Now I only use it within half an inch of the hair tip for feathering.  I&#x27;m not a hair stylist but the result is pretty professional looking.</li>
