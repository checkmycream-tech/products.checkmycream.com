      <li>I cannot say a lot about baby oil that most people does not already know...</li>

      <li>but I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love Johnson baby oil.</li>
      <li>More than just cleaning the baby butocks, it servs for the role body.</li>
      <li>I have been using baby oil for many years</li>
      <li>My skin love it.</li>
      <li>For many years, I have been mixing Johnson&#x27;s baby oil with Lubriderm lotion (1/4 oil to 3/4 lotion).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the fastest most thorough makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used; why pay tons for fancy makeup brands when this works better?&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite thing to use Johnson and Johnson baby oil or is homemade eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>As all of you know this has a lovely scent.  </li>
      <li>will see how it is after more uses</li>
      <li>Good price for a large size</li>
      <li>Great to use when being intimate with your special someone or by yourself.</li>
      <li>Economical and effective.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very worthy to buy this one.</li>
      <li>It works great for that purpose, BUT it smells SO STRONG that I almost barfed and had to open all the windows in winter to air the place out.  </li>
      <li>For the longest while, it was out of stock at BJs and saw that Amazon has it for cheap.</li>
      <li>does not have a smell and it is smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What can I say, the price and the speed for delivery was fantastic.</li>
      <li>It is easily absorbed in the skin and never go to bed without it!</li>
      <li>and it was recommended that we use baby oil to clean it.</li>
      <li>Rinse face with warm water, rub it all over with oil, wipe off with warm, wet washcloth, then repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great to lock moisture in, but is not really a moisturizer itself.</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have used so far to keep dry skin from cracking.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mild for all types of skin and does not seem to be of a nuisance when overused, unlike others.</li>
      <li>This bottle is nice and big for a cheap price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also tried going bare and just showering with warm water and applying nothing, but this has no effect.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is all right.</li>
      <li>I loveeeeeeeeee this, me and my bf have soooooo much fun using this ;)</li>
      <li>Tried couple other brands and this is pretty good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was previously using this as a first step to remove my makeup, followed by washing with face soap, but I recently went on a trip where I forgot my soap but remembered this baby oil, so I did a two-step oil wash, which worked great!</li>
      <li>Was delivered very fast.</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>you so much!</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>I bought this to clean stainless steel appliances, including my new SimpleHuman garbage can.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m was pretty sure that these were from dry follicles rather than oil.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s far superior than other oils because of its soothing impression on the skin.</li>
      <li>But if you want an UNSCENTED stainless steel cleaner, well, do what I did -- go to your local grocery store and buy a cheap bottle of mineral oil.  </li>
      <li>Beware when purchasing as it may not be shipped with as much care as needed.</li>
      <li>There are other ways I&#x27;m sure I will make use of it.</li>
      <li>Well, I was still worried at first before I tried it, but so far I&#x27;ve had no skin problems with it!</li>
      <li>I have used this since my twenties and although I am far, far away from that age, I can say my skin is silky smooth and young looking for my age, so that is my testimonial as I owe it all to this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a new staple in my beauty routine!</li>
      <li>Slather it on after showering while still slightly damp for locking in that all important moisture!</li>
      <li>It definitely beats any moisturizer I have used so far in the winters, keeps the skin glowing, moisturized and ultra smooth.</li>
      <li>STEER WELL CLEAR!</li>
      <li>Soft skin and feet never loses it value or appreciation.</li>
      <li>After using this stuff right after coming out of the shower, I am convinced that it was dry follicles.  </li>
      <li>I will still use the whole bottle, but maybe next time I will choose and unscented version.</li>
      <li>I apply several drops to the affected areas right after a shower and the skin remains soft until the next shower.</li>
      <li>Makes the skin so soft, even in harsh winters, but is non greasy and fast absorbing.</li>
      <li>there is no other baby oil that I would use except for this one.</li>
      <li>but I can usually find this product right at the dollar store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for non chemical, organic products but obviously this product isn&#x27;t an organic one however the fact that it is made especially for babies makes it less damaging to the skin and perhaps more smoother.</li>

<li> I used travel quite a distance to purchase all my cosmetics and usually lug them home via the train.</li>
<li> now who does not love baby oil,, huh??  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t want to put any stars for the rating but it makes you put at least one.</li>
<li> I probably would have preferred unscented but it&#x27;s not a big deal since my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bad reactions to it (either the oil or the added fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I use this for a million uses, removing false eyelashes, removing waterproof makeup, removing stickers, and softening skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just like in the stores. thanks!</li>
    <li> I always use Johnson and Johnson Baby oil on my skin to lock in moisture, especially during the wintertime. For the longest while, it was out of stock at BJs and saw that Amazon has it for cheap. I will continue to buy this baby oil from them.</li>
    <li> I love Johnson baby oil. It feel very good on my body. I will tell my family and friends about amazon.com</li>
    <li> if you are bald like me, this is the best type of oil to rub on the head. It&#x27;s far superior than other oils because of its soothing impression on the skin.</li>
    <li> Came on time.  I would buy again.  The product  was well wrapped, I would recommend this seller.  I have been using baby oil for many years</li>
    <li> I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I use to keep my razors from rusting and it extends the life of any costly razor. Works great.</li>
    <li> I loveeeeeeeeee this, me and my bf have soooooo much fun using this ;)</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean stainless steel appliances, including my new SimpleHuman garbage can.  It works great for that purpose, BUT it smells SO STRONG that I almost barfed and had to open all the windows in winter to air the place out.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone can stand the odor.  If you LIKE the overpowering smell of diapers, then by all means buy this.  But if you want an UNSCENTED stainless steel cleaner, well, do what I did -- go to your local grocery store and buy a cheap bottle of mineral oil.  It&#x27;s the same thing, but without the vomitous stench.  I knew it might smell a bit, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to make me gag.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about kids but my skin loves this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I does not have a smell and it is smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
    <li> This bottle is nice and big for a cheap price. I don&#x27;t have a baby but I use this on myself! It&#x27;s the fastest most thorough makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used; why pay tons for fancy makeup brands when this works better?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using this as a first step to remove my makeup, followed by washing with face soap, but I recently went on a trip where I forgot my soap but remembered this baby oil, so I did a two-step oil wash, which worked great! Rinse face with warm water, rub it all over with oil, wipe off with warm, wet washcloth, then repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is mineral oil, which is non comedogenic, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it clogging pores and breaking me out. Well, I was still worried at first before I tried it, but so far I&#x27;ve had no skin problems with it! The fragrance is all right. I probably would have preferred unscented but it&#x27;s not a big deal since my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bad reactions to it (either the oil or the added fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a new staple in my beauty routine! I&#x27;m so happy to be saving money on this cheap and effective product, plus it just makes washing up before bed faster since it melts off stubborn and waterproof makeup so well! Way faster than multiple rounds of foaming washes or having to rub a cotton ball soaked in makeup remover around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> More than just cleaning the baby butocks, it servs for the role body. Prevents dermatites if you pass throught the skin befor the bath.&lt;br /&gt;For the adults, you can use it after your bath, while still wet. It helps maintenance of elasticity and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as a cleaner, or make-up remouver. Bath your hair once a month with the oil before the shampoo, just let it ther for some 5 or 10 minutes and than, wash-it.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the moisturizing benefits of Johnson&#x27;s baby oil. I have used this since my twenties and although I am far, far away from that age, I can say my skin is silky smooth and young looking for my age, so that is my testimonial as I owe it all to this product. Slather it on after showering while still slightly damp for locking in that all important moisture!</li>
    <li> I like it very much. It is much bigger than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;It is very worthy to buy this one.</li>
    <li> Good size for price. Cheaper than walmart. Was delivered very fast. Great for baby rubs and add a lil in bath water to keep baby skin from drying and great for adult massages too.</li>
    <li> what&#x27;s not to like it&#x27;s mineral oil, a few hundred years ago you&#x27;d have heard a salesperson screaming it cures rabies, it cures whiskey....it&#x27;s the cure-all. It&#x27;s just mineral oil.</li>
    <li> Great to use when being intimate with your special someone or by yourself. Also great to moisturize your skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> THIS BABY OIL HAS BEEN AN ASSET IN MY HOME SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER- NOW AS A GRANDMOTHER, I BUY ONE FOR EACH FAMILY MEMBER AND RE-FILL LITTLE BOTTLES TO TAKE WITH ME &#x27;ON THE ROAD&#x27;.  Soft skin and feet never loses it value or appreciation.</li>
    <li> now who does not love baby oil,, huh??  this is just a bottle of Johnsons baby oil..  it does what baby oil is supposted to...</li>
    <li> there is no other baby oil that I would use except for this one. it&#x27;s mild for all types of skin and does not seem to be of a nuisance when overused, unlike others.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to put any stars for the rating but it makes you put at least one. I have used Johnson&#x27;s Baby Lotion for years with no problem, so when I bought their Baby Oil to relieve my dry, sun-parched skin, I assumed I&#x27;d have no problem with that either. Within a few hours of using it I developed a severe red and bumpy rash all over my neck, chest and arms. Five days later it it still there and it is spreading, and the itching is unbearable. I&#x27;ve now developed really rough ugly patches where the bumps have joined together and the affected skin is as dry as sandpaper. I&#x27;m not looking great in a T-shirt. Nothing relieves it. I&#x27;ve tried oral Piriton and topical Sudocrem. I&#x27;ve also tried going bare and just showering with warm water and applying nothing, but this has no effect. Had I known that Johnson&#x27;s Baby Oil could do this to skin I&#x27;d never have used it. STEER WELL CLEAR!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, keeps me moisturized.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a baby nor do I have one but I love this product. The smell, the texture, the way it makes my skin feels after using it is pretty impressive. I&#x27;m a sucker for non chemical, organic products but obviously this product isn&#x27;t an organic one however the fact that it is made especially for babies makes it less damaging to the skin and perhaps more smoother. I use it everytime I go out of the shower. It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> What can I say, the price and the speed for delivery was fantastic. I used travel quite a distance to purchase all my cosmetics and usually lug them home via the train. But my health does not allow for me to do that wisely any more. So This 20 ounce bottles are great and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> works good smell good and it don boher my twins skin so im happy with the product and so are my girla</li>
    <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my body moisturized after shower and very good to use in winter.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I just ran out of my pricey jojoba oil and switched to this. Can&#x27;t tell the difference. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> We have a sink that is partially granite and it was recommended that we use baby oil to clean it. Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I use this for a million uses, removing false eyelashes, removing waterproof makeup, removing stickers, and softening skin.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have some little dots that can form at the hair follicle on my legs.  I&#x27;m was pretty sure that these were from dry follicles rather than oil.  After using this stuff right after coming out of the shower, I am convinced that it was dry follicles.  The smell is a bit stronger than I would like.  I will still use the whole bottle, but maybe next time I will choose and unscented version.</li>
    <li> I use this to help smoothe my dry skin on my legs and shoulders.  Works every time! Economical and effective.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used so far to keep dry skin from cracking.  I apply several drops to the affected areas right after a shower and the skin remains soft until the next shower.</li>
    <li> Love it to moisturize after my shower or use while shaving, etc. Great to lock moisture in, but is not really a moisturizer itself.</li>
    <li> Tried couple other brands and this is pretty good. Baby loves it and smells wonderful as well.would recommend it for new born</li>
    <li> Very big bottle! I can use it for a very long time lol. It feels good too, will see how it is after more uses</li>
    <li> My favorite thing to use Johnson and Johnson baby oil or is homemade eye makeup remover. It is so expensive to buy but I can usually find this product right at the dollar store. Equal parts baby oil, baby no-tear shampoo and water. Mix well and apply with cotton round. Takes of any kind of eye makeup!</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with the product itself. When it came in the mail the bottle was cracked and it had leaked through the box. Beware when purchasing as it may not be shipped with as much care as needed.</li>
    <li> For many years, I have been mixing Johnson&#x27;s baby oil with Lubriderm lotion (1/4 oil to 3/4 lotion). It&#x27;s a magic elixir! Makes the skin so soft, even in harsh winters, but is non greasy and fast absorbing.</li>
    <li> As all of you know this has a lovely scent.  Purchased to add sign to my vinyl kitchen floors, does a good job. There are other ways I&#x27;m sure I will make use of it. Good price for a large size</li>
    <li> I cannot say a lot about baby oil that most people does not already know... But Johnson Baby Oil is still the best on the market today! There are too many uses for it to be put into a review. I still use it because it smells like a baby, it softens your skin like babies skin...
