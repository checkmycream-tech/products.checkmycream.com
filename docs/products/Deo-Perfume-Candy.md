      <li>I just got them yesterday lol</li>
      <li>or when it&#x27;s supposed to peak (at 3-4 hours?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is great, not perfume or flowery at all...</li>
      <li>HURTS YOUR STOMACH AND DOESN NOT WORK NO MATTER HOW MANY ARE EATEN!!</li>
      <li>They taste great, but that&#x27;s all they are good for.</li>
      <li>Guys, you will not smell like woman&#x27;s perfume...but you will smell really really good.  </li>
      <li>you &#x27;smell good&#x27;.  </li>
      <li>and I prefer the sugar free the best.</li>
      <li>taste itself is good and pleasent.</li>
      <li>On the plus, they taste good....</li>
      <li>The candy tastes good.  </li>
      <li>Does not taste good.</li>
      <li>This candy tastes really good.</li>
      <li>I decided to order it when Kelly was wearing it on her show and was talking about how good it smelled.</li>
      <li>good.  </li>
      <li>The candy doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>And you dont get very many for the money.</li>
      <li>You know how some people just smell good, not like product, but just like a nice skin smell?  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty awesome</li>
      <li>To the makers of this candy - please always manufacture this AND make this more assessable!</li>
      <li>LOVE these!</li>
      <li>so, I would say the claim of the candy maker is straight up and honest!!!</li>
      <li>I wanted rose flavored candies.</li>
      <li>They are citrus flavored with rose oil in them.</li>
      <li>Also, a side bonus, it has a nice effect on the breath that lasts longer for me than any breath mint</li>
      <li>But when it did, it was light and airy and very nice.  </li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised that they indeed tasted wonderful</li>
      <li>This was a pleasant way to make sure I was sweet smelling scent</li>
      <li>I tried it and it&#x27;s pretty good, doesn&#x27;t taste like flowers,but that&#x27;s a good thing right!?</li>
      <li>They taste like candy mostly.</li>
      <li>I love this candy.</li>
      <li>Truthfully, I have no idea.  </li>
      <li>I now have to re-order more.  </li>
      <li>and they work better.</li>
      <li>it was ok</li>
      <li>i know that&#x27;s not a word but don&#x27;t know of a better word to describe the taste.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>my boyfriend thought so too :)  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this!  </li>
      <li>If it makes my life more efficient and easy, I&#x27;m all for it.</li>
      <li>After about 2 hours, I realize it&#x27;s not working and get a laugh at the thought that my co-workers are sitting somewhere smelling their own skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it quickly changes to a nice citrus flavor, very fresh.</li>
      <li>(I love rosewater and it tastes very similar) and worked great too.  </li>
      <li>sweat easily and profusely.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always the first one in any group to start to sweat if it&#x27;s warm</li>
      <li>The taste was certainly fine, not soapy or anything.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy one before bed and smell \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; all day.  </li>
      <li>The sugar free version tastes tangier.</li>
      <li>Very fresh and girly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just the way it reacts with my own body chemistry, but I don&#x27;t think it smells particularly like roses, or even flowery...</li>
      <li>I got these on a whim and honestly didn&#x27;t try more than two total.  </li>
      <li>I teach and sometimes have to be up-close to students and am always self conscious (I have excellent personal hygiene but still, never know!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in all - a super fun product!</li>
      <li>The price is a high, but for smelling like a rose when I sweat, it is worth it.</li>
      <li>REALLY cool.</li>
      <li>The candy itself is not bad-</li>
      <li>and I thought she smelled more flowery, more reminiscent of roses, though not quite.  </li>
      <li>It was like I was sucking on rosewater or mild perfume.  </li>
      <li>The very first taste when you pop it in your mouth is a little \\&quot;rosey\\&quot;, meh, but that is almost immediately replaced by a very nice tangy tangerine flavor.  </li>
      <li>Too much sugar in the ones that are not sugar free.</li>
      <li>And - I did notice a bit of a rose aroma an hour later.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product, i didn&#x27;t have to wait long for this at all.</li>
      <li>I could not tell if the candy was actually doing anything untill a New Years party and when I did not wear perfume and yet everyone I hugged said I smelled sooo good.  </li>
      <li>and why do they require a certain amount of words to rate a product?!</li>
      <li>This candy is actually sort of a life-changing product for me, and I&#x27;m so excited it&#x27;s available in the US</li>
      <li>Im used to sugar, but these have so much they gave me anxiety!</li>
      <li>The taste is pretty good however a few friends of mine did not like them.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, I turn the bag over and a serving size is 4-5 pieces for someone weighing up to 145lbs.</li>
      <li>I first saw this on the Kelly and Michael Show a couple weeks ago.</li>
      <li>I would rate it higher however if it always worked and worked for everyone.</li>
      <li>I am just tasting the first piece</li>
      <li>This bag of candy has only 16 pieces, so if you follow directions you have about 8 days worth of deodorant!!?</li>
      <li>These are such a fun, totally unique idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even avoided certain activities with friends during the summer because I knew this would happen.  </li>
      <li>But it made my breath smell really good for a long time, no matter what I ate afterwards, so I give 4stars only because I didn&#x27;t give much time to get thru my pores.</li>
      <li>If you choose to try them, do so at your own risk, but for heavens sake please be responsible and keep them out of the reach of children, or you might end up with a little one in the emergency room.</li>
      <li>I tried it and it really worked.</li>
      <li>I purchased both regular and sugar free</li>
      <li>Same yourself a LOT of money and buy a really wonderful smelling deodorant, it will last months instead of a few days..or use chlorophyll capsules, much cheaper</li>
      <li>Not overbearing, just really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>found it didn&#x27;t do a thing for body odor and wasn&#x27;t very tasty to begin with..</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I only blame myself, I&#x27;m aware these are in no way regulated by the government and not likely to be safe, so I&#x27;m not suing or anything.  </li>
      <li>Also, since the scent of the oil comes out through your pores as you perspire, the more active you are - or</li>
      <li>but I thought i would be getting a decent bag of candy.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change in body odor in particular and I had a piece of candy per day continuously for a week.</li>
      <li>finished each bag 1 per day, so I definitely ate enough to be able to judge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not what I was expected but unique for candy</li>
      <li>Definitely prefer the regular sugar to the sugar free.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a subtle clean &amp; fresh smell that comes through my skin.  </li>
      <li>Professional curiosity makes me wonder when the onset is supposed to be (</li>
      <li>Hmmm, alcohol was not involved early in the evening</li>
      <li>The product was alright as far as the taste goes, but there was no perfume that came along after I ate the candy.</li>
      <li>My 18 year old son tried it and took all my bags.  </li>
      <li>Being in health care, perfumes are a complete no-no.  </li>
      <li>Wow does it work.  </li>
      <li>They did not change my body smell much at all, not enough to notice anyway.</li>
      <li>You must buy more than one bag and the bag is very small.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They taste like candy mostly. Didn&#x27;t notice any perfume scent though. Even asked my boyfriend in case I was used to it and he didn&#x27;t notice any perfume.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptial but decided to order the Deo Perfume Candy anyway.  Wow does it work.  Not overpowering but you smellso good.  It works with your body chemistry.  Men as well as women can use this.  Guys, you will not smell like woman&#x27;s perfume...but you will smell really really good.  My 18 year old son tried it and took all my bags.  I now have to re-order more.  Whether you are working out at the gym, or dinner and dancing; this candy does the trick.  You will never have to worry how you smell and can skip the cologne or perfume, just eat these.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It would get zero stars from me if the system would allow it.  It is just a piece of candy</li>
    <li> Not what I was expected but unique for candy</li>
    <li> This was a pleasant way to make sure I was sweet smelling scent but it did nothing for the sweating</li>
    <li> I love this candy. I keep in it my purse always...never leave home without it.</li>
    <li> I saw this just browsing one day and decided to give it a try. The taste is pretty good however a few friends of mine did not like them. What you need to keep in mind is the perfume part does not work for everyone. I would rate it higher however if it always worked and worked for everyone.</li>
    <li> They taste great, but that&#x27;s all they are good for. They did not change my body smell much at all, not enough to notice anyway. Too much sugar in the ones that are not sugar free. Im used to sugar, but these have so much they gave me anxiety! Yum, but just for use as a candy so not worth the price at all. Cheaper to just buy hard candies!</li>
    <li> Found about this perfume candy on the interned and decided to give it a try. You won&#x27;t believe how incredible they are!</li>
    <li> I got these on a whim and honestly didn&#x27;t try more than two total.  The taste was just a little... strange.  It wasn&#x27;t a strong taste or an unpleasant taste.  It was more of an artificial taste.  Something about the taste just sent off warning messages in my brain that the product shouldn&#x27;t be ingested as food.  It was like I was sucking on rosewater or mild perfume.  Again, it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant per se - just wrong tasting.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste money on that candy. I ordered 4 bags , ate 5 pieces at once , did not not smell of anything!</li>
    <li> I know this candy is expensive, but it does what it says it will, which is a big deal for me.  This candy is actually sort of a life-changing product for me, and I&#x27;m so excited it&#x27;s available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sweat easily and profusely.  It&#x27;s an embarrassing problem, but this candy makes it much less so.  I shower and use underarm deodorant, obviously, which helps the situation there, but the rest of me sweats too... just a general moistness of the skin all over, which often has a somewhat sour smell.  Yuck.  I&#x27;m always the first one in any group to start to sweat if it&#x27;s warm or we&#x27;re doing something vigorous.  Usually this leaves me feeling really self-conscious and I will stand apart, etc.  I&#x27;ve even avoided certain activities with friends during the summer because I knew this would happen.  For this candy to help me, I just eat a few pieces an hour or two in advance! Then, when I start to get warm my skin will give off a subtle lovely smell instead of the usual sour smell.  I can&#x27;t tell you how excited I am about this!  Also, a side bonus, it has a nice effect on the breath that lasts longer for me than any breath mint I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just the way it reacts with my own body chemistry, but I don&#x27;t think it smells particularly like roses, or even flowery... it&#x27;s hard to explain, it&#x27;s just a subtle clean &amp; fresh smell that comes through my skin.  You know how some people just smell good, not like product, but just like a nice skin smell?  That&#x27;s what this does for me.  A friend of mine ate some and I thought she smelled more flowery, more reminiscent of roses, though not quite.  I&#x27;d expect it&#x27;s going to smell a little different on everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and since it&#x27;s a candy, I should probably mention:  It&#x27;s delicious!  The very first taste when you pop it in your mouth is a little \\&quot;rosey\\&quot;, meh, but that is almost immediately replaced by a very nice tangy tangerine flavor.  I have to keep myself from eating them all up so I&#x27;ll have them when I need them.  :)  I buy the regular sugar-sweetened kind, since I don&#x27;t use artificial sweeteners, so I can&#x27;t comment on the taste of the sugar-free ones.</li>
    <li> Tried these the day I got them and I was pleasantly surprised that they indeed tasted wonderful (I love rosewater and it tastes very similar) and worked great too.  My skin didn&#x27;t start smelling like roses until about 4-5 hours after I had eaten the recommended amount.  But when it did, it was light and airy and very nice.  My husband loved it!</li>
    <li> This did not do what it says. I bought a bag for me and for my 14yo niece.  Neither of us ever smelled it, nor did our friends when we asked them to smell us. On the plus, they taste good....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all for all-natural stuff and for ease.  If it makes my life more efficient and easy, I&#x27;m all for it. Being in health care, perfumes are a complete no-no.  I teach and sometimes have to be up-close to students and am always self conscious (I have excellent personal hygiene but still, never know!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The package says they last up to 6 hours, and be mindful of body type / metabolism differentation.  Professional curiosity makes me wonder when the onset is supposed to be (30 min? 2 hours?) or when it&#x27;s supposed to peak (at 3-4 hours?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is great, not perfume or flowery at all... Tastes just like any other hard candy (red life savers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it work?  Truthfully, I have no idea.  I&#x27;m not sure if my antiperspirant overpowers it or if I can&#x27;t smell it because it&#x27;s on me and I don&#x27;t notice it anymore, but I can&#x27;t tell, and people haven&#x27;t mentioned if I smell any different (or like roses).  I&#x27;ve tried it for 3 consecutive days and between different times of the day and still don&#x27;t notice.  I&#x27;ve only been taking one at a time, may try to start with 2 and see what happens. Will keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I tried these once and got very sick to my stomach.  I never noticed any deo/perfume effect.  I regret buying this item.</li>
    <li> The candy itself is not bad- but I thought i would be getting a decent bag of candy.  It actually tastes perfumy - i know that&#x27;s not a word but don&#x27;t know of a better word to describe the taste. I am just tasting the first piece so I don&#x27;t know if it actually works...only time will tell - but again very disappointed in the amount of product received for the price! I doubt I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother. It didn&#x27;t take long for him to eat them.</li>
    <li> The candy tastes good.  I am not clear yet if it actually&lt;br /&gt;makes you &#x27;smell good&#x27;.  Would order again if it works</li>
    <li> To the makers of this candy - please always manufacture this AND make this more assessable! I enjoy one before bed and smell \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; all day.  Even when the smell fades, there is still a freshness.  With my chemistry, the smell is like (excuse my frankness, but ladies know what I&#x27;m saying) a carefree scented panty liner.  Very fresh and girly.</li>
    <li> Sorry guys,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered two packges of this Perfume Candy to see if it is working as they advertise for it  But NO! It is NOT really true!&lt;br /&gt;The taste itself is good and pleasent.</li>
    <li> HURTS YOUR STOMACH AND DOESN NOT WORK NO MATTER HOW MANY ARE EATEN!! DO NOT BUY IT IS NOT WORTH WASTING YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> Does not taste good. You must buy more than one bag and the bag is very small. I&#x27;m sorry I watched the news.</li>
    <li> Ate 3 at once and didn&#x27;t smell anything the rest of the day, but it did give me a headache.  I think this is just a pricey novelty item.</li>
    <li> The product was alright as far as the taste goes, but there was no perfume that came along after I ate the candy.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an experiment and think it failed.  As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s just pink candy and doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
    <li> The candies are not well described. They are citrus flavored with rose oil in them. I wanted rose flavored candies. And you dont get very many for the money.</li>
    <li> Without reading the bag, I rip it open and eat one while passing out 1 piece to three of my co-workers. Throughout the day I notice myself smelling my skin over and over. After about 2 hours, I realize it&#x27;s not working and get a laugh at the thought that my co-workers are sitting somewhere smelling their own skin over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the review on Amazon I was alerted that to \\&quot;eat one\\&quot; means a serving size of 4-5 pieces of candy. Sure enough, I turn the bag over and a serving size is 4-5 pieces for someone weighing up to 145lbs. I weigh 175 so I&#x27;d have to eat...6-7? I&#x27;m not a huge fan of hard candy and the fact of eating this many pieces one right after another was not so appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great flavored candy, but not worth eating 6-7 pieces in hopes to smell like roses :-/</li>
    <li> I really like this product. When I heard about it, I had to try it. The candy doesn&#x27;t taste the greatest, but it&#x27;s not bad. I still wear deodorant, but I don&#x27;t wear perfume. Since I&#x27;ve been eating this candy I&#x27;ve gotten multiple compliments on how I smell!</li>
    <li> LOVE these! These are such a fun, totally unique idea. I agree with the other comments - the taste in the first couple of seconds is a little different, almost purfumey. But it quickly changes to a nice citrus flavor, very fresh. And - I did notice a bit of a rose aroma an hour later. Not overbearing, just really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed, after having a few different friends try these out, that they work a little differently depending on the person. Which makes sense, since essential oils and scents are different on different people. Some noticed a stronger scent - others very little. Also, since the scent of the oil comes out through your pores as you perspire, the more active you are - or if your in a hot room - you&#x27;ll notice the scent a little quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - a super fun product!</li>
    <li> I first saw this on the Kelly and Michael Show a couple weeks ago. I decided to order it when Kelly was wearing it on her show and was talking about how good it smelled. I tried it and it really worked. It tastes kinda fruity. Definitely recommend everyone try it!</li>
    <li> This bag of candy has only 16 pieces, so if you follow directions you have about 8 days worth of deodorant!!? Or less if you are heavier.&lt;br /&gt;I found it didn&#x27;t do a thing for body odor and wasn&#x27;t very tasty to begin with..I have to force myself to use it as there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any benefit at all. If an American company came out with this at a fraction of the cost with a better taste I might try it, but at this price it is ridiculous.  Same yourself a LOT of money and buy a really wonderful smelling deodorant, it will last months instead of a few days..or use chlorophyll capsules, much cheaper and they work better.</li>
    <li> I ate an entire bag and did not smell like roses or any different for that matter but the seller offerd to replace the product so i will give it another try and then update my review.</li>
    <li> it was ok I guess but I&#x27;s not something I will order again. and why do they require a certain amount of words to rate a product?!</li>
    <li> Odd taste, but it does work.  The price is a high, but for smelling like a rose when I sweat, it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought these on a whim after reading about them in a news article.  The taste was certainly fine, not soapy or anything.  I don&#x27;t think at any point I smelt like roses.  Then about 8 hours later....I had horrible stomach pains.  After vomiting, there were large drops of rose-scented oil, and I passed rose-oil in the stools as well with quite a bit of cramping and loose stools.  I only blame myself, I&#x27;m aware these are in no way regulated by the government and not likely to be safe, so I&#x27;m not suing or anything.  I just won&#x27;t buy them again.  If you choose to try them, do so at your own risk, but for heavens sake please be responsible and keep them out of the reach of children, or you might end up with a little one in the emergency room.</li>
    <li> I bought this awhile back but just recently tried it.  I ate it a few hours before I was about to do some physical activity and holy crap...I actually smelled it coming off my skin.  REALLY cool. my boyfriend thought so too :)  it&#x27;s pretty awesome</li>
    <li> My husband ate one candy and he has been sick to his stomach for hours. I would NOT recommend this to anyone</li>
    <li> I still don&#x27;t think works as advertised but I like the taste of the candy.  I purchased both regular and sugar free and I prefer the sugar free the best.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product, i didn&#x27;t have to wait long for this at all. I tried it and it&#x27;s pretty good, doesn&#x27;t taste like flowers,but that&#x27;s a good thing right!? Not sure if it&#x27;s coming through my pores because I just got out the shower and all I smell is Dove. But it made my breath smell really good for a long time, no matter what I ate afterwards, so I give 4stars only because I didn&#x27;t give much time to get thru my pores. I just got them yesterday lol</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in body odor in particular and I had a piece of candy per day continuously for a week. It did, however left me with neutral breath. The taste is alright. Definitely prefer the regular sugar to the sugar free. The sugar free version tastes tangier. Quite frankly, having sugar is better than fake sugar however you think about it. I would buy this again mainly because I like the candy and not necessary because of the effect.</li>
    <li> This candy tastes really good. I&#x27;m not really sure if they make you smell like perfume though. A little pricey</li>
    <li> I could not tell if the candy was actually doing anything untill a New Years party and when I did not wear perfume and yet everyone I hugged said I smelled sooo good.  Hmmm, alcohol was not involved early in the evening so, I would say the claim of the candy maker is straight up and honest!!!</li>
    <li> Bad taste, didn&#x27;t make me smell like perfumeVery expensive for a bad tasting candy. My suggestion is to purchase what is in the candy.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell whether this worked. I tried both sugar AND this sugar-free versions in 2 days but I couldn&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;I finished each bag 1 per day, so I definitely ate enough to be able to judge.&lt;br /&gt;I guess this doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
    <li> Nasty tasting not able to tell if works or not could not get past horrible flavor. Large long lasting yuck.</li>
