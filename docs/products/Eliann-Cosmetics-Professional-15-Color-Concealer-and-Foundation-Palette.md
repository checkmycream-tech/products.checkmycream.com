      <li>In came in really quickly and usually I&#x27;m very picky about my make-up especially because some of us including myself has sensitive skin, but because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, it does not cause irritation to the skin and does not leave it oily.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s just a little too &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; for me.</li>
<li> Small pallet tho.</li>
<li> Very small quantity of each color.</li>
<li> Worst concealer/color corrector!!!</li>

    <li> I like this pallet.. at first when opening they look oily but after rubbing them they look normal.  I like cream ones cause of dry skin easy to apply and create a contoured look.</li>

    <li> The texture is decent, I have a hard time getting it out of the pallet and I feel like I&#x27;m wasting a lot but it&#x27;s at a great price point.  It&#x27;s not as smooth as I would&#x27;ve liked and I deducted a star for this.

    <li> Great product. Came right on time.</li>
    <li> Do not order! The cream foundation doesn&#x27;t even show color or rub on your face!</li>
    <li> such a waste of money. when you blend the colors- they wipe right off. i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very very small and cheap quality also different colors from the pic with very light coverage over all save ur money so expensive for the quality I don&#x27;t know  e what is the other  reviewer like ??</li>
    <li> Very small quantity of each color. Very light coverage. Better off spending twice as much for a better quality product.</li>
    <li> IT HAS MANY SHADES I JUST WISH IT CAME with direction on which shade to use for what</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a little too &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34; for me. Too orange-y. I guess I need more neutral tones. I use the darkest shade for my eyebrows though and the green, purple and white for color correction.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used but its beautiful. Small pallet tho.</li>
    <li> This is great, highly recommended last all day</li>
    <li> Un-natural shades of foundation. It is very cheap  in quality and goes on skin very cakey. Would not recommend or purchase again. Product was received a week later. Nice case cheap product</li>
    <li> This is a great product hands-down. My lady can&#x27;t stop bragging about how this palette is easy to use and  last allllllll day. I&#x27;m already amazed how beautiful she looks but this product only enhance her natural looks. Well worth it!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I LOOOOVE THIS PRODUCT! In came in really quickly and usually I&#x27;m very picky about my make-up especially because some of us including myself has sensitive skin, but because it&#x27;s hypoallergenic, it does not cause irritation to the skin and does not leave it oily. I&#x27;m really happy about this product and the sets of colors are amazing. You can trust this product everyone. It will come in. This product is NOT a scam. I&#x27;m very happy about it and so will you!!</li>
    <li> Good product but concealer does not have as much pigment as I expected. Received quickly.</li>
    <li> Most makeup companies do not offer concealer&#x27;s in mix and match color options for compacts and bottled products. It is fun to have all the time I need to test colors at home. It&#x27;s always a rush job at department store beauty counters, or the drug store where there are no samples available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is easy, I used my fingers since trying multiple colors in one sitting is time consuming and I didn&#x27;t want to clean brushes. It seems that all the colors blended nicely and matched my skin color perfectly.  I recommend this product because it&#x27;s creamy, covers well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out half way through the evening.</li>
    <li> as described exactly easy to use and spread arrived in good condition thank you</li>
    <li> Worst concealer/color corrector!!!</li>
    <li> Definitely prefer the Coastal Scents palette over this one.  It doesn&#x27;t go on as smoothly as I would like and the coverage isn&#x27;t even close to what I get with the Coastal Scents palette.  I&#x27;ll use it til it&#x27;s gone though I guess but I am going back to CS.</li>
    <li> Love it! Wonderful product!</li>
