      <li>and I&#x27;m able to easily untangle my hair without ripping have my hair out.  </li>
      <li>I have baby-fine hair that gets easily tangled and is stubborn.</li>
      <li>My hair tangles incredibly easily and takes forever to untangle.</li>
      <li>This product made it easy for me to comb thru my hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud bottle of this or what, but it does nothing for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>it did nothing for my fine hair.</li>
      <li>This spray helps tremendously!</li>
      <li>I bought this and Not Your Mother&#x27;s {Smooth Moves}.</li>
      <li>After getting the knots out this product did make my hair feel really silky and nice.</li>
      <li>Absolutely exactly what my granddaughter wanted!!  </li>
      <li>This is great for my daughter&#x27;s knotty post-shower hair and even some mornings when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
      <li>The next day I worked with some fine combs and I was able to get a lot of the tangles out but also had to cut many of them out as well.</li>
      <li>It works really well, just make sure your bottle sprays when you receive it.</li>
      <li>I ordered 4 different kinds of good detangler and this was one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a really nice smelling product that does make your hair feel super soft.</li>
      <li>I received the product quickly.  </li>
      <li>I am into shines sprays right now since its almost summer and the sun is out, you need that shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unbelievable how great this product works.</li>
      <li>I have very very fine,thin hair and it falls out from thyroid medications</li>
      <li>This makes it so much easier!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a shame though because otherwise the product works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Did ABSOLUTELY nothing for me, didn&#x27;t smooth, didn&#x27;t soften, didn&#x27;t condition, didn&#x27;t detangle, didn&#x27;t make it easier to comb, if anything, it dried me out even more and weaken my hair to the point of breakage.  </li>
      <li>and my hair felt really soft and nice, and that feeling last the whole</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a certain brand detangling spray for years.</li>
      <li>and it works really well on bed head.</li>
      <li>I have very tangly hair because its all bleached, and I find this product works well to detangle it when I don&#x27;t have the time or can&#x27;t condition in the shower.</li>
      <li>I have hair down to my waist, pretty straight for the most part.  </li>
      <li>Not bad for a low end product!</li>
      <li>I tried a few light sprays, I tried pouring right from the bottle, I tried ends to roots, I tried roots to ends.</li>
      <li>have never used a hair detangler before, so this type of product was absolutely new to me.</li>
      <li>I actually love the smell and was not sure if I was going too, based on some of the reviews.  </li>
      <li>but if you are at all sensitive to comedogenic ingredients I would stay away.</li>
      <li>Consequently, it doesn&#x27;t take much for my hair to get tangled - especially after a run.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product to use on my 8 year old daughters, this product does not stand a chance compared to johnsons and johnsons detangler and the smell</li>
      <li>I just received mine a few days ago, but already back on to buy more.</li>
      <li>first used this after the shower to see if it would glide through my hair like I expected, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like adding water to your hair, but this one has more nutrition at least!</li>
      <li>Normally the hair products I buy are more expensive</li>
      <li>So, I purchased this to see if it would help with the knots that accumulate near the back of my neck.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have jet black hair, bleached for lighter color tone on top, which means my hair is a tangled birds nest everyday....</li>
      <li>I enjoy spraying this on after a shower, but if my hair isn&#x27;t damp it really seems to weigh it down since I have very thick and curly hair.</li>

<li> No different than any other detangler as far as I can tell.  </li>
<li> I am constantly running my hands through my hair because it does get knotty after a long day.</li>
<li> Then I just flat iron my hair out!</li>
<li> I used it on my dry hair the same thing happend.</li>
<li> I do have straight, long, black hair that falls all the way down to my lower back.</li>
<li> It quasi-worked, as long as I did the laborious job of working through each knot.</li>
<li> All three of my daughters have long, thick, gorgeous hair that unfortunately is prone to tangling into an unkempt mess if not given the proper maintenance.</li>
<li> This, however is like a miracle product that I wish I knew of long ago!</li>
<li> Even tried after hair was dry and did nothing.</li>
<li> I let my hair air dry</li>
<li> I felt this dried my hair out especially at the ends and did nothing to detangle.</li>
<li> and you only need a few sprays.</li>
<li> They work really well and doesn&#x27;t make your hair dirty or oily the next day after a shower.  </li>
<li> I usually apply when my hair is wet and then blow dry.</li>
<li> This ingredient is HIGHLY comedogenic, I started breaking out around my hair line and on my scalp in decently large cystic type pimples, very painful.</li>
<li> A few sprays</li>
<li> I use it everyday just out of the shower.</li>
<li> It made me cringe to force a comb through it, but a lot of leave in conditioners made my hair oily or limp.</li>
<li> I have thick, long, curly hair that usually takes me 30 minutes to brush through.</li>

    <li> I have jet black hair, bleached for lighter color tone on top, which means my hair is a tangled birds nest everyday....THIS SPRAY WORKS!!! apply to knot and brush through!!! I just received mine a few days ago, but already back on to buy more.</li>
    <li> Not Your mothers let me review their products. These smell so good. Just like candy. They work really well and doesn&#x27;t make your hair dirty or oily the next day after a shower.  I love the detangler conditioner it works really good and you only need a few sprays. Starting at the bottom of your hair working your way up then just brush away and no tangles! I have thick hair and I need any help I can get when it comes to brushing the hair. Then I just flat iron my hair out! The shine mist is awesome smells like candy and shines the hair for hours. I am into shines sprays right now since its almost summer and the sun is out, you need that shine. Both products work great and make your hair smell good, and keeps hair pretty and not frizzy. Great CS and they ship fast to!</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful. Bottle won&#x27;t spray correctly.</li>
    <li> Awesome and great smelling does the job</li>
    <li> my sister loved this product it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have thick, long, curly hair that usually takes me 30 minutes to brush through. With the help of this stuff I was done brushing in under 5 minutes. I now feel like I need to try every product they make!! Loveeeeeee.</li>
    <li> My hair tangles incredibly easily and takes forever to untangle. This makes it so much easier! It smells good too</li>
    <li> No different than any other detangler as far as I can tell.  The head sprays really fine mist, might be good for thinner hair.</li>
    <li> While the price is good and the smell was nice it did nothing for my fine hair. I picked this up at my local beauty supply store. I usually apply when my hair is wet and then blow dry. I felt this dried my hair out especially at the ends and did nothing to detangle. Even tried after hair was dry and did nothing. Not one of my favs from this line</li>
    <li> I have used this for 6 months and it does get rid of the knots, after you comb it out. It&#x27;s like adding water to your hair, but this one has more nutrition at least!</li>
    <li> And I love it. I bought this and Not Your Mother&#x27;s {Smooth Moves}. I love them both. Impressed by the quality, and so glad that something actually works. I have baby-fine hair that gets easily tangled and is stubborn. Thankful for these products :)</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing someone rave about it on YouTube. It does help get any knots out and make it easy to brush out, smells nice, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy. HOWEVER, the second ingredient in the list (which means there is quite a lot of it in there) is cetearyl alcohol. This ingredient is HIGHLY comedogenic, I started breaking out around my hair line and on my scalp in decently large cystic type pimples, very painful. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why as I hadn&#x27;t changed anything except using this. I looked at the ingredients and it all made sense. I don&#x27;t know if others have this issue at all but if you are at all sensitive to comedogenic ingredients I would stay away. It&#x27;s a shame though because otherwise the product works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, thick, medium curly hair. I tried a few light sprays, I tried pouring right from the bottle, I tried ends to roots, I tried roots to ends. I stuck with it for about 10 days. Did ABSOLUTELY nothing for me, didn&#x27;t smooth, didn&#x27;t soften, didn&#x27;t condition, didn&#x27;t detangle, didn&#x27;t make it easier to comb, if anything, it dried me out even more and weaken my hair to the point of breakage.  I&#x27;ve been using Biosilk and was looking for a less expensive product. I just threw 3/4 of this product away and ordered the Biosilk again.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I ordered this and it works really well on bed head. Usually bed head isn&#x27;t a problem for me because I tie my hair up when I go to bed. It looks a bit different than the picture here though. Instead of a tannish color on the bottle, I got a orange one. It also says keratin protein instead of Brazilian Keratin. But it still is great!!</li>
    <li> Normally the hair products I buy are more expensive but I was happy I decided to try this.  I actually love the smell and was not sure if I was going too, based on some of the reviews.  I received the product quickly.  I think some of the local stores sell this product so I might check before ordering online again but I will use this product again.  I have hair down to my waist, pretty straight for the most part.  This product made it easy for me to comb thru my hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a dud bottle of this or what, but it does nothing for my fine hair. Doesn&#x27;t detangle at all, just makes hair wetter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice.</li>
    <li> I enjoy spraying this on after a shower, but if my hair isn&#x27;t damp it really seems to weigh it down since I have very thick and curly hair.</li>
    <li> All of the Not Your Mother&#x27;s products are amazing! I literally almost have all of them! They are so affordable and work great! This detangler gets the job done and makes my hair feel soft, smell good and doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy!</li>
    <li> this worked pretty well to get my bad tangles out. I have very very fine,thin hair and it falls out from thyroid medications and I get horrid tangles and rats nests from it. I ordered this and sprayed about half the bottle on my head and wrapped it in a thin towel then slept in it overnight. The next day I worked with some fine combs and I was able to get a lot of the tangles out but also had to cut many of them out as well. I ordered 4 different kinds of good detangler and this was one of my favorites. I&#x27;d recommend it but keep in mind it will leave a greasy feel if you use it as a leave in.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it smells, and it does a wonderful job detangling my waist length hair.</li>
    <li> This is really nice to spray in after the shower. Smells amazing too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about two months now. My hair gets so tangled, especially just out of the shower. It made me cringe to force a comb through it, but a lot of leave in conditioners made my hair oily or limp. This spray helps tremendously! I use it everyday just out of the shower. The brush goes right through my hair and the best part is, my hair dries with body and looks just as clean.</li>
    <li> This is great for my daughter&#x27;s knotty post-shower hair and even some mornings when it&#x27;s dry.  We both like the scent as well.</li>
    <li> I have an abundance of thick curly hair.  Consequently, it doesn&#x27;t take much for my hair to get tangled - especially after a run. I love this product.  A few sprays and I&#x27;m able to easily untangle my hair without ripping have my hair out.  :)  The product also has a pleasant smell and leaves your hair feeling softer.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> Absolutely exactly what my granddaughter wanted!!  she just loves, loves, this product.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have very tangly hair because its all bleached, and I find this product works well to detangle it when I don&#x27;t have the time or can&#x27;t condition in the shower. It smells good too, and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling like it has any product in it. Not bad for a low end product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Ulta after hearing some reviews about this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a hair detangler before, so this type of product was absolutely new to me. I do have straight, long, black hair that falls all the way down to my lower back. I am constantly running my hands through my hair because it does get knotty after a long day. So, I purchased this to see if it would help with the knots that accumulate near the back of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this after the shower to see if it would glide through my hair like I expected, but it didn&#x27;t. It did help the knots a bit, but I still felt the tug that I usually do when combing through my hair. After getting the knots out this product did make my hair feel really silky and nice. I let my hair air dry and my hair felt really soft and nice, and that feeling last the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it on my dry hair the same thing happend. Help a bit, but there was still a tug. It made my hair feel really nice and silky though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really nice smelling product that does make your hair feel super soft. I was just expecting my brush to glide through my hair, but it didnt do that. I still do like this product and might repurchase unless there is something else that is better out there and not a bank breaker.</li>
    <li> It works really well, just make sure your bottle sprays when you receive it.</li>
    <li> Did not work in my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
    <li> All three of my daughters have long, thick, gorgeous hair that unfortunately is prone to tangling into an unkempt mess if not given the proper maintenance. I&#x27;ve been using a certain brand detangling spray for years. It quasi-worked, as long as I did the laborious job of working through each knot. This, however is like a miracle product that I wish I knew of long ago! I was able to comb out my youngest daughter&#x27;s hair with great ease, no pulling, no tugging, no hand-separating any knots. No tears from my little one, she appreciates the pain-free brushing! It&#x27;s unbelievable how great this product works. It smells great too, nothing too perfumy or overwhelming. It also smoothes out the frizzes and tamed my daughters&#x27; static-prone tresses, as well as my own! I love it, my daughters love it. It&#x27;s an outstanding, inexpensive product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on my 8 year old daughters, this product does not stand a chance compared to johnsons and johnsons detangler and the smell is aweful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did recieve the product in advance of delivery date, so thank you for that. Just not happy with product!</li>
