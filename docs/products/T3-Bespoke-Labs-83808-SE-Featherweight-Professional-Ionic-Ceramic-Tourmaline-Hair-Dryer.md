<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have owned this dryer in the past and this was a replacement after 3 years of my old one! This one must have been refurbished or defective because it didn&#x27;t perform well after only 6 months. I went into Ulta and purchased a new t3 in person. Hope it lasts better than this one.</li>
    <li> Great price offered on Amazon. I used this dryer once, and was amazed. My hair dries so shiny, soft, full and super fast. I love it. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
    <li> While it is extremely lightweight and the long cord is great, I&#x27;ve had better dryers and regret this purchase. I agree that this dryer is effective in cutting down the time it takes to dry thick hair; it does not, however, have enough heat to straighten and smooth my thick yet fine textured wavy hair without using a flat iron. It leaves my hair straight, but a little on the frizzy/ bushy side in comparison to other dryers i&#x27;ve owned in the past. I hate the way my hair looks when i use it alone and now need to spend more money on something better.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer does not work at all. I have sent 3 emails to the company with no avail. I am going to have to stop payment. I don&#x27;t know what else to do! Nancy</li>
    <li> This was definitely worth the purchase! It dries faster than normal hair dryers. Best of all, I have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since I started using it!</li>
    <li> Dryer lasted exactly 90 days and died.  This was a replacement to the exact dryer I bought from Ulta 3 years ago.  So disappointing to see Amazon offer this product from this vendor given the number of complaints and problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is so great that I bought it for gifts. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar. Your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers. Your hair will stay healthy and will shine.Found the best price on Amazon, it was half the price I found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I like the extra long cord and I think it dries my hair a little faster but not by much. I don&#x27;t like where the on/off buttons are located I will be drying my hair and I accidently keep hitting them also it is not very quiet. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have had two T3 Tourmaline hair dryers and both have seriously dangerous wiring issues and caused electrical sparks and fire down the cord. I&#x27;m sending T3&#x27;s blow dryer to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the safety, but since that process takes time, I wanted to alert others of the fire and electorcution hazard of the T3 hair dryer.   I purchased a T3 hair dryer on Amazon (a purchase that can be verified). After using it for less than 8 months, it fired 6-8 inch red sparks when turned on. The sparks from the electrical fire extended a couple feet down the cord. I was lucky that my arm was outstretched and am thankful for not being electrocuted.  An isolated incident unrelated to the T3 dryer itself, you might think. Well, I did, and based on the glowing reviews, I replaced that T3 hair dryer with another one. At about the ten month point (last week), I turned on the dryer and a loud screeching noise erupted from dryer, giving off a terrible electrical fire smell, and blowing the fuse. I&#x27;m grateful that the dryer&#x27;s dangerous malfunction tripped the switch before being electrocuted.   The T3 dryers aren&#x27;t the only items I use in that outlet, which works perfectly fine for anything else (e.g., waterpik, hair iron, etc.). Nor was I around water when both of these T3 dryers basically exploded into electrical flames. I&#x27;m not a cat with nine lives, so two T3 hair dryers that threaten to be fatal was enough.   I contacted T3 with the limited information on their site, alerting the company and asking for their mailing address to return their consumer hair dryer to inspect for safety. They absolutely won&#x27;t give out their mailing address, even when alerted to a potentially fatal product. The T3 company just sends template emails, with no contact person, name, or address, and demands to know that model number. This is in response to a request to send them one of their products that is so seriously defective that it could be fatal.   Now, I don&#x27;t run a consumer products company, but if I was told a customer was nearly electrocuted and sparks are firing from my product, I&#x27;m pretty certain I&#x27;d be responsive, regardless of whether the dangerous item was black or white. Very shady in my view, prompting me to wonder if there are others who&#x27;ve experienced T3&#x27;s defective product and give up trying to contact the company.</li>
    <li> I have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years, but had never tried one. I&#x27;m a total convert at this point -- the T3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny, and it weighs practically nothing. It&#x27;s a quiet yet very powerful little machine.</li>
    <li> My T3 just stopped working after 3&#x27; MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &amp;  it really is light weight &amp; leaves the hair very smooth &amp; shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !</li>
    <li> I am a stylist and I loved this dryer.  I had a co-worker who had one also. Both of our dryers only lasted for three months.</li>
    <li> $100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don&#x27;t bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not.</li>
    <li> I had seen this dryer reviewed in InStyle for a couple of months and had considered purchasing it.  I have very natural curly hair.  The reviews said this product was helpful in taking the curl out.  After trying other products I decided to try this.  I was pleasently surprised.  I have alot less frizz than before.  Even thought the power is not tremendous that is not a problem.  The dryer gets very hot and really straightens my hair.  I really like that it is light weight also.</li>
    <li> Hate to dry my hair but using this dryer takes half the time and my hair looks much better!!</li>
    <li> I had one before and was lost without it.  Ordinary blow dryers take longer and don&#x27;t make my hair look as healthy.  I could not wait for my replacement to come.</li>
    <li> The dryer is very lightweight. However it did not have a serial number on it so I was not able to complete the warranty for it. I also tend to hit the power switch which accidently turns it off periodically; maybe I am just not used to the location of the switch yet on the handle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to style my hair.  It dries it, and leaves it frizz free, but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to shorten my drying time or omit the need for straightening iron.  It is nicely designed and really light weight, but it just didn&#x27;t do the job.  I&#x27;m returning mine.</li>
    <li> I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon because I had one previously and really like it.  I just tried to register the dryer and realized there was no serial number on the cord.  I should have read the reviews because I see several other people have had the same problem.  Disappointed about this.  You think you are getting a good price and then find out maybe in the long run your not.</li>
    <li> I love it and I love the amazon price! I was one of those skeptics that was thinking, why would I want to spend this much on a hairdryer? But for the $80-$90 that I spent, it is worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased this hairdryer specifically for the lengthy warranty. However, my dryer came without a serial number and therefore I couldn&#x27;t get the warranty. I returned to Amazon stating the problem and got another one with no serial number. The return process was easy and painless, but they did not pay attention to my comment or the product. It is obvious Amazon is not an authorized dealer. Never tried the dryer.</li>
    <li> Since this is a Christmas present for my granddaughter, I have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time. The service I received though was wonderful.</li>
    <li> We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we&#x27;ve tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GBUZX9VPNRW3]]Look no further.  See my short video for details.  Thanks!    Pros:  lightweight, arm doesn&#x27;t tire  dries my hair quickly (much quicker than any other i&#x27;ve owned)  amazing on my curly hair - I can quickly style it curly or blow it out    Cons:  None!</li>
    <li> I love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn&#x27;t frizz my hair out. The plug fits into my outlet well, my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces. After reading some reviews on the T3 and hair stylist using this product I committed. It is pricey but worth it to me.</li>
    <li> This is the second one i buy , because i love it so much but there is one bad thing about it .   It totally dies after two years of use .   I say that because my friends T3 died exactly after two yeas as well .</li>
    <li> This product is over priced. It works well, but stopped working with in one year. I have a hair dryer from walmart now that has last two years.</li>
    <li> I loved this...while it lasted.  After 3 weeks, it stopped working.  I also was not able to register it with the manufacturer and receive warranty coverage because Amazon is not a registered dealer. The seller has agreed to replace it when I mail the product back. Just be aware of these potential issues.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don&#x27;t like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don&#x27;t go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It&#x27;s light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This dryer is much better than my old, non-ionic dryer.  At first, I thought the dryer was pretty weak because the air flow is relatively low and usually I tend to slightly burn my hands with my old dryer.  But, my hair dries more thoroughly and much more shiny with the T3 without the extra heat.  I love that the dryer is so light.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the T3 is there is only a high and low setting.  The high actually feels more like a medium setting to me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t personally use this unit, but my girlfriend does every morning, and it causes a huge degradation of my quality of life in the mornings.  It initially doesn&#x27;t sound all that loud, but over time the high pitch squeal that it makes will start to drive you nuts.  I don&#x27;t think she necessarily hears it as the sound exits through the back of the unit away from her, and I bear the brunt of the unpleasant noise.   Anyway I cannot recommend having one of these in your home if you live with other people.  I figured it&#x27;s worth warning other people, so I made a quick stop to comment before shopping for a replacement so I can get back to relaxed mornings.</li>
    <li> Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won&#x27;t touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn&#x27;t like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It&#x27;s got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn&#x27;t that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty.</li>
    <li> This is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one I&#x27;ve owned, and it does it quietly.  It&#x27;s also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because I blow my hair out every morning.  I told my hair stylist what I bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years.  Great feedback on the seller, too.  My order came quickly and as described. New in box.</li>
    <li> Great item! Has a cool button and purrs almost,  on it&#x27;s highest setting. Not only do I almost NEVER get frizzy hair since I began using this item, but I can also go longer between actually shampooing. I feel this is related to not needing to use as many styling products.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dryer for my daughter for Christmas because I have one that I have been using for about two years.&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight, easy controls, and all around better results. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews on this hair dryer before I bought it and I purchased it anyway despite the fact that several people noted it died shortly after purchase...so mea culpa.  Here are the positives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s very light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Generates great heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Love the extra long cord&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-They provided extra filters when I purchased it which I thought was a good thing but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Even if you change the filter regularly (hint, hint with the included extras), mine died after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s passing was very dramatic and looked like it was going to catch on fire, and smelled like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s great as long as it works, until it doesn&#x27;t........</li>
    <li> It was quiet and light-weight and seems like it dries my hair faster then my old hair dryer. However, it broke after usage only 4 times. Only cool air came out and no HOT air no longer working!</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd purchase of this product I wore the first one out after 11 years ! it still worked but the black cover blocking the heat would no longer stay on. I love this hair dryer it leaves my hair so soft no frizz ! Well worth the money ..one of those cases you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and am very pleased with my purchase. It is an amazing hair dryer that literally makes your hair softer.I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I tend to be thrifty and will only spend money on items that are truly worth it. Considering I have to wash and dry my hair everyday, I&#x27;m willing to spend the money on a good hair dryer. I bought my first T3 featherweight 4 years ago for $200 at Sephora. It stopped working last night, and after shedding a small tear I planned to head back to the mall for a new one. Thank goodness I checked online first, as it&#x27;s around 60% cheaper on Amazon. I understand that the manufacturers 2 yr warranty won&#x27;t apply since Amazon is not an authorized dealer, but for that kind of savings Im willing to take the risk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, color treated, straight, thin hair (but a lot of it). This dryer not only cuts my drying time significantly, but makes my hair super soft and shiny!  I use a large barrel bristle brush and the combination gives me no frizz and a salon style.  If I ever question the investment, I quickly know it was worth it when I travel and have to use low end dryers. There is simply no comparison.  Thank goodness I&#x27;m a Prime customer and won&#x27;t have to wait long for my replacement.  It may be ponytails until it arrives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2013 update -- I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of complaints about a faulty product. I assume this is the same vendor I bought mine from. (Though the price is currently over double what I paid.) I only wanted to share that my dryer is still working great, no issues here.</li>
    <li> This is my second T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 3 1/2 years, as the second one is a replacement for the first featherweight that stopped working.  I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores.  I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair.  I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron.  I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron.  My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair.  Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less).  I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.    My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out.  It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers.  With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it&#x27;s no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!    ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 &amp; the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers.  Now I have noticed that Bespoke Labs has changed the warranty on this hair dryer to only 2 years!!!  Interesting!</li>
    <li> The best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. cut my drying time in half and I have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> As far as the product goes, it is a fantastic hair dryer.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and looking silky after blow drying it before I even do anything else to my hair.  However, my gripe with this product is that Amazon is NOT an authorized seller of the product and, thus, I cannot register the hair dryer.  T3 actually told me I should send it back to Amazon and refuse the credit card charges with my credit card company.  Fortunately for Amazon, and unfortunately for me, I don&#x27;t have the time or money to spend trying to resolve this issue.  I just pray that my investment in this hair dryer, which I hope is authentic, will not be short-lived.  Let the buyer (of this hair dryer from Amazon) beware!</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever used!!!  My hair is very thick and tends to look wild.  This dryer makes my hair perfectly straight.  Also drying time seems much less than any other dryer I have used.  However I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon is selling a product missing a serial number.  I bought one without the number and Amazon sent me another one also missing the serial number.  I am a little concerned because the price of the dryer is not cheap, even though Amazon discounts it.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very easy to use.  It is light and the switch is just under your thumb when drying your hair so it is very easy to turn off and on with one hand. Plus the noise level is very low. If you dry your hair while curling it with a brush this should be your first choice. Even if you don&#x27;t dry and curl at the same time it is a winer. Great! Product.  In the stores it would cost you $175.00</li>
    <li> This blow dryer has only two settings, high and low with a cold shot, The high setting is very,very hot, I&#x27;m assuming that is why it dries hair so quickly, don&#x27;t hold it in the same place for too long, you could burn your scalp. I do like the light weight of this dryer and long cord.  I would like to have a dryer that you can have more control over the heat and output of air. I most likely will not spend 100.00 to replace this dryer with the same model.</li>
    <li> I am a loyal Amazon customer, but much to my disappointment I was sold a used blow dryer. The packaging looked conventional. Upon closer inspection, I noticed the white label that should be affixed by law to the bottom of the electrical cord(warning of water danger) was missing. But this is the worst; the words \\&quot;off\\&quot; and \\&quot;low\\&quot; were gone from the handle of the dryer, partially worn off from use. Where the hand would grip the dryer, the words had rubbed off! I could not find in the Amazon product description the words \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; but it seems that is what you could get. I did speak, sort of, to a customer agent, who said I would get a \\&quot;new\\&quot; one. I was not sure if that meant \\&quot;new\\&quot; or \\&quot;another.\\&quot; It came right away with free shipping and it does indeed look new. Just remember it has a 30 day warranty.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 10-5-2011: This dryer went \\&quot;POP\\&quot;, began to breathe fire and emit noxious fumes. To say it died is incorrect; I turned it off....permanently. It had a lifespan of three years and five months. Is this acceptable for a hair dryer that costs about $150.00? Not as far as I am concerned. My next \\&quot;investment\\&quot; in hair dryer futures? [[ASIN:B002JSL6QI Babyliss BABTT5585 TT Tourmaline 3000 Hair Dryer]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: The hair dryer like the toaster oven, the cell phone, and the corded telephone all are built with obsolescence in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mother owned a chrome Oster hair dryer that lasted for 26 years. Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn&#x27;t have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that&#x27;s a complelety different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn&#x27;t dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation. It was about 3x more expensive than the crappy dryers I was used to but if it made my hair better it would be worth it. Or so I reasoned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the dryer has been proficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-The dryer is very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;-Its well balanced and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;-I have very thick, wavy-straight hair and the dryer allows me a blow out in about half the time.&lt;br /&gt;-The heat seems to be very consistant. Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn&#x27;t get hotter.&lt;br /&gt;-It is relatively quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don&#x27;t get gunked up.&lt;br /&gt;-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.&lt;br /&gt;- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don&#x27;t you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?&lt;br /&gt;-The cord is a good, generous length, 114\\&quot; for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating. This is my biggest gripe with the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in the frizz department. I purchased the optional diffuser and my hair seems to be as frizzy as ever, tourmaline or not.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair is still not luminous and movie star perfect.

    <li> Love this dryer. I now have flat hair.  The noise level is really low, which is a great feature as well.  Easy to use and as it states it is featherweight.  Before I had fuzzy hair on the top of my hair, not anymore thanks to T3 83808 SE.  Thanks Bespoke Labs.  Dealing with DiscountsJungle through our Amazon was a piece of cake. Although, I think the S/H is a bit steep.</li>
    <li> Stopped working within 90 days but not covered under warranty.  Amazon refused to stand behind the product.</li>
    <li> My wife seems to like the dryer and her looks great.  She says its faster her only comment is that there is no \\&quot;high warm\\&quot; only a \\&quot;high hot\\&quot;.    Its a great product for a good price hopefully it will last the test of time.  According to the other reviews, you can&#x27;t return it to the manufacturer when purchased on Amazon.    So far so good!!</li>
    <li> We bought the T3 Featherweight through Amazon less than a year ago. The dryer died yesterday. I contacted T3 and they stated that they would not honor their warranty because Amazon was not \\&quot;an authorized dealer\\&quot;. They offered to replace the dryer for $50.00. I advised them I would let Amazon know that the dryers they are selling are not backed by a warranty because they are not an authorized dealer.  Sounds like a bunch of manure to me.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Lightweight and quieter than others I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> this is a cool and very light blow-dryer, its light and its light and its very light. its may be not as powerful as some blow dryers but its pretty strong and yes ITS very light</li>
    <li> I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn&#x27;t really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I&#x27;ve been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the \\&quot;technology\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I&#x27;m always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don&#x27;t see how this is worth spending so much money on.</li>
    <li> I like this hairdriyer, to be honest I  expect more power but work great and is not to loudy. It´s really light and great to dry your hair</li>
    <li> My conair hair dryer stopped turning off the other day so I started searching online for a new one (I do this about every 1.5yrs b/c they eventually die on me).  Happened to come across this hair dryer and was intrigued though not sure what to believe.  After all, it&#x27;s *just* a hair dryer and ridiculously expensive!  It got good and bad reviews so I figured I&#x27;d try it out.  I decided to buy one at Nordstrom because if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could return it and if I did like it, I&#x27;d have the full warranty.     To my surprise it did an AMAZING job and I&#x27;m not very skilled at styling and blow drying my hair at the same time.    I washed my hair with the same shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve been using for a few months and I towel dried it a little but my hair still felt very wet.  I did not put any \\&quot;product\\&quot; in my hair afterward like I normally do.  I used the hair dryer while sitting on the floor in my bedroom and used my brush as usual and dried/brushed it without a mirror.  It definitely dried my hair faster than other hair dryers, but I&#x27;m not sure how much time it shaved off overall.  When I was all done, my hair felt nice, but nothing stuck out UNTIL I looked in the mirror!  It was nice and smooth (no flyaways) which I can usually only get this look when I use shine/smoothing serum on my hair.  And when I do that, I&#x27;m looking in the mirror and constantly brushing/styling as I&#x27;m drying it.  This was actually pretty effortless and I&#x27;m thrilled that I didn&#x27;t have to put anything in my hair to achieve a nice, smooth, professional look.  Very impressed after first try and I&#x27;d recommend this hair dryer to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have the t3 featherweight after 3 years it lost power and I was told by my hairstylist to send it back to company. I did but didnt think they would do anything because I didnt have receipt. Two weeks later I received a brand new dryer I am very impressed by how they stand behind their product. Also I love my featherweight during the two weeks gone I used my daughters hairdryer, it took me twice as long to blow dry and it was all frizzy. My T3 is fast and leaves my hair very smooth. Worth the money if you have very curly thick unruly hair!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s sensational.  very  happy with the price and service from the shipper.  my hair has never been smoother or shinier.</li>
    <li> The hairdryer is nothing special. It is not powerful enough although I have straight hair. Not really worth the money.</li>
    <li> very good great heat control</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It&#x27;s just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I&#x27;m leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! It is NOT from an auth dealer. Amazon put up a fight when I returned it and it somehow it \\&quot;got lost in the mail\\&quot; so they didnt refund me. Seriously don&#x27;t get sucked in.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn&#x27;t dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have much blowing power.  It&#x27;s like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It&#x27;s also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it&#x27;s that fast), that&#x27;s 65 years!</li>
    <li> Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don&#x27;t waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.</li>
    <li> This is my second T3 dryer.  I have super duper thick hair and I can blow my hair in 1/2 of the time of any other hair dryer.  It&#x27;s fabulous!</li>
    <li> Not only is this the most beautiful dryer I have ever seen, it works as well as it looks.  It is light weight, quiet and cut the time it takes to dry my hair by 5 minutes.  Rushing to get ready for work in the morning 5 minutes is huge.</li>
    <li> I ordered a T3 dryer from Amazon and it came minus the serial # so I was not able to register it with T3. At the high price, it needs to be registered for warranty. Amazon replaced it, and again, the serial # is missing!!! They are not buying these from an authorized dealer. The serial # should be on the cord. Anyone else have this issue?</li>
    <li> I bought the T3 featherweight for my wife as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She&#x27;s been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn&#x27;t use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife&#x27;s hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife&#x27;s hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it&#x27;s 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there&#x27;s no way my wife is going to give up her T3.</li>
    <li> This was a great deal this is very light weight does get a little bit too hot for me. Only has a high and low not a heat option.   Definetly drys my hair in record time. Has a great long cord. Great Dryer for the price</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t locate the serial number for this anywhere, so I have to wonder where these came from. On the other hand, they are very light, quiet, and dry my hair more quickly than my $20 dryer did. I have medium texture curly/wavy blonde hair, and it makes my hair shinier than I&#x27;m used to with just the blow dry, but not really any less frizzy. However, the dryer is very hot which seems to make using my flat iron take longer since the hair seems to have already been heat-styled into a specific position (pouf) with the dryer - my old dryer didn&#x27;t provide such an effect. Interesting tradeoff, but I would keep the T3 over my old one.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000K7JLGM T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    I love this hair dryer, it is everything they said it would be. It drys my hair much faster than any other blow dryer I have ever had and it is so light weight. I plan to purchase another one for my daughter&#x27;s birthday. Love it!</li>
    <li> I recently had the pleasure of taking this dryer for a test spin at a B&amp;B while I was on vacation. It&#x27;s awesome! I have super fine hair that easily gets frizzy and limp. Also, I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time blowing it out, with high heat and tension, because it is fragile. This blow dryer worked much faster than my Revlon ionic and left my hair super smooth and shiny. The best part is that I didn&#x27;t have to super heat my hair or put much tension on it to achieve a smooth blow out. I especially noticed the difference when I came home from my vacation and used my Revlon, which resulted in frizzies.    Unfortunately, I already purchased this dryer from Amazon. It hasn&#x27;t been delivered yet and I&#x27;m returning it as soon as it gets here since Amazon is not an authorized retailer. Unfortunately I will pay more at the authorized retailers but I would rather have the warrantee intact and be able to return it if it breaks. Sephora, Ulta and Nordstrom are listed on T3&#x27;s web site as authorized retailers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my Bespoke Labs 83808-SE for a few months now and really love it. I have thick, wavy hair and am really hard on my blow dryers - and I&#x27;ve had many over the years. This one is, hands down, the quietest, fastest-drying dryer I&#x27;ve ever had, and it makes my hair shiny and smooth, not frizzy. The lint filter is easy to access and clean. In brief, there&#x27;s just nothing not to like about it. It&#x27;s pricey - but, given that I&#x27;ve gone through one or two lower-priced blow dryers every year for the past heaven-knows-how-many years and that it seems like this one&#x27;s going to last a long time, I think it&#x27;s actually the most economical choice.</li>
    <li> This dryer is worth the money!  I&#x27;ve been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don&#x27;t notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> this dryer dries my hair in about half the time i used to (5 minutes instead of 10), and i am not drenched in sweat after using it. i use it with the diffuser (T3 83807 Tourmaline Diffuser II), on the high setting, and keep it very close to my head. it was pricey but it was a good buy.</li>
    <li> Blow drys the hair Smooth and silky</li>
    <li> I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it&#x27;s October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn&#x27;t cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better.</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It&#x27;s true that the dryer doesn&#x27;t seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.</li>
    <li> BEWARE-----    I purchased this item just over 4 months ago and am recently having some problems with it working properly.  It starts off really slow on high, and often doesn&#x27;t get up to speed like it did before.  It also smells like something is burning when I first turn it on.  I called Bespoke Labs to get it replaced and was told that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized online seller and therefore they will not honor the 1 year warranty.  Bespoke will only replace the BROKEN hairdryer for an additional $55 plus I have to ship it back to them in CA.    While I loved the hair dryer, I&#x27;m not willing to sink another $55+ in to it.  Besides, who knows if the next one will work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dryer for about a month now.  Although the wattage is less than my old hair dryer it dries my hair much quicker.  My hair looks smoother and I barely need to use my flat iron anymore.  On/off switch is right where my hand goes when I hold it with my left hand which is annoying, but other than that I think it is great.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous hair dryer. I recommend this to anyone who want to cut there drying time in half. This item also shipped immediatly. I received in within a week!</li>
    <li> Blows air way too hot.  It actually burned my hair.  I previously had another blow dryer the same brand and was perfect.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this one that&#x27;s defective of they just don&#x27;t make them like before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these dryers in the past 2 1/2 years and both dryers broke the same way - I turned them on and there was a funny noise and smoke started coming out the back.  It looks like the fan just completely broke off.  I had gotten the first through my sister who is a hairdresser and she replaced it for me (that one lasted less than 6 months) and the second one lasted longer, but still not long enough considering the cost.  There are limited setting options too, so those of you looking for \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; or \\&quot;warm\\&quot; options should look elsewhere.  It is very light and I liked it, but am going back to more reasonably costing models with good reviews over risking another $100+ on this again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I&#x27;ve had much cheaper dryer&#x27;s for years and I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I&#x27;ll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn&#x27;t stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer first and then read these reviews, which is not normally how I research.  And some reviews were scary--especially the ones about the dryer burning out and breaking down after awhile.  I was also fortunate to buy it from a store where I got the warranty, which is a nice safety net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for 4 months, and, so far, I really like it.  But it did take some getting used to.  For example, I learned that if I hold it right above the nozzle (don&#x27;t actually hold the nozzle, it gets hot), I can control it better than if I hold it by the handle.  And I test each section more often as I dry because it&#x27;s easy to over dry your hair.  This dryer will dry your hair faster, so be sure to test as you go.  Also, I take out the filter every week and rinse it as the instructions suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results?  My hair dries faster (although it&#x27;s more like 30% faster), it&#x27;s shinier, it&#x27;s straighter/smoother (I have curly hair), and it seems to stay smoother longer even if the fog rolls in.  In short, I&#x27;m a fan, and I recommend it.  Just remember to give it TLC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Well, it&#x27;s been almost 3 years now (2010-2013), and the dryer is still going strong.  Everything I said in my first review still applies, but I just wanted to add that despite spending beaucoup $$ for this dryer, it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying such an expensive hair dryer. However, my best friend had one and I tried it on a trip. I thought I liked it but still wasn&#x27;t sure about spending the money. My stylist let one of the other girls dry my hair one day. She used one when drying my hair. I commented on how soft and smooth my hair was. I usually get my hair flat ironed to get the same effect. She didn&#x27;t have to. I called my girlfriend to see if her hair dryer was the same brand and it was. So I bought one. I love it and haven&#x27;t flat ironed my hair yet! The only thing I was dissapointed in was that the warranty doesn&#x27;t apply to the purchases from Amzon. I just hope it lasts for a long time so I don&#x27;t feel cheated. Overall I am very impressed. I didn&#x27;t realize that a hair dryer can make such a difference in your hair. I say go for it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hairdryer. It is poorly constructed.  When I took off the attachment, it fell apart with a piece getting stuck inside.  In trying to get the piece out the plastic cracked.  One of the worst hairdyers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Dries hair faster than a regular dryer.</li>
    <li> This dryer meets all my expectations. It did cut the drying time for straightening my curly hair, and is not so hot that I worry about scorching. It is truly lightweight and comfortable to use. The cool shot button works very well. My only complaint is that the switches are on the handle, and I routinely switch the dryer off by accident while using it.</li>
    <li> Bought it with a exciting while found it cannot be used outside US as the voltage limits to 110V. the intention is to buy as a gift for my gf in Singapore. but have to return it. what a pity.</li>
    <li> This blow dryer is the best, keeps down the frizz and styles without getting everything out of control</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this hairdryer!  It is really light, dries my hair quickly, and helps eliminate frizz and the static.</li>
    <li> I spent a fortune on this dryer, but it was worth it.  I have fine, dry hair and didn&#x27;t want anything that would take all the moisture away.  The T3 dries my hair quickly and effortlessly...look ma, no frizz!  My hair doesn&#x27;t look like I went through a wind tunnel afterwards and feels extra soft and smooth.   The dryer is also pretty quiet and lightweight.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn&#x27;t straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I&#x27;d been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don&#x27;t have a warranty with it, but I&#x27;m very happy with this appliance.</li>
    <li> For my entire half century of life, I&#x27;ve been \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with curly hair which morphs to piles of frizz in rainy, snowy or humid weather.  Regular hand-held hair dryers never quite dried my very-thick hair and didn&#x27;t prevent the frizz.  This one not only dries my hair, but does so quickly and a lot more quietly than any other I&#x27;ve used.  The best thing is that it really does reduce the FrizzFactor significantly.  I won&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s completely gone, but having 90% less frizz is cause for celebration and a four-star rating.  By the way, I live in \\&quot;HotLanta\\&quot; where frizzy-hair weather lasts longer than a Maine winter.</li>
    <li> Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it&#x27;s light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I&#x27;ve never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I&#x27;ve spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> I cant say it&#x27;s exactly the same as a hair salon blow dryer; the heat pressure coming out may be a notch less, but still very hot and the nozzle allows you to go up right against a large lock of hair. I use ceramic brushes and run the dryer close to my scalp and then down into a curling formation at the bottom of hair a handful of times, then leave the brush on my head. Gives nice bounce and &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; volume while drying my thick &amp; wavy hair. If you have straight hair and literally just blow drying (not styling), only takes a few minutes to dry, very quick!</li>
    <li> T3 is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I&#x27;m a 50 something professional with thinning, color-treated hair that is frizzy and easily dried out.  This machine leaves my hair shiny, fuller and healthy looking with no friz.  Feel like I have a new head of hair.  Will buy a 2nd dryer for the office.</li>
    <li> I Love this hair dryer so much.  I used it at a friends house several times and finally just bought my own.  Sephora sells it for $216 (after tax) and Amazon-$145.  Money well spent!  My hair is long and thick and it usually takes about 12-15 minutes to dry and that&#x27;s after I&#x27;ve towel dried it, applied makeup, fixed the bed, etc...  My T3 takes 4 minutes, I&#x27;ve actually timed it.  I know its, \\&quot;just a hairdryer\\&quot; as my husband would say but if you are anything like me in the morning every second counts. I love it and Amazon always comes through with the best prices!!  Can&#x27;t wait to buy the straightening iron!</li>
    <li> LOVE this hairdyer!!  Dries my hair in half the time, is so quiet and light in weight.  My girlfriend has owned this dryer for years and always has it with her when we travel together.  After our last vacation together I decided it was time I owned my own!</li>
    <li> I bought this item 1/09 and it is still going strong.  It&#x27;s lightweight and dries my hair (chin length) in a matter of minutes (a bit longer than an afternoon commercial), yet isn&#x27;t blowing my hair to pieces and doesn&#x27;t really seem terribly hot like some hairdryers do.  In fact my daughter used it once when she was visiting and as soon as she turned it on, said it was terrible - that it was going to take forever to dry her hair (she has very long hair).  A short time later her hair was dry and looked great. She really liked it then.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically like to spend $110 on a hair dryer. But, I would spend double for this one. It drys my hair quickly without frizzing it. Since I&#x27;ve started using this dryer, I don&#x27;t need to use a flattner. My hair is already smooth after the dry. This is going to prevent a lot of damage on my hair. Maybe I&#x27;ll be albe to grow it out now. The one flaw, is the dryer makes an occasional rattle. It sounds like a screw is loose. But, if it breaks, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> This dryer is by far the lightest I have used. It does the job but DOES NOT dry hair any faster than my chi. It actually takes longer but I do notice a little less frizz. If you are looking for less stress on your arm and neck I recommend trying this.</li>
    <li> The Bespoke T3 hairdryer performs excellent, it is a bit expensive, but certainly worth the money.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000M51UIY T3 Featherweight (Bespoke Labs) 83808 Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    After seeing a review in the Vogue spring issue, I ordered thru Amazon and received the dryer in days. I am delighted with it. It has instant heat, a cool off button and is light weight. I had asked my hairdresser about it and she was not familar with it. I took it with me to my last appointment and she used it. She is now inquiring if she can get one thru her supplier. I plan to order the travel weight dryer.</li>
    <li> I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I&#x27;ll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I hesitated spending this much money on a hairdryer but the reviews were very convincing.  I am so glad that I invested in this product.  I used to hate drying my hair but it is so quick with this product.  There really is a significant difference in the drying time when compared with other dryers.  But most of all, my hair is so much healthier.  My co-workers made multiple comments on the condition of my hair shortly after using the dryer.  The shine is wonderful and my hair is so healthy.  When I think about how much I spend on my hair at the salon, this one-time investment is definitely worth the money.  There is no comparison.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I used to swear by the Chi but this one is not even comparable!  Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Lasted 7 months.  In that 7 months it sporatically shuts itself off.  Now its completely dead.  The manufacturer won&#x27;t warranty it because amazon is not an authorized dealer.    My $10 conair has lasted at least 15 years!  What a waste.</li>
    <li> I used the dryer for about a year.  One day I was blow drying my then 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair when sparks started flying out of the dryer.  I freaked out!  I am trying to get a replacement but the company is giving me a hard time because I bought it through Amazon and they are not an \\&quot;authorized re-seller.\\&quot;  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I really like the hair dyer.It is light, drys hair in half the time,but I had no idea that Amazon was not an authorized dealer. If you don&#x27;t mind taking the chance paying $100 with no warranty,it&#x27;s a great dryer.I think it is deceptive of Amazon to sell this product as new, and not let people know what they are getting into. Marianne</li>
    <li> A friend of mine had gotten this blow dryer a few years back and raved about it.... I thought it was insane to pay that price for a blow dryer..     It works! It&#x27;s amazing. There&#x27;s a SIGNIFICANT improvement in the texture of my hair.... I am naturally probably the darkest shade of very fine blond on the color swatch and I have almost always colored my hair platinum... As you can imagine, my hair is very fragile. The difference in the way my hair looks and feels after I use the T3 is remarkable.     The volume of the blow dryer is very low. It feels as though it&#x27;s not pushing out as much power, but it is... it&#x27;s just quieter about it. :)    The only problem I have with this product is that the On/Off switch is right on the shaft where your hand belongs so it is accidentally turned on and off very easily. That is annoying.    Anyways, I highly recommend it. I did my Blow Dryer Research before buying this, and everything indicated that this is the best one on the market. Agreed.    Good luck. :)</li>
    <li> I have always used relatively inexpensive hair dryers and have never had one break.  I splurged over $150 for a Bespoke Dryer and the thing burned out before I even had it for a year (and I don&#x27;t even use it once daily).  It literally sets off the smoke alarm when I use it.  Had to throw it out.  What a total waste of money.  And forget any warranty - they don&#x27;t stand by their product.</li>
    <li> I received the hairdryer in July as a gift and by the following February it was dead.  It worked great while it lasted but as I was the ONLY person using it, I feel it should have lasted a lot longer.  I have had $20 hairdryers that have lasted for 5 plus years.  However, I will say that Amazon stepped up and went above and beyond service and replaced the dryer immediately.  Very happy with Amazon and hoping the new dryer lasts longer than 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have thick, coarse, slightly wavy hair that takes a long time to dry.  It is difficult to keep it from getting frizzy and to have it do what I want.  This is the best dryer I have ever used for my hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer is most definetely worth the money.  I have naturaly curly/frizzy hair.  This dryer gives me soft, smooth hair in less time.  The dryer is less weight and less noisy than all of the others I have tried.  This dryer is the best!!</li>
    <li> This review is for the T3 &#x27;Overnight&#x27; dual-voltage hair dryer.  I have just used it overseas and I am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240V setting (every other dual-voltage hair dryer I&#x27;ve had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas).    This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves.  I can&#x27;t say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and super fast.  With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry.  Not anymore!  I also like the little \\&quot;bling\\&quot; added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer.  Dries my hair very fast and seems to help with static electricity.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but if you have long hair it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> This has cut down on my drying time and is very gentle to my hair.  While it is expensive, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I will say that this blowdryer does dry my hair faster than a regular one, but for 150 bucks my hair still comes out frizzy.  I tried to send the warranty and yes since amazon is NOT an authorized buyer Bespoke Labs will NOT honor the warranty.  It was too late for me to return. I&#x27;d rather have bought the smaller version full price at Sephora or somewhere else, but I feel this was a big waste of my money.</li>
    <li> I love this blow dryer! The first time I used it I couldn&#x27;t believe how much volume and thickness I had in my usually limp hair! I rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> In order to register this product and receive the factory warranty, there is a label on the box that says we need to find a silver decal on the cord of the product. After an exaustive search, I figured out that AMAZON.COM is not an authorized reseller and we do not qualify for a warranty... even worse, they say that the product may be temperad or fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confess I am pretty sad with that.</li>
    <li> I made my purchase and then read the reviews afterwards.  Big mistake!  After reading the reviews, I discovered many customers had problems with the serial numbers missing and doubts of authenticity.  When my product finally arrived, sure enough, the serial numbers were missing.  The product was so obviously fake!  It had large white tags on the cord where serial numbers should have been, the box wasn&#x27;t sealed, and even the plug had a different look from a real one.  I would not recommend this purchase, no matter how good the price.  Instead, spend your money on a genuine T3...it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon.</li>
    <li> This is my second T3 hair dryer and I love it.  Especially the price on Amazon is half off compared to all other retailers!</li>
    <li> It was used and broken :(</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 T3 hair dryers and 2 have had electrical issues.  The company replaced one dryer, which I give them credit for making an effort.  However, my last dryer blew up at the base, where the cord connects to the dryer.  Sparks flew and it scared the living daylight out of me.  I contacted the company but have not received a reply.  I used to be a fan of this product, which was proven when I purchased from them a second and third time; however, NEVER again.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer! 2nd I&#x27;ve owned. First one I got on QVC- Amazon was cheaper to go for this one!  T3 is worth it for hair dryer- I know they r much more expensive- but worth the price. Drying time is less- cuts down on frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never go back to store brand!!</li>
    <li> Its light weight and I love the new technology.  It&#x27;s very good for colored treated hair.</li>
    <li> This dryer dries your hair unbelievably fast. Half the time as my old drier. For anyone with long hair that can become a pain. It leaves your hair smooth and dry all the way through but not dried out and with little frizz. It&#x27;s great. Plus it has a cool shot button.</li>
    <li> This is a great dryer for curlie hair.  Don&#x27;t forget to clean the filter.  I did and the dryer stopped working.  so now, I purchased need a new one.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this several years ago but I still use it.  This is a quiet, well made blow dryer that works very well.  It&#x27;s expensive; but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I am a Fan of T3 items for years, This dryer seems to dry my hair very fast, leaving it shiny</li>
    <li> I have a ton of hair and it is curly and let me tell you this is the first hair dryer that I have ever found that does such an amazing job on my hair. Salon quality all the way.  This is my second time buying one for myself because I had my other one for so many years that it eventually died. My mom and sister in law have it also.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a little more from this dryer in terms of the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; and ionic magic that comparable dryers usually do on hair.  It does the job, but I used a different model at my friend&#x27;s place and that dryer works much better.  I like that it&#x27;s lightweight though and the long cord is a plus.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent blow dryer! I read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn&#x27;t work right out of the box. Same thing happened to me, except that I realized that if you press the red RESET button on the plug, it works just fine. My hair dries faster, without over-drying. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> When my wife first said she wanted me to get her this for her birthday, I though she had lost her mind. $100 for a hair dryer????!!!!!!!    Well, gotta keep her happy so I got it for her. After her using it for about a year, I must say that it really does work better then the cheaper hair dryers she&#x27;s been using.    Her hair tends to get frizzy and this dryer really does solve that problem a lot better the $25 hair dryer she was using before. It seems well constructed. MAKE SURE you clean out the filter under the back end cap!! It kept stopping every 5-8 minutes &amp; my wife thought it was overheating. But I noticed that the filter was clogged. After cleaning it, the hair dryer was back to normal.    I still have a hard time with paying $100 for a hair dryer but I must say that it actually does seem to work better  than \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair dryers.</li>
    <li> First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it&#x27;s no featherweight, it&#x27;s heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn&#x27;t register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it&#x27;s sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it&#x27;s real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn&#x27;t even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don&#x27;t buy, it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it but this hair dryer was everything they said it would be.  I especially love the fact that it is lightweight, and dried my hair in half the time of my old hair dryer.  I got a great deal through Amazon - all other retailers were charging more than double for it.</li>
    <li> I purchased one to try. Then two more, the first on failed at at arrival and since I call 32 days after I ordered, not received. It has been used twice! They declined to honor this purchase? I have called five times to only be told there is no supervisor to make a decision? Them they tell me they declined it. But will never call or email back! The product is defective. The handle is burning up and burnt my daughter&#x27;s hand!    Dissipointed!!!</li>
    <li> Great dryer and seller</li>
    <li> Great value.  It may seem silly to spend more than $30 on a blow dryer but the Bespoke keeps my hair smooth and shiny.  There is a reason professional stylists use this product.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my daughter.  She picked it out.  haven&#x27;t heard but am sure it&#x27;s OK.</li>
    <li> I know this is supposed to be the best hair dryer ever, but it&#x27;s not. Maybe I got a lemon, but mine has never worked very well. It takes FOREVER to dry my hair. And yes, I do clean the filter regularly. When friends stay over and borrow it, they always comment on how horrible it is. I look forward to traveling so I can use those crappy little hotel hair dryers attached to the wall, because they work better than this one. I don&#x27;t normally write negative reviews, but I can&#x27;t recommend strongly enough NOT to buy this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $20 on a ConAir model, and you will be much much happier. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype like I did!</li>
    <li> I bought this hairdryer under the impression that I was getting some magnificent piece of equipment. At $200, this \\&quot;magnificent piece of equipment\\&quot; starting whistling at me within DAYS of using it. I went back to the store, and they kindly exchanged it. About one week later, it began whistling again. I went back to the store and they exchanged it for me. The third hairdryer I received didn&#x27;t whistle until about a month of using it. Because this hairdryer got so many great reviews, I was willing to exchange it one more time, and so, I got my fourth hairdryer in 2008. It worked great up until about four days ago when I smelled something that smelled like it was burning. That alarmed me, but I ignored it. Then two days later, I heard something pop inside my hairdryer. After that, there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it! I finally had had enough, so today, I returned my hairdryer and got my money back. My husband did some research, and we found a great $35 hairdryer that works just as well, if not better, than the $200 piece of crap that I had to return multiple times.</li>
    <li> Would not purchase a product if it cannot be registered for warranty. Purchased in good good faith hair dryer through Amazon and upon receiving it, went online to register it. Was told by manufacturer that seller not authorized dealer for this product and therefore it could not be registered. Therefore would like to return and have notified seller who does not respond. I expect a full refund.</li>
    <li> This product comes with a one year warranty from the merchant as opposed to a four year warranty from the manufacturer. There is no serial number attached to the power cord so you can&#x27;t register for warranty.  Also our product made a distinctive sound that we did not have when we bought our first hair dryer from the manufacturer directly 5 years ago... Lesson learned, wanted to try to save on the purchase price, lost on the quality and warranty. Attempting to return the product. I would advise not to buy this product from this merchant.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned.  It is quick and easy.  My hairdresser just told me that he hates to blow-dry my hair because its too healthy which makes it take longer to blow-dry.  This is the only hairdryer I will ever use.  I have used it for the past 7 years and have noticed a huge difference in my hair.  You will not regret getting this!</li>
    <li> This is the worst dryer I&#x27;ve ever used in 20 years as a professional stylist. Arrived damaged. Seller refuses to take it back. They call it \\&quot;bespoke\\&quot; Because it sounds like the a  BEE in your ear. Rattles.</li>
    <li> Very very lightweight and easy on the hands.  Dries quickly &amp; leaves hair shiny.</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer, great price and very light weight.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this hair dryer. I debated between the Elchim 2001 Classic and this one, and ended up getting this one. i shouldn&#x27;t have ignored the reviews cautioning me on this product. After using this product for about 3 months, it&#x27;s broken; it makes a low whirring sound and barely blows any air out on high power, makes a weird burning smell, and emits extremely, extremely hot air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, potential buyers, beware!!!!! I didn&#x27;t believe the negative reviews here, but trust me, now I do!! My new Elchim Classic will hopefully arrive within the next week.</li>
    <li> Paid almost $100 for worst blower i ever had! Dont get fooled by its stylish looks. The heat was generous but the power was weak and took forever to dry my short hair.  To top it off in less than 4 weeks the front nozzle broke off making it totally unusable. I purchased this hair blower for its high rating on an online review as being one of the best hair blowers for the price.  I was also looking for a lightweight blower which is probably the only good thing you will get from this product! According to what ive read on Amazon,  I dont believe it is warrantied by the manufacturer when purchased from Amazon. Dont waste your money!  Will try and get a refund from the seller.... DiscountsJungle</li>
    <li> Worked great for a while. Tip of blow dryer broke off in first month, had to crazy glue it back on. Just died about a year later, no heat. It was a great price just wished it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> The hair dryer is super light. It drys my thin hair quickly without over drying and leaves a subtle sheen that my hair didn&#x27;t have before without changing shampoo or conditioner. Also the cool shot button actually blows cool air not luke warm so will be useful for setting styles.</li>
    <li> This is the best dryer.  Does not burn your hair  And dries it very quickly</li>
    <li> First off, the hair dryer worked great when it was working.  You can read the other reviews about how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT -- the wire slowly starts to twist and it&#x27;s not possible to fully untwist it.  It has to do with the rubber that covers the copper wire.  Well, this morning the wire completely disconnected from the hairdryer itself.  There was no smoke, fire, etc.  It just twisted off.  This is poor construction and something that you&#x27;d expect from a cheap product, not from something that&#x27;s $100+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 2 stars because when it was working it was great, but a $100+ hair dryer should last longer than a year and a half.  $30 hair dryers may suck, but they are at least built to last longer than this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two.  First one quit working in 2 months.  Replacement ALSO quit working after 3 months.  I still haven&#x27;t gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for \\&quot;processing\\&quot;.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time &amp; expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn&#x27;t they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don&#x27;t want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don&#x27;t have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You&#x27;ll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.  The second one in mid-Marchlay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.   The second one in mid-March</li>
    <li> I have used this dryer twice since I got it and it works great on my relazed hair.  I haven&#x27;t become proficient with the round brush but I use Aveda&#x27;s Hang Straight lotion and a comb to blow dry small sections of hair at a time.  My hair comes out shiny and smooth.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This dryer is not worth the money!!!  I used it for 3 days in a row thinking it would get better for some reason and it didn&#x27;t.  It did nothing exceptioinal for my hair.  It barley blew out any air.  My hair looked and felt the same after every blow dry.  Compared to the dryer I have now, which I spent $50 on at Sally Beauty Supply, I would rather keep my old one.  In my opinion the old one did a better job for less money.  I don&#x27;t see what all the hype is about T3 products? I also tried a straightening iron by them and it was a piece of %*&amp;#.</li>
    <li> I really love this blowdryer.  It really does eliminate frizz.  I&#x27;m not sure if my hair really is healthier, but it definitely LOOKS like it is!</li>
    <li> When we tried to register the warranty, the company refused because a silver serial number tag on the power cord was missing -- and they said it was missing because Amazon tampered with the product.  No kidding!  We don&#x27;t believe for a second that Amazon would ever do anything like this.  What we suspect, but don&#x27;t know, is that the manufacturer, T3 Micro, Inc., is protecting its full-price vendors.  As to the blower, what you&#x27;re getting for roughly half price is a pretty good unit.  It is very light and comfortable, but controls are limited.  There are two fan speeds, but no heat settings.  There is a cool air switch. All in all, it does a very nice job -- and on low speed, it is especially quiet.  Despite the warranty situation, we decided to keep the blower.  We would have given the blower itself three stars, maybe four, but the warranty matter was very disturbing.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t have bought a better one!</li>
    <li> Extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time, leaving it with a wonderful shine.  Also much quieter than my previous blowdryer, which is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t rate it if I didn&#x27;t have too!!! I&#x27;ve gone through 5 of these until I quit trying to actually receive one that wasn&#x27;t defective!!! DON&#x27;T BUY THIS DRYER!!!!! This dryer isn&#x27;t even manufactured by T3 anymore!! I think I kept getting refurbished ones. They all came vibrating as soon as I turned them on. BEWARE, DON&#x27;T PURCHASE!!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this for me three years ago. The hairdryer outlasted the man! Its a great lightweight dryer. I have soft but wild curly hair that i straighten from time to time. I also purchased the diffuser and used the dryer almost every day. The cool setting is great. Its still has a strong windstream but with cooler air for a more natural air dried look. The heat is not too hot. Never burned or hurt my scalp. great dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dryer literally just broke and I am back on amazon ordering another one. Anything I can use everyday for 3+ years, I will invest in again. I recommend this dry to all my friends.</li>
    <li> The blow dryer died after six months.  It just completely stopped working.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  My hair which usually took about 25 minutes to dry is literally dry in ten minutes or less and feels better, less dried out.  Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Cut the dry time in half. And my hair looks fuller , even the color looks richer. Only used it 3 times so far. Sure hope it last forever, because thats the most Iv ever paid for a hairdryer.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this hairdryer and I can&#x27;t say enough about it. It is lightweight and has a high/low setting and a cool trigger. It comes with several filter replacements although I&#x27;ve had mine about a year and haven&#x27;t needed to replace that yet. I just suck the lint/dust out with my vacuum when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has done wonders for my hair. I always had cheapie dryers that got pretty hot. I didn&#x27;t realize their was another way! I have a lot of coarse hair so usually after drying I look like the before part of the Frizz-ease commercial. With this dryer (while using a round brush) I don&#x27;t even need to straighten my hair. It doesn&#x27;t get very hot at all and it cut my drying time in half!! Not sure how that&#x27;s possible but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the cheapest price on Amazon and my stylist was shocked when she heard how little I paid so I was pretty pleased. I&#x27;ll never go back to those cheapie dryers ever again!!!</li>
    <li> We tried other brands after the first T3 died, but they never matched how well the T3 performed. My wife explicitly asked for another T3, got it, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this dryer 2 stars because when it works, it is the best dryer.  I like it because it generates good heat without the blow part being a hurricane, which allows for good control for drying and styling and I get compliments on my hair and how shiny it is.  The huge disappointment in this dryer is that this is my second one, and in a year it broke the one before that same deal, lasted just under 2 years.  A $150 dryer should last longer than that.  I cleaned the filter as recommended, if it requires more than what i was doing then i guess the dryer is just too high maintenance for me.  I just contacted the vendor i bought it through and i&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer is going to replace it, otherwise i&#x27;m done using these dryers.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &amp;#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&amp;#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don&#x27;t do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My wife swears by it.  The only hair dryer that doesn&#x27;t leave her hair like a tangled mess!  ; )  Sorry honey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Super Solano professional dryer for years but was burning my hair, so, after a lot of internet research, decided to try this model.  This dryer does not push out as much air, but it is much lighter and quieter - which at first made me think it was not doing as good a job.  To my surprise, it actually did a better job in the same amount of time.  Despite the heat, no burning occurred, and my slightly wavy hair was nice and straight, shiny and smooth.  Not really sure what ions or tourmaline do, but the results are solid.</li>
    <li> Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here&#x27;s the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000K7JLGM T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    This dryer is dangerous, and doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Yes, it dries hair. There is no standard temperature setting, you can just have high strength or low (wind level, not heat) and it is so hot i&#x27;ve burned myself and my hair on it. Because it gets so hot, it&#x27;s own internal temperature regulator SHUTS IT OFF all the time in the middle of drying. The only way to turn it back on is to wait until it decides it&#x27;s ready to go again (several minutes of sitting.) It is quieter, but who cares, if it&#x27;s quietly burning your skin and hair? i am actively pursuing a refund, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> bought it. didn&#x27;t use it. wanted a silver one. picture looks silver. returned it. will get exactly what i want instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best investment. I wish I had known about it years ago. This dryer cuts drying time in half and my hair is shiny when I use it.</li>
    <li> I just received the dryer today and have already used it.  It dried my hair faster than other dryers.  A bit pricey.  My last T3 lasted about 4 years</li>
    <li> After four years of ownership, this hairdryer finally crapped out on me today.  The heating element had been on the fritz for perhaps the last six months.  It would blow hot for about 30 seconds and then switch to cold.  I could get the heater working again by holding down the COLD button for a few moments - I assumed the core was overheating. Today it stopped blowing hot altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four years is a pretty good run, but for the high price tag, I guess I expected more.  I&#x27;ve owned cheap hairdryers that lasted much longer.  I will explore what other fancy hairdryers are out on the market right now before I&#x27;d consider re-purchasing.</li>
    <li> I would definitely not recommend purchasing this product as it is a safety hazard. I had an issue with the dryer sparking and smoking at the electrical outlet and had to get rid of it. The circuit protector never worked properly to warn of an electrical problem. I see where this has been an issue for others and believe Bespoke should recall the T3 before they get sued for the outbreak of a fire.</li>
    <li> This is my first T3 blow dryer and my last.  I purchased this hair dryer last September at the recommendation of my sister.  Paying over $100 for a blow dryer is a lot in my opinion if you are not a stylist.  It has a cool air button which will not turn off now.  I can&#x27;t get even warm air to blow out of it.  And by the way, my sister&#x27;s T3 blow dryer stopped working as well.  NOT WORTH THE $$$$.</li>
    <li> I have owned 3 T3s (Three different models, including this one). They are great while they last. My third one just died after only 5 months and I WON&#x27;T be buying another one! The heating element has gone out on every one of them after less than a year of use. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This hairdryer is everything it claims to be: lightweight, fast-drying and the price well worth it. I have long wavy, colored, \\&quot;tends to be frizzy\\&quot; hair and this hairdryer makes it smoother than any other I have used; and I have tried MANY (both cheap and expensive). If I take my time and section my hair, I can get it smooth enough to not have to use a flat iron after (which I have always had to do before). If I&#x27;m in a real hurry, I can dry it fast and then just smooth it with the flat iron. Overall, it takes much less time than ever. It has an extra long cord which is great for getting the dryer pointed in all directions as needed and the cool-shot button works very well. If this one ever gives out, I would buy another just like it, which is more than I can say for others I have tried. I got one first for my daughter who has very long, thick hair which she always dries as fast as possible (always in a hurry). She has a little bit of frizz but this hairdryer dries it smoother than others she has used and she never has to use a flat iron after. We both love our hair better than before when drying was an ordeal with inconsistent results.</li>
    <li> The dryer is pretty lightweight and quiet.  Leaves my hair free of frizzies so for me it passes the test just a tad expensive. The cord coRd be a little longer  and I woujd liek a few more accessories but by and large a good buy</li>
    <li> I owned this hairdryer for about 6 months. I must have gotten a dud because it never seemed really powerful, got waaaay too hot, and broke after 6 months. My hair didn&#x27;t look any different with this dryer than with my old Conair cheapie that I got from CVS.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is the absolute best. It works faster than any other drier I have used and is less damaging to your hair. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Dries my hair with higher heat BUT SO MUCH FASTER!!  Dries SUPER fast, shiny &amp; with a lot less flyaways.  PLUS I found it on Amazon for a great price!!! Excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> Not the best hair drier I&#x27;ve used it gets hot as you cornuie to use it but I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I was to look for a professional hair drier that can bring up the heat because this doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever used.  It is very quiet and light.  Since it&#x27;s an Ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny.  It&#x27;s a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it&#x27;s so lightweight.  I would highly recommened it..</li>
    <li> Best Blowdryer!  Leaves hair straight and without frizz.  Also great on straightened or colored hair.</li>
    <li> It is quiet and dries all our hair quickly and feels soft after.  I was referred to this dryer by my sister and I love love it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone that wants a light weight, quiet and very good dryer.  Cord is long so does not get tangled!</li>
    <li> This is a very noisy dryer....and the switch is in the wrong place and easy to turn off by accident when drying your hair...I would not purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer, I have had it for a long time now. works like new.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this professionally she loves how lightweight it is but at the same time really pushes some air flow to dry hair. If she ever needs another it will be one of these. So far it has out lasted any other brand she has used.</li>
    <li> This is an essential part of my life since I blow dry my own hair most of the time - love this.</li>
    <li> the on-off switch is extremely sensitive and right where your fingers land when you hold it - I am constantly turning it off while drying my hair. Really needs to be fixed. Other that that, it is a fine dryer.</li>
    <li> I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> Worked well and as described.  Motor started to sound like a lawn mower, one week after it&#x27;s one year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace my CHI that stopped blowing hot air.  I have below shoulder length thick, coarse, frizzy hair and it takes forever to dry.  I loved my CHI because it was lightwieght, super quiet and always left my hair straight, and soft in short time.  I would have gotten another CHI, but I always felt that it was too hot and had no different settings other than the cold shot or low.  I heard good things about the T3 because it has similiar features to the CHI.  It is defintely lightweight so this is a godsend to your arms.  Maybe I am too used to the CHI being so hot, but I found that the T3 wasnt that hot and hence it took me longer to dry my hair then I would like.  Maybe 5 to 10 minutes longer.  It did do an great job of controlling frizze and it is quiet and light.  I have only used it once so far, so I have to see if the time to dry improves and how long it will last.  I am concerned about other reviews here stating it doesnt last more than a few months.  If mine dies, I will update this review. For now, I think this dryer is ok, but perhaps you can get the same in cheaper dryers.  Jury is still out.  :)  I give it a 3 for lightweight and quiet and it does get the job done nicely, but not as fast as my CHI did.</li>
