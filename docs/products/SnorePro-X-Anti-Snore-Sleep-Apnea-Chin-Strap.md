### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>What a joke, great if you want a headache!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried using this instead of my CPAP machine yet, but when using it WITH the CPAP, it does a great job!  </li>
      <li>this product is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>thanks for the wonderful well priced product!!!</li>
      <li>Good, but not always easy to keep on</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not costly so worth a try..  </li>
      <li>VERY tight right out of the package - sure hope it stretches out some.  </li>
      <li>It wont allow my jaw to close in a normal position, pushes it into an under bite.</li>
      <li>It does work, especially if you use it along with a breathe right strip.</li>
      <li>I sleep a little better, and don&#x27;t wake with signs I&#x27;ve been snoring or sleeping with my mouth open.  </li>
      <li>If you are a typical female or a small guy this might fit you ok, but it is small for my big melon.</li>

    <li> helps little bit , uncomfortable at times.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t reduce my snoring but helps to keep my jaw in alignment.</li>
    <li> The product is OK, but uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Chin strap was replaced by plastic nose unpluggers!  Not what I payed for or what was sold!</li>
    <li> Good, but not always easy to keep on and it does nothing for nasal noises.</li>
    <li> My hubby won&#x27;t wear it, said it hurts his jaw.</li>
    <li> Instant headache!  No thanks!</li>
    <li> VERY tight right out of the package - sure hope it stretches out some.  Gave me an instant headache, and the velcro was on the last possible inch.  I have a big head (7 1/2), but it&#x27;s not huge. The return policy is generous - I might have to do just that.</li>
    <li> A waste.  Doesn&#x27;t keep my mouth closed even if it is so tight it is irritating, and the surface at the chin is rough and irritating.</li>
    <li> It gave me a head ache and my jaw hurt.</li>
    <li> What a joke, great if you want a headache!</li>

    <li> OMG! this product is amazing! totally would recommend everyone with a snoring issue to buy it! snoring for me was always such an embarrassment. like whenever I sleep with someone else in the room, which happens quite often since we constantly have guest, i literally need to keep myself awake throughout the night. since i have purchased this strap... I literally invite people in my room to sleep with me! thanks for the wonderful well priced product!!!</li>
    <li> Causes me jaw pain when I wear it.  It wont allow my jaw to close in a normal position, pushes it into an under bite.</li>
    <li> I have yet to wake up with this strap still attached to my head. If you are a typical female or a small guy this might fit you ok, but it is small for my big melon. It does work, especially if you use it along with a breathe right strip. I just wish it would stay on..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all!!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t for me...perhaps others will find it helpful so I don&#x27;t want to discourage someone from trying it.  It&#x27;s not costly so worth a try..  Good luck.</li>
    <li> It works, just have to get use to wearing it.</li>
