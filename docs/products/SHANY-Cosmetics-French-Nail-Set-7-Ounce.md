      <li>The polishes were really easy to use and drys very quickly!</li>
      <li>I can create the most professional look with these polishes and I am not that great at doing nails</li>
      <li>For A Great French Style!</li>
      <li>It really is super easy with this set.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all right in my kit when I need it!</li>
      <li>All you need for a good french tip, is all in this set.</li>
      <li>Polish is extremely thick and stickers are not the greatest.</li>
      <li>The white was good though, that went on correctly.</li>
      <li>I have always loved getting the french manicure</li>
      <li>I will buy this set if I ever want to do a french manicure, or a pedicure, because this would be good value for the money, and because this set can be used over and over again to get the desired results.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect for creating the ultimate cute, yet classic french nail.</li>
      <li>I love the look of them, but the cost is normally to high.</li>
      <li>I recently decided I would start doing my own nails and nail art.</li>
      <li>(They are not on the actual bottle, probably since it&#x27;s a set and it&#x27;s kind of assumed it&#x27;s together).</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>You got everything from basecoat to topcoat for your own french manicure.</li>
      <li>The french manicure is a timeless classic and with this set it is super easy and affordable to do yourself and achieve that salon look for a fraction of the price!!</li>
      <li>The price is just right as well.</li>
      <li>Overall: super satisfied and recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I ended up taking it all off and only using the white polish from the kit and my own top coat.</li>
      <li>This makes doing a french manicure so easy to use!</li>
      <li>I think that french manicures look great on a woman, especially on the toe nails.  </li>
      <li>They dry super fast and have a nice tint to them.</li>
      <li>I am sure I will get better at doing French manicures after a little more practice.  </li>
      <li>These little nail polishes are pretty good for the price.</li>
      <li>The packaging was interesting especially since it gave you directions on how to apply the nail polish and the required ingredients were on it too</li>
      <li>Only the top coat serves its purpose.</li>
      <li>At the nail salon it cost like $20 and up and this only cost $12 so this is cheap !</li>
      <li>One of my nails ended up stained from the removal of the polish, but I could at least be happy</li>
      <li>When working with French Manicures, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to spend more and get high quality polish.</li>
      <li>The top coat is thick, plastic-like and very cheap.</li>
      <li>I thought a small started kit would be good to learn the basics.</li>
      <li>The nail polish does not harden, I can still easily scratch it off the next day.</li>
      <li>The nail polishes included in this set definitely did not act like any of the other nail polishes I&#x27;ve experienced; I couldn&#x27;t just leave paint on my skin to clean up later too since I can&#x27;t do thetwo stroke nail trick.</li>
      <li>This kit has all you need for that classic look!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the polish is very high quality.  </li>
      <li>However, that didn&#x27;t really bug me.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and didn&#x27;t quite mind the whole fact that it was mini bottles</li>
      <li>but I do not like how the stickers fit on the nail that help determine where to paint the white tip.</li>
      <li>so I had know clue how much pressure I should have applied on them.</li>
      <li>I had originally looked into buying french nail nail polishes separately and came across this product.</li>
      <li>it was mainly for beginners –– I&#x27;m a beginner if that even really matters.</li>
      <li>It came with everything you need for a great french manicure and without all the hard work of trying to do it yourself.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  </li>
      <li>I wish the pink colours were rather see through rather than fully tinted, but they are still very pretty.</li>
      <li>the pink is very pretty .</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m surprised because their products (at least the ones I&#x27;ve bought off amazon) are of top notch</li>
      <li>i thought they would go on clear with a tint</li>
      <li>The neutral colors are also very opaque and not very sheer.  </li>
      <li>If i was a 13 yr old girl</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking that this product is old and expired perhaps?</li>
      <li>I want to have the look of my nails professionally done but dont have the time to pamper my self.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product quality is very cheap. I bought it for the 2 basecoats and the guide sticker but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. The quality of the nail polish is beyond poor and the other &amp;#34;accesories&amp;#34; they give you is also poorly made. I&#x27;m not a big expert on nail polish but I could still tell how shoddy it is. Money well wasted.</li>
    <li> I thought a lot before buying this and I  wish I&#x27;d thought some more. I have a collection of Shany nail polishes and they are good quality. This set, however, is not. The polishes are overly thick and the stickers pull up the color.</li>
    <li> Turned my nails yellow which took me over a month to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Polish is extremely thick and stickers are not the greatest.</li>
    <li> I might actually purchase this myself and try it. I am a person who likes to do my nails especially french too and i wouldn&#x27;t want to waste so much money going to the nail salon. At the nail salon it cost like $20 and up and this only cost $12 so this is cheap !</li>
    <li> Shany cosmetic always supply&#x27;s quality in their nail polish! It always last and doesn&#x27;t chip. I can create the most professional look with these polishes and I am not that great at doing nails so I am glad there is a simple way to get excellent results!</li>
    <li> I like the idea of the whole set but the colors are just a little too pale for my skin.</li>
    <li> Its great for the price you pay. I normally try to spend more in nail polish because I like them when they last for about a week at least. This one will last about 2 days or so depending on how active you are with your hands washing and doing things like that. I am really active so it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me but for the price is something I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product :(&lt;br /&gt;Bad quality</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. The item arrived with a bottle open, therefore spilled everywhere. After a couple of uses the polish seems to thicken. It comes with manicure guides and that helps a lot. Overall it&#x27;s decent.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. But I say don&#x27;t purchase the product. All the products especially the white tip coat, it us very thick like wall paint. It spoiled my mood.</li>
    <li> I regret purchasing this, the quality of the polish is horrendous.  If i was a 13 yr old girl id probably think it was great but if you have even a remote knowledge of what good polish looks like you will hate it.</li>
    <li> Terrible. The nail polish does not harden, I can still easily scratch it off the next day. The stickers pull off the polish when you use them for painting on white tips. When you pull off the stickers it also pulls off some of the white polish. Not a recommended buy!</li>
    <li> The french manicure is a timeless classic and with this set it is super easy and affordable to do yourself and achieve that salon look for a fraction of the price!!</li>
    <li> The french manicure look is so chic and will never get old! It&#x27;s all right in my kit when I need it! All of the colors look so nice together. They just flow</li>
    <li> Love that it comes with basically everything! and all the tools too great products and the price is awesome! shany products are always good quality and so i wouldn&#x27;t hesitate you should totally buy it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been loving the french nail style lately and this set has everything you need! The angle brush is a great add!</li>
    <li> The polish in this set arrived so thick that I couldn&#x27;t paint my nails at all with it, much less do a French tip!  The neutral colors are also very opaque and not very sheer.  Even though it was just a few bucks, save yourself the money and either invest in a nicer nail set or get a manicure!</li>
    <li> I just got the french nail set from Shany and I admit I am really happy with the quality of the nail polish. They dry super fast and have a nice tint to them. It comes with everything for french nail and other designs, they really though of it all for hands and feed! I wish the pink colours were rather see through rather than fully tinted, but they are still very pretty. Overall: super satisfied and recommend this product. Super fair price and great quality!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the quality of the product, it is a great beginners kit. The base coats are a bit too much being opaque so I mixed them with a bit of the clear polish to get a tinted base coat which is clear. I used the enclosed tools to make a design using the opaque pink base coat along the french tip and my own sparkle polish on the tip itself. Forgot to take a photo of the before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is great and really versatile.</li>
    <li> Bought this since shany cosmetics has yet to disappoint me. However, this product has finally done it. The presentation is lovely ill give it that with lots of practical things like the toe seperators, tip guide stickers, nail file, and brush/tool combo. For that alone, it got 3 stars. It&#x27;s the nail polish I did not like at all. They went on streaky and thick as opposed to thin and able to be build up on. The beige and pink did the same effect. The white was good though, that went on correctly. The top coat should be labeled as a base coat bc it does not have a glossy finish. It&#x27;s matte at best. I think shany could of done better with this and I&#x27;m surprised because their products (at least the ones I&#x27;ve bought off amazon) are of top notch quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- jill</li>
    <li> I got this product so I could give myself a french manicure. I love the look of them, but the cost is normally to high. With this product I get the best of both worlds.  I would recommend this product for anyone who loves the look of a french manicure but hates the price of one. It is so easy to use this product and it leaves your nails looking amazing.</li>
    <li> I recently decided I would start doing my own nails and nail art. I thought a small started kit would be good to learn the basics. This french manicure kit was just Horrible! Its something I would buy for a five year old girl playing dress-up. The white is too thick and streaks as other reviewers have said. The top coat is thick, plastic-like and very cheap. The base coats are also thick and have way too much color for a shear base coat. Take my advice, so not worth it!</li>
    <li> Very nice kit.  It came with everything you need for a great french manicure and without all the hard work of trying to do it yourself.  Loved it!!!  [[ASIN:B008X2133K SHANY Cosmetics French Nail Set, 7 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> The polish stays on for a good 10days for me! I love the set because you have everything you need!</li>
    <li> With this kit, it take no time to do perfect french nails! I really loved it! The polishes were really easy to use and drys very quickly! This kit is a good investment! :)</li>
    <li> This makes doing a french manicure so easy to use! It lays out everything for you and gives you all the tools you will need to achieve a perfect french manicure.</li>
    <li> I love bright funky nails but every now and then you can&#x27;t beat a professional looking french.  This kit has all you need for that classic look!</li>
    <li> For A Great French Style! I love this! I have always loved getting the french manicure but now I can do this at home and save more money! And some kits don&#x27;t even have a top coat! Great for the budget savvy Diva!</li>
    <li> I got this to save some money by doing it myself.  It is an excellent starter set.  I got it in 2 days and was everything I was expecting.</li>
    <li> I am sure I will get better at doing French manicures after a little more practice.  My effort was pretty, but not as perfect as I wanted it to be.  The Shany products are very nice and include all the tools and polishes you will need.  All in all, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The nail polishes in this product are of very poor quality. Only the top coat serves its purpose. The other colors are too liquid and do not cover as supposed to.</li>
    <li> this is a horrible set.the pink and beige base coats are not what are supposed to be used. i thought they would go on clear with a tint but the colors were totally opaque and took hours to &amp;#34;fully dry&amp;#34; even then they get getting scrunched up. do not buy!</li>
    <li> All you need for a good french tip, is all in this set. You got everything from basecoat to topcoat for your own french manicure. It comes with instruction on how to do a french manicure, so no worries for people who do not know how to do a french manicure. It really is super easy with this set.</li>
    <li> So awful...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!  The polish is so thick it just clumps and streaks.  The white color is yellowish.  The strips don&#x27;t stick well so it&#x27;s impossible to get a straight line.  Amazon will not refund this product even though it&#x27;s Prime eligible, so don&#x27;t take a chance.  I feel like this set has been sitting on a shelf for ten years.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as satisfied with the product as I thought I would be. Nail Polish is very streaky, difficult instructions to follow and not very user friendly. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have never done a french manicure and i am so suprised at how much work it appears to be to do them. Base Coat,Top Coat and clear top coat. I  like the nail file and the device to keep your toes apart that is neat. The price is just right as well.</li>
    <li> This is sooo cute! I think it&#x27;s perfect for creating the ultimate cute, yet classic french nail. Has to be one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I had originally looked into buying french nail nail polishes separately and came across this product. I read the reviews and didn&#x27;t quite mind the whole fact that it was mini bottles verse larger ones or the fact it was mainly for beginners –– I&#x27;m a beginner if that even really matters. For that price, it seemed like a lot. Thus I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the product in the mail, I was thrilled. The packaging was interesting especially since it gave you directions on how to apply the nail polish and the required ingredients were on it too (They are not on the actual bottle, probably since it&#x27;s a set and it&#x27;s kind of assumed it&#x27;s together). However, that didn&#x27;t really bug me. I finally got time to paint my nails with this set trying out the french nails. I went step by step waiting for the layers to dry on the base coat that I picked. Then I applied the stickers. I&#x27;ve never dealt with actually made nail stickers, I&#x27;ve usually just used painter&#x27;s taped and cut into the shape... so I had know clue how much pressure I should have applied on them. Either way, it tore the paint that was dry off my nail after I had painted the white layer. Of course, I tried to retouch it up and let that dry for another 20 minutes. After it appeared to have looked dry I placed on the clear coat. However, the nails didn&#x27;t dry on me –– I still have no clue why or even how. I instantly messed them up. The total of time spent was three hours just to try to do french nails with this product. I ended up cleaning everything off. The nail polish was the hardest thing to actually get off. One of my nails ended up stained from the removal of the polish, but I could at least be happy it&#x27;s gotten color from it instead of the dull peach color nail that it resided before the three hours. The nail polishes included in this set definitely did not act like any of the other nail polishes I&#x27;ve experienced; I couldn&#x27;t just leave paint on my skin to clean up later too since I can&#x27;t do thetwo stroke nail trick. I don&#x27;t know if I should have used a nail dryer or the nail polish just doesn&#x27;t dry at a reasonable pace.  I&#x27;ll never know until I try a second time... Or if I will try a second time. I&#x27;ll probably try to use the clear coat on my other nail polish since I&#x27;ve gotten into nail art lately.</li>
    <li> The base coat was very thin and I needed three coats to cover . the pink is very pretty . the white French tip polish is thick and stayed nicely. I waited ten minutes between coats of polish but it all smeared anyway ! I am very disappointed with this product !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the polish is very high quality.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> Shany French Nail Set</li>
    <li> I purchased this product mainly due to positive reviews and also the price. I would have to say I&#x27;m not very impressed, the polishes are EXTREMELY thick in consistency (and that&#x27;s per botltle). It was impossible to get even consistent strokes when using this polish (even after shaking it up a few times), not worth me adding polish thinner to it, and why should I or anyone else have to do that? I&#x27;m thinking that this product is old and expired perhaps? Also I didn&#x27;t care for the base colors.</li>
    <li> The nail polishes themselves are great and I like that this kit comes with everything you need but I do not like how the stickers fit on the nail that help determine where to paint the white tip. I decided to just paint the tip myself and use the brush and some acetone to shape it.</li>
    <li> These little nail polishes are pretty good for the price. They are a little tacky and take a bit of extra drying time but overall they do the job and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the set.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this kit but the amount of time that goes into it just isn&#x27;t for me. I want to have the look of my nails professionally done but dont have the time to pamper my self. I am sure this kit is very good for others but just not for me.</li>
    <li> This set is ok. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the quality of the polishes or the size of the bottles. If I had it to do over I would pass on this product. When working with French Manicures, it&#x27;s definitely worth it to spend more and get high quality polish.</li>
    <li> The polishes are too thick.</li>
    <li> I think that french manicures look great on a woman, especially on the toe nails.  I will buy this set if I ever want to do a french manicure, or a pedicure, because this would be good value for the money, and because this set can be used over and over again to get the desired results.  However, it does look like the purchaser can experiment with this set to get different looks each time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay...the clear coat polish was really thick and made it frustrating since I do my own nails. I ended up taking it all off and only using the white polish from the kit and my own top coat. The brush and stickers were nice though.</li>
