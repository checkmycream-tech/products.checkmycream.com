      <li>Finally found the perfect massage product!</li>
      <li>I am a massage therapy student and I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>your clients also feel better.</li>
      <li>I love the built in lock on the pump</li>
      <li>I also like that the name doesn&#x27;t have a sexual connotation.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this massage oil.</li>
      <li>Most of my fellow students didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
      <li>I love using this Gel during my therapy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Gel is Light, great mild scent and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Cleans off easily and does not stain like so many do.</li>
      <li>It is not oily and absorbs fairly quickly - also the scent is nice and not too strong.  </li>
      <li>Both easily wash off without leaving a residue.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
      <li>I use this Biotone Advanced Therapy Gel to do hot stone massage and it is just amazing</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth.  </li>
      <li>My husband and I have been trying to find the perfect massage oil, cream or gel that isn&#x27;t too greasy or heavy.  </li>
      <li>It is MUCH easier to massage with than the cream, which you have to warm up in your hands to use.  </li>
      <li>So excited I found such a good product for a cheap price!</li>
      <li>This is a great product and a nice option instead of lotion, especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products, including Biotone&#x27;s Dual Purpose, and this is the best by far.  </li>
      <li>This type of gel is great because don&#x27;t get dry</li>
      <li>not what I ordered (wanted gel because lotion tends to cool the skin after application).  </li>
      <li>The seller was quick to send the product and it came in packaging that protected it well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got just the right amount of slickness.</li>
      <li>Even better when used to massage the most important stress relieving areas for either of us if you you know what I mean.  </li>
      <li>Not gonna give that low a rating because smell is subjective, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice as a classic lavender.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately most of the ingredients in the gel are oils and therefore have the same feeling.</li>
      <li>but I hope it gets packaged  better in the future.</li>
      <li>Biotone works very well!</li>
      <li>I just wanted something more like body lotion which I found in a different product.</li>
      <li>Stays smooth enough on the skin to have an easy glide feel, while giving enough resistance that you can go in deeply as desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards it feels more like a lotion being absorbed than coated in an oil, and is virtually unscented [unlike Dual Purpose, which has a rather distinct odor].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>in the past, most are pretty oily and strongly scented.</li>
      <li>I use many many products, and this one is just a complete waste.</li>
      <li>If this is the kind of product that you like, you could simply buy canola oil at the supermarket and save a bundle of money... and get pretty much the same performance.</li>
      <li>Gives my skin a really dewy look.  </li>
      <li>Much nicer than creams in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I have search high and low for such an amazing gel.</li>
      <li>Works great a little goes a long way!</li>
      <li>It only requires a little amount to be applied and it has a nice slide and glide while still being able to maintain friction needed for deep work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
      <li>I was using lotions and cheap store bought massage oils before and those either just made things more sticky, a mess or dried out too quickly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>Have to use a good amount, very chalky and oily, weird blend.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and react to a lot of lotions.</li>
      <li>We like to give each other massages for fun without getting our bed linens permanently oil stained too!  </li>
      <li>The last time I went for a massage the masseuse asked if I prefer oil or gel, that was the first time I&#x27;d heard of massage gel.</li>
      <li>it leaves me soft and silky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought various massage oils from Whole Foods etc.</li>
      <li>I was misled by the good reviews, but this is honestly one of the worst products I have used on clients.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more of a thicker gel to apply to a small area like you can do with the cremes and work deep tissue and have it change consistency as you work</li>
      <li>but it does have a nice long lasting quality for massage,  and probably will need to use less than regular oil.</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it, it&#x27;s light feeling, has to me a very slight pleasing scent.</li>
      <li>I got a quick response from the seller responding to a small problem with the contain.  </li>

    <li> I use this Biotone Advanced Therapy Gel to do hot stone massage and it is just amazing my clients just love it.&lt;br /&gt;Most of them don&#x27;t even want to shower after. I have gotten calls after a day or so and clients want it for there own homes.&lt;br /&gt;Its wonderful after I shave my legs it leaves me soft and silky. I have search high and low for such an amazing gel.</li>
    <li> I love using this Gel during my therapy&#x27;s. It only requires a little amount to be applied and it has a nice slide and glide while still being able to maintain friction needed for deep work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>

I contacted the company, and they said they&#x27;d look into it if I could find my receipt - which I couldn&#x27;t, so I let it go.  I ordered another gallon, and we&#x27;ll see if the same thing happens this time.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and applies very easily.  Gives my skin a really dewy look.  It&#x27;s especially great after a shower.  It makes my skin feel really smooth.  One of the best all around moisturizers i&#x27;e ever used...a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been trying to find the perfect massage oil, cream or gel that isn&#x27;t too greasy or heavy.  We got the recommendation from the Ritz Carlton Hotel after having several massages there. This is what they used!  Both of us tend to \\&quot;break out in a rash\\&quot;, if oils are left on our skin too long.  We like to give each other massages for fun without getting our bed linens permanently oil stained too!  This is perfect!  It has NO odor which we like, it doesn&#x27;t drip all over the bed, and a \\&quot;little goes a long way\\&quot;.  For traveling it is nice too since it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;leak\\&quot; in my toiletry bag!  We have tried the Biotone Cream too and also love it.  Both easily wash off without leaving a residue.  Highly recommend it for sensitive skin! Finally found the perfect massage product!</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m totally an amateur. I took a chance on this gel and am totally lovin&#x27; it. I&#x27;ve bought various massage oils from Whole Foods etc. in the past, most are pretty oily and strongly scented. The last time I went for a massage the masseuse asked if I prefer oil or gel, that was the first time I&#x27;d heard of massage gel. So I searched online and came across Biotone.  I totally recommend it, it&#x27;s light feeling, has to me a very slight pleasing scent. As you work it in it&#x27;s slippery, once you&#x27;re done, I&#x27;ve left it on the skin and it just feels like a nice moisturizer. You&#x27;re not all oily or smelling like a bunch of flowers.</li>
    <li> this is a drippy, runny, oily product.  the consistency is not gel-like at all.  It&#x27;s OILY, OILY, OILY-probably because it&#x27;s OILY!  I&#x27;m pissed about this purchase because I was looking for the consistency of lotion, with the longer glide-ability of oil, which is what this gel product is supposed to be.  NOT!</li>
    <li> This is great for massages!!</li>
    <li> Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Gel is Light, great mild scent and not greasy.  The perfect massage product. We use it at home after a recommendation by a massage therapist.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of all the reviews claiming that it was not oily or greasy and didn&#x27;t leave any kind of oily residue. Perhaps those other reviewers were comparing this product to petroleum jelly because I can&#x27;t imagine any other reason that someone would consider this product NOT oily. It&#x27;s just oil... period. Grape seed oil, sesame oil, and canola oil are all in this product and that&#x27;s how it feels during application and afterward. If this is the kind of product that you like, you could simply buy canola oil at the supermarket and save a bundle of money... and get pretty much the same performance.</li>
    <li> Works great a little goes a long way! Much nicer than creams in my opinion. I love the built in lock on the pump</li>
    <li> Very smooth and slick.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts well, does not need re-application.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this massage oil. I have very sensitive skin and react to a lot of lotions. I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to the oil. It also lasts for a long time when giving a massage. A little certainly goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I ordered this massage gel because I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of walking around with oil all over my body after I got a massage. Unfortunately most of the ingredients in the gel are oils and therefore have the same feeling. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this gel if you don&#x27;t mind the oily feeling. I just wanted something more like body lotion which I found in a different product.</li>
    <li> I use many many products, and this one is just a complete waste. Have to use a good amount, very chalky and oily, weird blend. I would definitely not order this product again. I was misled by the good reviews, but this is honestly one of the worst products I have used on clients. They don&#x27;t like it, and neither do I. .</li>
    <li> This is the best massage oil I&#x27;ve found. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It&#x27;s not too oily and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I like the gel for giving massages but the grade seed smell bothers me a little.</li>
    <li> It soaks into your skin faster then baby oil, so you not sitting there all oily waiting and waiting for the baby oil to soak in. And it works.</li>
    <li> This massage gel is great!   It just takes a little bit, lasts a long time and isn&#x27;t greasy .  I wish they offfered it in a larger (16oz. or 32oz.) size.  I also like that the name doesn&#x27;t have a sexual connotation.</li>
    <li> I plan on buying the various versions of the brand, however I am completely satisfied with this one.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this on each other and ourselves.  It has a great texture and glide and is perfect for a relaxing massage.  Even better when used to massage the most important stress relieving areas for either of us if you you know what I mean.  I&#x27;m now ordering my third bottle in six months.</li>
    <li> Very nice massage gel. Cleans off easily and does not stain like so many do. No odor</li>
    <li> Not gonna give that low a rating because smell is subjective, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice as a classic lavender.</li>
    <li> Biotone works very well! With this gel, a little goes a long way and it works well for home massages! The great thing about this product is that I don&#x27;t feel like I have to take a shower after using it. The seller was quick to send the product and it came in packaging that protected it well.</li>
    <li> Very nice oil. Is not really a gel but it does have a nice long lasting quality for massage,  and probably will need to use less than regular oil. The package arrived with the pump broken.  Rather than send it back I glued it together. Just a minor annoyance but I hope it gets packaged  better in the future.</li>
    <li> So excited I found such a good product for a cheap price! I will most defiantly be a repeat customer! Cant beat the price for product quality!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s got just the right amount of slickness. I was using lotions and cheap store bought massage oils before and those either just made things more sticky, a mess or dried out too quickly. With this gel I can give an hour massage and my hands do not hurt or tire out. I could not believe the difference it has made. It does not stain either.</li>
    <li> I liked this product and the pump applicator.  I like this product for smaller areas or for doing myo on really dry skin</li>
    <li> This type of gel is great because don&#x27;t get dry and you don&#x27;t have to waste time applying and applying again your clients also feel better.</li>
    <li> Great gel for aching muscles</li>
    <li> Works well, but I had another massage gel I liked better but is no longer available. yada yada yada yada</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing massage for 15 years and finally decided to try the gel.  I found it oily and would rather just use oil.  I prefer the dual purpose massage cream.  This stuff also stained my sheets like oil.  It does have nice glide though.</li>
    <li> This is a nice collection of oils but it is not a gel.  I was hoping for more of a thicker gel to apply to a small area like you can do with the cremes and work deep tissue and have it change consistency as you work it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a nice collection of oils and is more suited to the relaxation massage.  It is nice for working chapped feet because it will soak into the skin a lot better and also is nice for working the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Herbal Select lotion for the deep tissue work and then finish it off with something like this to help relax the muscles.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapy student and I love this stuff.  So do my clients.  Awesome glide and doesn&#x27;t leave client greasy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the gel, but received lotion.  The lotion is good quality but not what I ordered (wanted gel because lotion tends to cool the skin after application).  Rather than go through the fiasco of trying to return it, I kept it, but it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Does not leave a greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
    <li> I came across this great product at my physiotherapists and ordered some for myself to use on the wound site and help break up scarring by massage and manipulation. A little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be put off by the price. I expect this to last me three months!</li>
    <li> and a good price too. I think its the best massage gel out there, and it lasts much longer than lotion and don&#x27;t have to apply it as often.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from one of my teachers. This is my personal opinion, but I do not like this gel. It feels slimy. I would rather use oil or lotion. I was bringing this to massage therapy class for others to use, so I could get rid of it. Most of my fellow students didn&#x27;t like it either. Their lotion is great, this is not.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and a nice option instead of lotion, especially if you have sensitive skin.  It is not oily and absorbs fairly quickly - also the scent is nice and not too strong.  I got a quick response from the seller responding to a small problem with the contain.  I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> My husband is studying to be a massage therapist.  This brand was recommended to him.  He likes that it is not filled with &#x27;questionable&#x27; ingredients.</li>
