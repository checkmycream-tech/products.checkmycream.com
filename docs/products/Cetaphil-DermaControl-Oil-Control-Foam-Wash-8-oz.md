      <li>although it helped was not cost effective.</li>

      <li>The pump lasted about 100 days and no longer returns to the upright position on it&#x27;s own, but the acne prevention works.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have a bit of color.</li>
      <li>Not as great as the original.</li>
      <li>that said, it is a nice light cleanser, a pleasant fragrance, and not drying.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this product, I ordered it for my girlfriend; she was very happy about and she love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this! After getting a free sample from my dermatologist (which has lasted 3 months!) I was sold. I have a very oily T-zone and dry cheeks and this is delicate enough for the dry areas while really tackling the oil in a longer-lasting way than I&#x27;ve experienced with any other drugstore face wash. Combined with the matching moisturizer and a little loose powder my face stays nice and matte all day.</li>
    <li> I have been having the hardest time with acne since I was 35. After never having acne even as a teenager I got hit with it as an adult. I was using some stuff from the dermatologist that was $80 per bottle and although it helped was not cost effective. My teenage son&#x27;s doctor recommended this for him so I gave it a try too. Less than one week alter, clear skin! I use this in conjunction with an Olay electric brush and I am 99% break out free. Would definitely recommend, its worth a shot!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s DERm recommended and works perfectly. I really enjoy the foam feel because it&#x27;s hard to get deep into pores without it. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Geez, I don&#x27;t know whats happening, but I&#x27;ve really started breaking out a ton since I started using this.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam does a solid job of washing away oil, but it does leave my face feeling a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only mildly sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m still prone to the occasional acne break-out on my face.  My face does get oily several hours after washing, though, and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for a new cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil facial cleansers before, but this is the first time I tried their foam product.  Others have noted a floral scent, but I can&#x27;t detect it.  If there is a fragrance, it has to be incredibly weak so that only a few users will notice it.  The Dermacontrol Foam is supposedly formulated for acne-prone skin, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be the usual (harsh) chemicals associated with that moniker (2% salicylic acid, for example).  I&#x27;ll quickly note that I like the bottle itself; the pump mechanism is solid and the bottle doesn&#x27;t get moldy in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 2 weeks now, before bed and when I wake up.  2-3 pumps of foam work well for a single washing, but since it&#x27;s a foam, facial application is a gentle, light sensation.  It&#x27;s almost hard to know if you&#x27;ve spread it completely over you face without the typical lather of other cleansers.  As I only have mildly sensitive skin, I did not have any problems with chemical-induce blemishes or redness. The Dermacontrol Foam does blast away the oil off my face better than a lot of other products I&#x27;ve tried.  My skin looks and feels completely oil free after each washing.  The slight downside is that my face, devoid of any oil whatsoever, feels noticeably dry.  For better or worse, other facial cleansers, like some of the new Simple products, tend to leave a moisturizing-residue feeling after I wash with them.  The Dermacontrol Foam is quite the opposite.  There is absolutely no residue finish and I might even recommend a light moisturizer be applied after washing with this Cetaphil product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like the way this product washes away ALL oil.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to deter oil build-up on my face over the course of a day, but I haven&#x27;t found a product that does that yet.  Still, the somewhat dry feeling that I experience after washing is preventing me from giving this product a full 5 stars.  But, to be fair, I&#x27;ve yet to find the perfect facial cleanser for me.  I&#x27;ll have to wait until I get to the bottom of this bottle before I decide whether to buy more Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam, but if you like a zero-residue, completely oil-free finish to your facial cleansers, I think you&#x27;ll like this product.hes away ALL oil.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the liquid version of Cetaphil for years, normal to oily for myself and my husband, and gentle for my 8yr old daughter. I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and suffer from hormonal acne which seems to have been getting worse in the past few months. I had tried several other brands of cleansers formulated for acne control and they just dried out my skin and made my breakouts worse. I decided to try the Cetaphil foam wash even though I never liked foam products in the past. I&#x27;m thrilled to report that this one rocks! My skin is cleared up and has remained clear all month. My husband even commented on it and then started stealing the cleanser from under my side of the sink. My skin didn&#x27;t dry out and the foam actually removes my makeup really well leaving my face feeling fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months, around the same time I also switched my moisturizing to Avon Anew so while I can&#x27;t be certain which made the biggest difference in my skin I can say that this has really changed things for me. I used to get monthly breakouts around my cycle... in the past 2 months I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout!!! My makeup goes on smoothly and looks great. I&#x27;m still using my original bottle of this wash, it&#x27;s not even empty yet and I use it 2x per day! Great product and I&#x27;m back to buy more before I do run out.</li>
    <li> This is a nice foaming wash. It rinses off cleanly and I really like how it makes my face feel. The smell is a good one to wake up to; not too much scent, but just enough. I&#x27;ve used other Cetaphil products and it seems like all of them follow in the same format - quality and well thought-out products.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin and wanted to try this product. The container is nice, easy to hold and the pump works well. I have used some foam pumps that clog but this one did not.&lt;br /&gt;I used it to was my face twice a day and it did dry my skin out all over. My suggestion is that if you have oily skin it will work well for you.  But if, like me, you have combination skin it may be to drying for the parts that are not oily.</li>
    <li> favorite and wish they actually sold it in stores</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST foam wash for oily skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry either!</li>
    <li> This works really for my teenagers.  They use it in the shower.  Helps control oily skin and breakouts.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Walmart in hopes this would clear my acne. It seems to help my acne a little but it dries my face out so bad! After I am done washing my face I am left with dry flaky red skin that is very itchy. I have gone down to only washing my face once a day and it is still very irritating to my skin.  If you do not have sensitive skin it will probably work better.</li>
    <li> I have read other reviews that did not have good luck with this product. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I always had combination skin, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older it has gotten oily all over. This wash and the moisturizer keep it manageable. I still look a bit shiny by the end of the day, nothing a little blotting won&#x27;t solve. Much better than needing to blot every few hours.</li>
    <li> My two teenage daughters struggle with acne and will not use anything else.  I think the foamer makes the difference.  Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> This face wash works fine, but I personally prefer something with a little more grit. The dispenser makes it easy to use, as the wash is dispensed as foam directly into your hands. I found, however, that the soap washes off too easily as I washed my face. As other reviewers mentioned, the smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant and it leaves my face a little more dry than I would like. Overall, it&#x27;s an okay face wash, but I will probably go with other products in the future.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this for me when I had pretty severe acne and it was just one product helped to clear up my face. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and I still love it.</li>
    <li> This is really gentle on my acne prone skin. It really keeps the acne in check and doesn&#x27;t tend to dry my face.out.</li>
    <li> Have really sensitive skin, cystic acne prone- skin just a mess. I bought this after my sister claimed to have good results.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first cleanser that left my face clean yet not dried out. I&#x27;m a product junkie who has been in search of the acne cure, this isn&#x27;t a cure but in conjunction with a few other products my face looks better than it has in years. I&#x27;m 40, fair-medium complexion and some scarring oily during summer.&lt;br /&gt;While using this along with cetaphil eczema calming moisturizer at night and cetaphil oil control SPF 30 during the day I can smile and not hide behind my hair. My box came with a mfg coupon for $3.00 off next cetaphil purchase so that was a plus!!</li>
    <li> Most products I have used that are supposed to clear up your skin tend to smell medicinal and usually leave my skin feeling dry.  This product smells lovely and the gentle foam leaves my face feeling silky and smooth.  Lately I have been having some random breakouts, especially on my cheeks and jawline.  The eruptions were red and angry looking, so much so that I worried I was going to need a trip to the dermatologist to get a prescription to take care of them.  I decided to give this product a go instead and it has saved me a trip and a co-pay.  All I do is run a makeup remover pad over my face to get off the tougher to remove bits (mascara, lip color), then I follow that up with by gently rubbing this product over my entire face and the upper portion of my neck.  Rinse thoroughly with warm water and pat dry.  Afterwards, I apply a small amount of moisturizer.  This is the same routine I was following before, all I did was change the wash from my normal facial cleanser to the Cetaphil.  In just a few days I saw improvement and after a couple of weeks my skin was clearer than it has been for months.</li>
    <li> I think some people are getting too fussy about the fragrance. I have very sensitive skin on my face and the fragrance hasn&#x27;t bothered it at all. The smells disappears quickly too! (at least for me, but it could be because of my morning routine with toner and then moisturizer). For me, that hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all. With that said, I really love this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil for years and it&#x27;s always been the only wash that I can use without over drying my face. When I found out that they were coming out with a new foam wash, I got excited because I&#x27;ve always wished that the liquid soap would foam up a bit more.  I&#x27;ve been using the product now for about four weeks and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all. It works well with my Clarisonic and in my opinion, it&#x27;s actually been a little bit more gentle on my face that the other liquid soap face wash they have. As far as oil control, I&#x27;ve found that it really doesn&#x27;t help that much in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I&#x27;m a satisfied customer and will continue to use this face wash!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Great for oily skin, but not overdrawing (I have some dry areas and also have rosacea).  Very happy with this product, even though it&#x27;s a little pricey compared to other acne washes/soaps.</li>
    <li> Still on the fence.  Been using it for about 1.5 months, and my skin broke out for the first week, seemed to improve for a while (had hopes it was working), but then broke out again.  Not sure if I need to give it more time or give up.</li>
    <li> Originally i received the sample.Had to order full size cos is very good for my sensitive skin and washes well. No irritation or dryness.. delicate smell. Love the foam dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATES&lt;br /&gt;AFter using for couple days in row... 14-17 .. my skin get irritated and very dry.. heard the same from another friend..  not using any more</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was recommended to me by my doctor. I had previously used products that contained  sodium sulfacetamide  and sulfur which burned my eyes. This product is gentle on my skin and I use it twice a day and works well for me. I do not know how well it works on moderate or severe acne. Check with your own health care professional  prior to use. Also it is much less expensive on Amazon as compared to my local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I got turned on to it by my Dermatologist and I have used any other skin wash since.</li>
    <li> after years of spending (wasting) money on expensive products, i found out about this wash and it&#x27;s amazing!! my face feels clean/clear, no more breakouts, and it lasts forever (no joke, months).</li>
    <li> This is a nice facewash.  to clear a few things up, this cleanser has no medication in it.  the purpose of this cleanser is to cleanse your skin and prepare the skin to use prescription topical medication. Overall this cleanser works very well.  I have been using it for about 5 days and it is very gentle and leaves my skin soft and supple.  It does not cause dryness.  It is scented, but not to the point that it is overpowering.  for people who are allergic to scents, this may not be for you.  but it has a very soft powder fresh scent.  I usually hate powder scents because they usually give me nausea, but this one actually smells nice and is infused with a clean scent.  overall it is a nice cleanser and it gets every bit of my Bare Escentuals makeup off of my face (with the help of my Clarisonic Mia).  I will purchase this again.  I actually like this more than the Bare Escentuals Purifying facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> This foam wash isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s light and it makes your skin feel fresh. The only negative flaw is that my face feels a bit dry after I use it so I end up putting some lotion on. Besides that, I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> The face wash is a foam and it takes 3 pumps to cover my entire face.  Unlike with the Cetaphil liquid, the foam feels like it is actually cleaning my skin and I get the satisfaction of having the suds wash away the grime.  I wash with this every morning and then follow up with the Oil Control moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read complaints about the smell being medicinal or overwhelming for both products, so I was unsure about trying it since I am sensitive to smells.  Fortunately I had no issue with the smell at all and find it rather nice.  It smells subtly clean.  It does linger and probably more so in my case since I follow up with the moisturizer.  I like that the foam does not leave my skin feeling tight yet it feels completely clean at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my face I put on the moisturizer.  The moisturizer smells a little like sunscreen, but I find it nice since it reminds me of the beach.  It absorbs quickly and is light and non-greasy.  If I wear any makeup that day, I put the moisturizer on first then my primer.  I have had no issues wearing it under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it contains an SPF so I don&#x27;t have to worry about adding an additional step to my routine. I have fair skin and burn easily, yet when I have been outside in the sun for several hours my face did not even get pink even though my arms did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these products for several weeks now and there is a subtle change in the oiliness and shininess of my skin.  I have extremely oily skin so the true test will be when it is the middle of summer and it is 90+ degrees outside.  But after living with seriously oily and acne prone skin my entire life any improvement is awesome, especially at what I consider a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the two products do seem to control oil.  Keep in mind that control does not mean eliminate, which the product does not claim to do.  Actually I don&#x27;t want to completely eliminate the oil since that will help keep wrinkles at bay just a little longer than it would with someone that has dry skin.  I also like how simple they are to use and they are what I consider products with no-frills.  As a mother of four I do not like a high-maintenance routine since I do not have the time or desire to keep it up.  So this fits rather nicely into my morning schedule and still manages to work pretty well.es at bay just a little longer than it would with someone that has dry skin.

    <li> It does control oil, but it does leave your skin feeling a little dry. I would recommend using a moisturizer along with this product. The restoraderm body wash is a better alternative</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash. It&#x27;s got an old school scent that reminds me a lot of the creams and such my grandmother used to use. It&#x27;s not exactly medicinal, but it&#x27;s also not overpoweringly feminine. This is definitely a product both men and women alike could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found its claim to be oil controlling true. My skin is less oily and therefore I have less breakouts. It didn&#x27;t do much to speed up the healing of current blemishes, but is obviously preventing new ones. I especially like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. For some reason, most facial cleansers make my forehead extremely dry to the point of peeling and moisturizer can only do so much. I haven&#x27;t had that problem while using this foam wash.</li>
    <li> Pretty good at clearing up acne on dry skin without over drying</li>
    <li> I received this cleanser today so it might be a bit early to write a review, but I&#x27;m going to anyways. To show kind of what to expect when your first use of this product. So I used this product this night about an hour ago and so far my skin is smooth, not dried out, and shine free. These are great results for the first use if you ask me. This cetaphil cleanser isn&#x27;t fragrance free though, which is what cetaphil products usually are. It smells like: closest comparison would be baby powder. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me and the smell kind of sets away over time. I would recommend this product for people with oily skin and acne.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I have very oily skin and this helps my face feel so clean and controls my oil all day long. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> Great product and has been for decades. It really controls skin oils without harshness. I buy it for my teenagers. This is what I consider Garlderma&#x27;s replacement for their prior product  Ionax Foam.</li>
    <li> great seller, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I feel like this wash gets me really squeaky clean, without irritating my skin! The foam is really great in that you don&#x27;t need to use very much of it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in a smaller travel size though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for three years now I love it. However, it&#x27;s pretty expensive buying it at Walgreens since i buy on average three bottles/month. When I found out about the subscribe option, I was so psyched!! The price cut is awesome!! I already know how many bottles of this I go through anyway. With the subscribe option I can set the date I want them to ship it to me so I know the exact date I will be charged and plan for that in my budget!! I am never going back to buying these at Walgreens Im sticking with the subscribe option!! BTW, in case you don&#x27;t know you can also do the subscribe option for the big tub of Cetaphil Moisturizing cream. I know how much of the tub I use per month so I buy both this face wash and the moisturizing cream via the subscription option!! It saves at least $20/month. DEFINITLEY recommend it!</li>
    <li> It helped me get ready of my oily skin and deep cleanse my pores used as use everyday if u have oily skin this will work for u</li>
    <li> The front of the bottle states Oil Control Foam Wash. So the first real question I had was if it would deliver on the Oil Control. I&#x27;m sure it differs from face to face, but for me it works great. I use it several times a week, just once a day at night. I don&#x27;t recommend using it more than one time a day, as it does dry out the skin. At first I thought the dryness it made would be a problem, but I just put some lotion on afterward and it was perfect. I&#x27;m really liking the oil-free skin it leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is pretty good. My only complaint is that the lid is super smooth, making it hard to get off when my hands are wet. So I leave it unsealed. The pump is curved up, making it easy to push. The pump(top) screws off, so I&#x27;ll be able to reuse the bottle, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions state only this: Massage foam onto damp skin. Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;Like most face-care products, it&#x27;s lacking in details. How much do they expect me to use? Just a little? Do I need more? How many times a day do they recommend? They&#x27;re the ones who ran the tests, I wish they&#x27;d at least give some general use advice.&lt;br /&gt;I use a single pump or half a pump over a lightly rinsed face, rub it in, then rinse again with warm water (no more than once a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being foam wash, it&#x27;s easy to use, really nice to wash with. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple weeks and the liquid level in the bottle isn&#x27;t much reduced. Foam wash tends to be a bit more expensive, as compared to, say, [[ASIN:B001ET79H8 Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser 16oz (Pack of 2)]], which I&#x27;ve been using for years. Frankly, I like the Cetaphil Facial Cleanser just as well as the Foam Wash. This Foam Wash, however, realllllly helps with my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell, I didn&#x27;t find the fragrance a problem, it didn&#x27;t seem too strong for me. I use a fairly scentless face lotion so it&#x27;s nice to have a bit of color. Er. Scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash fulfilled my expectations, and I enjoy using it. Whether or not I continue to use it once this bottle is gone will depend on the observed benefits over time.I enjoy using it. Whether or not I continue to use it once this bottle is gone will depend on the observed benefits over time.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my teenager&#x27;s dermatologist.  Works well.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I switch to Cetaphil and this line works great on my oily skin!  I really like it!</li>
    <li> My son has acne on his face, so I got this product for him to use.  His skin looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to help keep the oils in his skin from building up.  He likes the scent in the soap but it has not caused any problems with his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, just use the dispenser to create a foam, and then wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses it a couple times per day and really likes it.  He puts his acne medicine on after using the soap.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those lucky people who have acne issues even though I&#x27;m in my 30s (I always joke about having a jar of \\&quot;anti-wrinkle acne cream\\&quot;, oh the joy).  I also have sensitive skin, and for that I wish this facial wash didn&#x27;t have any fragrance.  It&#x27;s light, not a heavy perfume, but as I remove makeup it has enough time in contact with my skin to irritate and leaves my skin a bit red and tight.  The bottle says it&#x27;s a calming formula, but no fragrance at all would be calming.  Because I always apply a 2% salicylic acid or 8% glycolic acid after washing my face, and following that with 5% benzoyl peroxide, I can use all the calming I can get so I avoid fragrance in my facial products.  If you have sturdier skin than I do or no family history of eczema or rosacea, perhaps you won&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its cleansing ability, the first time I used it I used 6 pumps of this foam wash and it quickly dissolved into nothing as I washed my face.  It didn&#x27;t feel like it was removing my makeup so I rinsed then looked in the mirror.  Sure enough, my (regular, non-waterproof) mascara and eyeliner had simply been smeared around my eyes.  I used a makeup remover wipe to see if my foundation had been removed, and it had.  But the eye makeup?  Nope.  I wet my face again and got 6 more pumps of the face wash and concentrated on removing my eye makeup only.  After a minute, I rinsed, and the black smeared makeup was still there.  Disappointing.  I tried again for a week to see if it was a fluke, but it couldn&#x27;t make my eye makeup budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t wear eye makeup at all and don&#x27;t have skin that is sensitive to fragrance, this foam wash might be a good option for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m older, but still suffer breakouts now and then, especially during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;The wash does have fragrance, but I like it.  It smells clean and fresh and that is how my face feels after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always apply a moisturizer after cleansing my face, but didn&#x27;t think the wash left my skin feeling excessively dry or tight.  The foam is very light and sort of melts as you massage it onto your skin.  It&#x27;s easy to rinse, which is a plus and the pump bottle makes it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I may use a different wash for winter months, this one fits my needs for summer months.</li>
    <li> Smells really good, leaves skin feeling really clean. It&#x27;s not quite as gentle as regular Cetaphil, but pretty gentle given it&#x27;s a foaming wash. It&#x27;s something I can use more in hot weather, but come winter I&#x27;ll have to stick with regular Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> Been using these for quite sometime and all my pimples are gone and less oily face since our weather here in the philippines is super humid. Expensive though</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have oily skin, and thought it would be perfect for me. I personally don&#x27;t think the foam wash is effective enough for oily skin. It felt like I wasn&#x27;t even washing my skin. The foam seemed to disappear during the process, before it could even be effective. I am a loyal Cetaphil user, and like all their other products, but I don&#x27;t think this one works. well.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is gentle yet effective for sensitive acne and blackhead prone skin. The actual cleanser I would vote as five stars, but one bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long. I used about 5-6 pumps for each facial cleansing (2-3 times per day) and it only lasted a few weeks. That paired with the cost of each bottle makes me reluctant to buy more, although my skin really likes it.</li>
    <li> This foamy face wash was a nice change from my normal St. Ives Apricot Scrub. It was soft and gentle(at first, more on that in a minute). It removed excess oil without leaving me dry after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it contained what smelled like lavender. I am highly allergic, and my eyes started watering and burning as I applied the foam. My nostrils stung. I looked on the label to check for these ingredients, and it only stated \\&quot;masking fragrances\\&quot;. Cetaphil is a company I usually associate with non-comedogenic and sensitive-skin friendly products. Their lotion is very mild, and does not elicit a reaction from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product was not advertised as being scented. Many people have sensitive skin or sensitivities to scents, like me. My skin isn&#x27;t even all that sensitive (just my nose), and this was so uncomfortable I vowed then and there not to use it again.</li>
    <li> Love using Cetaphil, and just reviewed the moisturizer. I got both the foam wash and moisturizer together and started using them together too.... Just love it. I have had no bad reactions even with my sensitive skin and I really like the smell - not too strong at all - and the feeling of the foam on my face. I&#x27;ve had some before that feel so oily and thick. This is perfect, and after a few weeks, I am still enjoying using it. Highly recommend the Cetaphil line.</li>
    <li> I love this foam wash! It takes off make up very well and I have not had any reactions to it and I am a person with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I received this product about a month ago, now, and my teen age daughter has been using it on a daily basis. She seems to think it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot; but nothing special. I was hoping to write a better review of this product, but she hasn&#x27;t been forthcoming with many specifics. She says it smells nice and seems to do a fine job washing her face, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to think it&#x27;s any better or worse than other facial washes that we have purchased for her. If that is the case, I guess we&#x27;re better off using a cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> Most dermatologist&#x27;s favorite wash (Cetaphil of course) introduced a new formula, and I have to say I think I like it better than the original. Cetaphil cleanser now comes in a foam that treats acne prone skin (in my humble opinion I think its great even if you don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin). Its called Cetaphil DermaControl Oil Control Foam Wash. Why I like it better than the original?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I think the foam version is MUCH better at removing makeup. Second, it works great with my clarisonic brush. Third, it&#x27;s foamy. And lastly, while this formula is marketed for oily skin, I don&#x27;t find this formula over drying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original Cetaphil came in three formulations: the original cream cleanser, a gel cleanser for oily skin, and a gentle cleansing bar. The cream cleanser was great but very poor at removing makeup and not good for acne prone skin. The biggest complaints I&#x27;ve heard is that the Cetaphil really didn&#x27;t lather very much. This new foam formulation wash takes a few  squirts and it&#x27;s super-foamy.  The gel version and bar version, while better for oily skin, sometimes were too drying. This new formulation is not too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While marketed for acne prone skin, I think it is a great all around formula. Its extremely gentle (great if you have sensitive skin) but removes makeup.  It is similar to another one of my top rated washes, Aveeno Ultra-Calming foaming wash. Aveeno&#x27;s foaming wash is about $6 for 6oz. Cetaphil&#x27;s is $12 for 8oz. Both formula&#x27;s top ingredients are water and glycerin, however Cetaphil&#x27;s new formula contains zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zinc in the form of zinc gluconate or zinc sulfate is thought to help heal acne blemishes, reduce inflammation caused by acne, and reduce androgenic hormonal effects on skin that contribute to acne breakouts or in other words help regulate the skin&#x27;s oil gland activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great drugstore wash.

    <li> I really love Cetaphil Demacacontrol Foam Wash. I sometimes have oily skin and I find this products works very well in cleaning and removing the excess oil from my face leaving my face soft and smooth. I have used Cetaphil products in the past and I have always found the products to be very exceptional in quality and price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this product, I ordered it for my girlfriend; she was very happy about and she love it.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash is a decent product. It has a pleasant smell, almost like baby powder, and foams up nicely. It seems to rinse off well. But it really doesn&#x27;t seem to pack much of a punch in actually controlling skin issues. At least it did not for myself or my family members. For the price, we&#x27;d expected something a bit more special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to offer oil control and is \\&quot;clinically proven to remove excess oil and control shine.\\&quot; It is also supposed to be a calming without the tendency to over-dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first claim is highly possible. I don&#x27;t have excessively oily skin but foam cleaners typically work best for those who do. My combination skin found this foam to be very over-drying. I had to discontinue using it and return to a milder product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I have no reason not recommend Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash for those who are prone to oily skin. Just be aware that unlike some of the other Cetaphil products this one does have a scent. My husband wasn&#x27;t a fan of smelling like baby powder, but the scent was actually one of my favorite parts of this foam wash. It is one of the reasons why I rated it so highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Zinc Coceth Sulfate, Glycerin, PEG-75, Dipotassium Glcyrrhizate, Zinc Gluconate, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, Sodium Benzoate, Masking Fragrance, Disodium EDTA.</li>
    <li> GOES ON AS FOAM AND HELPS REVIVES ME FOR THE DAY.  MY FACE FEELS CLEAN AND NOT TIGHT.  I STILL USE A MOISTURIZER, as before, yet I&#x27;m not oily at the end of the day. MY MAKEUP STAYS ON LONGER AND I&#x27;M NOT LOOKING SO UNKEPT  AT END OF DAY.</li>
    <li> Love this ! &amp; shipping was super fast</li>
    <li> I got it because the dermatologist recommended  it for adult acne (oily, shiny skin) in older people. My skin is much less oily and it is easy to use. Dims the shine and helps prevent oily looking pillow cases and ring around the collar.</li>
    <li> Its the only soap that works for my teen son&#x27;s acne - thank you for the great value. I signed up for auto delivery.</li>
    <li> The foam wash was suggested by my doctor to help with the discoloration on my face and armsThe foam wash really seem&lt;br /&gt;to help with my complexion.Also use on my arms as they were very dry.</li>
    <li> If money was no object, I&#x27;d stick with Proactiv.  Unfortunately, I do have a budget.  This does a great job in controlling my acne, except at \\&quot;that time of the month.\\&quot; This is a gentle easy to wash off foam.  Your skin does not feel tight or greasy after.  I am sensitive to smell and this scent did NOT bother me.  Once the foam was rinsed off, the smell faded rather quickly.</li>
    <li> This product is my savior!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know where to start.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and although I&#x27;ve never suffered from major acne, it was always a bump or two here or there.&lt;br /&gt;Not only that but my nose is ALWAYS shiny. Nothing would ever take it all away. Blotting papers, cleansers, masks, makeup UGH. After a week using this product the shine has gone! My profile looks great! no ugly shine on my nose and no shine ALL DAY. &lt;3 I use this miracle stuff 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE YOU CETAPHIL</li>
    <li> Cons:  Strong chemical/powder smell, weak foaming, does not seem to fight acne or oil&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Contains no SLS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne prone skin and I use a Clarisonic Mia with a foaming cleanser as part of my skincare regimen.  I purchased the Cetaphil Foaming Oil Control Cleanser as a back-up while I was waiting for my usual staple cleanser: The Body Shop Tea Tree Foaming Cleanser (I have to order it online because I live in a semi-remote area) to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before deciding I looked at several foaming cleansers in our local Walgreens, and I thought that I had read the label pretty thoroughly.  Since it is a Cetaphil product I thought it would be a pretty safe bet for my skin...especially since Cetaphil&#x27;s products are generally non-irritating etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product about 3-4 times before I decided to toss it out.  It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel clean AT ALL even though I&#x27;m using it with my Clarisonic.  The scent is unpleasant and very strong- and not one that I associate as \\&quot;clean\\&quot; or refreshing (the back label lists it as a \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot;)  I didn&#x27;t feel that it did any help for controlling oil (says it contains castor oil), so if that is the primary motive for buying this product I would caution you to not buy it for that.  The foam dissipates very quickly which was really odd...I have never had that issue with a foaming cleanser before.  Essentially, this does not seem to make my skin feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually one to blame a product- especially with skincare products because it has a lot to do with our own personal skin chemistry.  Unfortunately I think Cetaphil has missed the mark this time as this is a very inferior product,  Save yourself the $4-$6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend: [[ASIN:B002K8MJZ4 The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Foaming Cleanser, 5.0-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product reduces oil on my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower with a brush on my back, and my back sure feels cleaner after using it.  I&#x27;ve also been using it intermittently on my face on problem oily areas.  I can really tell the difference between using this and all manner of soaps and body washes.  I&#x27;m not convinced it is reducing acne, I only have a problem with that at certain times, but when this bottle runs out I&#x27;m certainly going to buy another, worth the purchase for the clean oil free feeling alone.</li>
    <li> CERAVE FOAMING WASH FOR NORMAL TO OILY SKIN IS THE KING. NEUTROGENA RAPID CLEAR OIL CONTROL FOAMING CLEANSER IS ALSO UP THERE.</li>
    <li> The top of the pump is at an angle -- it requires almost a whole hand to stabilize to prevent slipping, which is tedious and prone to contamination. The foam has very little cleaning power -- it doesn&#x27;t feel very slippery like soaps, and it barely removes any oil from my face. It takes 4 pumps to barely wash my face, and afterwards my face is still so oily that it makes my hands oily when I touch it. However, since this is developed by dermatologists, it is possible that this level of oil removal is optimal for skin health.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash.  As an adult with acne prone skin I find it difficult to find mild face washes that don&#x27;t cause irritation or severely dry skin.  This foaming face wash works really well and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with hopes it would control my EXCESSIVELY oily skin that stems from my constant struggles with drying acne creams; and, sadly, these \\&quot;creams\\&quot; are the only effective ones I&#x27;ve found both OTC and prescription. In short, this product did clean my skin, but left it dry. Albeit, this drying effect didn&#x27;t help with the oiliness because within an hour I looked like I had clear-coat sprayed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for oily skin. Makes your face feel clean and actually controls oil throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive and acne prone skin.  A dermatologist recommended this product to me and i have been using it every since.</li>
    <li> This is something totally different than the lotions or gels.  This comes out of the bottle in a foam form and I usually pushed it twice every time I wash my face.  So it doesn&#x27;t appear like it is going to last as long as the traditional Cetaphil for your face.  I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a clean feeling after removing but a different feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t appear to be making my face break out any worse than normal but not really seeing a lot of difference either.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product recommended by my dermatologist.  Love to use, only problem is hard to dispense as you use more, dispenser gets harder to use and doesn&#x27;t foam toward the end.</li>
    <li> it sucks it makes my skin dry and brittle and then after i use it i also use a moisturizers and my skin is still dry do not reccomend</li>
    <li> I saw this rated highly in a beauty magazine, and decided to try it.  The ingredients are supposed to be more natural and better for your skin.  I like it very much.  It&#x27;s not too drying, cleans my skin better than many products I&#x27;ve used and it smells nice.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products and used buff puff pads, but none of those products ever got my face as clean as this product and w/none of the scratching or harshness.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well on acne.  Not too harsh, can use it everyday without drying out your skin.  Saw good results very quickly.</li>
    <li> This product woks good on my medium greasy face skin helping to control my rosacea keeping red spots under control</li>
    <li> I order this frequently because its a better price on Amazon than I can get it at the grocery store/drug store or even Target.  Since my daughter uses it daily and consistently for over a year, I usually buy a few bottles at once to get the free shipping because I know she will use it.</li>
    <li> It dried my face up so much it made me switch to Pevonia Rs2 cleanser. I mean if you&#x27;re 14 and you can&#x27;t afford a better cleanser then you get what you pay for, but if you have a good income start using the real stuff and stop messing with these &amp;#34;teen miracle&amp;#34; store solutions...If we all could we&#x27;d be doing acne laser surgery or Photo dynamic therapy, if only we all had the luxury.</li>
    <li> nice facial wash. its keeps your face LESS oily. I&#x27;ve noticed that if you use this more than 2x a day, your face will become dry, so if your planning to use the wash as your regular cleanser, always have a moisturiser ready to avoid drying up your face.</li>
    <li> good product - no major improvements yet but it is a good facial wash</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended the use of this wash. My son is a 17-year-old with typical teenage acne. It does appear to control the acne better then most of the cleansers on the market. The pump bottle is well shaped and easy to use. Being that this is a Cetaphil product, his face is not too dry or irritated.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have had a small problem with acne ever since high school. I have been through the whole list of acne products. I&#x27;ve used Murad, Clearasil, and many others and none of them worked for me. Recently about a year ago I discovered cetaphil and right after using their products I realized I had found the product that was right for me. Their products are sensitive on the skin and are so simple to use. The sensitive skin facial wash is what I started using but after purchasing this product and have been for the past months I can safely say this product worked for me and helps me keep a nice skin tone, oil free, and acne free complexion. I recommend shopping over the internet before you buy from anywhere. I found it to be cheaper on Amazon than it is at my local Wal-mart.&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: When washing your face, do not use a scrubber , try not to irritate your face. When washing your face don&#x27;t wash for to long. When you are done washing your face, pat it dry, do not rub a towel over your face, that may cause irritation which will lead to breakouts. Whenever I wash my face and I touch something that may have bacteria on it and then I touch my face either right then or hours after , I might break out in that area. So when you are done washing your face do NOT touch your face unless you know there is no bacteria on your hands. Their is bacteria all over your shower and shower knobs to where your turn your water on so be careful when touching your face throughout the day. When I stopped touching my face so much I noticed my skin was breaking out a LOT LESS!!!!!</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam was recommended by my Dermatologist ad I must say since I have oily acne prone skin.  This foam wash is great for the face and back.  Works beautifully  without drying and keeps shine at bay.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t lather well. Not much of a fan of foams</li>
    <li> Definitely has aided in minimizing the oil on my face...  Is a great product in conjunction with the Cetaphil moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin that&#x27;s pretty prone to acne. This is the only face wash that helps with my break outs and reduces the oil on my face.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me. Dried my skin</li>
    <li> It dissipates on your face even on a second wash... makes you feel as if your face isn&#x27;t really washed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. This obviously is best for people with sensitive skin. I need something a little stronger. Also, whenever I push down it get stuck. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I also don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s just not for me. Quick delivery though.</li>
    <li> Goes great with other Cetaphil products. Leaves skin clean and not feeling excessively dry.  Helps keep shine in control. Prevents acne outbreaks.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great, does the job. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product! I have acne prone skin, and usually use a benzoyl peroxide product but I wanted to take a break from that. My face has been clearing up before I used this product, so I cant speak for its effectiveness on active acne, but it hasnt CAUSED a break out which is a very good thing for me! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, following with the moisturizer and i like the results.</li>
    <li> I have super, insane, crazy oily skin - all over, not just in the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;This gets things under control without over-drying.</li>
    <li> I really like Cetaphil but I like the original or the gentle skin one. This one is ok, but I rather go back to the other. Came on time and was packaged well. Just that my skin is use to the gentle skin.</li>
    <li> This face wash was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I have moderate to severe acne and this has really helped a lot.The face wash leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out you skin. I use this in combination with prescription creams and together I&#x27;ve really seen an improvement. I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any stores other than amazon. Besides that, foam is fun! There is a slight smell but it goes away when I rinse.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old with beginning acne issues.  Doctor recommended.  I did not like the original formula as it was difficult to get the foam feel.  This one starts out foamy and feels more like you are actually washing your face.  We keep one in the shower and one on the sink for optimal 11 year old face washing opportunities.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing fantastic. Just ok, probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> beeen using this product for awhile now its pretty good keeps oil under control and that helps with causing acne but its just a cleanser if u have bad acne still recommend a cream for overnight</li>
    <li> Great foam wash for oily skin. I had great result with this product for my oily skin. However, this product is overpriced here. Elsewhere you can find it for $9.87.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:     I really loved this product and did see results for a short time but it wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for in the long run, plus the bottle stopped pumping only half way through so I ended up wasting more than I used. I no longer use this foam wash. I now use witch hazel and follow with Everyone Lotion mixed with a tiny bit of apricot oil and rose hips seed oil and I&#x27;m loving it. My skin has improved so much. I might still use the cetaphil lotion in summer though because it was decent and has the sunblock.  - - - - - - - - - -  Original Review:  I was a bit skeptical about these products but I figured what the heck? I&#x27;m one of those people that carry around oil pads and bring long sleeves on purpose to wipe oil off my face throughout the day because it gets really irritating and it&#x27;s embarrassing, plus the oil is the cause of so many zits and blackheads! Most of the other products I&#x27;ve tried worked for my mom but gave me really crappy results and some even gave me chemical burns or dried out my face so bad I didn&#x27;t think the skin would stop peeling off. Then about 3 weeks ago I stumbled across this. I saw that it had a lot of great reviews and I wanted to try it but the prices weren&#x27;t so appealing to me cause&#x27; lets face it... I&#x27;m broke. My biggest fear was buying it and having just wasted 25 bucks because it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it turns out that&#x27;s not the case at all. I broke down and bought it (anything that could help right?) and I love it! It&#x27;s not harsh on skin and it helps a lot. I&#x27;ve been using both the foam wash and the moisturizer twice daily for the last week and a half to 2 weeks and I can already tell you I will definitely purchase it again when I run out (which won&#x27;t be for a while, believe it or not a little goes a very long way with these products). The first use or 2 of the foam doesn&#x27;t feel like it even cleaned anything, but trust me it does, and the next few uses you will notice a change and it feels really clean and your face isn&#x27;ttight at all like it is with other soaps. (using face scrubbies or something like the Neutrogena wave or the Mia brush works better than washing your face with your hands.) It also doesn&#x27;t have a very overpowering scent like I read in other reviews. It has a smell that is really hard to describe but it definitely does NOT smell bad at all just different. To the reviewers saying it&#x27;s overpowering, it&#x27;s totally not and would you really want extra chemicals added just to fragrance it anyway? Nope... didn&#x27;t think so. The moisturizer is really nice especially used after the foam. I&#x27;m one of those people that hates lotion and body oils because they make your skin look and feel greasy. This stuff leaves a minimal grease feeling and doesn&#x27;t make your face look greasy at all. It&#x27;s a very small bottle for 15 bucks but it gives you pumps smaller than a marble and I usually have some left over after I&#x27;m done applying it! Both the foam and moisturizer are definitely worth the money because they work and they last. After the 2 weeks I already see noticeably less oil and in turn less blemishes. I still have acne obviously because this stuff isn&#x27;t acne medicine but it dramatically lessens the oil. A side note, if you are one of those that occasionally can&#x27;t resist the urge to get the gunk out of your face it also makes acne easier to squeeze out if you have stubborn blemishes with less tearing skin.  Overall both the foam and moisturizer are really great products and I would recommend them to anyone that struggles with oily/combination skin or anyone with acne for that matter. Lessens oil, which lessens acne, not harsh and keeps skin feeling softer and more even. Anyone have any suggestions on face washes or medicinal treatments for acne (especially blackheads) that would go hand in hand with these I would really greatful?!?! Thank you!</li>
    <li> For about 5 years now I&#x27;ve paid over $100 every 6 weeks for Proactiv. My sister suggested I try this about 4 months ago and I&#x27;ve had amazing results. My face would always get so dried out from the Proactiv during the winter months especially, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dryness at all with this product. I always follow up with he Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer after washing. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on Proactiv when I should have been using this instead!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my son&#x27;s doctor for his acne.  It is in a neat foam so perfect for teens that are learning how to take care of hygiene!</li>
    <li> Very impressive product - I&#x27;ve been using this Cetaphil Foam Wash for the last ~18mo. which is the longest I&#x27;ve consistently stuck with one face wash product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- As someone with VERY oily and acne-prone skin, this product eliminates ALL oil from my face, but without leaving it dry&lt;br /&gt;- My face genuinely feels &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34; after washing...after a long-day at work and commuting through the subway, I can&#x27;t wait to get home and wash my face with the Dermacontrol Foam Wash&lt;br /&gt;- Very effective at curbing my breakouts, particularly on my forehead&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The pump nozzle consistently seems to &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34; about 1/4 of the way through the bottle, which requires two hands to pump with...1 to hold the bottle and another to manually push up and down (the spring-action mechanism fails and the nozzle will remain stuck at the bottom otherwise)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many cleansers, in my search to find one that doesn&#x27;t give me acne but also doesn&#x27;t dry me out. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;It also meets another important criteria, low Ph, about 5.5.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the Aveeno product i used to use, and found this one one day. I thought i would try it and now i will continue using it. It has a nice scent that I love, and the foam helps dissolve oil on the skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and the moisturizer. I have mild acne issues. Don&#x27;t wear make up. Female. I&#x27;ve only be using about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: a little goes a long way; skin feels clean; not harsh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none yet for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give 5 stars when I see a definite positive change in my face. But I trust Cetaphil brand.</li>
    <li> Not a big fan of the smell of this cleanser or the density of the foam.  It&#x27;s just kind of blah and it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it cleans well.  It takes 3 or 4 pumps to get a reasonable amount of foam and then it just sort of is airy on your face.  I&#x27;ve since switched to a DermaMD oil control wash... this bottle sits 3/4 full still.</li>
    <li> My daughter gets this from the department store for a higher price so we are very pleased to be saving money by purchasing it on e bay.  It arrived really quickly. This is the only face wash that seem to clear my daughter&#x27;s oily skin</li>
    <li> Excellent foaming cleanser. My face is literally squeaky clean after using this. I use it every other day so as not to dry out my combination skin, though. So, alternate days, I use a homemade oil based cleanser. The combination of using the two seems to work great. This is excellent at controlling oil. I&#x27;m super pleased with it. Plus, my dermatologist recommended it, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. I work construction and sweat a lot in the summer so my pores on my back plug up a lot. I get bad acne on my back in the summer. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist along with the matching lotion or oil control bottle that is supposed to go with it. After using it for a couple of months my back was just as bad but did make the deep acne come to the surface. Still didn&#x27;t go away or lessen it. Just gave me white heads. I discontinued it and just showered after work as usual and started to shower once more right before bed and my back cleared up. Not 100% but a big improvement.</li>
    <li> excellent facial cleansing for teenage skin.  Use it daily for best outcomes.</li>
    <li> Do not care for the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> Not as great as the original. The original doesn&#x27;t foam or lather but you can still get that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;  feeling. It&#x27;s not even so much that you don&#x27;t get that feeling as the wash just disappears as soon as it touches your skin. I use about 4 pumps every wash and I&#x27;m still not sure if it&#x27;s getting everywhere since I apply it to a washcloth and then my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the world&#x27;s worst oily skin and I don&#x27;t notice a difference with this product even in conjunction with the moisturizer.  That being said, it isn&#x27;t overly drying and does not cause breakouts. I probably still wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Its okay. You need about five to six pumps to get a good lather for your face so you can go through a container pretty quickly.  I think its because the formula does not come out very thick but rather thin, almost watered down, so you dont think you are getting enough in one to two pumps.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks.  For teenage breakouts and oily skin, nothing has worked better.  My teen reports that this does not leave his skin feeling too tight or too dry, just super clean.  The scent is pleasant and best of all it really seems to control breakouts - both the appearance and the intensity.  great stuff.</li>
    <li> i started using this because , it was recommended by my dermatologist and used couple of samples, it really worked for any kind of pimples or acne .&lt;br /&gt;basically a good face wash.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i don&#x27;t like is the pump..from DAY 1 the pump action is not working. when i press the pump for the foam ,the pump stuck at the bottom and i have to put it back and have to press it again....&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money.</li>
    <li> I have a seriously acne problem for few years. Last week I went to see my dermatologist and he gave me some little samples of Cetaphil acne wash and Cetaphil acne moisturizer. My poor face was so dry after using this damn cleanser and many peices of skin began to fall off. At first I thought it might be normal. Then I realized this cleanser was totally harming my skin. My acne got worse than before. Everytime after I used it, my face was like wearing a plactis musk and I couldn&#x27;t even smile!! I don&#x27;t understand why Cetaphil makes such a dry cleanser for acne people! Not every acne person has oily skin and caused by oil!! I&#x27;m combination and sometimes really dry in winter cuz I live in Boston. Just warning you guys to be careful! BTW, the acne moisturizer is pretty good. Not oily at all and keeps skin moisture.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product. It made my face break out more &amp; the pump stopped working with the foam like water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Cetaphil&#x27;s facial moisturizers for years with much success, so I had high hopes for this cleanser. Clearasil changed the only product of theirs that I really liked, the Oil-Free Daily Cleanser (it now has salicylic acid in it, which I can&#x27;t use), so I picked up Cetaphil&#x27;s Dermacontrol Face Wash as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than three days after starting to use Cetaphil&#x27;s product I noticed a substantial increase in breakouts. The breakouts have continued all week, so I&#x27;ve changed back to my old face wash until I can find another replacement. Contrary to other reviews I didn&#x27;t think it left my skin particularly dry, though I do use a moisturizer after washing my face. The smell also wasn&#x27;t terribly obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam doesn&#x27;t seem like a good vehicle for this cleanser. One or two pumps doesn&#x27;t feel like enough to really cover your face, and the foam dissipates into a thin liquid, so I never felt like I was getting good coverage on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that it doesn&#x27;t say non-comedogenic on the packaging anywhere. I&#x27;d be awfully surprised if Cetaphil made a face wash that wasn&#x27;t non-comedogenic, especially an acne face wash, but from my results it certainly seems that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this product works for others, but it has really put be back in my progress on controlling my acne. It&#x27;ll be weeks before it&#x27;s under control again. If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, 8 Fluid Ounce looks very good, I haven&#x27;t begun using it.Hope it can clean my oil face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and I&#x27;ll have to say, it&#x27;s alright. I really enjoyed this product; after a month or so, my skin really cleared up. There was no more acne on my forehead. Then, the acne came back. well, mainly depended on the level of stress. If stress was high, the acne would remain. If not, the acne was not. When I didn&#x27;t use it, my face was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice, before using this product, I never actually used a cleanser. I recently stumped upon the Estee Lauder Perfectly Clean Splash Away Foaming Cleanser Facial Cleansing Products. It works so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cetaphil is great if you have sensitive skin. Otherwise, I don&#x27;t recommend it. I have quite oily skin, and I needed a stronger cleanser. Of course, a foam cleanser is best &#x27;cause it does not strip too much of the skin. I found that was a problem, when I tried using Neurogena products. Depending on your skin type, will depend on your needs. It would be a mistake to put all the blame on cetaphil for my returned acne because I was never using the right cleanser to begin with.</li>
    <li> As advertised, it does a genuinely good job of removing oil from my face, and it seems to actually keep oiliness down for some time after washing too.</li>
    <li> Loves it. Will definitely be getting more and my skin has never felt better. Thanks so much! Looking forward to trying more of your products.</li>
    <li> Absorbs very well&lt;br /&gt;Spf&lt;br /&gt;Lasts 3 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t deeply moisturize</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter to try.  After her dance competitions she always breaksout from all the make up.  Using this limited those breakouts and quickly \\&quot;healed\\&quot; the pimples that did appear.</li>
    <li> I love this foaming facial cleanser by Cetaphil.  I keep it in my shower and it leaves my skin feeling clean and oil free, but not overly dry and flaky.  I like the foam format as a little bit cleans my entire face and neck and I don&#x27;t have a lot of wasted gel or liquid soap from a regular pump.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical of purchasing this because it is a foam cleanser which I struggled with in the past.  I decided to purchase it because I already purchased the moisturizer.  This foam cleanser actually removes all of my makeup and does not dry out my skin!  The smell is pleasant like all other Cetaphil products there is no perfume.  I broke out on my chin when initially switching to this cleanser but I am not sure if it was due to me also changing my toner and adding a BHA treatment all at the same time.  I have used this in combo with the moisturizer and worn makeup and have seen much less oil throughout the day.  On days I am not wearing makeup, my skin is smooth and not oil at all hours later.  I have suffered from acne prone, oily skin my entire life and this stuff works great.</li>
    <li> My skin is &amp;#34;combination&amp;#34; - dry in some spots, oily in others. My nose is especially oily, and while astringent keeps it under control, it&#x27;s pretty harsh. I used the Cetaphil cleanser once a day for several days and it really did help on my nose and above my eyebrows, the oiliest parts. For a while it was fine on my dry skin, too, but eventually got a little too dry and moisturizer alone couldn&#x27;t keep up. It&#x27;s okay for every other day use for me as long as I stick to only the oily parts. The scent is too strong, and the foam is just unwieldy. It gets everywhere, though I do pump it into my hand and let the bubbles pop for a second before using it. This isn&#x27;t a terrible wash, but there are such better ones around for the same price that I can&#x27;t recommend this particular brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would clear my face up some since it says it&#x27;s made for ance prone skin, it hasnt. Its a good facewash to control oil though.</li>
    <li> As described and in good packaging...no leaks.  This is great wash, but inconvenient for me to go to the store and buy.</li>
    <li> I thought this product did a good job of removing oil, but left my face feeling dry. After about 8 hours I would have to use the product again as my face would again be oily. The pump also stopped working while I still had nearly half a bottle left so I had to toss it out.</li>
    <li> There is no better cleanser for oily skin.  I have tried everything...this is the bomb!  I will never buy anything else, but what do you expect from Cetaphil.  They know skin care.</li>
    <li> I no longer use this product, but when I did I can say it worked decently. It was recommended by my dermatologist, and since I was familiar with other cetaphil products I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the short term it worked decently. Kept the oil at bay, and my face felt clean. However, in the long run my face was still oily, and the acne outbreaks just WOULDN&#x27;T STOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn&#x27;t realize how harsh this cleanser was on my face until I stopped using it completely. Now I use bamboo-charcoal soap as a pre wash, hemp seed oil as a main wash, and Braggs ACV as a toner. My face is 10x softer than when I used any commercial product, I have NO acne whatsoever, and there is also not even a trace of oil. My face literally feels softer than a babys bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re considering using this I would highly suggest you go the natural route as it&#x27;s so much cheaper and better for you. If you&#x27;re too lazy to do the natural thing, then this would be my top choice for a chemical based facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I received a few samples of this and liked them so much I wanted to purchase a larger bottle.  Results may vary, but it has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Helps tremendously with Epuduo</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed me to use it for facial cleansing.. It works just ok to me.. It does reduce oil production. But didn&#x27;t face my acne scar or prevent my acne...</li>
    <li> I came across this face wash while researching the benefits of zinc for skin. I have very sensitive, red, dry, flaky, and acne prone skin. Sigh. Many of my skin problems are probably hormone related: I am in my early thirties and have been pregnant or breastfeeding for six consecutive years now with only one, short, three-month long break. Flaky skin can be a symptom of dermatitis (dandruff), and zinc can help control that. I have been using Cetaphil body lotion and Cetaphil Facial Lotion with SPF for years now, and so I thought I&#x27;d give this wash a try. After two weeks, I can say that I am fairly happy with it. It does not seem to irritate or dry out my skin. My skin is less flaky, and less red, and I even have less acne. It hasn&#x27;t been a cure, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I am sensitive to odor, and the smell does not bother me the least bit. I do use a gentle microfiber to exfoliate and remove make-up, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well this product does those things. I am interested in also trying the derma control facial lotion, but I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the regular Cetaphil facial lotion, I haven&#x27;t given it a chance yet.</li>
    <li> I went to the dermatologist about a week ago for my acne, and I told him I mainly had oily skin (I&#x27;m 17 years old by the way) . The next morning I used this cleanser and it felt great, my skin was clean and my face wasn&#x27;t oily at all throughout the day. Then after a few more days of using it, my face started to get dry, so I began to use some lotion and I figured that would solve the problem. It hasn&#x27;t. I put lotion on my face 3-5 times a day and my face is still bone dry. My nose is peeling, and even my nostrils are peeling and they hurt. I really wanted to fall in love with this wash because it is really good for oily skin, but it completely dried out my face and now I look like someone punched me in the face because my face is so dry and red. Super disappointed. 👎</li>
    <li> To be honest this made my acne worst ANd prominent. It definitely brought my self esteem down to see my mild acne red and growing more tiny bumps. I&#x27;m a 28 yr old adult nd it did not work for my skin. My skin was clear in my early twenties but all of the sudden I started getting acne again n eliminated all diary n decided to go back to proactiv, just the cleanser n my acne is getting better little by little. I haven&#x27;t used proactiv since high school!! I hope it works for u but for me it didn&#x27;t</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for a couple of months. It keeps the ance away that for sure, and it is a gentle cleanser. However, when I dry my face with my towel there is still dirt on face... Just know its way better than the original!!!</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, and have used it ever since.  It is very light, has a nice scent and does not dry out your skin.  I also use a retinol product, and the combination has made my skin very clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleanser. Great delivery</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this face wash.  It leaves my skin feeling super soft and it&#x27;s working better on my breakouts than other washes I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m also using it with the oil control moisturizer and I have definitely seen a difference in amount of oil on my face.</li>
    <li> I got this originally as a sample with the DermaControl Moisturizer. I&#x27;m so happy I did. I quickly bough the full size. It&#x27;s really good at removing makeup. I don&#x27;t even use my makeup remover wipes anymore. I feel like my face is clean, but not overly dry when I&#x27;m done. My acne has been managed since starting this besides the monthly pimple or two on my chin, which I can&#x27;t expect a soap to fix. I&#x27;m really happy with this product, which is rare for me.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-gentle foam&lt;br /&gt;-easy to wash off&lt;br /&gt;-skin feels natural after removal, verses feeling taunt or coated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible Con if scent sensitive:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m somewhat scent sensitive and it is not fragrance free, but the odor fades quickly after washing it off.  So in comparison to other face washes, it would rank as a \\&quot;mild\\&quot; odor.</li>
    <li> This product may work, but it really depends on your skin type! My girlfriend and I have both tried it, with varying results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this product is worth trying if your skin type (and acne) involves a lot of oiliness. If you&#x27;re the type of person who has a little acne but also normal/dry/T-zone skin.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist gave me samples of Cetaphil and CeraVe. I actually use both one after another because I feel they work well together. While I like CeraVe more, as it is practically scentless and more drying, Cetaphil is still pretty good! Not as fast working as CeraVe, but keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I like the foam texture but it dry my skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff has so much fragrance.  Not only is it unpleasant, but it irritated my already acne prone skin and actually caused more acne.  I used this and the lotion.  The lotion also smelled and burned when any residue of it got even her my eyes.  Very disappointed.  I wanted to like it.  Had to return both to Target where I purchased them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for a couple of months, and it&#x27;s great. I tried several other brands, and they irritated my skin even though it was supposed to be for red, sensitive skin. I will buy this again because it is controlling my rosacea.</li>
    <li> Even though I am using it every night, I do not feel any different and my acne still keep appearing.</li>
    <li> I mean so far it is working on what it supposed to, Its not making things worse and it not working like magic, but its working enough that i still like and using it.</li>
    <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase this product through Amazon, I came here (like always) to read others&#x27; reviews before buying. I feel like I need to return the favor.  Despite complaints about the smell, the foam, the lack of clean feeling, etc. I bought this product due to recent breakouts. Years ago when I was in my teens the Dermologist recommended Cetaphil, so I came back. I have to tell you that this product is SO harsh on your skin that after just 3 days (6 washes) my face is literally burnt and my breakout is SO bad that I left work feeling so self conscious. I&#x27;m a 35 year old male professional and was so embarrassed of what this crap did to my skin and people looking funny at me in meetings, that I left work early. I went and bought the good old Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser today. Do yourself a favor and save yourself from the absolute embarassment I went through today.  Terrible, awful product.</li>
    <li> The product seems to get most of the oil off and is not harsh on the skin. The foam is general, but the bottle I recieved didn&#x27;t foam the solution very much. The solution is very watery so in the shower it will just fall through my fingers. This means I have to pump more than when it is a true foam.</li>
    <li> Gentle daily cleanser recommended by my doctor</li>
    <li> My 13 year old has severe acne. He has to go through 4 acne regimens before he can qualify for Acutane.&lt;br /&gt;He uses 2 antibiotic topical creams and has to take the antibiotic capsule Doxycycline hyclate twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;His dermatologist gave him this face wash to help prevent over drying and chapping his skin. It helps control his oily skin and he doesn&#x27;t have irriation from all the meds while washing with this. The oil control moisturizing lotion also helps with the oil and protects from sunburn.</li>
    <li> I have like 3 pimples on my forehead and I have now been using this product for 3 good days now. It&#x27;s been really hot out and I sweat but still. 2 thumbs down.</li>
    <li> After trying hundreds of products through the years from brand name to not so known, I&#x27;ve finally realized that the best products for sensitive combination skin are the original cetaphil cleanser and the dry-sensitive cetaphil cream. I tried this product after my dermatologist recommended it to prevent breakouts (typically I brake out in my mouth, chin, and forehead) monthly during the first week I thought and noticed a difference, however two weeks later I my skin was so dry and I got this weird allergic reaction. So if you have sensitive/combo skin don&#x27;t try this.</li>
    <li> THis facial cleaner works well.  It foams beautifully and smells good, strong, but good.  The pump lasted about 100 days and no longer returns to the upright position on it&#x27;s own, but the acne prevention works.</li>
    <li> I switched to Cetaphil from Gly-Sal cleansers I had been using for acne.  My skin has seemed to respond really well to it and I think actually produces less oil now that it is not begin as stripped with harsher cleansers.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much perfume is added to this, would never have guessed it from Cetaphil.  It&#x27;s actually a little nauseating kind of cinnamon-candle yuck smelling.  It&#x27;s foamy when you dispense it but the foaming action kind of breaks down after that so it&#x27;s a bit of a &amp;#34;dud&amp;#34; in terms of cleaning action.  I use 6 pumps - twice!  To feel like I am getting all my make up off.  Really expect more from this brand.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. I love it. It is very light yet and effective. It&#x27;s casing makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a soap replacement, generally in a mid-day workout shower. My skin gets oily pretty quickly, and this appears to prevent this for the entire afternoon. I have not experienced any skin dryness, but again, my skin is oily. It dispenses as a foam, so several pumps are necessary to get enough cleanser to do the job. It washes out easily and has a very pleasing scent, as well. The price is quite reasonable, as many specialty cleansers run into the double digits.</li>
    <li> Good for oil control. Prefer than normal Cetaphil liquid wash. Will definitely continue using it and recommend to my friends</li>
    <li> has been use it for two years, very good, my doctor recommend it to me. I keep use it since then.</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended by my dermatologist.  I like the formulation a lot.  It is very gentle yet helps manage my acne.  The reason I am only rating it 3 stars is because of the dispenser.  From the time I got it, the pump hasn&#x27;t worked well.  When you pump out the cleanser, the pump gets stuck in the down position and you have to pull it back up to pump it again.  I have gone through two bottles and both had the same issue so I&#x27;m pretty sure it is a design flaw rather than just getting a &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34;.  That said, I still like it enough to purchase again and put up with the annoyance of the dispenser.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my two teenagers, it was recommended by our dermatologist.  It works well for both of them, they have minor typical teenage acne issues.  For some reason it is not available in our local stores, so we love it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This foam is very gentile but it does a great job of cleaning my skin througholy. It has a very light almost medicinal scent, but it is light and almost unnoticeable. I know it&#x27;s for oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturizer whatsoever. My skin feels right afterwards, but as long as I follow up with moisturizer it&#x27;s alright. Not really sure if it helps keep my oil at bay throughout the day, but I still love this product.</li>
    <li> 1 out of the 3 bottles i ordered had somehow spilled while still being within its protective plastic baggy, and now is around half full. It also caused damage to the box. I&#x27;m just glad I didnt order any electronics with it because it wouldve been damaged by the spill.</li>
    <li> I recently switched from my usual face wash to this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist and I am so happy I did! There are no harsh chemicals and my skin is looking beautiful these days! I only gave this product 4 stars and not 5 because I do have to wash my face twice; maybe that is because it&#x27;s a foaming cleanser versus a cream cleaner. Either way; I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been 6 months since i use this and still haven&#x27;t ran out of foam, maybe i just pump a little. My acne was gone but still there are break-outs and no irritation to the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used cetaphil products in the past with great results. When I started using this particular one, the first day or so, it made my skin look and feel great. A day or two later, my skin started breaking out horribly. I tried changing my moisturizer, make up...nothing helped. When I stopped using the face wash, my skin cleared back up in a matter of days. I&#x27;m unsure if it was the fragrance or the formula of this product that didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I hope it works better for everyone else!</li>
    <li> Made me break out terribly</li>
    <li> this works wonderfully, a little foam goes a long way and after a few months I&#x27;ve started using it every other day and following up with a little lotion in the morning, my boyfriend can&#x27;t believe how well it works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble with acne over my life, and this is about the only cleanser that consistently works. My dermatologist recommended I get it, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have moderately oily skin, if that helps you in your choice. I believe this is best for moderate to oily folks.</li>
    <li> I have had rosacea with acne for many years and was fairly controlled while using the cetaphil daily cleanser. The gentle cleanser didn&#x27;t remove my makeup.  The daily cleanser seemed to work pretty well with only occasional breakouts.  Now that I&#x27;m using the dermacontrol, I&#x27;ve noticed that areas which used to have a buildup up of oils that looked like orange peel are nearly gone.  My face is overall much clearer than it has been and is less red and calmer.  I&#x27;m so pleased!  My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good for a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it&#x27;s tempting to waste this product as its hard to tell how much foaming is going to happen. Two squirts is generally plenty to remove my makeup and clean my skin.  Three squirts is too much and is wasting product.  I have yet to finish my first bottle and I have washed my face twice a day for  nearly 3 months.  Great value!</li>
    <li> My daughters dermatologist recommended this product as part of her acne care. She loves the product.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it will probably run out quickly because I have to use about three pumps&#x27; worth each time.  It isn&#x27;t like most foaming cleansers because you don&#x27;t really get a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel after you use it.  You just have to trust that it&#x27;s working.  I have seen a difference when I use this product.  My skin isn&#x27;t nearly as oily, especially since I use the Dermacontrol moisturizer with it.  My husband, on the other hand, does not like this product because of the smell and he particularly likes the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feel you get from using a face wash.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer said that it doesn&#x27;t clean as well as the gel, and they are right. I tried this because I love foamy soaps.  Unfortunately, it leaves on make-up (bare minerals is what I use). I also feel like I have to do two pumps for enough coverage on my face.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, it is a nice light cleanser, a pleasant fragrance, and not drying. I have acne prone skin and have to be very careful with my skin products, it keep me from break outs (but I have to wash twice).&lt;br /&gt;This product could work for a person who doesn&#x27;t wear make up. I&#x27;d probably buy this for my boys when they need to fight acne.</li>
    <li> I have horrible skin. It pretty much just breaks out if you look at it. This was very gentle on my skin and lasted a pretty long time. It&#x27;s definitely my choice for at the sink washing my face. (my other favorite is Neutrogena oil free acne stress free power cream wash)</li>
    <li> As soon as I put it on my face, I felt a burning sensation.  (Maybe I am just sensitive to ALL Cetaphil products, because I had a similar reaction to original.) Now my face is red and 5 minutes after washing I can still smell that awful fragrance on my face!  Definitely returning this one to the store</li>
    <li> My son love it compare to regular bath soap. Dermatologist recommended it back home. I bought it here on States and ship to my home town (Far East). The prize back home are way doubled. Purchased 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> I like this product it did help clear my face, however around the same time I started using this product I started using a new facial serum, so I can&#x27;t say that this product alone helped clear the small acne problem I was having. Anyway, my face is clearer, and because I have pretty dry skin, my skin is always dry after I wash it no matter how gentle a product claims to be. I wear foundation practically everyday and when using this I do feel that my face is clean and makeup free. Another comment I have is like with all new products give this a week or so to work.</li>
    <li> I used it for a week and LOVE the product. Then after only a week the pump got stuck. I&#x27;m not the only one. Manufacturer doesn&#x27;t seem to care enough to change the pump design. Ugh. It&#x27;s just one step from greatness.</li>
    <li> I am Chinese-American and I suffer from oily /dry skin with a little bit of acne. I recently went to the dermatologist and she gave me a sample of this product. Every single wash and moisturizer I used have left my skin oily throughout the day. When I used this wash I was amazed at how well it worked. It kept my very beautiful throughout the day and I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> just love it! it have helped alot.</li>
    <li> the cap split in half when i put this in my travel bag. Second time I brought this with me when I travelled, it spilled all over my stuff. It is foamy but doesnt latther enough to feel clean</li>
    <li> This stuff helps make my prescription toppical creams work better</li>
    <li> It improves clarity of skin, but not perfect. Definitely a reduction in acne thanks to the product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I only got this a few days ago, but I can already see and feel a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a bit tough, it&#x27;s oily in some places while completely drying out in others. Psoriasis runs in my family and I&#x27;ve been started to get it around my mouth, and this has helped that problem immensely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this stuff DOES dry out my skin right under my eyes just slightly, but a moisturizer works goes with this stuff perfectly. I have a bit of acne and other than a few blemishes that were already there, it&#x27;s almost completely cleared up my skin. (That said, I&#x27;ve never had severe acne, so hard to tell what this will do for that type of skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fully intend to be using this for the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it both in the morning and at night with a moisturizer (again, it is a little drying but it&#x27;s far better than any cleanser I&#x27;ve found). Best used every day, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product . My skin is super sensitive and I used these product while I was deployed, definitely helped and was easy on my skin</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with product itself - I&#x27;m just not a fan of &amp;#34;foam&amp;#34; cleansers.  I like bubbles!</li>
    <li> Great face wash. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very dry but when paired with the derma-control moisturizer, it keeps my skin clear.</li>
    <li> works great. doesn&#x27;t break me out like EVERY other face wash does. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> This face wash has a different acne fighting ingredient (zinc) than most other acne washes (benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid). I think that&#x27;s what makes the product work for me. It works perfect on all those tiny little pimples and I truly believe it helps prevent the giant monster cysts.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good to me. I LOVE the foam. I do find that it is sold out in stores quite often.....which means it is a lot of people&#x27;s go-to face wash.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and discontinue all of your salicylic acid and benzoyl products, and try this face wash. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I like that it foams, and I feel very clean after I wash my face. However, I am not seeing a change in my dermatology quite yet. It has only been a few weeks, so we will see. However, I am impressed that it does not dry my face out like other washes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my son.  His dermatologist recommended it for his acne.  His face responds well to it, with minimum drying.</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been trying to find a cleanser mainly drugstore products before going to high end products that fights acne and control my very oily skin I heard about this cleanser it was vey good. I gave it a try even though I&#x27;m not a fan of foaming cleansers, it been a week or more it did nothing to both. It tame my oiliness for an hour and as for acne it only to cause me to breakout more.</li>
    <li> I have tried proactive and every other face wash out there and I must say this is the first time I&#x27;ve found something I would recommend. I use this with my clarisonic and with the St. Ives Apricot Scrub and my face has been much clearer. I just to use the cetaphil bars after my brother recommended them, and I realized they were breaking me out. This stuff washes off with no residue; I still breakout but I find that my breakouts heal much faster than they use to. I use to get a lot of cyst like acne as well and most of that has gone away thanks to this product. I highly recommend this product if you suffer from acne or have problem skin.</li>
    <li> I am undergoing self Retin-A treatments which makes my skin hyper-sensitive.  My old face wash was gentle, but still irritated my already irritated skin.  This is the first that I have tried that does not sting at all.  I used to be a dedicated Cetaphil user, it looks like I never should have left them for another.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and my face feels wonderfully clean!  The redness has disappeared and I don&#x27;t have any more itchy patches.  It&#x27;s soft and smooth and calming for my delicate, blonde skin.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time Cetaphil user, and out of all the different types of products they have, this one is my favorite. First, it foams and lathers your face really well, better than most products out there. Second, the formula has been improved since when used against the original Cetaphil this removed more oil and dirt after my basketball game. I don&#x27;t think I would go back to the original formula after this, it&#x27;s just too perfect.</li>
    <li> I have an extremely oily t-zone plus I live it hot humid Florida. When I first purchased this, I used it as a set. I used the foam wash with the oil control moisturizer and felt like this system did not work for me. However, the other day I ran out of my cleanser I usually use so I grabbed this as a last minute alternate. To my demise this really worked (by itself) I noticed that my face was not as oily by the mid day like I usually am. It caught me by surprise. I have tried sooooo many products and this is the first product that I have seen that has made a significant difference. Happy!</li>
    <li> I got this for my son. He tried it a few times, but it did not really do much for him. Acne did not improve.  It&#x27;s not a bad product. It smells nice and rinses clean, but it did not perform any miracles.</li>
    <li> I would give it four stars if the pumped still worked. It&#x27;s very frustrating have to try to push up the pump to work, after pressing the pump down.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this did not work for me. It ended up drying my skin out and never helped with my acne.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for three months now and I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m even a quarter of the way through the bottle. I use it in the shower pumping 2-3 squirts of foam on to a cheap soft bristle face brush I picked up at Sephora that makes a world of difference. For those that have more oil or break out prone skin this is a real help. I rarely have a black head show up now which I couldn&#x27;t say for the Simple brand I was using before. And while I still get the occasional pimple ( maybe once a month) I can keep it very much in control. I also treat my face with a great natural tea tree oil pad which I think is made by Jason.</li>
    <li> my son uses it &amp; love it. Doesn&#x27;t dry up his skin a lot.  just hoping there&#x27;s bigger container for the price.</li>
