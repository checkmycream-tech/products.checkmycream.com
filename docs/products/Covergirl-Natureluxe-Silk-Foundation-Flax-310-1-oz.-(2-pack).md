      <li>The lip balm however is amazing</li>
      <li>recevied a free sample from bzzagent and this smells great</li>
      <li>I received a sample from CoverGirl and Buzz for review, and am offering an honest one.</li>

      <li>The lip balm is nice too.</li>
      <li>This product is light, applies incredibly easily, provides great coverage, and even smells good.</li>
      <li>This foundation provides good light cover for spring/summer.  </li>
      <li>The product inside is great - covers nicely but lightly and doesn&#x27;t have a bothersome scent, either - just clean.  </li>
      <li>This foundation was very smooth to put on and silky to the touch.  </li>
      <li>and it is very light.</li>
      <li>However, I have also been using the NatureLuxe lip gloss and have been pleased with it.  </li>

      <li>and I love it.    </li>

      <li>I am happy with how quickly the makeup absorbed, and it did feel weightless like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything at all.</li>
      <li>It went on very smoothly &amp; it felt light on my skin.</li>
      <li>I tried on the foundation immediately and was pleased to see how lightweight and smooth it felt.</li>

      <li>I really enjoyed the fact that it is light and non greasy without sacrificing coverage.</li>
      <li>The foundation was so smooth and easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel like</li>
      <li>It did not seem to wear off at all, and did not settle into my fine lines.</li>
      <li>it went on smooth, had a nice shine that lasted a lot longer than I expected, and the taste was pleasant.</li>
      <li>and I received a free sample of NatureLuxe foundation.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this product from Bzzagent.com.</li>
      <li>It has a wonderful light texture, covers with a natural look, and is made from natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Overall a great product.</li>
      <li>I received a free Sample from buzzagent to try this product.</li>
      <li>The foundation goes on smoothly without looking cakey, leaving streaks, or looking like</li>
      <li>I received my free Natureluxe foundation and lip balm in the mail compliments of Bzzagent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a BuzzAgent and was selected to receive a free sample of Cover Girls NatureLuxe Liquid foundation in the color flax.</li>
      <li>It felt great on my lips and lasted surprisingly long for a lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>I do think it tends toward the pink side, but that works out great with my skin</li>
      <li>I will say that if you are looking for full coverage, this is not the foundation for you.  </li>
      <li>I received a full sized sample of this through BzzAgent.</li>
      <li>I also received a full sized lip gloss &amp; five $2 coupons.</li>
      <li>It gave a good natural coverage and covered my skin blemishes and large pores well.</li>
      <li>I was really excited to try a new foundation for FREE!  </li>
      <li>This foundation will give you more of a clean, lightweight, natural look.</li>
      <li>Were I to have to give a brief description I would call it a silky, smooth, creamy, light foundation with good natural coverage.</li>
      <li>So many times I find myself applying makeup on the run - in the car, in a window&#x27;s reflection - because I am so busy!  </li>
      <li>I like the idea of using natural ingredients and the lightweight coverage, but in my case I felt like the coverage was too light and wore off too easily.  </li>
      <li>I really like the light weight feel of the foundation.</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that CoverGirl tried to take a more natural approach to make-up.</li>
      <li>Nothing is worse than standing in the makeup isle trying to decide which foundation will work best for me, and my budget as well.  </li>
      <li>I love being a bzz agent and having the opportunity to try new products, then tell folks what I REALLY think about them!</li>
      <li>Other than that I loved it.</li>
      <li>I also liked the little tube it comes in as it&#x27;s easy to pore out the right amount.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product and it seems that it would be good for those who have sensitive skin too!  </li>
      <li>The new line from Covergirl - Natureluxe - is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>I used this for the first time today, and wore it for 8 hours.</li>
      <li>I can literally smile without fear that my makeup will start to crack and cake off my face much like a mud mask..</li>
      <li>Very lightweight, and not sticky like the foundation!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very excited to say that it did indeed last all day.  </li>
      <li>I was very pleased with the lightweight feel that was neither greasy nor heavy.  </li>
      <li>First of all , it has way too much perfume in it.</li>
      <li>The only downside is that I have oily skin and by the end of the day it appears that most of the makeup is gone from my face due to blotting it but that seems to be the case with most foundation anyway.  </li>
      <li>It gives skin a dewy kind of look, not as matte as other foundations that I have tried, but it gives skin a fresh and natural look.  </li>
      <li>I have never been a huge fan of liquid foundation, but NatureLuxe has found its way into my daily make-up routine.</li>
      <li>I give this 5 stars because the folks at Covergirl have put so much thought into the product, but also the design and ease of use.  </li>
      <li>and I really like wearing it.</li>
      <li>but this was way too much.</li>
      <li>Granted, I live in South Texas (read: hot and humid) and my skin is somewhat oily so maybe this foundation just wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>However, I am in the south and humidity is high here.</li>
      <li>So far, I really like this foundation, and I recommend it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t often wear makeup, because many of the products out there are too harsh on my skin.</li>
      <li>As someone in their early 40&#x27;s, finding a liquid/cream foundation that does not settle into every single fine line is quite an achievement.</li>
      <li>When the folks over at Bzzagent gave me the opportunity to sample Covergirl Natureluxe foundation, I was eager to try something new.    </li>
      <li>Target, which is more than I would usually spend on foundation.</li>
      <li>For the record, I am 35 years old with oily skin.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of NatureLuxe foundation from bzzagent.com and have been using the NatureLuxe foundation from Covergirl for a few days now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticky, it was really sticky and gross.</li>
      <li>- it is a squeeze bottle with a very small opening on the top.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this awesome foundation 5 stars is because I find that its a little expensive for my taste.</li>
      <li>However , what i did like was that is absorbs fairly quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.</li>
      <li>This product wasn&#x27;t harsh, and had just the right amount of coverage for a natural look.</li>

    <li> I received a free sample of this product from Bzzagent.com. I don&#x27;t often wear makeup, because many of the products out there are too harsh on my skin. This product wasn&#x27;t harsh, and had just the right amount of coverage for a natural look. It also contains sunscreen which protected me from getting sunburned on the one sunny day we&#x27;ve had this year. As with all liquid foundations, it is messy to apply, and I have to be careful to keep it away from my hair.</li>
    <li> I am a BzzAgent and I received a free sample of NatureLuxe foundation. I really enjoyed the fact that it is light and non greasy without sacrificing coverage. I also like the fact that CoverGirl tried to take a more natural approach to make-up. I have never been a huge fan of liquid foundation, but NatureLuxe has found its way into my daily make-up routine. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this awesome foundation 5 stars is because I find that its a little expensive for my taste.</li>
    <li> With so many foundation choices out there, a girl can get dizzy wondering what will do the job.  The new line from Covergirl - Natureluxe - is fabulous.  It has a wonderful light texture, covers with a natural look, and is made from natural ingredients.  Not only that, but I loved the bottle.  So many times I find myself applying makeup on the run - in the car, in a window&#x27;s reflection - because I am so busy!  I love this bottle  - it is a squeeze bottle with a very small opening on the top.  I get just enough foundation out, without all of the fuss with a bottle that may just spill, or getting it all over my hands.  I also get the sense (I haven&#x27;t used it all up, just yet) that I will get a bigger bang for my buck because I won&#x27;t be wasting makeup, lost in the bottom.  Getting the lid on and off is also a snap.  The product inside is great - covers nicely but lightly and doesn&#x27;t have a bothersome scent, either - just clean.  I give this 5 stars because the folks at Covergirl have put so much thought into the product, but also the design and ease of use.  Love it!  I have to say \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; to my friends at Bzz agent who shared this sample and the coupons I have been sharing, with me. I love being a bzz agent and having the opportunity to try new products, then tell folks what I REALLY think about them!</li>
    <li> I am a buzzagent and received a sample of this foundation along with a sample of the lip balm. I am happy with how quickly the makeup absorbed, and it did feel weightless like I wasn&#x27;t wearing anything at all. However, I am in the south and humidity is high here. I noticed as the day went on and I was outside my face felt sticky. And not just the usual oh its humid I&#x27;m sticky, it was really sticky and gross. I can only assume this was from the makeup because I have not had a problem like that before. So not sure I would buy this makeup again since humidity is a frequent problem around here. The lip balm however is amazing and I really like wearing it. Very lightweight, and not sticky like the foundation!</li>
    <li> This foundation was very smooth to put on and silky to the touch.  It gives skin a dewy kind of look, not as matte as other foundations that I have tried, but it gives skin a fresh and natural look.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t give quite the coverage of other makeups.  I would recommend this to a friend, though.</li>
    <li> I like wearing makeup that gives me a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look and not something that has me looking like a corpse done up in a funeral parlor. When the folks over at Bzzagent gave me the opportunity to sample Covergirl Natureluxe foundation, I was eager to try something new.    The foundation was so smooth and easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t feel like Im wearing makeup at all. I can literally smile without fear that my makeup will start to crack and cake off my face much like a mud mask..I&#x27;ve had this happen in the past,but thankfully that isn&#x27;t the issue with this!    The foundation blends in nicely with my skin tone and doesn&#x27;t look caked on. I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Fully satisfied!  Good service!</li>
    <li> I got to try the foundation and lip balm for being a BzzAgent.I really like the light weight feel of the foundation.The lip balm is nice too.It doesn&#x27;t over color your lips which I like.It&#x27;s also not sticky and heavy feeling.I do wish the foundation came in more shades though.Other than that I loved it.</li>
    <li> The Cover Girl NatureLuxe foundation is a revelation to someone who long ago gave up on cream and liquid foundations because they were so heavy. I received a sample from CoverGirl and Buzz for review, and am offering an honest one. This product is light, applies incredibly easily, provides great coverage, and even smells good. As someone in their early 40&#x27;s, finding a liquid/cream foundation that does not settle into every single fine line is quite an achievement. Were I to have to give a brief description I would call it a silky, smooth, creamy, light foundation with good natural coverage.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of NatureLuxe foundation from bzzagent.com and have been using the NatureLuxe foundation from Covergirl for a few days now. Unfortunately, I have to say I&#x27;m not totally impressed.  I like the idea of using natural ingredients and the lightweight coverage, but in my case I felt like the coverage was too light and wore off too easily.  Granted, I live in South Texas (read: hot and humid) and my skin is somewhat oily so maybe this foundation just wasn&#x27;t for me.  However, I have also been using the NatureLuxe lip gloss and have been pleased with it.  It felt great on my lips and lasted surprisingly long for a lip gloss.  I loved the color too!  So to sum it up, I don&#x27;t think I would spend the money on the NatureLuxe foundation, however, I would definitely buy the lip gloss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a BuzzAgent and was selected to receive a free sample of Cover Girls NatureLuxe Liquid foundation in the color flax. I have to tell you that anyone who knows me will tell you I do NOT regularly wear makeup. I hate that all foundations I have tried. often they feel gross on my skin or the coloring is all wrong. This product was definitely different from others that I have tried. I goes on smoothly, covers great and best yet feel like I am not wearing anything! I have been using this product daily for a little over a week now and have to say, I would highly recommend using it. I think I have finally found a keeper!</li>
    <li> As a BzzAgent, I received the foundation and lipstick yesterday and was delighted to see the colors. I tried on the foundation immediately and was pleased to see how lightweight and smooth it felt. It matched my skintone perfectly and made my skin look flawless. I have a T-zone and my skin did not feel oily even after 3-4 hours of application. It gave a good natural coverage and covered my skin blemishes and large pores well. I also liked the little tube it comes in as it&#x27;s easy to pore out the right amount. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> This foundation provides good light cover for spring/summer.  I really enjoy the scent!  I do think it tends toward the pink side, but that works out great with my skin so no complaints here!  I did mark it down one star because I do need to use some powder over it to cut down on shine for work.  But otherwise, love it!  I did receive my supply of the foundation as a free sample to evaluate - but there were no requirements to give it a good review!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sad they discontinued this line. After years of trying to find that perfect foundation,  I finally found it when this product came out. Got a stock of 4 left. Not sure what I&#x27;m going to do once they are gone :-(</li>
    <li> I received a free Sample from buzzagent to try this product. I was not very pleased with it. First of all , it has way too much perfume in it. I like a little scent in my cosmetic products but this was way too much. Also, it didn&#x27;t give me the coverage i was hoping to get either - but maybe i just should have gone with one shade darker? However , what i did like was that is absorbs fairly quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.</li>
    <li> recevied a free sample from bzzagent and this smells great and it is very light. it is not cakey and again feels like iam not wearing anything.. i have some sun damage and it evens me out and my skin looks dewy and glows!</li>
    <li> I received a full sized sample of this through BzzAgent. The color I received is flax. I also received a full sized lip gloss &amp; five $2 coupons. For the record, I am 35 years old with oily skin. My ideal shade would be Alabaster, but flax is a close second. I used this for the first time today, and wore it for 8 hours. It did not seem to wear off at all, and did not settle into my fine lines. It went on very smoothly &amp; it felt light on my skin. So far, I really like this foundation, and I recommend it. It retails for around $12 @ Target, which is more than I would usually spend on foundation. I would purchase it if it were on sale &amp; I had a coupon (which I do). I will give an update as I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I received my free Natureluxe foundation and lip balm in the mail compliments of Bzzagent.  I was really excited to try a new foundation for FREE!  Nothing is worse than standing in the makeup isle trying to decide which foundation will work best for me, and my budget as well.  I usually go with the cheapest, and I&#x27;m almost never satisfied.  So this was a great opportunity!  I chose the color Flax, which seemed to be the lightest of all the foundations.  This seemed to be a great choice at the time but when the foundation came in I had just been on vacation and my skin color was now darker.  But I still tried it anyways.  I was very pleased with the lightweight feel that was neither greasy nor heavy.  Working two jobs, and no time for touch-ups, I need a foundation that lasts all day.  I&#x27;m very excited to say that it did indeed last all day.  After trying out the foundation for a week, I went and bought a darker shade to match my skin tone and couldn&#x27;t be happier!  I will say that if you are looking for full coverage, this is not the foundation for you.  This foundation will give you more of a clean, lightweight, natural look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bzzagent and was recently given this product along with a lip balm to try out and I love it.    The foundation goes on smoothly without looking cakey, leaving streaks, or looking like I have a lot of makeup on. It gave me great coverage and covered the imperfections and redder areas on my face.   The only downside is that I have oily skin and by the end of the day it appears that most of the makeup is gone from my face due to blotting it but that seems to be the case with most foundation anyway.  I would definitely recommend this product and it seems that it would be good for those who have sensitive skin too!  The lip balm was simply amazing! I loved it... it went on smooth, had a nice shine that lasted a lot longer than I expected, and the taste was pleasant.</li>
    <li> I love it! and will be ordering ,ore soon.</li>
