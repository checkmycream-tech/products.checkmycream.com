    <li> This really works. Omg this works I have tried 20 more methods to help I spray this on my neck when I feel a hot flash and it feels cold ...love it A+++++++++++++</li>
    <li> If you suffer from hot flashes, please try this all natural spray! The moment you feel one coming on, spray lightly on the back of your neck. You&#x27;ll feel yourself cool down fast. There is a menthol/mint smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last. I keep one in my bag and one on my nightstand!</li>
    <li> I received my product today and tried it for the first time. I have to say that it is very LOUD smelling and when applied like suggested, it kind of felt like it was burning/stinging the lower back of my neck.  Not sure if I should keep using it to see if it works or deal with the uncomfortable reaction I am getting from this product? I only remember order one and for some reason in received two in the mail today?</li>
    <li> This is a peppermint based solution. I smell like a combination of candy canes and Ben gay. And cooling relief? I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;m warmer than I was before I put it on. And for the love of God! Do NOT spray this on your face, even with your eyes closed. I can finally see again. i bought 2 because it was cheaper that way and I could just kick myself in the ass.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing and thought that I would love this product - but I absolutely hate it.  The smell is so strong that my eyes watered.  I like peppermint and menthol, but there is just too much in this product.  This is going back, sorry.</li>
    <li> Really works and reduces hot flashes and night sweats.  I have been saved!!</li>
    <li> gives some relief but product has a strong smell. Be careful not to get in your eyes or on your hands and then rub your eyes or they will burn.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, cooling pad, pills ...is amazing ..one puff on the back of the neck and the hot waves are gone for long long time. Could be a coincidence or just a phase, but since i start using it -  I&#x27;m going for days without needing it anymore. Are 2 in the pack, I keep one in the office , one next to my bed for night ..just in case and after a month already - bottles are still looking full. I do recommend it. I sent some to a friend in South Africa - she is ecstatic, works like nothing else before.</li>
    <li> When the heat hits this helps</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me.  I had an allergic reaction to the spray.  Some very fine bumps formed where I used the spray.  I used it as instructed.</li>
    <li> Should have believed the reviews when it said it burns.  After trying it out, I figured there are other ways to get relief from my hot flashes but this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks! I&#x27;ve bought it for other people too. As soon as I spray it, I stop sweating. Highly recommend for anyone having hot flashes.</li>
    <li> I am a cancer survivor and had to have a hysterectomy which means I was forced into menopause.  I have been miserable from the hot flashes.  I sleep with two fans and an air conditioner every night and am still burning up.  I have tried many natural products and even medication prescribed by my doctor and nothing works......until now.  I was desperate to try anything just to get some relief.  I received this spray yesterday and had the first good night sleep in years, without exaggeration.  Yes, it burns at first for a few minutes but numbs and cools off your neck.  It is sooooo worth it if they are so bad that you cannot sleep.  I am stocking up!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I followed directions and sprayed on the back of my neck.  Just one spray and it burned for the first 15 minutes.  Once the burning went away it did seem to cool off some, but I had to walk around smelling like Ben Gay.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!!! My hot flashes immediately cease and the coolness lingers for quite a while.  I love the purse size aspect of it, so I can carry it with me wherever I go.  I just love it!</li>
    <li> Everytime i feel a hot flash coming on or am just working hard and hot. I spray some at the base of my neck and in 15 seconds I am cooling down.  I hate drugs and this is better than anything my friends have used.  I keep it in my purse, car, kitchen etc!  WORTH IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Really helps takes down the hot flashes at their high points, especially in hot weather.</li>
    <li> This helps so much by decreasing the severity of a hot flash.  I just spray it on my neck when I feel a hot flash coming on.  It takes a few minutes to work but then I feel a cool menthol sensation on my neck that stops me from sweating profusely.  The only drawback is it does smell like menthol but my husband says it is only overpowering if he tries to kiss my neck.</li>
    <li> This stuff burns my skin!  I sprayed it on the back of my neck per the directions and it burned like the dickens.  Even after I washed it off, it still burned for quite a while.  I don&#x27;t have particularity delicate skin and have used peppermint oil before without a problem.  I guess this is just too strong for me, or the combination of the oils and alcohol just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> I had hot flashes during &#x27;chemo-pause&#x27; from cancer treatment and this product was really nice. I kept one next to my bed and one in my purse. It does not completely cure hot flashes, but helps to cool you down quickly. I used it to get to sleep by spraying it on the back of my neck and feet.  It&#x27;s quite a relief. I am not having hot flashes anymore but will keep it to help me deal with summer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I get hot flashes so bad! I have them stashed everywhere and have gotten a lot of people hooked......men and women!</li>
    <li> I was very please with the product, it actually exceed my expectation.</li>
    <li> Good temporary fix,  just be careful where you Spray it, it will burn in the wrong places.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The best, at least for me, this what a was expected.&lt;br /&gt;Lo mejor para las oleadas de calor incomodas, te refresca un montón.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff by far for hot flashes. You spray a lil on the base of your neckline and within seconds you feel cooler. I suffered alot with being hot all the time. I finally found something that really works and is natural throw in your purse and go..</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find something to help with my hot flashes, not only on Amazon but independent reviews also.  I figured it was worth a try.  I could not be happier, for me this works great!  I realize every woman is different and it may not work the same for each one of us.  But I was having 2-3 hot flashes per hour and now thanks to this I am down 1-2 per DAY if even that!  I have to use the spray once in the morning and sometimes in the later afternoon. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, I find it fades away fairly quickly. It cools my neck and stops the hot flash within 30 seconds or less.  I will admit I also starting take Vitamin E and Fish Oil (Omega 3) at the same time I started this.  So maybe it is a combination but regardless, I am sooooo very happy to finally have those awful hot flashes under control!!!  I bought a 2 pack, one stays with me all day and the other stays by the bed which by the way I have had to use one time!!  I recommend this product highly and wish all you women who try it the luck that I have had with it! Very happy customer!  :-)</li>
    <li> This hot flash spray really works! I was doubtful but tried it. Love this spray! I live in the hot Arizona desert where it is over a hundred degrees almost year round. This really does help keep me cooler and limits hot flashes. I put it on at night on the back of my neck and go to bed. I swear I feel my body temperature drop right away! It smells good but not overpowering. It does not stain your clothes or bedding. It is handy to carry in my purse and car for hot flashes too. I highly recommend trying it.</li>

    <li> I was hesitant to order and waste my money on yet another useless product, but when you&#x27;re desperate you buy just about anything. Needless to say I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. At first I was disappointed with the strong &amp;#34;Icy Hot&amp;#34; scent. I thought I would only be able to use it at home , but then I noticed that the scent doesn&#x27;t linger too long. I&#x27;m going to take it to Disneyland next month because I&#x27;ll be in the sun all day and I&#x27;m going to need help staying cool. By the way, I sprayed it on my husband when he got a hot flash and it worked great for him. I highly recommend this product. 👍</li>
    <li> Works like a miracle for Hot flashes</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a voice artist and one of the problems I (and most voice artists who work from a home booth) face is how to stay cool whilst recording.  We can&#x27;t have A/C on, of course since the microphone picks up even the tiniest of noises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted in a FB group I belong to about trying out some cooling wearables (for wrist and neck) and a peer suggested this spray.  Though, of course, I got lots of chuckles about it I have to say, it does seem to make a difference.  Just a quick spray on the neck and initially it seems to warm the neck but then overall one feels cooler.  It also has a rather nice (though strong) smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend persuaded me to &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; the spray whilst wearing my cooling wearables so if you&#x27;re brave, check out the picture. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> Magic! If it came in bigger bottles, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kat</li>
