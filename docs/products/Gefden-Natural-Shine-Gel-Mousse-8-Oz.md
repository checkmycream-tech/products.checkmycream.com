<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is great for my fine hair. It gives me more body. My hair holds the style longer. Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I used it years ago and found it at Beautyco and have not been able to find it since, so you can imagine how excited I was when i found it on Amazon. It is a wonderful product that gives a great hold and shine, especially for fine hair. I ordered 3 to start with, I don&#x27;t want to be out anymore. I received this quickly too. Such a great product.</li>
    <li> I happened to find this mousse at a beauty shop.  They don&#x27;t carry it anymore, so I searched the web.  I FOUND IT!!!  My hair is fine and only mousse I&#x27;ve found that actually holds in any kind weather.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> I was interested in purchasing this product but haven&#x27;t been able to find info ANYWHERE online regarding the ingredients of it. I generally follow the curly girl methods for my curls so I prefer to avoid chemicals and silicones. Also prefer to avoid parabens, as I have allergic reactions to them. Eventually I sent an email to the producers of this product (on their site) asking them if they could tell me if there were any of these things in it. This was the absurd response I got- \\&quot;I am referring you to the company rep., Pam Remmy at DeMert Brands. Her toll-free number is 1-800-327-3323. She would be happy to help you.I only sell the product, not involved in its ingredients.\\&quot; Even if they only sold the product, why wouldn&#x27;t they be able to read the back and tell me the ingredients? this evasive \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; is lacking sincerity and I will avoid this product.</li>
    <li> Best price for Gefden Gel Mousse is at dunmorebeauty.com Holiday Special is only $6.75 for a limited time. Regular price is $7.75. Same great product.</li>
    <li> All my life I had fine, thin hair. The longer it got, the thinner it got.  Then I started using Gefden Natural Shine Gel Mousse.  Since using it, I get compliments all the time from people who stop me just to tell me how beautiful my hair looks.  My hair looks thick and shiny no matter what length it is.  This product totally changed my self image.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I got this at a Beauty Supply Store but it went out of business.  I moved and couldn&#x27;t find it so was thrilled I found it on Amazon!!  Great product that holds my natural curly hair, adds body but is not stiff.  I get so many compliments on my hair!!</li>
    <li> I used this product for years then could not find it in the beauty supply stores.  My hair was severley damaged about a year ago due to the person doing it getting sidetracked.  So i have had to let it grow out and (it is still growing out) but especially without a perm it is really straight.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore Gefden is great I use it when I wash my hair and it gives it enough body and shine that I just have to touch it up between washings with the hot curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So gad it is still on the market.  Also I like the way they have redone the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for your website</li>
    <li> This product is great on my long, naturally wavy hair.  It really holds the wave and set and makes the hair super shiny.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair....it&#x27;s been awhile since I found a scrunching gel/mousse that I like. The girl at our local beauty supply recommended it. When I went back to get more they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore...thank you Amazon....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mousse gel for years and love it.  It adds a nice shine and hold to my hair.</li>
    <li> The product is as expected based on prior use of it.  One container was received damaged.  A claim was made with a picture showing the status and the product was immediately replaced.  That is service that will yield repeat business.</li>
    <li> A little bit goes a long way.  Been using this product for years and it still exceeds expectations as always</li>
    <li> I love this mousse. It doesn&#x27;t get hard, my hair stays soft and the curls look great. It also has a nice smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two years now and really like it.  As usual I ordered this one through Amazon and received it promptly.  Although I ordered this in April I did not open the package until yesterday and was very disappointed to find that the Mousse does not come out as a foam.  The container appears to be intact and I don&#x27;t see any issues with the top except that it is hard to press down on and when something does come out it is basically a runny white liquid.&lt;br /&gt;I am not placing any blame on the seller as they probably were not aware of any problems when shipping but now I am out of Mousse until I can get more of this hard to find product.</li>
    <li> I have beenvery satisfied with this product in the past but this time I am finding the nozzle is very hard to push and the foam is not coming out as easily as in the past.  I hope this is a fluke because I really like the results I get with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product ever since LA Looks quit making their gel mousse. I loved that product! Then I found this on amazon as a good replacement per the rating on it. So, I tried it and have been hooked since then. It not only makes the hair more managing to any style, but, it makes my hair shiny and healthy looking. NOT dull like some products that flake and make your hair lifeless looking. I am fully hooked on this!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product  keep coming back to it even after trying other products</li>
