### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I still like UPI the best of them all though.</li>
      <li>Great product and would suggest it to friends!</li>
      <li>Very nice color!</li>
      <li>Cures beautifully and wears well.  </li>
      <li>OPI seems to have improved their formula greatly.</li>
      <li>In some lights it has a lavender hue, but it&#x27;s really great on</li>
      <li>This gel nail fits perfectly to the color I tought and easy to paint on the nails!</li>
      <li>Amazing buy!</li>
      <li>Definitely a good choice to have in your manicure kit.</li>
      <li>This is a really interesting color, I am happy with it</li>
      <li>Love this color!</li>
      <li>and I got many compliments.</li>
      <li>OPI gelcolor is awesome - of the different brands I&#x27;ve tried for my at-home manicures, this product has lasted the longest without chipping.  </li>
      <li>There are better OPI neutrals.</li>
      <li>OK, but for me Harmony Gelish works better.</li>
      <li>and I love the color</li>
      <li>Love the color.</li>
      <li>beyond excited to find out this color was not a gel nail polish :)</li>
      <li>I had a gel manicure done in this color out if state and wanted the same beautiful color.</li>
      <li>Came quick!</li>
      <li>This color is very pretty -- I don&#x27;t typically wear light colors, but it still works with my skin tone and has a more conservative look to it which is good for work, weddings, etc.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful taupe color that leans slightly lavender in some lighting.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>Sophisticated enough for work, sexy enough for after work.</li>
      <li>It wears very well, no issues with chipping or peeling.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nude, that isn&#x27;t too light or too dark and has some flair, buy this!</li>
      <li>In certain lighting conditions, this color looks slightly purple.  </li>

<li> In certain lighting conditions, this color looks slightly purple.  </li>
<li> but I have been told it looked brown, grey and purple.  </li>
<li> I could wear this and only this everyday forever.</li>
<li> Flattering for dark skin.</li>
<li> For a gel coat I expect it to last at least 2 weeks</li>
<li> This didn&#x27;t work for me at all, maybe I was doing something wrong, a lot os different techniques and didn&#x27;t work. ..</li>
<li> It just is a dull color and doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed this color us totally different than the &amp;#34;taupeless beach&amp;#34; I had prior.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m so disappointed in OPI&#x27;s gelcolor.</li>
<li> ALL of the gel in ALL of the companies have terrible color guide on the bottles.</li>

    <li> This gel polish has a lavender gray cast to it.  It has cream finish to it, no sparkle.  It wears very well, no issues with chipping or peeling.  It just is a dull color and doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  There are better OPI neutrals.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Came quick! Worth the money.</li>

    <li> OK, but for me Harmony Gelish works better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this twice at the salon and I love the color but it is only lasting 24 hours before it starts peeling off.  For a gel coat I expect it to last at least 2 weeks and this doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m going to buy the regular polish for home but I&#x27;m so disappointed in OPI&#x27;s gelcolor.</li>
    <li> Very nice color! This gel nail fits perfectly to the color I tought and easy to paint on the nails! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love this color! In some lights it has a lavender hue, but it&#x27;s really great on and I got many compliments.</li>
    <li> ALL of the gel in ALL of the companies have terrible color guide on the bottles. Like none of the inside the bottle gel looks like the picture on the bottle of the color. I still like UPI the best of them all though.</li>

    <li> This is a really interesting color, I am happy with it but I have been told it looked brown, grey and purple.  Depending on the lighting you may get any one of these colors.</li>
