      <li>They were amazing.</li>

      <li>I liked how lightweight it felt</li>
      <li>These bb creams are good if you are fair to light.  </li>
      <li>I liked the product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good idea I bought the samples instead of the full size products.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t look good with super oily face.  </li>
      <li>and they were fine; I liked them.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok during winter time, but when summer comes I might not recommend this</li>
      <li>I got 2 applications from each packet, but this is my favorite BB cream company.  </li>
      <li>and I was able to get two uses out of each packet so the samples lasted me for months.</li>
      <li>These individual samples were awesome.</li>
      <li>I love these BB</li>
      <li>And it was mostly around my lips.</li>
      <li>I was able to get two applications from each sample.  </li>
      <li>knew that I wanted to try Skin79&#x27;s most popular BB creams, but I wasn&#x27;t sure which version the pink or gold would best fit me, so I bought this sample set.</li>
      <li>It blends into my skin, feels good, looks great, isn&#x27;t greasy or dry, stays put.</li>
      <li>In terms of value, I am so glad I bought a sample set rather than the full size!</li>
      <li>The Pink packets are lighter than the gold and the perfect shade for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I knew I wanted the Pink BB Cream, and sample size is perfect for travel!</li>
      <li>These samples for skin 79 gold and pink are just awesome.</li>
      <li>is a bit more natural to most skin tones, but I feel that honestly, with the shade color-changing within minutes to accommodate your skin tone, I wanna lean more towards the gold one...</li>
      <li>Which is almost a bit more moisturizing which I found great in the winter, and covered my eyes circles a tiny bit more cause of the original color when applied...</li>
      <li>It goes on easily.</li>
      <li>Un general is great....</li>
      <li>Probably better if you are a cool undertone.</li>
      <li>The sample pack gave me the chance to try these products without a huge investment.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide if the Pink or Gold would be better for my skin so this was a great option.</li>
      <li>But you get a great light dewy look upon initial application.  </li>
      <li>Well worth what i paid for and more.</li>
      <li>I really like it!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy that it came WEEKS before the expected date.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning on buying the full bottle when my samples run out.</li>
      <li>will be investing in the full size bottle</li>
      <li>However, it has a more greasy composition than the gold which makes me look really oily a couple of hours in</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering a full size product when this runs out.</li>
      <li>The product was very good; made my skin look smoother &amp; pale finish blended in quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin and the gold can look a little dark on me, but it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, so</li>
      <li>My complexion has never looked better and it&#x27;s really nice just to be able to put some of this cream on with a little blush and lip gloss and have a nice laid back look.</li>
      <li>so both formulas have been fine since it is the winter, but I am interested to see if that changes in the summer.</li>
      <li>I really liked both but ultimately decided on getting the full size of the gold.</li>
      <li>That in mind once you put this product on your skin, it is addictive, you love it and must have it on your skin always!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, and blends very well.  </li>
      <li>Each sample is a days worth of product.  </li>
      <li>These trial sizes also make it worth the money since you end up with 80 grams</li>
      <li>They daily use of this has also help improve my own skin.  </li>
      <li>The shipping didn&#x27;t take more than a couple weeks, and I also got 2 more samples from other BB creams from this line.</li>
      <li>Each sample can last me an average of 2.5 applications (about 3 x dime-sized amounts), so it is perfectly portable for weekend trips.</li>
      <li>and it comes super fast.</li>
      <li>super fast delivery.  </li>
      <li>Super fast shipping considering its amazon</li>
      <li>Both are medium to full buildable coverage, nice texture, long wearing on my mostly normal skin.</li>
      <li>I work out a lot, and this stuck to my skin pretty well without any strips from the sweat.</li>
      <li>And I think samples are always better than the regular one.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Even at the end of a hot day, it&#x27;s hanging in there, but you can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin once it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
      <li>But this Skin 79 BB cream pink feels very natural and has nice fresh scent, not overly scented.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought a sample, I wish it was much better than the other reviews had said, but I&#x27;m glad I only bought a sample, but the shipping was fast</li>
      <li>These trial size bb cream came pretty fast in the mail since the came from Korea.</li>
      <li>light and barely there.</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t use the product much during the summer.  </li>
      <li>: I like this better since the coverage is lighter than the pink one.</li>
      <li>But I really like this BB cream.</li>
      <li>I do not break out as much.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They provided two extra cleanser sample for free.</li>
      <li>I have very persistent acne, though, and it didn&#x27;t really cover it.</li>
      <li>and now i really don&#x27;t have to since this does the job.</li>
      <li>The only gripe i have is that it is bit too light for my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the real deal</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing too.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Neither the pink or gold work for me. The pink makes me grayish and wrinkled beyond my years. The gold gets greasy and breaks me out. It goes on easily.</li>
    <li> I really like it!!! One pack can use for 2 or 3 times. Good cream ever at good price! And I think samples are always better than the regular one.</li>
    <li> This has really good coverage.  It is very concentrated. A little goes a long way. It is very moisturizing too. It is a thick cream. But I really like this BB cream. Thanks!</li>
    <li> They were amazing. I love these BB creams.&lt;br /&gt;I am a girl with lots of acnes. This bb cream can cover everything. It makes my skin perfect.&lt;br /&gt;It even makes my skin better.&lt;br /&gt;Love it. I will definitely purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But are these really 2ml every pac? I feel it less.</li>
    <li> Buy it from Seoul Glamour. It&#x27;s the real deal and it comes super fast. Good pricing too. It has even coverage and matches skin stones when it oxidizes.</li>
    <li> Obviously, can&#x27;t figure which of the two Skin79 bb creams to buy, so when I saw this, i was excited. I actually am nowhere near touching the stack after almost two and a half months cause i tend to use one packet 3 or more times on a regular day where i apply under the eyes, all over the nose, on a big spot on the forehead, on my chin, and a little on the sides of my face. Putting a generous amount all over my face i&#x27;d probably go through it twice and then have some for a normal day. Honestly, I love this product! A little goes a long way! These samples are just what I needed. As for which one I prefer... well, I have sensitive skin in the winter, and combination in the summer. When I tested this product, it was a bit in between. I can definitely see why everyone prefers the hot pink one more, since it&#x27;s shade is a bit more natural to most skin tones, but I feel that honestly, with the shade color-changing within minutes to accommodate your skin tone, I wanna lean more towards the gold one... Which is almost a bit more moisturizing which I found great in the winter, and covered my eyes circles a tiny bit more cause of the original color when applied... Gahh! so hard to choose T.T...</li>
    <li> I just received my package just now when i ordered it 10 days ago! Super fast shipping considering its amazon and they even gave me a free sampling of another bb cream :D I&#x27;m very excited to try out the samples!</li>
    <li> Covers smoothly, feels great. I have very persistent acne, though, and it didn&#x27;t really cover it. Would probably work for milder skin problems.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try Skin79 BB cream, and this was a very good bargain.  Lots of little sample packs!  The shipping was a little high for a small bubble envelope of product, but it arrived very quickly.  Once you complete your order, start checking the mailbox.  The bb cream is so wonderful, I don&#x27;t think I can live without it after this.  It blends into my skin, feels good, looks great, isn&#x27;t greasy or dry, stays put. Even at the end of a hot day, it&#x27;s hanging in there, but you can&#x27;t even feel it on your skin once it&#x27;s been applied. A little goes a long way, so one little sample packet lasts for a few days.  Everything you ever wanted, this is it.  I&#x27;ll be ordering a full size product when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy that it came WEEKS before the expected date. Everything was perfect. The only gripe i have is that it is bit too light for my skin. But i just mixed it with a little bit of a darker foundation to match my tone better. It feels really great. light and barely there. I&#x27;m planning on buying the full bottle when my samples run out. I use the Gold mostly since i have dry skin and will probably try the pink once it gets hot and humid. a really good choice if you don&#x27;t know which one to get. Well worth what i paid for and more.</li>
    <li> These trial size bb cream came pretty fast in the mail since the came from Korea. I don&#x27;t wear foundation or concealer and now i really don&#x27;t have to since this does the job. I love it! These trial sizes also make it worth the money since you end up with 80 grams and I also got two other trail size missha lotion and bb cream!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is a mixture of oily and dryness and also really sensitive. This goes on without irritating anything and all of my face is even! Very good product!</li>
    <li> The packets get messy pretty fast.  I got 2 applications from each packet, but this is my favorite BB cream company.  I have fair skin and the gold can look a little dark on me, but it&#x27;s the perfect consistency, so I bought MAC&#x27;s N1 foundation to mix into it to make it lighter for me.  The Pink packets are lighter than the gold and the perfect shade for my skin.  However, it has a more greasy composition than the gold which makes me look really oily a couple of hours in and I don&#x27;t look good with super oily face.  But you get a great light dewy look upon initial application.  These BB creams spread amazingly well.  BTW, they are silicone based.</li>
    <li> EDIT: I liked how lightweight it felt but it turns out that the BB creams gave me an allergic reaction every time I wore it. I&#x27;d get itchy rashes on my face that later became tiny little pimples (that don&#x27;t surface), especially on my forehead. I have never had that happened to me before since I usually get zits, not these little itchy bumps. I couldn&#x27;t figure it out for a few weeks until I realized that this was the only new product I have on my face. It&#x27;s a good idea I bought the samples instead of the full size products. Now I will give all of my samples to my family and friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that I wanted to try Skin79&#x27;s most popular BB creams, but I wasn&#x27;t sure which version the pink or gold would best fit me, so I bought this sample set. As someone who is in-between light and medium, MAC NC25-30, I actually ended up liking both! Gold oxidizes to a lighter shade than pink - a range between NC15-NC25. On the other hand, pink is more NC25-NC35, IMHO. I have oily/combination skin so both formulas have been fine since it is the winter, but I am interested to see if that changes in the summer. In terms of value, I am so glad I bought a sample set rather than the full size! Each sample can last me an average of 2.5 applications (about 3 x dime-sized amounts), so it is perfectly portable for weekend trips.</li>
    <li> I bought this sample pack thinking I could try both (pink &amp; gold) without having to buy a bigger supply of each.  I tried both of them and they were fine; I liked them.  But it was too much monkeying around with the packaging each time I used it.  One little package wasn&#x27;t enough, so I was opening 2 each time &amp; sometimes 3+.  The product was very good; made my skin look smoother &amp; pale finish blended in quickly.  Dealing with the little packets was inconvenient &amp; time-consuming -- which didn&#x27;t have anything to with the product itself.  Eventually I bought a bigger container.</li>
    <li> I also use Skin79&#x27;s facial cleanser.  I wish Skin79 has darker shades as I get darker during the summer so I don&#x27;t use the product much during the summer.  This is why I&#x27;m glad to use these sample sizes for my daily use as I pretty much use 1 packet per month as a little goes a long way.  When I use this, I use a bit of concealer for problem spot and dab the BB cream all over with blush and go.  The quickest make-up regime I could ask for. My face appears even toned, moisturized, and it has SPF.  They daily use of this has also help improve my own skin.  I do not break out as much.</li>
    <li> Un general is great.... I think is a little oily for muy skin...bit when un a rush is perfect make up to go</li>
    <li> I have been looking a traditional BB creams and had narrowed it down between three products, two of them being in this pack. The sample pack gave me the chance to try these products without a huge investment. I was able to get two applications from each sample.  I started a rotating test by going one pink pack, one gold pack, 2 pink packs, 2 gold packs, 3 pink packs, etc. I am now on 4 gold packs and about half way through the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the two is emerging as the &amp;#34;winner&amp;#34; and what I plan to buy in bottle form once I finish the packets. I am not going to comment the two creams individually as the logic for choosing one over the other is personal and everyone has different preferences from scent, coverage, finished skin tone, finished skin shine/glow etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the VIP Gold and the Hot Pink give coverage that even my skin tone and it is still natural looking. I asked some friends and my sister to check for the make up line on the chin and neck. No one could find it!  I have an issue with dark circles, and while they aren&#x27;t completely erased (I need a concealers for that), they are diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer and I have had a decrease in pimples.  They also don&#x27;t stay around as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product stays on all day.  I usually apply around 7 in the morning and take it off at about 10:00 at night.  I haven&#x27;t sweated in the product or otherwise gotten my face really wet to see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a couple of tries to get the packets open with as little mess as possible and it took me a couple of tries to get the bb cream applied properly and efficiently.  I get the &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; look for about 3-4 minutes and then it looks normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current debate is whether to go ahead and buy the bottle of the one I want and pass the leftover samples to family and friends who are interested in trying BB creams. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that with a half used bottle.</li>
    <li> This sample pack is just perfect!  Each sample is a days worth of product.  Two different choices makes for a fun experiment!</li>
    <li> Have wanted to try this product for a long time, but didn&#x27;t want to commit to a full size bottle.  So happy I found these samples!  It&#x27;s really a great product!&lt;br /&gt;Also super fast delivery.  Ordered on a Thursday and was wearing it on Saturday!&lt;br /&gt;I will be investing in the full size bottle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times, but so far I really like it.  It is VERY thick, more like an old-fashioned sun block with lots of zinc.  It goes on smooth, and blends very well.  I&#x27;ve actually used both the pink and the gold, and they actually both work with my skin, which I find odd.  The gold was a bit lighter, but it really does blend well.  It&#x27;s sure not full coverage, but I didn&#x27;t want a heavy foundation for summer.  It seems to stay on all day, and it&#x27;s light enough that I don&#x27;t feel it.  Overall, I think when these run out, I&#x27;ll be buying a full size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note...it said this would take 6-8 weeks for shipping.  I think it took less than a week to arrive.  WOW!</li>
    <li> This was a great way to sample some Korean BB cream. These bb creams are good if you are fair to light.  I am a MAC NC 25. If you are any darker than that, this is not for you. When you first apply, it appears a bit grey but oxides in about 10 minutes to a more natural shade. They are as neutral as it gets. I have a slight yellow peach undertone. These blend fairly well but not perfect. Probably better if you are a cool undertone. I prefer the pink as the gold seems a little bit more pale on me.  Both are medium to full buildable coverage, nice texture, long wearing on my mostly normal skin. One warning though, your face my be a bit too white in flash photos because of the foundation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought a sample, I wish it was much better than the other reviews had said, but I&#x27;m glad I only bought a sample, but the shipping was fast</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Received the order within days.&lt;br /&gt;2. Small sample lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;3. They provided two extra cleanser sample for free. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;4. I liked the product. So far it sticks to my skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;- Pink: It&#x27;s creamier than the gold. At first, it makes you look really pale (I have the Asian yellowy skin tone; oily/combination), but it then blends in over time...May not use it during the summer time since I like to go darker. However, it can make you look a little shiny over time since it moisturizes your skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Gold: I like this better since the coverage is lighter than the pink one. I work out a lot, and this stuck to my skin pretty well without any strips from the sweat. Still makes you look super pale though. I had to blend this with a darker tone powder to make my skin look flawlessly natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. makes you look pale unless you&#x27;re going for that look. It&#x27;s ok during winter time, but when summer comes I might not recommend this shade.&lt;br /&gt;2. for oily/combination skin, you&#x27;d have to re-apply powder to prevent shininess on your face. I had to apply every two hours.</li>
    <li> The packaging for the product was unbelievably beautiful. It actually makes me wistful of the time I spent in Asia. It actually makes me sad inside.</li>
    <li> These samples for skin 79 gold and pink are just awesome. The pink and the gold are identically in color to me,the main difference I notice is that the gold is a bit thicker and heavier than the pink. They go on like silk for a beautiful, smooth, finish. On a scale of 1-5 for coverage, I would give the pink a 2 and the gold a 3. That in mind once you put this product on your skin, it is addictive, you love it and must have it on your skin always!</li>
    <li> I have oily and somewhat sensitive skin. Other BB cream I have tried, from well known brands, still irritate my face. But this Skin 79 BB cream pink feels very natural and has nice fresh scent, not overly scented. Very nice.</li>
    <li> Not really good for my sensitive skin. The allergic reaction did not come immediately, it started a few days after I had been using the product. And it was mostly around my lips. It took me a few quit-and-try-again to be sure this was the culprit.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sample set after hearing raves about Skin 79 BB cream from my friends. I couldn&#x27;t decide if the Pink or Gold would be better for my skin so this was a great option. I really liked both but ultimately decided on getting the full size of the gold. These individual samples were awesome. Great for traveling and I was able to get two uses out of each packet so the samples lasted me for months. I have very sensitive skin and have a tendency to break out but I had no issue at all with this cream. I definitely recommend giving it a try. My complexion has never looked better and it&#x27;s really nice just to be able to put some of this cream on with a little blush and lip gloss and have a nice laid back look.</li>
    <li> I bought this 40 of these samples, 2 grams each. I felt that each package didn&#x27;t have two grams, so I did a little experiment. I put 20 into a 15 grams container and it didn&#x27;t even fill up halfway!! So, I spent twenty dollars on less than fifteen grams of bb cream. Also, I emailed the seller explaining my dilemma, and he/she replied, saying the product comes directly from the manufacturer, so they cannot change the product. This product is not worth the money, and having a lie to advertise is not right.</li>
    <li> I heard rave reviews about BB cream online, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have \\&quot;mature\\&quot; skin (age ain&#x27;t nuthin&#x27; but a number!) and was sick of the heavy foundations that look like you&#x27;re wearing it, so thought it worth trying.  It&#x27;s pretty impressive stuff, and a great price!  It somehow adjusts to your natural skin tone, and evens it out, while looking like it&#x27;s not even there.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I knew I wanted the Pink BB Cream, and sample size is perfect for travel! I also ended up trying the Gold samples and really love it as well! The shipping didn&#x27;t take more than a couple weeks, and I also got 2 more samples from other BB creams from this line. Now I know I don&#x27;t like the Orange Triple BB Cream, and will be sticking with the Pink Triple BB Cream!</li>
    <li> I like both pink &amp; gold.  They are both great products.  I wear them alone and for extra coverage underneath my foundation.  I love these!</li>
