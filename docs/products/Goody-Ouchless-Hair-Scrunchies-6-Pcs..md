      <li>great price.you get exactly what you order</li>
      <li>These are durable and retain their shape after many uses.  </li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>the girls are love it</li>
      <li>I bought these for the satin scrunchies, thinking they&#x27;d be better on my hair when I&#x27;m bumming around.</li>
      <li>They are OK, kinda skimpy but do the job.  </li>
      <li>These are my absolute favorite and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere - so happy</li>
      <li>These are ok -</li>
      <li>Also the seam comes apart fairly easily, so you have to re-sew or re buy.</li>
      <li>but these are fine</li>
      <li>I have fairly fine hair and these are just the right size.  </li>
      <li>; Goody Gentle Scrunchies Earth Elements&amp;#34; more.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re super not-stretchy</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I love them and highly recommend too.</li>
      <li>I use these to secure my sleep braids, and my husband uses them for his ponytails, very gentle and not too scrunchie-y if you&#x27;re not into that 80s/90s look</li>
      <li>Very pretty and don&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I hoped it would be!</li>
      <li>Nice but only three are satin, rest are cotton</li>
      <li>I bought mine elsewhere, that being said, I use the SATIN ones at bedtime to protect my curls by doing a high &amp;#34;pineapple&amp;#34;, as I have swavy/curly, type 2C fine hair.</li>
      <li>Hoping they come out with a more colorful variety in the future!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Really nice, lost one star for slipping off hair.  </li>
      <li>These are ok, they are MUCH smaller than they look like in the picture.</li>
      <li>And take out your hair So with satin or silk the material is so soft and smooth that your hair will not rub nor you have to worry about losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in phoenix where it is very hot, and I often use these to put my hair up.</li>
      <li>Small, material on chaper side not as good as the velvet ones.</li>
      <li>my wife use it daily; easy to use ; durable</li>
      <li>I twist them around three times and they hold very well.  </li>
      <li>The advertisement is very deceitful for this.</li>
      <li>Just wish they were slightly larger as they wrap twice nicely, but the third wrap feels like it might break.  </li>
      <li>These are nice, but just like a past reviewer said, please keep in mind that not all of them are satin.  </li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t buy this particular one again.</li>
      <li>I search all over for these and they are becoming more difficult to find.  </li>
      <li>Just what I ordered, but I thought the quality was a little cheap.  </li>
      <li>Love these little scrunchies (which are now back in style, yay!).  </li>
      <li>I have relaxed hair and try to be as gentle as possible with it.  </li>
      <li>But so far they work well</li>
      <li>I do recommend to all women with natural, Relax or textlax hair.</li>
      <li>Nice colors, but too thin in fabric.  </li>
      <li>I was also really hoping that I could use these to avoid the dreaded hair elastic-crimp that happens after wearing one for too long, but nope these do it, too.</li>
      <li>I had expected Goody to be a little better quality</li>
      <li>Material is better and if you have long hair it&#x27; won&#x27;t pull as hard.</li>
      <li>I usually use 2 scrunchies to make a cool color combination.</li>
      <li>I really needed black and some neutral colors also.  </li>

<li> I usually use 2 scrunchies to make a cool color combination.</li>

<li> I probably wouldnt have spent this amount of money for only 3 satin scrunchies.</li>
<li> My husband and I both have long hair.  </li>
<li> holds my long hair without falling out.</li>
<li> I prefer the satin ones; you get 3 satin and the other 3 are regular material.  </li>
<li> , mine&#x27;s just very long (to my tailbone)</li>
<li> Two wraps are just a little loose on my hair which is about to my mid back</li>
<li> My hair is to my hips and takes forever to dry.</li>
<li> But I knew what I was getting and appreciate the 3, which were at a great price as I&#x27;ve seen others at outrageous prices.  </li>
<li> and so we both try to be careful with our manes.  </li>
<li> It wasn&#x27;t the big fluffy satin scrunchies that I purchased before.  </li>
<li> The other 3 are cotton and the advertisement does not say this.</li>
<li> I like the satin material but, as other reviewers said, wish all were of that material instead of half and half, since it is advertised as &amp;#34;satin hair scrunchies&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> but I thought they would be a little thicker.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, they disintegrated after only a few wearings.</li>
<li> These do the trick without pulling out excessive hair or drying out my hair.</li>
<li> Not sure, but probably all satin would slip.</li>
<li> They are too small, I imagined looser scrunchies.</li>
<li> When I&#x27;ve tried using the cotton once, in the morning I wake up to find an ugly indentation mark around my curls which is not a good look if you ask me ;)</li>
<li> When you are going natural are already natural, you know that cotton is your worst enemy your hair will rub on your clothes or hat and pillow.</li>
<li> too small, not for medium or thick hair.</li>
<li> I have a thick hair</li>
<li> I have thick hair and these seem to have been made for a child.</li>
<li> My hair isn&#x27;t very thick and these wouldn&#x27;t began to hold my hair.</li>
<li> Ugh, these are crap.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are ok, they are MUCH smaller than they look like in the picture. About 1/4 the size of a regular scrunchie.</li>
    <li> Love these little scrunchies (which are now back in style, yay!).  I have fairly fine hair and these are just the right size.  I twist them around three times and they hold very well.  I really needed black and some neutral colors also.  Hoping they come out with a more colorful variety in the future!</li>
    <li> These are ok - I had expected Goody to be a little better quality but these are fine</li>
    <li> Good product but I thought they would be a little thicker.  But so far they work well</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipped quickly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but too thin in fabric.  I like the&amp;#34; Goody Gentle Scrunchies Earth Elements&amp;#34; more.  Won&#x27;t buy this particular one again.</li>
    <li> Ugh, these are crap. They&#x27;re super not-stretchy — I have to just put mine in my hair without even tightening it once, and it lasts all night that way with me tossing and turning! I was also really hoping that I could use these to avoid the dreaded hair elastic-crimp that happens after wearing one for too long, but nope these do it, too. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend and won&#x27;t be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> I bought these for the satin scrunchies, thinking they&#x27;d be better on my hair when I&#x27;m bumming around. Unfortunately, they disintegrated after only a few wearings. Boooo!!</li>
    <li> I search all over for these and they are becoming more difficult to find.  I have relaxed hair and try to be as gentle as possible with it.  These do the trick without pulling out excessive hair or drying out my hair.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I hoped it would be!</li>
    <li> Bought these because I did not want to wear a Satin bonnet. They hold my hair without coming off while sleeping, but you only get 3 satin ones. Also the seam comes apart fairly easily, so you have to re-sew or re buy.</li>
    <li> my wife use it daily; easy to use ; durable</li>
    <li> Love them. Very pretty and don&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and these seem to have been made for a child.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered, but I thought the quality was a little cheap.  It wasn&#x27;t the big fluffy satin scrunchies that I purchased before.  But they do the trick for the price....</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the satin scrunchies. I wear them to bed to keep my hair from tangling and they&#x27;re great! I wish they sold a pack of just satin ones.</li>
    <li> These are nice, but just like a past reviewer said, please keep in mind that not all of them are satin.  I prefer the satin ones; you get 3 satin and the other 3 are regular material.  However, they are all nice.</li>
    <li> My hair is to my hips and takes forever to dry. Therefore I use my scrunched to help me when I want went hair off my skin and when working out or doing daily chore around the house.</li>
    <li> When you are going natural are already natural, you know that cotton is your worst enemy your hair will rub on your clothes or hat and pillow. And take out your hair So with satin or silk the material is so soft and smooth that your hair will not rub nor you have to worry about losing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do recommend to all women with natural, Relax or textlax hair.</li>
    <li> great price.you get exactly what you order</li>
    <li> Would not buy them again.  They are too small, I imagined looser scrunchies.</li>
    <li> Just wish they were slightly larger as they wrap twice nicely, but the third wrap feels like it might break.  Two wraps are just a little loose on my hair which is about to my mid back and I have quite alot of it.</li>
    <li> holds my long hair without falling out. thought they&#x27;d be bigger though.</li>
    <li> nicely made scrunchies. I live in phoenix where it is very hot, and I often use these to put my hair up. very easy to use, makes the heat more bearable.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both have long hair.  His is bleached and thus fragile, mine&#x27;s just very long (to my tailbone) and so we both try to be careful with our manes.  I use these to secure my sleep braids, and my husband uses them for his ponytails, very gentle and not too scrunchie-y if you&#x27;re not into that 80s/90s look</li>
    <li> Good quality merchandise, great shipping time.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The advertisement is very deceitful for this. It should be in the product description. That only 3 satin scrunchies are includes. The other 3 are cotton and the advertisement does not say this. I probably wouldnt have spent this amount of money for only 3 satin scrunchies.</li>
    <li> I like the satin material but, as other reviewers said, wish all were of that material instead of half and half, since it is advertised as &amp;#34;satin hair scrunchies&amp;#34;.  But I knew what I was getting and appreciate the 3, which were at a great price as I&#x27;ve seen others at outrageous prices.  I also like the neutral colors.</li>
    <li> They are OK, kinda skimpy but do the job.  The colors are nice</li>
    <li> These are a joke! For kids! Cheaper in the store. My hair isn&#x27;t very thick and these wouldn&#x27;t began to hold my hair.</li>
    <li> Only 3 of the 6 are actually satin</li>
    <li> These are my absolute favorite and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere - so happy I found them on Amazon!!!  I wear and use them daily.</li>
    <li> too small, not for medium or thick hair.</li>
    <li> Nice but only three are satin, rest are cotton</li>
    <li> the girls are love it</li>
    <li> Good quality. Great colors!</li>
    <li> Really nice, lost one star for slipping off hair.  Not sure, but probably all satin would slip.</li>
    <li> Goody scrunchies are awesome. I have a thick hair so they work well for me. I usually use 2 scrunchies to make a cool color combination.</li>
    <li> I bought mine elsewhere, that being said, I use the SATIN ones at bedtime to protect my curls by doing a high &amp;#34;pineapple&amp;#34;, as I have swavy/curly, type 2C fine hair. I then place a satin bonnet over the pineapple and in the morning my curls are perfectly intact.  When I&#x27;ve tried using the cotton once, in the morning I wake up to find an ugly indentation mark around my curls which is not a good look if you ask me ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer that all six scrunchies were satin as I have no use for the cotton ones...</li>
    <li> Small, material on chaper side not as good as the velvet ones. If you have shoulder length hair forget it.I would stick to Scunci Effortless Beauty Velour Comfy Twister, 3-Count. Material is better and if you have long hair it&#x27; won&#x27;t pull as hard.</li>
    <li> These are durable and retain their shape after many uses.  Elasticity is great!  This is my second time around with the hairbands.  I love them and highly recommend too.</li>
