### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful smell.</li>
      <li>This is great stuff!!!</li>
      <li>A wonderful scent,  lots of suds,  non-drying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great shower and bath soap.</li>
      <li>Just not as pleasant of an experience.</li>
      <li>Its a good product, smells great and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This was good news because it smells more like pine trees than ocean mist.</li>
      <li>Smells nice too.</li>
      <li>This (ocean mist) will be a nice summer bath gel fragrance for me.</li>
      <li>I liked it alright, but it&#x27;s a tad more drying than the moisturizing one.</li>
      <li>Although I love the fragrance</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite body wash.</li>
      <li>Love the way it smells and the way your skin feels.</li>
      <li>What more could you ask for.  </li>
      <li>Lovely.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>This looks great sitting on the tub ledge, and is stable enough to not need constant picking up from the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plunger is awesome.</li>
      <li>Gentle but superior cleansing.</li>
      <li>This has a nice fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>good news it was delivered fast .</li>
      <li>- this line from Neutragena wins many features I didn&#x27;t realize needed</li>
      <li>It seems to be the exact opposite of the full bodied amber-colored rainbath shower &amp; gel,&lt;br /&gt;which has a wonderful musky sandalwood fragrance that lingers on the skin.</li>
      <li>Available in costco for 17$.</li>
      <li>The translucent, light color add to the freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the presentation.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling clean and the fragrance is very fresh and light.</li>
      <li>Light, clean, non creamy, fresh feel.</li>
      <li>The scent is light and pleasant but not at all what i expected.</li>
      <li>but I remember using it off and on many, many years ago and will continue to do so as long as it is on the market.</li>
      <li>Great product, a little pricy.</li>
      <li>It smells good, but it made me itch after the first use--skin feels very dry and prickly.  </li>
      <li>and I get just the right amount of gel on a scrub.</li>
      <li>Love these gels; they never dry you out.</li>
      <li>it is rich moisture two different products.</li>
      <li>The second Time I noticed the box was labeled incorrect as ocean mist the front of the  box says rich moisture not ocean</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how old that product is</li>
      <li>Product still performs it&#x27;s main function.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After having used the different fragrances in this series - and comparing to the long list and many years of use of products from Bath &amp; Body Works, Ace, Old Spice, Suave, Dove, and such</li>
      <li>I liked the bottle and plunger so much, once the first bottle was over, I cleaned it out and poured half empty bottles of other shower gels into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>No struggling to fit shower gel on the little track hanging from the shower pipe.</li>

<li> believe I&#x27;m writing a long review for a shower gel, but there you go, a product I can thoroughly recommend.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s cleansing power, it does not moisten my dry winter skin as I thought it would so &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; was a bit misleading.  </li>
<li> Big, stable, transparent bottle with a big heavy duty plumber.</li>
<li> The color was darker blue than what I purchased previously at a store.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> No turning bottles over and waiting for the product to trickle down.</li>
<li> Leaves very little residue in the shower also.</li>
<li> We have very hard water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was what I wanted.</li>
    <li> cheapest I could find</li>
    <li> This is a great shower and bath soap. I will keep buying.</li>
    <li> This is not ocean mist it is rich moisture two different products. I ordered it twice thinking ther was a mistake . The second Time I noticed the box was labeled incorrect as ocean mist the front of the  box says rich moisture not ocean mist.&lt;br /&gt;The good news it was delivered fast .</li>
    <li> Love the way it smells and the way your skin feels.</li>
    <li> The color was darker blue than what I purchased previously at a store. The fragrance was a hint of the same scent but it was not as pronounced. This was good news because it smells more like pine trees than ocean mist. Product still performs it&#x27;s main function. Just not as pleasant of an experience. Perhaps it was stored incorrectly..</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell. Leaves very little residue in the shower also. We have very hard water.</li>
    <li> I liked it alright, but it&#x27;s a tad more drying than the moisturizing one. I&#x27;ll not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but it made me itch after the first use--skin feels very dry and prickly.  I simply can&#x27;t use -- will have to throw it out.</li>
    <li> This (ocean mist) will be a nice summer bath gel fragrance for me. The scent is light and pleasant but not at all what i expected. It seems to be the exact opposite of the full bodied amber-colored rainbath shower &amp; gel,&lt;br /&gt;which has a wonderful musky sandalwood fragrance that lingers on the skin. I don&#x27;t know exactly how old that product is but I remember using it off and on many, many years ago and will continue to do so as long as it is on the market.</li>
    <li> ...my friend says she loves it...</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR WINTER SKIN</li>
    <li> This has a nice fresh smell.  Because I have a shelf in my shower, I did not have to put it in smaller containers.</li>
    <li> Neutragena has perfected the body wash with their Rainbath line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used the different fragrances in this series - and comparing to the long list and many years of use of products from Bath &amp; Body Works, Ace, Old Spice, Suave, Dove, and such - this line from Neutragena wins many features I didn&#x27;t realize needed an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product. Light, clean, non creamy, fresh feel. Lovely. The translucent, light color add to the freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the presentation. Big, stable, transparent bottle with a big heavy duty plumber. No turning bottles over and waiting for the product to trickle down. No guessing how much is left. No struggling to fit shower gel on the little track hanging from the shower pipe. This looks great sitting on the tub ledge, and is stable enough to not need constant picking up from the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plunger is awesome. One plunge and I get just the right amount of gel on a scrub. I liked the bottle and plunger so much, once the first bottle was over, I cleaned it out and poured half empty bottles of other shower gels into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a long review for a shower gel, but there you go, a product I can thoroughly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!!! A little bit goes a long way.  Gentle but superior cleansing. Smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Love these gels; they never dry you out.</li>
    <li> I use the regular Neutrogena and decided to try this during the winter months.  Although I love the fragrance and it&#x27;s cleansing power, it does not moisten my dry winter skin as I thought it would so &amp;#34;replenishing&amp;#34; was a bit misleading.  If you are looking for moisturizing power, skip this one.</li>
    <li> Great product, a little pricy.</li>
    <li> Its a good product, smells great and refreshing. Available in costco for 17$.</li>
    <li> A wonderful scent,  lots of suds,  non-drying. What more could you ask for.  My husband&#x27;s favorite body wash.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Leaves skin feeling clean and the fragrance is very fresh and light.</li>
