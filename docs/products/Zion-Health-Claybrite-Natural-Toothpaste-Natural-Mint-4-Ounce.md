<li> * - Mouth feels \\&quot;minty fresh\\&quot; after brushing - something that&#x27;s been hard for me to find/achieve w/natural brands.&lt;br /</li>
<li> This cleans and polishes my teeth without all the crazy foam of regular toothpastes.  </li>
<li> but they either lather up too much and get too much &#x27;foam&#x27; in my mouth, taste horrible, are gritty, or leave a horrible after-taste.  </li>
<li> My gums are now a deep red color and somewhat puffy, and in the morning I wake up with this nasty beaver-breath taste in my mouth.  </li>
<li> I just feel horrible every-time I use their product because I am indirectly supporting the admitted market deception.  </li>
<li> * - The tube is very poorly designed and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get all of the product out of the tube.  </li>
<li> I find that I don&#x27;t wake up with any bad taste in my mouth after using it at night.</li>
<li> I was shocked and in horror!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was recommended this toothpaste by my dental hygienist. I enjoy brushing my teeth with it because it leaves my mouth feeling very clean and I like the taste. I find that I don&#x27;t wake up with any bad taste in my mouth after using it at night. Don&#x27;t let the brown color throw you off, it actually whitens your teeth!  I also like that it does not contain fluoride. Wonderful product!</li>
    <li> GREAT VALUE VERY REFRESHING AND ALL NATURAL</li>
    <li> This cleans and polishes my teeth without all the crazy foam of regular toothpastes.  My teeth also seem to be a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> I was having some trouble with my gums being sensitive and bleeding. After using this toothpaste for about three weeks, they were a LOT better. They say the clay in this toothpaste absorbs the bad bacteria in the mouth, and I think they&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m reordering today. I just wish this was an Amazon Prime item so I could have free shipping!</li>
    <li> Aside from the poop-like, gritty texture that remains for hours, ClayBrite burned my mouth.  My mouth didn&#x27;t feel clean - it felt gritty and burned.  It also uses a synthetic surfactants - Sodium Cocoyl Glutamate and Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate.  These are not true soaps, so they rely on synthetic surfactants to create foam.  Customer service at ZionHealth ignored my concerns.  BEWARE!  Burt Bees used to have a clay toothpaste, but they replaced it with a synthetic toothpaste.  I&#x27;m still searching for a toothpaste...</li>
    <li> First time I opened ZionHealth&#x27;s ClayBrite Natural Toothpaste I was astonished to find the tube about 50% \\&quot;inflated\\&quot; with air!  I called ZionHealth regarding the deception they use to market their product.  I was told that their marketing consultant told them to use a larger tube than needed and to blow it up with air.  They were very nice, AND very honest, which is rare these days.  BUT, they admit the deception.  They have a wonderful product, IMO.  I just feel horrible every-time I use their product because I am indirectly supporting the admitted market deception.  Try it...let all the air out of their tube and you see the tube becomes half the original size.  Go to the store and look at all of ClayBrite&#x27;s other tubes, everyone is inflated to maximum capacity!  Most other brands give 4 to 6 ounces of toothpaste, and charge less, BUT also use approximately the same size tube!  So, I give just 2-stars...in the interest of promoting corporate integrity.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this toothpaste.  I like that its fluoride free too.  I get this for my 3 kids so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them swallowing it. (or my 1 year old eating it!) It has a very strong spearmint taste to it and it leaves your breath smelling great and your teeth feeling squeaky clean!  My oldest (age 5) had his first dentist visit and the dentist told me, \\&quot;He is a cavity free kid!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:: my boys are now 6, 8, and 10 and never had a single cavity. Of course, I&#x27;m bragging just a little bit. ;)</li>
    <li> Love it! Definitely recommend you try. Great taste and has helped my gums a lot. For those who think tooth paste is white, dare to think different.</li>
    <li> Best natural toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  My new toothpaste brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* - Definitely whitens teeth, I could tell after only three uses!&lt;br /&gt;* - Wasn&#x27;t gritty.&lt;br /&gt;* - Fluoride free.&lt;br /&gt;* - Mouth feels \\&quot;minty fresh\\&quot; after brushing - something that&#x27;s been hard for me to find/achieve w/natural brands.&lt;br /&gt;* - Rinses from sink like any other toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;* - Pleasant earth color (looks like melted chocolate... okay, this could be a con for some, my friend says it looks like poop lol).&lt;br /&gt;* - It&#x27;s not &#x27;foamy&#x27; like some other natural toothpastes, but it does give a nice lather that is &#x27;just right&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* - The price.  It&#x27;s a lot for toothpaste, but it is pretty comparable to other natural toothpastes.  I just wish it cost less.&lt;br /&gt;* - The tube is very poorly designed and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get all of the product out of the tube.  For a product that costs so much, this is really unacceptible.&lt;br /&gt;* - I wish it were sold locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommnended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/15/2011&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this toothpaste, I have gotten two comments from two different people on how white my teeth are, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/8/2012&lt;br /&gt;Still using this toothpaste.  Still loving it!  Have tried other brands but they either lather up too much and get too much &#x27;foam&#x27; in my mouth, taste horrible, are gritty, or leave a horrible after-taste.  I really like this toothpaste!!  Plus my last dental check-up showed that my receding gums are not receding as much as they were!  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s this toothpaste alone though.  I also take Calcium daily in liquid form and I do Oil Pulling every morning.  I think the Oil Pulling helps the receding gums more than anything, but since I can&#x27;t &#x27;prove&#x27; which helps it I thought I would share my entire Regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/7/2012&lt;br /&gt;Wow.  It didn&#x27;t take long.  I ran out of the toothpaste.  I went to a dentist to get mercury removed from my teeth and found out Ihave the beginning of periodontal disease.  They did a test on my gums and nearly every gum was bleeding and receding.  I was shocked and in horror!!  I now again brush with clay, but this time I brush with a product called Living Clay [[ASIN:1887879048 Living Clay Nature&#x27;s Own Miracle Cure]] tells about it.  I just use the clay, not a toothpaste.  And I use [[ASIN:B004GW0WJM Desert Essence Natural Refreshing Tea Tree Oil Mouthwash -- 16 fl oz]].  After starting back on this regime, there are only two teeth that bleed when I floss now.  Stubborn.  Still love the toothpaste but it&#x27;s cheaper to use clay and the mouthwash for me.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great.  It whitens your teeth and isn&#x27;t sweet and gagging like other toothpastes.  It keeps my mouth fresh.  My dentist loves it too!  At my last visit, he said that my gums look really good.  I really feel like my teeth are cleaner when I use this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and ordered four tubes.</li>
    <li> But this has been steadily growing on me and my husband.  It has a nice, mild but refreshing flavor.  It is not super foamy like some of the more commercial toothpastes out there, yet, it DOES clean your teeth, feel good to use, taste good and maybe this is pschosomatic (sp?), but our mouths feel healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really counter-intuitive to put a light brown substance in your mouth twice a day but I realized I do the same thing with chocolate... and they use grey abrasive cleaner at the dentist office... so we&#x27;re going to stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have removed 1 star because it&#x27;s hopeless packaging - if it was better packaged/designed, maybe more people would try it for healthier gums.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love that it is all natural and leaves teeth feeling really clean. The taste is an acquired one....But I am used to it now, and won;t go back to commercial toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I like this very much.  I don&#x27;t think it makes my teeth as white as baking soda/peroxide and tom&#x27;s toothpaste, but it is a good toothpaste</li>
    <li> just love this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothpaste.  I struggle with bleeding gums &amp; bad breath and have tried many different products throughout the years.  This stuff has helped the most and I am so glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste makes your teeth feel like glass, the same feeling as when you leave the dentist. My hygienist actually commented at my last cleaning how clean my teeth were! However, one caveat. The formula definitely feels abrasive and leaves a gritty feel in the mouth. I expressed this concern to my dentist and he told me to use only a pea-sized drop at a time to avoid any further wearing down of my enamel.</li>
    <li> A year ago, I walked into a raw, vegan, health food restaurant on Sunset Blvd, in Los Angeles, CA.  My boyfriend ordered something to eat and I sat and ate nothing...in protest.  Afterwards, we browsed the take home health food items.  I spotted a tube of ClayBrite Natural Toothpaste.  My supply at home was running out, so I purchased it.  I had no expectations.  It was just toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, I looked at my gums.  They were all pink and healthy.  Wow!  For someone who has had major dental work due to lack of preventative care, this was miraculous.  I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste ever since.  With the exception of the teeth that were worked on by the dentist, my teeth have been restored to a healthy status.  (If only the dental work would respond as well...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done some research on the clay ingredient.  I purchased a bucket of montmorillonite clay.  I use this too, alternative brushing my teeth with the ClayBrite and with the pure montmorillonite clay (in part to save money--i&#x27;m a poor college student).  I am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this toothpaste to anyone who wants healthy teeth and gums.  I also recommend obtaining some of the main ingredient, montmorillonite clay.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item out of curiosity and have used it for about two weeks now.  My gums are now a deep red color and somewhat puffy, and in the morning I wake up with this nasty beaver-breath taste in my mouth.  I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s from all the sweeteners and other nonsense in the formula giving bacteria a party at night.  Discontinuing the product and returning to my old natural toothpaste.  Three stars just because I appreciate the attempt at marketing a healthy product.</li>
    <li> Really makes my mouth and gums feel great.</li>
    <li> Great product! Makes teeth brite, white, and feels very clean. After two uses my gums looked healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should try it.</li>
</ol>
