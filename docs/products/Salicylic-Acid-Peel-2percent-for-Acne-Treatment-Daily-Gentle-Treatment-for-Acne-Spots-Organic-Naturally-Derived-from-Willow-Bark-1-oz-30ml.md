      <li>Dries out pimples wonderfully.</li>
      <li>My skin looks perfect all the time now - NO PEELING and no detrimental effects from antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Perfect for acne, hyperpigmentation and premature aging, unclogs and reduce appearance of pores.</li>
      <li>This perfectly controls my oily skin without drying me out.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to happy skin!</li>
      <li>But honestly this product has been the best thing I have ever tried for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just used it once and felt great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product and will continue to buy this</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>and I can very happily say my problem areas are smooth and more supple - all with no visible peeling or flaking skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased at punch!</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and glowing and the hyperpigmention has improved a great deal.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so amazing</li>
      <li>At night, I use Moroccan Rasshoul Clay as a mask for about 15 minutes, then I wash it off with warm water and follow with the Salicylic Acid peel (I apply with a cotton pad/ball)</li>
      <li>It works especially good on new spots that are just forming.</li>
      <li>Until I got a couple professional acid peels that worked awesome for my acne.  </li>
      <li>Trust me you will love this product and will come to buy it again.</li>
      <li>This product works better then the $80 salicylic acid that I bought from my dermatologist.</li>
      <li>and it works its magic.</li>
      <li>and I thought nothing more of it.</li>
      <li>so glad I gave this one a try -</li>
      <li>I am a 68 year old grandmother with fair hair and fair skin.  </li>
      <li>However, all three products worked for me and worked better than I</li>
      <li>and I must say I am VERY impressed because not only did it remove my acne problem but opened all my pores and stopped any blackheads from forming on my nose too!.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a toner.</li>
      <li>I asked him if he would like me to buy more cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, including minocycline, differin, and many products with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worked like a miracle - results are just as good as the minocycline and the professional chemical peels, but without the cost and recovery time.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face every morning with a mild oil free organic face wash (I use the Lerosett face wash), then I follow with Vitamin C/E &amp; Hyaluronic acid drops.</li>
      <li>That is super cheap to get rid of my acne and blackheads, not to mention making my face smoother and softer.</li>
      <li>have something special here.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, it&#x27;s been many years since my skin would break out, but I now have had to deal with older skin that does not shed as quickly or efficiently as it used to  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the company sent me a free bottle since I told them the first bottle i purchased</li>
      <li>Very fast shipment!</li>
      <li>It smoothens your face in that first wash!</li>
      <li>products is well worth it, along with quality skin nourishment to follow this, and a healthy diet, you will be on your way to clear skin!</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;You honestly that SAME day will see results.</li>
      <li>first I was super nervous to try it on my face.</li>
      <li>Now when I wash my face in the morning I feel like the water gets much deeper into my skin to clean.</li>
      <li>What I did was to use the Rose Glow Cleanser first, then this peel and last of all the moisturizing cream.</li>
      <li>She saw some improvement on the first day and her acne was gone in three or four days.</li>
      <li>and I can truly say i love the way my skin is starting to look like and feel like.</li>
      <li>I am pleased and will buy another bottle when my supply gets low.  </li>
      <li>but then your able to peel it and the color is back to reg after you peel it.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re face feels super soft and looks smoother!!</li>
      <li>and I have been trying every single natural product out there to improve my adult acne ridden skin, and by far this has been the absolute best!</li>
      <li>It does not burn my skin, though at times when my skin is extra sensitive it will tingle slightly, I kind of like the tingle.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t like to write a really good review because they sound to start fake lol.</li>
      <li>When we first got this, my son absolutely refused to use it.</li>
      <li>But let me tell you, you can have the best products in the world, they will not work if you do not eat a whole foods plant based diet, get at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, and drink lots of water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to squeeze those white heads after it.</li>
      <li>, I leave the peel on for about 5 minutes and then gently rinse it with cool water, pat dry my face with paper or a clean towel and follow with the Vitamin C/Hyaluronic Acid drops.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is I want more! :)</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>He wants this peel.</li>
      <li>Used up the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for.</li>
      <li>My skin has improved so much.  </li>
      <li>After a full month of using this daily, when my cycle started, I didn&#x27;t have one breakout.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using every night for one week and my skin looks noticeably better - less redness, a couple of breakout spots cleared up and no oily t zone by mid-day.  </li>
      <li>I love this, I use this as a spot treatment, I use it for like two to three days back to back</li>
      <li>and I know that within the next week it should be completely spot free.</li>
      <li>It clears my acne quickly and helps keep my skin very clear, I would recommend highly to anyone who has moderate to severe acne</li>
      <li>have fair, sensitive skin, so started off only using this a few times/week.  </li>
      <li>This worked to smooth out my face as I have very dry and sandpapery type of skin!</li>
      <li>I really like this Salicylic Acid 2% Daily Gentle Peel and Refresh</li>
      <li>I have combination skin with an &#x27;I&#x27; zone (as opposed to a &#x27;T&#x27; zone), so I pretty much use it all over my face, except my cheeks (which will dry out if I use it there).  </li>
      <li>I love the name, the logo, the packaging and the fact that there are so few ingredients!</li>
      <li>My face has become a lot less oily and smooth.</li>
      <li>I find the $14.75 price tag as very cheap and especially down from like $70</li>
      <li>It turns out that&#x27;s what he&#x27;d been using when his skin was so clear</li>
      <li>Now on my face, my skin is SOFT and does not feel like sandpaper</li>
      <li>This has been a life saver for my adult acne.  </li>
      <li>Just gentle enough for your face, it hepls a lot with my acne</li>
      <li>The only thing that worked before this was minocycline, but I couldn&#x27;t continue to take antibiotics forever and as soon as I stopped taking it, my acne came right back.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle but with just a dab in the evenings, the bottle will last a long time with amazing results.</li>
      <li>So far, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for those lines when I smile or the creases that are now forming above my upper lip; but I hope something may happen with long term, continued use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 42 years old a still struggle with spots of adult acne and occasional cystic acne along my jawline.  </li>
      <li>I finally found a skin peel I can use frequently.</li>
      <li>I tested out a few  topical treatments but none have come close to offer quick and visible results that</li>
      <li>I was pretty hesitant about trying something with only 2% active ingredient, but the satisfaction guarantee helped me decide to try this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m optimistic and I&#x27;m planning to purchase a couple of other Refresh products because I really like this</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super super gentle to your face, don&#x27;t get me wrong it does sting a little</li>
      <li>Many are too irritating and leave my skin blotchy, red and flaking.  </li>
      <li>Luckily this product seems to work well to clear up breakouts and reduce oiliness without irritating my skin.  </li>

<li> then i stop and two days later i can kinda peel the skin off, the spot turns a little dark</li>

<li> She said it burned a little, but not much.</li>
<li> I was not sure if any of these would work on my very dry skin that is as rough as sandpaper (even on my face).</li>
<li> She used some of the expensive products, some worked, others, not so much.</li>
<li> but then it cools down</li>
<li> I do feel that my skin is less oily.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Acne is a constant concern for me. I tested out a few  topical treatments but none have come close to offer quick and visible results that this product. It&#x27;s an easy-to-use, one-step acne treatment pad that reduces acne breakouts and promotes clearer skin. Perfect for acne, hyperpigmentation and premature aging, unclogs and reduce appearance of pores. It&#x27;s a small bottle but with just a dab in the evenings, the bottle will last a long time with amazing results.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and I have been trying every single natural product out there to improve my adult acne ridden skin, and by far this has been the absolute best! It does not burn my skin, though at times when my skin is extra sensitive it will tingle slightly, I kind of like the tingle. It is not the deal breaker or single cure, of course, nothing is. And even though everyone is different, I will  tell you what routine is working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face every morning with a mild oil free organic face wash (I use the Lerosett face wash), then I follow with Vitamin C/E &amp; Hyaluronic acid drops. At night, I use Moroccan Rasshoul Clay as a mask for about 15 minutes, then I wash it off with warm water and follow with the Salicylic Acid peel (I apply with a cotton pad/ball), I leave the peel on for about 5 minutes and then gently rinse it with cool water, pat dry my face with paper or a clean towel and follow with the Vitamin C/Hyaluronic Acid drops. Do not apply near your eyes, and be careful around your lips, it will overdry it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This routine has worked wonders for me! But let me tell you, you can have the best products in the world, they will not work if you do not eat a whole foods plant based diet, get at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep, and drink lots of water. Starches, sugars, and dairy happen to be my triggers. I&#x27;ve reduced my grain intake to sprouted breads and and soaked brown rice, and these seem to work well for me. Pizza is the ultimate acne magnet for me! After the holidays I had a setback and now I am working on getting back to improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This products is well worth it, along with quality skin nourishment to follow this, and a healthy diet, you will be on your way to clear skin! My only complaint is I want more! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipment! I just used it once and felt great. It&#x27;s easy to squeeze those white heads after it. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this product.  I was on the hunt for a BHA product that I could use to help with my hormonal breakouts and hyperpigmentation.  I am on my 2nd bottle and I know that this is something that I will continue to buy and use in the future.  My skin has improved so much.  After a full month of using this daily, when my cycle started, I didn&#x27;t have one breakout.  My skin is smooth and glowing and the hyperpigmention has improved a great deal.  I&#x27;m pleased at punch!</li>
    <li> This product works better then the $80 salicylic acid that I bought from my dermatologist. It clears my acne quickly and helps keep my skin very clear, I would recommend highly to anyone who has moderate to severe acne and I will continue to buy this product because I do NOT want to ever be without it!</li>
    <li> IT WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO DO ANYTHING FOR MY FACE.</li>
    <li> In the past tried several brands of so called peels but nothing worked that well. That is until this product! Also I use 3 of Refresh Skin Therapy Products: 1) Pre-Peel, 2) Peel 3) Moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;And I was not sure if any of these would work on my very dry skin that is as rough as sandpaper (even on my face). However, all three products worked for me and worked better than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ This worked to smooth out my face as I have very dry and sandpapery type of skin! What I did was to use the Rose Glow Cleanser first, then this peel and last of all the moisturizing cream. Now on my face, my skin is SOFT and does not feel like sandpaper anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it work for you? Yes, I believe it will because if this worked well for me with my SCALY and very DRY skin, it should work for anyone. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This has been a life saver for my adult acne.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried everything out there, including minocycline, differin, and many products with salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide.  The only thing that worked before this was minocycline, but I couldn&#x27;t continue to take antibiotics forever and as soon as I stopped taking it, my acne came right back.  I&#x27;ve tried Salicylic Acid products before, and for some reason, they never worked for me.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why everyone recommended salicylic acid products for acne.  Until I got a couple professional acid peels that worked awesome for my acne.  I loved the results, but hated the days of peeling and there was no way I wanted to pay for ongoing peels, so I started searching peels that I could do myself, at home, and found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a try - it&#x27;s worked like a miracle - results are just as good as the minocycline and the professional chemical peels, but without the cost and recovery time.  My skin looks perfect all the time now - NO PEELING and no detrimental effects from antibiotics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair, sensitive skin, so started off only using this a few times/week.  I now use it daily.  I have combination skin with an &#x27;I&#x27; zone (as opposed to a &#x27;T&#x27; zone), so I pretty much use it all over my face, except my cheeks (which will dry out if I use it there).  This perfectly controls my oily skin without drying me out.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my skin now.</li>
    <li> I am a 68 year old grandmother with fair hair and fair skin.  Thankfully, it&#x27;s been many years since my skin would break out, but I now have had to deal with older skin that does not shed as quickly or efficiently as it used to  The texture of the skin on my forehead, cheeks and chin became definitely thickened and course feeling, so I decided to try this product.  I have been using it now for about 10 days and I can very happily say my problem areas are smooth and more supple - all with no visible peeling or flaking skin.  I was pretty hesitant about trying something with only 2% active ingredient, but the satisfaction guarantee helped me decide to try this product.  I am pleased and will buy another bottle when my supply gets low.  So far, it hasn&#x27;t done anything for those lines when I smile or the creases that are now forming above my upper lip; but I hope something may happen with long term, continued use.</li>
    <li> I got one of these as I have had a bit of problem with Acne and I must say I am VERY impressed because not only did it remove my acne problem but opened all my pores and stopped any blackheads from forming on my nose too!. Now when I wash my face in the morning I feel like the water gets much deeper into my skin to clean. My spots on my face are 99% gone and I know that within the next week it should be completely spot free. My face has become a lot less oily and smooth. Just keep using it once a day and it works its magic. It works especially good on new spots that are just forming. The older ones it works on too but usually within a few days. I really like this Salicylic Acid 2% Daily Gentle Peel and Refresh have something special here. I find the $14.75 price tag as very cheap and especially down from like $70+ What a bargain. Being from the UK that is £7 for me. That is super cheap to get rid of my acne and blackheads, not to mention making my face smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> It gave my face a rash or something like that , never again!</li>
    <li> Works great. Faded my sun spots.</li>
    <li> gentle slow peel that shrinks pores but dries skin, need to use a moisturizer with this product. I personally use organic olive oil mixed with purified water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 42 years old a still struggle with spots of adult acne and occasional cystic acne along my jawline.  I&#x27;ve tried countless products both over the counter and prescription.  Many are too irritating and leave my skin blotchy, red and flaking.  Others just don&#x27;t do anything.  Luckily this product seems to work well to clear up breakouts and reduce oiliness without irritating my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using every night for one week and my skin looks noticeably better - less redness, a couple of breakout spots cleared up and no oily t zone by mid-day.  Hopefully continued used will reduce future breakouts and keep the oily skin in check.  I&#x27;m optimistic and I&#x27;m planning to purchase a couple of other Refresh products because I really like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get paid or receive any product for this review.</li>
    <li> When we first got this, my son absolutely refused to use it. He said it burns. So, I bought him some other acne meds. Months go by. His acne cleared up and I thought nothing more of it. Today, I noticed his acne was coming back. I asked him if he would like me to buy more cream. No, he doesn&#x27;t want the creams. He says they&#x27;re messy and they don&#x27;t work. He wants this peel. It turns out that&#x27;s what he&#x27;d been using when his skin was so clear and he&#x27;d run out. &amp;#34;It burns, but it works.&amp;#34; Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Refresh Skin Therapy.</li>
    <li> I finally found a skin peel I can use frequently. I love the name, the logo, the packaging and the fact that there are so few ingredients! I&#x27;m looking forward to happy skin!</li>
    <li> i like how it feels on my skin, but i haven&#x27;t seen the effects that the company advertises.  HOWEVER, the company sent me a free bottle since I told them the first bottle i purchased didn;t show any effects.  I do feel that my skin is less oily.  I don&#x27;t think it prevents my skin from breaking out.</li>
    <li> Just gentle enough for your face, it hepls a lot with my acne</li>
    <li> I love this, I use this as a spot treatment, I use it for like two to three days back to back then i stop and two days later i can kinda peel the skin off, the spot turns a little dark but then your able to peel it and the color is back to reg after you peel it. Dries out pimples wonderfully. and yes it burns</li>
    <li> My sister-in-law has a problem with acne on her face. She used some of the expensive products, some worked, others, not so much. She tried this Salicylic Acid 2% Daily Gentle Peel on her face daily for a few days. She said it burned a little, but not much. She saw some improvement on the first day and her acne was gone in three or four days. She loves this product and will use it if the acne comes back again.</li>
    <li> Chemical peel? No. It&#x27;s more of a toner. Used up the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t get the results I was looking for. It did help keep acne at bay.</li>
    <li> Best thing for acne pronounced skin. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s with embarrassing acne that comes and goes. Nothing seemed to help till I used this every night.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t know where to begin with this product. This has worked WONDERS for me. I usually don&#x27;t like to write a really good review because they sound to start fake lol. But honestly this product has been the best thing I have ever tried for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was super nervous to try it on my face. I bought it but never used it. Until maybe 1 month later I decided to give it a try. I thought &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; would literally peel my face, which is why I held off on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But boy was I wrong. This product does NOT do that to you. It&#x27;s super super gentle to your face, don&#x27;t get me wrong it does sting a little and that&#x27;s just because it has alcohol, but then it cools down and you don&#x27;t even feel it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually leave it on longer than 5 minutes around 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the results..&lt;br /&gt;You honestly that SAME day will see results. You&#x27;re face feels super soft and looks smoother!! Your acne starts to shrink and not be as red. And I&#x27;ve also noticed that your pores get smaller and shrink in size which is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 8 days now and I can truly say i love the way my skin is starting to look like and feel like. It&#x27;s so amazing how this product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It erases acne scars like an eraser! I&#x27;m not exaggerating. It smoothens your face in that first wash! I&#x27;m so happy with this product and will continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend this product to you ladies! Trust me you will love this product and will come to buy it again.</li>
