    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! I have combination skin that is more prone to oiliness and adult acne. As a result, I always have to be careful about foundation, sunscreen and moisturizers. But at 52, I seriously need a moisturizer to combat lines and aging skin. This is the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever been able to use. It really works to keep my skin hydrated and seems to balance the oily and dry areas. I use it in the morning before I apply my make-up and at night after I use a retinol pad.  It also apply it on my neck. I&#x27;m not sure if I has reduced the appearance of fine lines around my eyes or not. But overall, but my skin feels and looks great. It&#x27;s a real pleasure to use this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;ve tried a million moisturizers, and Philosophy has been the best money I&#x27;ve spent. I use this w/the Philosophy Pure one-step cleanser, Miracle Worker overnight moisturizer and the Miracle Worker Eye Reform. Love them all.</li>
    <li> This is the only moisturizer that works on my dry skin.  I have tried other moisturizers and always go back to this.</li>
    <li> Really do like this moisturizer.</li>
    <li> A friend got me small sizes as a birthday present. I also bought the miracle worker overnight moisturizer. Wow! Best combo for aging skin (I&#x27;m 41). I&#x27;ve tried them all, Murad, Dermalogica, lush. This is the best.  I have combo skin and this has made my skin feel so soft and moisturized. Get it. Worth the $$$</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It truly is Miracle worker.  I ran out and kept forgetting to order (duh me).  When it came, I put it on immediately and it was like my face was a sponge!  I didn&#x27;t realize how much I relied upon this for smooth, soft, well hydrated skin!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the very best moisturizer.  This is a repeat order and I love it! Great service too!</li>
    <li> I was so looking forward to using it and getting results but sadly it just didn&#x27;t agree with my skin (went dry and blotchy) and I had to stop using it by the 3rd week...very disappointed...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Philosophy user for many years.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this, and the affordable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time Philosophy user...  Love this cream, but I&#x27;m looking for a new product that&#x27;s all organic...</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Use daily</li>
    <li> love it...it is fantastic, I also use the Miracle night cream.  Both items have helped to decrease the look of lines.</li>
    <li> Will NEVER buy another moisturizer. This is the BEST! I am 42yo, live is Boston Area and the changing-weather is hard on my skin. This protects and softened my skin without making it greasy. I now put a dab of foundation in the cream every morning and my skin looks awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin, is it a miracle.. NO!... But it feel nice and hydrates my skin, wrinkles still there...</li>
    <li> I have only used this for about 4 weeks but so far I am very pleased with my purchase.  I like this because it absorbs into your skin quickly and makes your skin feel smooth.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because I though it was 8 oz.  I was able to purchase 8 oz for only $84.00. Just a liittle over half of what 2 4oz tubs would cost.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about getting rid of any wrinkles, but I love this stuff ! ! ! ! ! I love the way it feels on my skin ! It goes on feeling wet but sinks in and just feels wonderful not greasy !</li>
