    <li> I received the cream on October 6th and have been using it faithfully ever since - at least twice a day every day [sometimes more than twice when I was just home relaxing]. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen the slightest change in the sensitive region and inner thigh. I&#x27;m a light skinned hispanic &amp; the tone down there has just become a few shades darker than I&#x27;m comfortable with. It&#x27;s a shame that so far it isn&#x27;t working, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m going to finish this cream but I won&#x27;t be purchasing another.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the gel, which I like more than the cream, (on my &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; area) for about a week and see its working!  Im about two shades lighter.  It&#x27;s important to massage the gel or cream into the skin for a minute or two. Don&#x27;t just rub on and do nothing else. Do this in the morning and before bed. Give it a minute to dry Bedford putting on clothes.</li>
