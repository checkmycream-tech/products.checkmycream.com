      <li>Great dishwashing liquid.  </li>
      <li>A great scent for a hand-washing dish soap.  </li>
      <li>This scent is amazing, calming and screaming a pine Christmas!</li>
      <li>The container is attractive and look good sitting on the counter.</li>
      <li>I had been given a bottle of Thymes Frasier Fir (in bottle pictured) as a gift awhile ago and loved it.  </li>
      <li>this has a wonderful pine fresh fragrance if this is an interest to you</li>
      <li>When you do dishes, the whole kitchen smells wonderful!</li>
      <li>Love love love this stuff!!  </li>
      <li>Although it is labeled as dishwashing liquid, it is just as good quality as any hand-soap, and has a fresh, pleasant &amp;#34;Christmas-y&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and cleaning power of this dishwashing soap.</li>
      <li>This makes dishwashing around the holidays so much more enjoyable.  </li>
      <li>I love this product though.</li>
      <li>I love this product; although it can be a strong odor to some.  </li>
      <li>Thymes LTD is the only company that has been able to perfectly replicate the smell of a fresh cut frasier fir.</li>
      <li>Amazing smell, crisp &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>Scent is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>makes me want to do the dishes - takes me back to the Maine woods on a rainy day - worthy dish detergent - gentle on the hands and renders a delightful olfactory sensation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It cleans the dishes squeekie clean</li>
      <li>also this soap suds up very well and rinses clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>It makes nice suds and the fragrance improves the entire dish washing experience.</li>
      <li>It smells just like a fresh Christmas tree.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice and thick dish soap with a lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>If I could get another bottle of what I had the first time, I&#x27;d rate 5 stars, but what I received was unusable, and I had to throw it out.</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t be closer to the real thing!</li>
      <li>3 months later it is still going strong.</li>
      <li>It makes washing dishes much more fun than with any other dish cleaner!</li>
      <li>This is the finest-scented dishwashing liquid I&#x27;ve ever used, and it makes doing dishes so much nicer.  </li>
      <li>REAL fir scent.</li>
      <li>I liked the original bottle (as pictured) better than the new bottle which I got (green and tapered) but that&#x27;s the only complaint I have about the product or seller.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to fragrance, but have found I really, really like this one.  </li>
      <li>Bottle is completely different from the one pictured, and not as pretty.</li>
      <li>It may seem a bit pricey, but I mix it half and half with an inexpensive soap from the grocery store and the fragrance is still lovely.</li>
      <li>However, it is just as good for any time of year when you want a pine scent that actually smells like fresh Balsam Fir, and not pine-sol or other artificial pine scents.</li>
      <li>the seller has sent my order very prompt in less than a week the seller was located in California.</li>
      <li>The new soap left an oily, filmy residue on everything that required 2x as much effort to get off as the dirty food did in the first place!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product; although it can be a strong odor to some.  I use the foam container, adding 1/3 Thymes Frasier Fir dish soap, and 2/3 water. Works wonderful, smells great, saves money, and product lasts longer. I am hooked on this fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is a nice and thick dish soap with a lovely fragrance.  It makes nice suds and the fragrance improves the entire dish washing experience.</li>
    <li> excellent fragrance. I hate to do dishes and this product make me feel better when I do the dishes for the smell of fir.</li>
    <li> Bring the scent of the North Woods to your kitchen every time you use this.  It may seem a bit pricey, but I mix it half and half with an inexpensive soap from the grocery store and the fragrance is still lovely.</li>
    <li> The picture did not match the product I received. It looked like maybe a replacement bottle and was not presentable to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> I am sensitive to fragrance, but have found I really, really like this one.  I don&#x27;t use it all the time, but it&#x27;s a treat to use during the holidays.</li>
    <li> did not come as in the picture...they had a different container that I didn&#x27;t want and chose differently on purposely</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing, calming and screaming a pine Christmas! Try the  spray cleaner, the liquid scent jar, and candles also.</li>
    <li> This is my annual Christmas soap dispenser soap which I must have every year. Although it is labeled as dishwashing liquid, it is just as good quality as any hand-soap, and has a fresh, pleasant &amp;#34;Christmas-y&amp;#34; scent. However, it is just as good for any time of year when you want a pine scent that actually smells like fresh Balsam Fir, and not pine-sol or other artificial pine scents.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and cleaning power of this dishwashing soap. The container is attractive and look good sitting on the counter.</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff!!  REAL fir scent.</li>
    <li> I did not receive THIS product!! I was sent something in a green bottle that definitely is not the same as pictured. It is also not the product I have previously purchased. The ingredients are different from the bottle shown. Not happy with this bait &amp; switch.</li>
    <li> Great dishwashing liquid.  Smells like Christmas and lasts forever, especially if you dilute it, which you can.  3 months later it is still going strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell, crisp &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> makes me want to do the dishes - takes me back to the Maine woods on a rainy day - worthy dish detergent - gentle on the hands and renders a delightful olfactory sensation.</li>
    <li> Bottle is completely different from the one pictured, and not as pretty. Scent is fabulous.  Works well.</li>
    <li> A great scent for a hand-washing dish soap.  A little goes a long way.  I purchase this item all year long.</li>
    <li> This is the finest-scented dishwashing liquid I&#x27;ve ever used, and it makes doing dishes so much nicer.  I liked the original bottle (as pictured) better than the new bottle which I got (green and tapered) but that&#x27;s the only complaint I have about the product or seller.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> This dish-washing soap smells like a forest.  It makes washing dishes much more fun than with any other dish cleaner!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be closer to the real thing! Great product!</li>
    <li> When you do dishes, the whole kitchen smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This makes dishwashing around the holidays so much more enjoyable.  It smells just like a fresh Christmas tree.  I only gave 4 out of 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t lather as well or cut the grease as well as some name brand soaps.</li>
    <li> Like the candles this liquid dish soap is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It cleans the dishes squeekie clean and I don&#x27;t mind doing them!</li>
    <li> Thymes LTD is the only company that has been able to perfectly replicate the smell of a fresh cut frasier fir. It would not be Christmas without these products.</li>
    <li> The dishwashing liquid was improperly packaged so one of the two bottles was cracked and leaked. I love this product though.</li>
    <li> this has a wonderful pine fresh fragrance if this is an interest to you I recommend this product. also this soap suds up very well and rinses clean and smooth. the seller has sent my order very prompt in less than a week the seller was located in California.</li>
    <li> I had been given a bottle of Thymes Frasier Fir (in bottle pictured) as a gift awhile ago and loved it.  After I ran out I ordered myself another bottle. What I received came in a different, dark green bottle. I figured they had just changed the packaging - no big deal. However, when I used it I was sorely disappointed. The new soap left an oily, filmy residue on everything that required 2x as much effort to get off as the dirty food did in the first place! If I could get another bottle of what I had the first time, I&#x27;d rate 5 stars, but what I received was unusable, and I had to throw it out.</li>
