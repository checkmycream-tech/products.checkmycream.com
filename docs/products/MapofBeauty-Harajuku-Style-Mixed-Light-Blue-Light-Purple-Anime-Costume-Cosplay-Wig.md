      <li>but I love it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute but it&#x27;s way too thin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is so cute I love it.</li>
      <li>the wig looked like they just glues the top of the wig together.</li>
      <li>i love the color and it looks just as pictured.</li>
      <li>Pretty good it is a good Halloween  costume and useful for video for YouTube</li>
      <li>The hair is beautiful when it comes to the color, and it is soft..</li>
      <li>Its soft and very nice fibers.</li>
      <li>The bluish turquoise that appears in the photo is alot more visible in the actual wig than in the picture, but its a very cute wig!</li>
      <li>exactly how it was described I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for a cheep wig</li>
      <li>This wig is super fun!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a light luster to it</li>
      <li>I like it a lot because it is not thin and it looks amazing.</li>
      <li>Fantastic wig.</li>
      <li>so its super soft and styled nicely!</li>
      <li>pretty I love it</li>
      <li>I love this wig so much!</li>
      <li>It is soft, long, and very beautiful.</li>
      <li>I love this wig people ask if it&#x27;s my real hair</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
      <li>and it looks fantastic and as pictured (maybe a tad more blue at the top, but still very pretty)</li>
      <li>normally, wigs have a flap of plastic at the top to represent your scalp.</li>
      <li>Also it came sooner than expected and in great condition, thanks!</li>
      <li>This was such a precious wig!</li>
      <li>I kind of wish it would have been a bit bigger</li>
      <li>plus it&#x27;s not hard to untangle and the colors are fabulous so for those reasons I rate 5 stars</li>
      <li>Seems a little more purple at the top of the head</li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t buy anything on here unless it has some (good) reviews from other buyers, but this wig looked so pretty</li>
      <li>But the only complaint I have is that on the top it looks matted and also it sheds easily but other than that its a great wig.</li>
      <li>Everyone thought it was my real  hair too.</li>
      <li>Absolutely lovin&#x27; it.</li>
      <li>other than that i love this wig.</li>
      <li>but there were some frazzled short hairs on the top that made it look low qaulity.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for high quality this is not it .</li>
      <li>The blue is ore a pastel color but for the price I&#x27;m not mad</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re just looking to get a new wig, I suggest this one .</li>
      <li>The wig fit as expected!!</li>
      <li>where they connect to the wig, it looks like matted hair after you haven&#x27;t brushed it in 20 years, but its pretty easy to cover up with styling the longer parts of the bangs, overall id totally recommend this wig, and its not super shiny either, exactly what i was looking for for my lolita style!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks cute and all but not really what I expected.</li>
      <li>I really like the colors, but I think the color is somewhat different from the picture.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and not too shiny.</li>
      <li>This wig is so soft and</li>
      <li>Also the top of the wig where all of the hair meets is a little messed up but its not really that noticeable.</li>
      <li>The wig came to me with really ratty and damaged top hair unfortunately.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to split and is very thick</li>
      <li>I have problems with long wigs in which they normally are thin and with my huge head, they show the net underneath.</li>

<li> I have problems with long wigs in which they normally are thin and with my huge head, they show the net underneath.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s soft and the only problem is the top is a little weird</li>
<li> The bangs just need some cutting and styling is all, but that&#x27;s how most wigs are.</li>
<li> It came much earlier than I expected.</li>
<li> the only complaint that i had was that the top of the wig was really sloppy.</li>
<li> Very poorly manufactured product.... not enough hair to cover the hair net, missing chunks all over, just a very sloppy looking wig, cheap Halloween wigs you can buy for 3 bucks at your local toys r us are higher quality thank this wig</li>
<li> Just arrived today (took only two weeks or a week and half?)</li>
<li> Its really thick but not in a bad way, it hides most of the natural hair underneath.</li>
<li> I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t compliment my skin color (light brown)</li>
<li> The part is weird and after trying it on a few pieces of hair was found in the bathroom,thick enough to tell where they came from.the sides are much thinner than in the picture, I might just cut them off.</li>
<li> this wig, on the other hand did not.</li>
<li> The extra purple on the wig is kinda hard to take care of.</li>
<li> Its a little fizzy</li>
<li> but when I got it the bangs where down a little past my nose.</li>
<li> Maybe a little small around the head, but just takes a little work  to get on.</li>
<li> the only thing i think wrong with it is the bangs and</li>
<li> but it is very thin.. doesn&#x27;t cover all of my hair .</li>

    <li> This is one of my favorites of the wigs I have gotten. Its so cute and perfect for pastel lolita outfits! Pair it up with pearls and a bow and you&#x27;re as cute as a doll :D</li>
    <li> The wig is very nice. All though. The extra purple on the wig is kinda hard to take care of. But the wig is very nice. You can straighten or curl the wig if you want just to let you know.</li>
    <li> Normally I don&#x27;t buy anything on here unless it has some (good) reviews from other buyers, but this wig looked so pretty I took a chance on it. Just arrived today (took only two weeks or a week and half?) and it looks fantastic and as pictured (maybe a tad more blue at the top, but still very pretty) It&#x27;s soft and not too shiny. The bangs just need some cutting and styling is all, but that&#x27;s how most wigs are.</li>

Absolutely lovin&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> The wig came to me with really ratty and damaged top hair unfortunately. I feel like there should have been a product check before sending it out.</li>
    <li> so beautiful! i love this wig! the only thing i think wrong with it is the bangs and where they connect to the wig, it looks like matted hair after you haven&#x27;t brushed it in 20 years, but its pretty easy to cover up with styling the longer parts of the bangs, overall id totally recommend this wig, and its not super shiny either, exactly what i was looking for for my lolita style!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s cute but it&#x27;s way too thin.&lt;br /&gt;It has some blank spots but they can be covered with the rest of the hair sort of?&lt;br /&gt;Looks cute and all but not really what I expected.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s has VERY nice trimming in my opinion it&#x27;s easy to split and is very thick plus it&#x27;s not hard to untangle and the colors are fabulous so for those reasons I rate 5 stars</li>
    <li> My daughter is very satisfied with this wig:)</li>
    <li> this is so cute I love it. It is very blue. in the pictures i trimmed it a bit but when I got it the bangs where down a little past my nose.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very cute wig, and it looks just like in the picture</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my friend (she wanted to cosplay Sytry from Makai Ouija) and she absolutely loved it. It is soft, long, and very beautiful.</li>
    <li> The wig is great! Maybe a little small around the head, but just takes a little work  to get on. Otherwise, the material for the hair is perfect and the colors are so vibrant and awesome! Everyone thought it was my real  hair too.</li>
    <li> I kind of wish it would have been a bit bigger</li>
    <li> I like it a lot because it is not thin and it looks amazing. It also came 2 weeks earlier then it said it would come</li>
    <li> Very poorly manufactured product.... not enough hair to cover the hair net, missing chunks all over, just a very sloppy looking wig, cheap Halloween wigs you can buy for 3 bucks at your local toys r us are higher quality thank this wig</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it.  Dependable delivery.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> The bluish turquoise that appears in the photo is alot more visible in the actual wig than in the picture, but its a very cute wig! Also the top of the wig where all of the hair meets is a little messed up but its not really that noticeable. Its really thick but not in a bad way, it hides most of the natural hair underneath. I will enjoy cosplaying with this wig!!</li>
    <li> I love this wig people ask if it&#x27;s my real hair xD Five Stars.</li>
    <li> This was such a precious wig! im using it for a Fairy Kei outfit, and this was so cute! its nice colors but there were some frazzled short hairs on the top that made it look low qaulity. I didnt mind since it was covered in clips anyway! so its super soft and styled nicely! fit perfectly, nice shipping, and the company was wonderful!</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for . The hair is beautiful when it comes to the color, and it is soft.. but it is very thin.. doesn&#x27;t cover all of my hair . If you&#x27;re looking for high quality this is not it . But if you&#x27;re just looking to get a new wig, I suggest this one .</li>
    <li> It got here on the 10th and I have to say its well made. Its soft and very nice fibers. But the only complaint I have is that on the top it looks matted and also it sheds easily but other than that its a great wig.</li>
    <li> I bought for my granddaughters birthday.  She loved it.</li>
