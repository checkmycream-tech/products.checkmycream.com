      <li>in all, this does work and amazing results happen :)</li>
      <li>It allows a very good application on the entire nail and a good distribution of the varnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I used tape and more polish to keep it from breaking off.</li>
      <li>Guess I just need more vitamins</li>
      <li>/&gt;Varnishes care, I love,</li>

      <li>&lt;br /&gt;going fine for maybe 5 days.</li>

      <li>Overall, good stuff.</li>
      <li>It works fine as a clear top coat, but if you&#x27;re looking for help with your nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as all.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>My nails grow fast and this helps to keep them strong.</li>
      <li>You definitely need this magic gold bottle in your collection!</li>
      <li>I do not orally take vitamins but from time to time--possibly 1-2 days a week--I put vitamin e cream (de la cruz brand) with my own added concentration of vitamin e and Lubridum lotion and rub them on my hands and each individual nail.</li>
      <li>This is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>right thumb--</li>
      <li>The first few days with this on my nails looked great.</li>
      <li>I definitely noticed my nails growing very quickly!</li>
      <li>haha!</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really want to test that right now</li>
      <li>i use this glossy nail polish as a base coat before aplying color, and also as a top coat to keep my nails super glossy and nice!!</li>
      <li>They not only look way better, but they feel so much stronger than before.</li>
      <li>Ive had it on for 4 days and with 2 coats my nails have grown SOOO much and feel much stronger!</li>
      <li>But I certainly like this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>BUT within a minth or so it got very thic</li>
      <li>My nails feel much stronger.</li>
      <li>I got really concerned....because it seemed to happen after</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to all my nail lovers out there!</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>This product really does harden your fingernails so they can grow.</li>
      <li>I do not put all the color of time, but I look after them very often.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>By the end of the week, I have decent looking nails.</li>
      <li>fact it is on the blogs I&#x27;ve heard about this brand and this particular</li>
      <li>I was surprised it worked as fast as it did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve switched back to the Sally Hensen (pink bottle) Maximum Growth as I saw more strength using that.</li>
      <li>My nails are quite strong and slightly flexible.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The serum has worked pretty well at making my nails longer, but they&#x27;re not necessarily stronger...</li>
      <li>It works i wasn&#x27;t sure it would because my nails are hard to grow</li>
      <li>It looks like shiny, clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t count this product out completely, as it does yield results, but not in the time that is advertised.</li>
      <li>I bought this product to keep them long and strong.&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, they DID feel stronger for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>After a few days it starts peeling and it left my nails more damaged than they were.</li>
      <li>My nails have always been bitten down to the quick and sometimes sore.</li>
      <li>Moreover, this smell will fade quickly when dry.&lt;br /&gt;In less than 4 minutes, the varnish is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Even when I ever do have my nails bare, I&#x27;ll swipe a coat of this over them if I want some shine and reinforcement.</li>
      <li>After removing the nails, I was beginning to think I would have to have the acrylics reapplied out of fear that my nails would continuously break past the quick.</li>
      <li>I have tried several products through out the years with little success.</li>
      <li>Not going to say it grows fast or slow because that really all depends on your metabolism</li>
      <li>for the first few times just wear the product alone.</li>
      <li>This first split started to&lt;br /&gt;grow out, and wasn&#x27;t painful anymore, so I was able to trim it.</li>
      <li>I live by this stuff I have weak nails and only when I use this consistently they seem longer and stronger.</li>

    <li> Sally Hansen&#x27;s Nailgrowth Miracle is what I use to speed up the process of growing my nails. After five days, my nails are on their way to growing - there is slight noticeable change - but the difference is not miraculous. I like using it because it does impact the quality of my nails. They are stronger and after about ten days of using the product my nails are longer and less prone to breaking. I wouldn&#x27;t count this product out completely, as it does yield results, but not in the time that is advertised. Using this, in my opinion, is a good choice if you want to grow your nails faster than they would on their own. However, it&#x27;s important to realize that the time frame that Sally Hansen gives is hyperbolic and should be taken lightly.</li>
    <li> My nails do not grow well. I have tried several products through out the years with little success. I purchased this one to try a couple of weeks ago . It is working!  If you are having issues with nails that peel and are thin &amp; weak as mine were then you should give it a try. I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT. IT WORK. I BEENIGN USE 6 YEAR NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
    <li> Received timely. Have been using about a month and my nails look better than they ever have.  Not sure if they actually grow faster but they are stronger and don&#x27;t peel and tear off like before.  First time I have had real nails that look good.</li>
    <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I had acrylic nails on for over a year. I had them removed, and my nails were brittle and painful to the touch. After removing the nails, I was beginning to think I would have to have the acrylics reapplied out of fear that my nails would continuously break past the quick. I bought this product out of pure desperation, and I am so glad I did. This product saved my nails. They not only look way better, but they feel so much stronger than before. Thank you, Sally Hansen!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it made nails stronger, possibly weaker?</li>
    <li> PRODUCT SHIPED AS STATED.  SEEMS TO BE WORKING TO GROW MY NAILS.</li>
    <li> I personally haven&#x27;t tried any other product for nail growth but this one does its job to make your nails grow. Makes your nails shiny, you have to apply it every other day. I do not orally take vitamins but from time to time--possibly 1-2 days a week--I put vitamin e cream (de la cruz brand) with my own added concentration of vitamin e and Lubridum lotion and rub them on my hands and each individual nail. My nails are quite strong and slightly flexible. I try not to ruin them by doing things that&#x27;ll knowingly-accidentally break/chip them. Don&#x27;t really want to test that right now haha! The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it four-stars instead of five is because it does peel. If you peel it, yes, obviously it&#x27;s going to ruin your nail bed. I would say apply this product after you shower or at least a couple hours or so before you do. To narrow it down to not read this entire feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My nails are quite healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Peels a bit. Not going to say it grows fast or slow because that really all depends on your metabolism also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t just be reliant to this serum, take care of your nails too by hydrating them with non-polish products! Everything has an extent to what they can do. But I certainly like this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo below: Left/Right hand at least two weeks of using this nail serum. I did chip my nail--right thumb--but it&#x27;s growing back beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I have noticed a definite improvement in my nails. I have had lots of products but I believe this is the best. I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> It works i wasn&#x27;t sure it would because my nails are hard to grow but i started wearing it within 4 days i saw difference in my nails their actually growing i&#x27;m so happy.</li>
    <li> This product really does harden your fingernails so they can grow. I was surprised it worked as fast as it did.</li>
    <li> The first few days with this on my nails looked great. It goes on and feels a bit like a plastic cover on your nail. It looks like shiny, clear nail polish. However, it peels. After a few days it starts peeling and it left my nails more damaged than they were. I would not buy or recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I shouldn&#x27;t use this until my nail fungus is healed.  Told by doctor to leave the nail open so the air can help with healing.  The little I did use it, I could tell the nail was strengthened.  Once my nail fungus is healed, I definitely will start using this product again on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> My nails were long before using Hard As Nails. I bought this product to keep them long and strong.&lt;br /&gt;After the first application, they DID feel stronger for a couple of days. But then I got a horizontal&lt;br /&gt; split on the side of one nail. I used tape and more polish to keep it from breaking off. I kept that&lt;br /&gt;going fine for maybe 5 days. Then another split happened on another nail. This first split started to&lt;br /&gt;grow out, and wasn&#x27;t painful anymore, so I was able to trim it. But, about every 2 to 4 days, a horizontal&lt;br /&gt;split would appear on another long nail. I got really concerned....because it seemed to happen after&lt;br /&gt;I would apply the polish! In less than a month, all of my fingernails were as short as possible!&lt;br /&gt;Using the Nail Strengthener was WEAKENING not strengthening my nails.[[ASIN:185389382X Hard as Nails]]</li>
    <li> Love it and it arrived fast!</li>
    <li> Whenever my nails break, and are at the point of embarrassment, I use this treatment, and sure enough my nails look beautiful. By the end of the week, I have decent looking nails.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My nails feel much stronger.</li>
    <li> has no affect on my brittle breakable nails i would recomend sally hansen diamond strengthabout 2-3 coats</li>
    <li> Used this product.  It works!</li>
    <li> Before I had my child my nails were so brittle and splitting all of the time. Of course when I was pregnant and for awhile after they were perfect but eventually they went back to their normal state and I was looking for something that could at least prevent them from splitting. The first time I used this polish I was of course skeptical because I&#x27;ve used others before and they only gave me some shine for a day or so, then peeled off. This does not peel off! Ive had it on for 4 days and with 2 coats my nails have grown SOOO much and feel much stronger! If people doubt it, all I have to say is PLEASE try it. It really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for over 10 years, ever since I can remember, actually. My nails have always been bitten down to the quick and sometimes sore. Recently, my boyfriend has helped me stop biting my nails but I bought this to speed up the growth process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has worked pretty well at making my nails longer, but they&#x27;re not necessarily stronger...so I&#x27;m not sure how the length will stay where it is or grow since my nails are still so thin and weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you already have thick nails and you just want to accelerate their growth, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product worked for me.. BUT within a minth or so it got very thic</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it and t has helped my brittle, dry, peeling nails. Will definitely purchase again once this bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t really work. It does make your nail look nice. However my nails are sill breaking. Guess I just need more vitamins</li>
    <li> I live by this stuff I have weak nails and only when I use this consistently they seem longer and stronger. When I start to see length I get beside myself and break the routine. But I swear by it....</li>
    <li> I recently had a baby and coming off the hormones did a number on my nails. They were brittle and breaking. My friend reccommended I try this and it totally worked within one use! My nails are stronger and growing. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My daughter thought this was a polish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sally Hansen Nailgrowth Miracle Treatment ever since it was put on the shelf.I love this nail strengthener.My nails grow fast and this helps to keep them strong.This is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product seems to help in strengthening my nails, thus enabling them to grow longer without splitting or breaking. It is a low-cost solution to a significant problem.</li>
    <li> I started to use it and my nails grew in about a week..I would recommend this to anyone it&#x27;s the TRUTH!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this in the past. I used to always bite my nails I the past and as soon as I got this product around June to end of July of 2013, My nails were so long. There is brittleness that can happen so always moisturize your cuticles and hands that have oils n the lotion. I do suggest to do it everyday and then as your nails begin to grow near the length you want... start doing once or twice a week. for the first few times just wear the product alone. I always have this product but I lost my recent one so I bought another.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this does work and amazing results happen :) Have funn growing out your nails!</li>
    <li> the shipment was very quickly and great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really by chance that I discovered this brand.&lt;br /&gt;In fact it is on the blogs I&#x27;ve heard about this brand and this particular varnish.&lt;br /&gt;We find this brand easily and affordably on site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand is in color, but also in the care of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;I love taking care of my nails. I do not put all the color of time, but I look after them very often.&lt;br /&gt;Varnishes care, I love, especially when they do not tint. And this is the case for the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This varnish is contained in a nice golden bottle of 13.3 ml.&lt;br /&gt;The golden cap is practical to implement and black fine brush is perfect too. It allows a very good application on the entire nail and a good distribution of the varnish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel too strong. Moreover, this smell will fade quickly when dry.&lt;br /&gt;In less than 4 minutes, the varnish is dry.&lt;br /&gt;I put a layer is sufficient, even when I put color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This varnish gives my nails strong and better growth.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the harder and less brittle. No duplication either. But what is obvious I think, is the growth acceleration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A varnish that is perfect and yours too. Even when I do the dishes and cleaning (with a little eh storage; o)&lt;br /&gt;If you like taking care of your nails, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just got this product a few weeks ago. I started using it with no nail growth at all. my nails never grow out and I wanted to find something to help them grow. It says 5 days guarantee you will notice results. I have, it&#x27;s just some of my nails grew and the rest didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve kept using it for 2 more weeks after that..same thing. They aren&#x27;t growing at all. So I wasted my money and still need to find a product that can help with my nails :(</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as a miracle cure for your nails. It works fine as a clear top coat, but if you&#x27;re looking for help with your nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as all.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the reason i was able to stop biting my nails after 20 years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while.  I just received my second bottle.  I used to have acrylic nails and when I had them taken off my nails were so weak and paper thin, and this product actually made them strong and growing so quickly I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  So if you looking for a way to get your nails to grow you will find it here.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail polish for YEARS underneath my self manicures. Not only does it make my nail colour last until /I/ decide to change it (the longest I&#x27;ve lasted with no chips is two and a half weeks!), but my nails feel much stronger with this on them. Even when I ever do have my nails bare, I&#x27;ll swipe a coat of this over them if I want some shine and reinforcement. I highly recommend this to all my nail lovers out there! You definitely need this magic gold bottle in your collection!</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed my nails growing very quickly! Please keep in mind this does NOTHING for the strength of your nails... they broke and peeled very easily. I&#x27;ve switched back to the Sally Hensen (pink bottle) Maximum Growth as I saw more strength using that. You also cannot wear nail polish with this stuff... it will cause it to peel as if you used the peelable polish you had when you were a little girl. It&#x27;s not made to be used as a base coat. Overall, good stuff. Does what it claims.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic.  My nail broke at the base and this helped it grow back so quickly!</li>
    <li> i use this glossy nail polish as a base coat before aplying color, and also as a top coat to keep my nails super glossy and nice!! i personally love it!</li>
