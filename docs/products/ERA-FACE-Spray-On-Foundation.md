      <li>I love this foundation!</li>
      <li>LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Enjoy ~ !!</li>
      <li>My nose gets kind of oily throughout the day and the makeup can&#x27;t seem to stand up to it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t look as though I&#x27;m wearing makeup, but my skin looks practically flawless, and it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>My face looked flawless and very natural.  </li>
      <li>I have used three colors over the years and find that R2 is the closest match for my complexion (fair to light).</li>
      <li>I bought this like many ladies here, because Carmindy used it on WNTW.</li>
      <li>and it would work just as well or better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it while it lasts though.</li>
      <li>It does nothing for the oiliness and feels even more caked on with powder on top.</li>
      <li>I have to say I&#x27;m going to stick with this foundation because it&#x27;s given me better results than any I&#x27;ve ever tried before</li>
      <li>I love this foundation.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation, but I do not spray it on.  </li>
      <li>After trying this a couple times myself, I learned you have to be sure to shake the can</li>
      <li>best make-up foundation I have found to actually diminish the appearance of \\&quot;the crack\\&quot;, is Suzanne Somers spray on foundation.  </li>
      <li>You can reapply for more coverage.  </li>
      <li>I used Amazon and got it for about $20.00 more than Suzannes.....</li>
      <li>I am so glad I kept trying.</li>
      <li>I make sure to moisturize and follow with sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I love this foundation..</li>
      <li>Best on well moisturized and exfoliated skin or it settles on the dry patches.</li>
      <li>Honestly, when trying to cover a DEEP crack with foundation, it might as well be the Grand Canyon!!  </li>
      <li>This foundation is extremely easy to apply (I use a make-up sponge to apply, like I&#x27;ve seen Carmindy do), and the application lasts throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Still, after reading all these glowing reviews and knowing that Carmindy reccomends it, I figured great looking skin is worth that much money.      </li>
      <li>This is really impressive since most products that actually conceal my sun spots leave me looking very made up.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the way it would cake up and show creases and the way it would wear off quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have rosacea, so my skin is both very sensitive and needs good coverage.</li>
      <li>Followed her directions and my face looks radiant and smooth.  </li>
      <li>well so it doesn&#x27;t come out watery, then apply lightly with the brush.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so smooth.  </li>
      <li>Even in a light application it feels caked on.</li>
      <li>I would recommend spraying into the palm of your hand and applying, then smooth out with pad or brush.  </li>
      <li>This one is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not even that light.</li>
      <li>It is now easy and quick to apply.</li>
      <li>Overall, it made my skin look okay, but it definitely did not make it look as flawless as when Carmindy uses it on the show.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money!    </li>
      <li>The texture of the product is smooth, not cakey, and with the number of colors available, it&#x27;s easy to match to your own personal coloring.  </li>
      <li>I could hardly contain my excitement when I got it, imagining that flawless airbrushed complexion.</li>
      <li>I had my husband shake it for a full three minutes</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foundation.</li>
      <li>I often do double shifts at work and look just as good when I get off work as I did coming on.  </li>
      <li>Even though the color matched perfectly, I think the bad outweighed any good.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for about a week and have already had a few compliments on my beautiful, radiant skin...</li>
      <li>Next application went a little better as I had more of a clue how to apply, but still nothing near flawless or  airbrushed.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it</li>
      <li>I tried applying it with a sponge, like Carmindy does, but I found I got better results when I sprayed it directly on my face and followed the directions it came with.</li>
      <li>I can understand what everyone was saying for the first time -- it went on lightly and was pretty decent, although I bought one of the yellow-based colors and it was way too yellow for me, even though I always buy cosmetics for warm skin tones and have never had a problem with it before.  </li>
      <li>Though pricey, highly recommended and worth the cost!</li>
      <li>When used this way the foundation is actually the most economical I have used.</li>
      <li>The yellow tone Y3 makes my uneven, reddish skin flawless and it stays on all day, even after a swim in the pool on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I first tried it, a Sephora saleswoman suggested spraying it into the palm of your hand then using a foundation brush to apply for the coverage you desire.  </li>
      <li>It seemed like $55 was WAY too much money to be spending on makeup, but it&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth it.  </li>
      <li>At first I thought I had made a mistake and thought I should return it.</li>
      <li>I have used many, many foundation formulations from some of the most expensive companies.</li>
      <li>If you want flawless, dewy look that doesn&#x27;t show fine lines and other irritating skin imperfections you have found the right foundation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of foundation in the last 15 years, from drug store to more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brands like Clinique and Dermablend.  </li>
      <li>By the way, you can purchase it directly from their web-site for around $33.00 and they can take the info from the current brand of foundation you are using and match it to there line, pretty cool, and makes it sooo easy...</li>
      <li>(so the sponge doesnt soak up too much foundation.  </li>
      <li>If you spray on too much, you get a cakey look, and it DOES settle into wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>Because the foundation is an aerosal and not touched, I would imagine it would store for much longer than a foundation that is exposed to bacteria using finger or sponge applicators.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>can be covered by dotting a bit of color with your finger, gently tap it into the skin.  </li>
      <li>Dip the sponge in and pat and gently smoothing it on my face.  </li>
      <li>straight the 1st time.      </li>
      <li>My boyfriend got me this foundation as a gift after two years of watching What Not to Wear and saying, \\&quot;I really need to try that stuff.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>and it matches my skin tone better than any other I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>I was currently using Clinique&#x27;s super balanced in Alabaster and decided I would try this ERA... not used to spending that much money on foundation</li>
      <li>So much for trying something new.</li>
      <li>I pay particular attention to the cracks, getting the makeup well inside......</li>
      <li>I also used a sponge to apply it because there was just no way I was going to take the time to wrap my head in a towel to airbrush the stuff on - not to mention the mess it would surely make.    </li>
      <li>First of all, the stuff needs some major shaking.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this holds true for all races, but as a Caucasian woman I know I have loads of tiny fine invisible hairs on my face, not only in the prime waxing areas like upper lip and chin, but also on the cheeks and so forth.  </li>
      <li>It looks natural yet really improves the look of my skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used many, many foundation formulations from some of the most expensive companies. This foundation is the best. I apply it with a sponge and the small can lasts about 18 months or longer. When used this way the foundation is actually the most economical I have used. the formula is buildable with the sponge for those red areas which need attention, and can be glossed over areas which are not in need of much coverage. I have used three colors over the years and find that R2 is the closest match for my complexion (fair to light).</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this foundation. If you want flawless, dewy look that doesn&#x27;t show fine lines and other irritating skin imperfections you have found the right foundation. I have been using foundations sold at the department stores, online and drug stores. My list includes Lancome, Bare Escentuals, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Make up for Ever and L&#x27;Oreal. All of them fade in comparison and leave you feeling \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. Use it as directed and you will be amazed at the results. This foundation stays on all day even in humidity and heat. Try it and you will stay picture perfect all day.</li>
    <li> Finally a foundation I can wear, no irritation, flakey spots, break-outs, goes on easily w/sponge, washes off cleanly, good base for blush, eyes, etc. It looks like I was born w/great skin.  I have sun damage and age spots, combination sensitive skin, allergies, all not a problem, cowabunga!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend got me this foundation as a gift after two years of watching What Not to Wear and saying, \\&quot;I really need to try that stuff.\\&quot; I gotta say, I&#x27;m slightly disappointed, but it&#x27;s not a horrible product.    I got the Y5 shade which really does match my skintone well, but I have very yellow undertones to my skin, and others might find it&#x27;s too yellow. I also used a sponge to apply it because there was just no way I was going to take the time to wrap my head in a towel to airbrush the stuff on - not to mention the mess it would surely make.    Overall, it made my skin look okay, but it definitely did not make it look as flawless as when Carmindy uses it on the show. Not that I expected miracles, given that Carmindy is a professional, but I still noticed some redness around my nose and overall, some discoloration still stuck out ... spots that usually aren&#x27;t too difficult to cover with other foundations I&#x27;ve used.    It does stay put on my face all day, which is a definite plus and you don&#x27;t use a lot for one application. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another can of this once this one runs out. I think you could go into Sephora and buy just about any other mid-priced foundation and it would work just as well or better. I&#x27;m enjoying it while it lasts though.</li>
    <li> I love this foundation! I have very uneven skin; it&#x27;s fairly light with red, blotchy cheeks and melasma (brown spots) from sun damage on my forehead, but when I use this product it looks so smooth and even. I purchased Y3 for my skin color, and when I have it on you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing foundation. This is really impressive since most products that actually conceal my sun spots leave me looking very made up. I have been using it for about a week and have already had a few compliments on my beautiful, radiant skin...it has literally been years since anyone complimented my skin!     My only advice is to shake it A LOT, especially before you use it the first time; this should help you avoid issues other users have complained about. I had my husband shake it for a full three minutes and it came out perfect the first time. Now I shake it for about 30 seconds each time...it&#x27;s totally worth it to have my skin look this good! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this foundation, but I do not spray it on.  When I first tried it, a Sephora saleswoman suggested spraying it into the palm of your hand then using a foundation brush to apply for the coverage you desire.  After trying this a couple times myself, I learned you have to be sure to shake the can well so it doesn&#x27;t come out watery, then apply lightly with the brush.  You can reapply for more coverage.  The yellow tone Y3 makes my uneven, reddish skin flawless and it stays on all day, even after a swim in the pool on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other tips:  the product is not good for dry or flaky skin.  Best on well moisturized and exfoliated skin or it settles on the dry patches.</li>
    <li> I am over 50.  For the past several years I have become more and more frustrated with the foundation available out there for mature skin.  I describe the cracks in my chin as \\&quot;the great cravace\\&quot;.  Honestly, when trying to cover a DEEP crack with foundation, it might as well be the Grand Canyon!!  I could never get the foundation to stay in the crack.  Thus, within a few hours, the wrinkle showed pink, and the crack stood out even more than if I just didn&#x27;t wear make-up at all!  I was almost resigned to thinking the only remedy would be botox, or cosmetic surg.  I&#x27;ve even tried filling the crack with the filler that Wei East puts out.  Nothing worked.  I tried Lancomb, Clinic and Estee Lauder.  I&#x27;ve tried Dr. Brandt, every moisturizer, astringent and face mask known to man.&lt;br /&gt;The best make-up foundation I have found to actually diminish the appearance of \\&quot;the crack\\&quot;, is Suzanne Somers spray on foundation.  I too had seen Carmindy on What Not To Wear use sray on foundation.  But it was pricey...so I researched and read the reviews on Suzanne&#x27;s make-up and people said it was comparable and less expensive.  So, for the past 2 years I have used Suzanne&#x27;s.  It is sometimes hard to find, and last month I could not find my color.  So I decided to try the ERA.  I used Amazon and got it for about $20.00 more than Suzannes.....but let me say, it is worth EVERY DIME.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering it in the future, I don&#x27;t care what it costs.  I use a sponge, not the puff that comes with it.  I make sure to moisturize and follow with sunscreen.  I pay particular attention to the cracks, getting the makeup well inside......I use two small squirts on the sponge for each part of my face.....2 for one side/2 for the other side/2 for forehead, nose and chin/1 for neck....perfect.  Excellent coverage.  STAYS ON, EVEN IN \\&quot;THE CRACK\\&quot;.  Doesn&#x27;t smear onto my clothing.....LOVE IT!! My skin feels so smooth.  I don&#x27;t see a big pink crack staring back at me after a few hours.  I often do double shifts at work and look just as good when I get off work as I did coming on.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of people ask me if I \\&quot;had something done\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps ladies.fts at work and look just as good when I get off work as I did coming on.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of people ask me if I \\&quot;had something done\\&quot;!  Hope this helps ladies.</li>
    <li> I was pretty wary of buying this because of the price, but it really is worth it. The can has lasted me almost a year, and it&#x27;s not even empty! It&#x27;s wonderful! I have very oily, acne prone skin with rosacea, and this stuff makes me look like I have a flawless, beautiful complexion. And I&#x27;m not exaggerating. It feels like I&#x27;m not wearing makeup. I just can&#x27;t say enough about it. This is the one thing that I couldn&#x27;t live without. You need to try it!!!</li>
    <li> I can understand what everyone was saying for the first time -- it went on lightly and was pretty decent, although I bought one of the yellow-based colors and it was way too yellow for me, even though I always buy cosmetics for warm skin tones and have never had a problem with it before.  A couple days later, today, I tried it again, and it came out like paint.  I tried shaking the bottle and it didn&#x27;t change.  I put a little on my face and it looked like yellow facepaint.  It took a lot of hard scrubbing to get it off my face and it&#x27;s still on my hands.      If you want to paint your kid&#x27;s face, you don&#x27;t need to spend $55 for it.  My suggestion for excellent, light coverage foundation would be Clinique&#x27;s Almost Makeup.  If you want something even lighter, Cover Girl&#x27;s tinted moisturizer is surprisingly good, considering it&#x27;s a drugstore brand.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bare Escentuals mineral foundation for 2 yrs. or so and I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with the way it would cake up and show creases and the way it would wear off quickly.  I watched WNTW, saw Carmindy do her thing, and researched this product.  Just so we are clear here, I thought B.E. was outrageously priced, so when I saw how much this cost I was flabbergasted. Still, after reading all these glowing reviews and knowing that Carmindy reccomends it, I figured great looking skin is worth that much money.      I could hardly contain my excitement when I got it, imagining that flawless airbrushed complexion. Well, sadly, it was not to be. First of all, the stuff needs some major shaking. It tells you so on the bottle, but you should know they&#x27;re not exaggerating.  I would say you need to shake for like 2 min. straight the 1st time.      My first application went terribly. It&#x27;s very different from mineral foundation, and it ended up looking too heavy. Next application went a little better as I had more of a clue how to apply, but still nothing near flawless or  airbrushed.  You can clearly tell that I&#x27;m wearing foundation; it does not look unusually natural.  As for being water resistant and having long lasting properties, it seems to rub off as does any foundation. I scratch my face and I can see where I scratched.  If I blow my nose, it comes off the nose, which is what I hated about Bare Escentuals.  My nose gets kind of oily throughout the day and the makeup can&#x27;t seem to stand up to it. We are not talking terribly oily here, just average. My nose begins to look pinker as the day progresses and the foundation diminishes and the rosacea shows through. My face looks shiny and greasy in the afternoon which is hardly what I expected for $62.     Also, I bought the lightest shade they have, R2,  and it&#x27;s not even that light. It suits alright I suppose, but if I was any paler, this would be too dark.   If you are one of those uber pale people, I don&#x27;t think thisis light enough.      The bottom line here is that this foundation doesn&#x27;t do what it claims, is way overpriced, and is a big disappoinment. If I wanted an average foundation that wears off easily and gives me a mediocre finish,  there&#x27;s plenty to chose from for a fraction of the price.  I&#x27;m so sad that I wasted my husband&#x27;s hard earned money on this product.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> After watching Carmindy (What Not to Wear) use this on women I just had to try it.  I also bought Carmindy&#x27;s book \\&quot;The 5 Minute Face\\&quot;.  Followed her directions and my face looks radiant and smooth.  It is expensive and I also bought the Sally Hansen spray foundation (cheap).  Use a good quality wedge sponge, dipped in a bit of moisturizer (so the sponge doesnt soak up too much foundation.  I spray the foundation on an old mirror.  Dip the sponge in and pat and gently smoothing it on my face.  Extra coverage for blems, etc.  can be covered by dotting a bit of color with your finger, gently tap it into the skin.  Good Luck !</li>
    <li> I love this foundation. I cannot see myself ever changing to any other foundation. I have rosacea, so my skin is both very sensitive and needs good coverage. This foundation is great on both counts. It does take a few times to learn to apply it well. At first I thought I had made a mistake and thought I should return it. I am so glad I kept trying. It is now easy and quick to apply. It looks natural yet really improves the look of my skin. It is expensive, but it is so far superior to any other foundation I&#x27;ve tried that it is very worth it.</li>
    <li> You can buy this on HSN for a lot less.  If you spray on too much, you get a cakey look, and it DOES settle into wrinkles.  I would recommend spraying into the palm of your hand and applying, then smooth out with pad or brush.  It is necessary to cover your clothes and hair before spraying, so the overspray does not mist over onto them.  When I was halfway through my second can, the spray button clogged and no amount of cleaning would unclog.  I had to throw it away. For the price, I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go out of my house without makeup on, but I like to look really natural when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I&#x27;ve had trouble finding a foundation that isn&#x27;t too obvious.  This one is fantastic.  I get great coverage with it.  It evens out my skin tone and hides flaws, but it also seems to melt into my skin so it just looks like I have naturally beautiful skin.  Not like I&#x27;m wearing enough make-up to be going on stage!  I just love it!  It&#x27;s well worth the money!    Carolyn  My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Flame Sport Walkers   ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of foundation in the last 15 years, from drug store to more \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brands like Clinique and Dermablend.  The most expensive I&#x27;ve gone on foundation in the past is about $25.  It seemed like $55 was WAY too much money to be spending on makeup, but it&#x27;s DEFINITELY worth it.  I tried applying it with a sponge, like Carmindy does, but I found I got better results when I sprayed it directly on my face and followed the directions it came with. I have to say I&#x27;m going to stick with this foundation because it&#x27;s given me better results than any I&#x27;ve ever tried before and it matches my skin tone better than any other I&#x27;ve found.  It doesn&#x27;t look as though I&#x27;m wearing makeup, but my skin looks practically flawless, and it&#x27;s quick and easy to apply.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> ERA Foundation is really good stuff. I&#x27;m 55 years old and was looking for a foundation that provided good coverage while not looking fake or caked on. This product does the job, and you only need a little to even out skin tones and get a natural look. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I tan a lot so my skin is dark/golden brown.  I bought R8 and it matched my skin perfectly.  It hides my dark circles, uneven skin areas and doesn&#x27;t settle in wrinkles at all !!  I sprayed some on the sponge first to use as concealer on my problem areas, then sprayed my face and finished with a little powder.  I&#x27;m very pleased!  I have bought just about everything to try to hide my dark circles (even tattoo cover up makeup).  This stuff looks natural and not caked on at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the raves about it.  But I think it felt sticky on my face and gave my skin a redness.  I didn&#x27;t like that you had to cover all up before application.  That would be a pain if you had to cover up your hair and clothes each time before applying.  And when using a sponge it didn&#x27;t give enough coverage.  Even though the color matched perfectly, I think the bad outweighed any good.  I&#x27;m sticking to my Bare Minerals and Mary Kay is a close second.  So much for trying something new.</li>
    <li> I was currently using Clinique&#x27;s super balanced in Alabaster and decided I would try this ERA... not used to spending that much money on foundation but I am def. not straying now. I love this foundation.. I chose R2 and it matches perfectly. If you go to the ERA website you can put in your current foundation color and they will match you up with what you should be using for ERA.  VERY EASY!  I bought it from the Home Shopping Network and I think I only paid $36... save yourself some money, but def. buy this product!!!</li>
    <li> By the way, you can purchase it directly from their web-site for around $33.00 and they can take the info from the current brand of foundation you are using and match it to there line, pretty cool, and makes it sooo easy...Enjoy ~ !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;d seen Carmindy using it on \\&quot;What Not To Wear.\\&quot;  This foundation is extremely easy to apply (I use a make-up sponge to apply, like I&#x27;ve seen Carmindy do), and the application lasts throughout the day.  The texture of the product is smooth, not cakey, and with the number of colors available, it&#x27;s easy to match to your own personal coloring.  My face looked flawless and very natural.  Because the foundation is an aerosal and not touched, I would imagine it would store for much longer than a foundation that is exposed to bacteria using finger or sponge applicators.  Though pricey, highly recommended and worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I bought this like many ladies here, because Carmindy used it on WNTW. I wish I had saved my money and stuck with a cheaper foundation. I shook it well &amp; applied with the sponge. It wears off like any other cheaper foundation and it feels really heavy on my skin. Even in a light application it feels caked on. It does nothing for the oiliness and feels even more caked on with powder on top. Also, I used their site to find the right color, using my usual brand which matches my skin exactly, it told me I need R4 for my rosy skin. But this actually looks a shade too dark and a little too yellowish on my rosy-toned skin.   Essentially- I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted money on this product when I could buy a better one in the local drug store for 1/4 the price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this holds true for all races, but as a Caucasian woman I know I have loads of tiny fine invisible hairs on my face, not only in the prime waxing areas like upper lip and chin, but also on the cheeks and so forth.  Well, I got my ERA Face, and shook it, and shook it, and shook it, and then I sprayed it, and it made every one of those little tiny hairs stand up on end and get coated in foundation!  It was horrible, I looked like a yellow lady Sasquatch.  I don&#x27;t know what would have caused it to make them all stand on end, unless it was some reaction to the propellant, but this is going back to Classified tomorrow.</li>
