### Positive Reviews

<ol>

      <li>This is an excellent affordable alternative to the high-priced skin care products I was using before.</li>
      <li>This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>its wonderful and</li>

      <li>This one has been wonderful for cleansing my face.</li>
      <li>This product is actually very good.  </li>
      <li>Good value!</li>
      <li>Anyway, this turned out to be a great buy</li>
      <li>Neutrogena is a great brand</li>
      <li>Which was great until it got discontinued of course.</li>
      <li>Great produce....</li>
      <li>I also have to say that the Amazon price is a great deal.  </li>
      <li>This is her review: This is a great product that cleans well without over drying your skin.</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant.  </li>
      <li>in all, a good product from a trusted and established brand.</li>
      <li>I was nervous about trying this product since I saw the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;, but I was amazed with how good it felt on my face.</li>
      <li>I felt it did a good job removing makeup.  </li>
      <li>It is a good size product bottle for the price</li>
      <li>It also does not have good foaming and doesn&#x27;t remove my eye makeup well.  </li>
      <li>Try it, make your own opinion and don&#x27;t listen to the negatives.</li>
      <li>Smells nice, cleans makeup off well.</li>
      <li>It has a nice smell, its not as &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; as the sample I got before.</li>
      <li>Kind of an asexual perfume - not flowery or overly feminine.</li>
      <li>It is so gentle, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
      <li>When I used it I really liked the smell.</li>
      <li>I will never buy this again because of that - even though the cleanser itself cleans nicely</li>
      <li>I have tried a variety of face washes and while some have worked better than others, I feel this one, while maybe not the best, is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It smells a lot like &amp;#34;No More Tears&amp;#34; Shampoo, so it has a pleasing scent and is very handy with the pump dispenser on top..</li>
      <li>The pump makes it easy to use and the foaming formula means you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get good results.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and good</li>
      <li>It makes it very easy to get the cleaner out of the bottle</li>
      <li>It does clean my face well and it leaves it with a nice refreshed look and feel, but that smell!  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent cleanser for oily, sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>and it was delivered to me on Sunday which was great because I got to use it right away.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so strong!  </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t take the strong perfume smell!  </li>
      <li>all that being said, this is a very good product, on par with Neutrogena&#x27;s classic orange face soap.</li>
      <li>I originally said this was a good cleanser, after a week.  </li>
      <li>Honestly the best part is that it&#x27;s a big bottle for $8 or $9 that has lasted me 3 months</li>
      <li>works great for fair skin, or for people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is very light.</li>
      <li>I even like the very light scent.</li>
      <li>This product from reputable company lives up to its reputation.</li>
      <li>I got this for my girlfriend since she would use it more.</li>
      <li>They were glad I contacted them.  </li>
      <li>I commend them for launching the Neutrogena Naturals line that does not test on animals for the most part, though they do include a line about not testing unless required by law.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this cleanser.</li>
      <li>I usually love Neutrogena products.</li>
      <li>Keep the formula the way it is and and the fragrance too! :-)</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The foaming is ok.</li>
      <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I love this wash.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work on my face as I have oily skin that is prone to breaking out.  </li>
      <li>check ingredients in all the skin care products I use to make sure there are no irritants or pore-clogging ingredients</li>
      <li>and I am quite pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still able to spot-treat the blemishes, but this helps keep my skin hydrated</li>
      <li>Neutrogena needs to find a better way of packaging this item for shipment.</li>
      <li>I will wash twice to make sure it&#x27;s all gone, then follow up with a scrub-</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
      <li>many of my pimples were not visible anymore in about two to three days.</li>
      <li>However, my 19-year-old daughter loved it right away and ended up stealing the rest of the bottle to take off to college.</li>
      <li>Very nice, gentle cleanser.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, before I apply my prescription treatments, I have to make sure my face is very clean.  </li>
      <li>Yes it has a fragerence, but it is a clean nice smell.  </li>
      <li>I have used Neutrogena products for years, so I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new, \\&quot;ultra gentle\\&quot; cleanser.  </li>
      <li>They were very helpful, pleasant, and cooperative.  </li>
      <li>I would have picked up Cetaphil&#x27;s gentle cleanser (because I love, love, love, their moisturizing cream), but it has parabens - argh!</li>
      <li>I liked sulfate free and mild</li>
      <li>It does leave one&#x27;s skin feeling very clean &amp; smooth.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the original orange cleanser instead.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena has come up with a wonderful daily cleanser that made my skin feel fresh after each use.</li>
      <li>Gentle, lightly scented cleanser that did a good job removing my makeup which is a feat in itself.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it got my face clean, but it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling noticeably smoother or softer.</li>
      <li>Also, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t spread easily - you need two-three pumps for your face.</li>
      <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a pump, so it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I too don&#x27;t have a tolerance for strong smells-</li>
      <li>However, the fragrance is just way too strong.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very familiar with all the chemicals on the labels of products, and this one seemed great on all counts, until I actually tried it!</li>
      <li>It probably works fine if you use it in conjunction with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>at home.&lt;br /&gt;She said all of them should be fine, but she still suggested I stick to Cetaphil or</li>
      <li>so maybe for some individuals it is fine.  </li>
      <li>Again, it has a pleasant aroma and my usually sensitive skinned daughter</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Neutrogena products.  </li>
      <li>This really is gentle and the smell is nice and light.</li>
      <li>This product is hypo-allergenic &amp; dye free &amp; even soap free.  </li>
      <li>I liked it on the whole, but didn&#x27;t find myself raving over it.</li>
      <li>The first impression was the nice sweet smell that comes with the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love it if it felt a tiny bit more moist after use, but the clean feel is nice.  </li>
      <li>My wife really loves it!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lotion options: Aveeno Daily moisturizer, Vaseline ointment (sticky but very effective) or VaniCream brand ointment/cream (sticky but no allergens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE:&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
      <li>super easily-</li>
      <li>This is the first wash I have used and absolutly love.  </li>
      <li>This product will leave your face feeling clean and does not irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>It does clean the skin, but there are gentler products than this one.</li>
      <li>My skin also doesn&#x27;t feel totally clean after using it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got a sample for this Neutrogena Daily cleanser from rent the runway. When I used it I really liked the smell. I also liked how soft and clean my face felt after washing my face. The little sample bottled lasted me for more than a week since I used small amounts of the cleanser in the morning and at night. I really did see a difference in my skin many of my pimples were not visible anymore in about two to three days. I looked for this product at many pharmacies with no luck, and then recently I googled it and found it here and ordered it. I ordered it on Friday and it was delivered to me on Sunday which was great because I got to use it right away. The bottle is big it looks like it could last a couple of months. It has a nice smell, its not as &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; as the sample I got before. I also noticed that some of my pimples are gone and it has just been three days since I started using it. I do recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this cleanser. I have had acne for over 10 years and whenever I would use up a bottle of cleanser I would move on to a different one, hoping it would be &amp;#34;the one.&amp;#34; This is it for me! My skin is incredibly sensitive and I have either broken out or had allergic reactions to a plethora of different products. This cleanser does not leave me feeling tight or dry at all-- I typically only use it at night and just rinse with water in the morning, but I can use it twice a day with no ill effects. It is fantastic at removing makeup and (chemical) sunscreen on its own, though my personal preference is to use sweet almond oil to break everything up first.&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would avoid ANY product with fragrance as it can be irritating, but there seems to be very little in this cleanser as it doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything, and so far no reactions to it either.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena never disappoints! This gentle daily cleanser pampers my sensitive skin - I have my young children use it also!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine what product the naysayers were using!&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a very long time, need very little to lather. The fragrance is very light. My husband has a wicked sensitivity to fragrances. This one he can use, no problem. Great product!</li>
    <li> Simple cleanser with pleasant smell, so gentle I can use it on my sensitive skin twice daily without over drying. A must have if you are looking for a simple cleanser.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use anything with a fragrance in it, so was pleased to discover Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser. When I ran out, I purchased what I thought was another bottle of it, but when I opened it, I could tell right away it was a different product because of the overpowering fragrance. Yes, my fault for not realizing that it wasn&#x27;t the same product I had used before, but the labels are almost identical: same color label, same size, same name &amp;#34;Ultra Gentle.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll be more careful next time, but in the meantime, my store won&#x27;t take it back, understandably, because I opened it, and I can&#x27;t use it, because I&#x27;m allergic to the perfume in it. Just wanted to warn others who aren&#x27;t aware there are two nearly identical Neutrogena products. If you need fragrance-free, make sure to read the label on the back.</li>
    <li> A few days after first using this cleanser I developed hard bumps all over my forehead..then i broke out on my chin and cheeks..I&#x27;ve been prone to acne in the past but not this extreme and I didn&#x27;t connect it to this cleanser until someone else I know who had recently started using the same was complaining of a very bad breakout too. She also has sensitive skin but noticed there is added fragrance to this formula and that may be what is causing the problem. . Would not reccomend.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has yet again released an effective product by introducing a new daily cleanser infused with a light flowery scent. The cleanser utilizes a pump which releases the product as a foam. Gently lather and rinse with water. I did not scrub my face dry but softly dabbed with a towel and left a minimal amount of water on my face. I purposefully have been doing this since I was a teenager so I may allow my skin to absorb water and not leave it dry and red. I have used this product for the last 3 weeks and have had no breakouts. The final outcome has been consistent to leave my face feeling soft and smooth. Some people may find the scent not to their liking I found it pleasurable and calming. I would highly recommend that those who may experience  reactions to  products that have a scent to be careful using this product. It clearly is not hypoallergenic. I would suggest using other items in Neutrogena&#x27;s product line. I have always been faithful to Neutrogena and recommend the daily cleanser whole heartily.</li>
    <li> For me, the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser had a very glycerin slipperiness to it and untrue to it&#x27;s claim, did in fact prove a bit drying to my aging facial skin. However, my 19-year-old daughter loved it right away and ended up stealing the rest of the bottle to take off to college. While I still had it, it worked well on a wash cloth in the shower for the rest of my body. It&#x27;s not as drying as regular soap, but then, I wouldn&#x27;t use soap on my face, either. Again, it has a pleasant aroma and my usually sensitive skinned daughter didn&#x27;t break out in a rash from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars only because I&#x27;d hoped it would work for my face, as well.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash bought it on a whim while my other fave ran out !</li>
    <li> I am 75 and my face needs to be washed at least twice a day but anything harsh would be detrimental to my skin. This is an excellent affordable alternative to the high-priced skin care products I was using before.</li>
    <li> This cleanser cleans very well, but if you want something that is fragrance-free, don&#x27;t buy this product!  It&#x27;s seriously one of the most fragrant cleansers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I noticed it immediately the first time I used it.  It does clean my face well and it leaves it with a nice refreshed look and feel, but that smell!  I am not exaggerating when I tell you that when I accidentally got a tiny bit of the suds onto my mouth and I couldn&#x27;t get that awful perfume taste out of mouth for a while.  It&#x27;s so strong!  Hardly what you would expect for a product designed for sensitive skin \\&quot;ultra gentle\\&quot;.  How stupid that they would make this cleanser reek of fragrance.  I will never buy this again because of that - even though the cleanser itself cleans nicely and I find this to be reasonably priced.  I just can&#x27;t take the strong perfume smell!  It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and within two days of me using this product my chin and mouth area are peeling and extremely dry with bumps. The fragrance of this cleanser is also over-powering and shouldn&#x27;t be used in a &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; cleanser for sensitive skin. Also, this cleanser doesn&#x27;t spread easily - you need two-three pumps for your face. Taking it back ASAP.</li>
    <li> Burned my hands (which are very dry) and made finger tips crack after 2 uses of this product.&lt;br /&gt; This is not gentle at all and would not recommend for anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be ultra gentle without over drying, but it dries my combination skin out really bad. Even in places that I&#x27;m usually oily in its gets so dry it flakey. And the smell of it will about knock you down. I know neutrogena products have always had a smell, but I wish they could tone it down. It is a good size product bottle for the price but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I have very dry,acne-prone skin that is very sensitive because of the use of topicals. I was looking for a non-comedogenic cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out further, and I had previously tried cetaphil. This cleanser has a similar texture to cetaphil, but my skin still feels dry. It removes makeup a lot better than cetaphil, but does little for my dry skin. Overall satisfactory for the price, especially for those with fragrance sensitivities.</li>
    <li> Very nice, gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 with combination skin and some minor hormonal acne. My T-zone is oily, but around my nose and chin gets super dry during the winter months.  After years of trying new products to help balance my skin and eliminate breakouts, I&#x27;ve found the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, harsh acne treatments only make my skin RAGE.  This cleanser confirms to me that my skin is SUPER sensitive.  When I ran out of this and went back to another &amp;#34;soap-free, as gentle as water&amp;#34; cleanser, my face hated me for it.  I went straight back to the drugstore for this and the difference is remarkable.  I&#x27;m still able to spot-treat the blemishes, but this helps keep my skin hydrated so it doesn&#x27;t crack and flake like a lizard.  (So gross!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any strong perfumes, like some other people.  This product does NOT foam up at all, so be aware of that.  I wear a full face of makeup and this takes it all off, no problem.  I typically do two washes on my face to get everything off, but it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  Your skin shouldn&#x27;t feel tight after cleansing.  If so, it&#x27;s too harsh for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried everything on the shelf and you continue to have new breakouts, I recommend making your skin care routine as simple and GENTLE as possible.  Cleanse with this, moisturize with something for sensitive skin and spot-treat your blemishes with a benzoyl-peroxide/salicylic acid gel (ONLY on the spots, not all over your face).  All this time I thought I was &amp;#34;acne-prone&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m just SENSITIVE.  Harsh products make it worse, but this chills everything out.  Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive skin. I was given sampled from my Dermatologist. I will use nothing but this to wash my face.</li>
    <li> I have adult-onset cystic acne and fail with more products than I succeed with in avoiding breakouts. I love this wash. It is so gentle, and the smell is wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since starting it two months ago. I have also had changes to my prescription medications during that time that could be contributing to that, but at the very least, even if it didn&#x27;t help improve my adult acne, it certainly hasn&#x27;t worsened it. I also have very sensitive skin and am certain I have allergies that cause contact dermatitis and red, inflamed skin on my neck and chest regularly, though I can never seem to narrow down what products are doing this. But like with the acne, this too I can be certain does not cause it. It is fantastic!  I like it much better than other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; washes like Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> I like the way this cleanser does its thing. I even like the fragrance. However, the fragrance is just way too strong. It feels like I&#x27;m washing my face with perfume. Kind of an asexual perfume - not flowery or overly feminine. Clean and crisp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser itself is gentle and does not dry or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming is ok. A little product goes a long way. Personally the foaming part is not really a selling point. I previously used Fresh Soy Cleanser which does not foam and works really well, its just quite pricy so I&#x27;m looking for an alternative. It has fragrance too but its very mild and natural smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this product until its gone, but will not re-buy. I think I&#x27;ll try the Neutrogena Extra Gentle cleanser - which is fragrance free.</li>
    <li> Like using water with it</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that work for my face, it makes my face feel so soft. It does not dry my face out at all. I am now a fan!</li>
    <li> Delivered before estimated. Good value! Great produce....</li>
    <li> Oh my word! Don&#x27;t mistake it or use it as an alternative to Cetaphil! I got it in my eye and had to run cold water over my open eye for I don&#x27;t know how long. It was as if I had some science lab chemical in my eye. I have very sensitive skin, and normally use cetaphil, but the dermatologist gave me this as a sample, just to try. It does clean the skin, but there are gentler products than this one. I&#x27;m sorry,Neutrogena, I normally like your products,but this one is not really for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser has to be the harshest, smelliest stuff there is.  Why why why did they decide to put fragrance in it?  Is this some stupid marketing strategy to get rid of an overload of fragrance tubs they have in their manufacturing plant? You&#x27;re better off buying the original orange cleanser instead.  This stuff made my face red and sting...and of course create more issues with the &#x27;already&#x27; fragile state of my skin.  NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN!&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are less sensitive on your back and chest, I used it and it seems to be okay.</li>
    <li> I have super hyper-reactive skin and am allergic to almost all face washes, sunscreens, make ups, etc.  This is the first wash I have used and absolutly love.  Yes it has a fragerence, but it is a clean nice smell.  It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  This cleanser works especially well with a clarisonic.  I use this twice a day, and you neutrogena hydro boost water gel for moisturizer.  My skin has never looked better.  Bye bye rashes and pimples!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cleanser. I have super hyper ultra sensitive skin and neutrogena&#x27;s ultra gentle daily cleanser works well on my skin. I really LIKE the fragrance of this face wash and my skin is not irritated or red after using it. Keep the formula the way it is and and the fragrance too! :-) I also use neutrogena&#x27;s deep clean scrub for sensitive skin and alternate with st. ive&#x27;s scrubs ( I use a very hydrating moisturing cream after using my toner) and it seems to help with my acne. I am in my mid-late 20s. I&#x27;m just thankful I&#x27;ve finally found my soul mate face wash. :-) Try it, make your own opinion and don&#x27;t listen to the negatives. Your skin is going to react differently than others or mine, so see for yourself. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands out there even trying to go natural or organic and had all kinds of skin reactions. This is the only wash that does not irritate my skin nor does it make my skin red. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be very careful what products I use to avoid breaking out. This one has been wonderful for cleansing my face. It smells a lot like &amp;#34;No More Tears&amp;#34; Shampoo, so it has a pleasing scent and is very handy with the pump dispenser on top..</li>
    <li> At first glance, this new cleanser seems to be a dream come true for those who have sensitive skin. It claims to be ultra gentle, hypoallergenic, dye-free, and soap free. And yet it unfortunately contains an overpowering fragrance. Does Neutrogena not realize that people with sensitive skin are also sensitive to fragrance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming ability of this product is very mild, so if you like a cleanser that gets really foamy, look elsewhere. But, the product does leave my skin soft after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Neutrogena had left the overpowering strong fragrance out, and made this a truly Ultra Gentle Cleanser for sensitive skin that was hypoallergenic, dye-free, soap free and fragrance free, then I would have given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I usually use the Neutrogena fresh foaming cleanser (in the blue bottle) but wanted to try this because my skin was super dry for a while. It didn&#x27;t make my skin feel squeaky like the more drying cleansers or oily like some of the cleansers marketed for dry skin. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t seem to be as good for removing makeup as the fresh foaming cleanser. In addition, it was easy to get too much product out of the pump each time. This cleanser did have a fragrance, but the scent disappeared immediately after rinsing away the product and didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I am already a fan of the Neutrogena product line.  I found this item to do exactly what it is professed to do.  The scent is not that noticeable and it does indeed wash with no irritation.  It left my skin feeling soft but without the dried out squeaky clean feeling of other products that I have tried. My skin is extremely sensitive especially around my face but this product did not make me break out or experience any type of negative reaction.  I would highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has come up with a wonderful daily cleanser that made my skin feel fresh after each use. Most facial cleaners are too petite for my liking, however this quanity will be certain to last me for quite a while. This is a product</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena products for years, so I was happy to have the opportunity to try this new, \\&quot;ultra gentle\\&quot; cleanser.  I am currently experiencing skin flare ups due to pregnancy, and I am happy to report that this cleanser IS extremely gentle and has not aggravated my sensitive skin at all.  My skin feels clean and fresh, without feeling tight and overly dried, and at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it has a \\&quot;film\\&quot; left on it, as is the case with some gentle cleansers.  I did notice that if I was wearing heavier eye make-up, I would have to go back and either wash my face again, or use make up remover after I had washed my face.  Now I just use eye make-up remover before hand, and I have not had any other problems.  This formula foams up well, so a 12oz bottle will last a while, even with twice a day showers.  I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a lightweight, gentle cleanser.</li>
    <li> This product from reputable company lives up to its reputation. It removes makeup with no residue or greasy feeling. This is a product we will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser and am very pleased with it. It has no smell that I can detect and it is not drying and is gentle on my skin. Some products I have used made my skin break out, but after using product for four weeks I have not had a problem. Also, the price is very reasonable so I can afford it. Will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I like how this product removes make up but I have very sensitive skin with a mild case of rosacea. This product leaves my skin very tight and with a burning sensation. I thought I would try something other than my Eucerin redness relief that I love but Eucerin has parabens. I&#x27;ll continue to look, this Neutrogena product isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> For an \\&quot;ultra gentle\\&quot; daily cleanser claiming to be for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, I would have assumed this product would be fragrance free. However, fragrance is listed in the ingredients. The product does seem to be dye-free, as I did not see any dyes listed in the ingredients and the product was clear when pumped out. If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend Simple over this product. Simple lists on the front of their products, \\&quot;no perfumes, no dyes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The general idea when manufacturing a cleanser that is marketed &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; is to keep out ingredients are common irritants to skin. I had high hopes for this cleanser - just what I have been needing - but nope, can&#x27;t use it. Some dope put perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claims to be &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34;. It is not. Perfume is a very common allergen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse yet, once on the skin, it is very difficult to wash off, like clingy. I couldn&#x27;t rinse it off with lots of water and it wouldn&#x27;t even come off when I scrubbed with a washcloth. It says &amp;#34;Rinses clean&amp;#34; but it doesn&#x27;t. So there I was with perfume on my face, couldn&#x27;t get it off, wondering whether my face would have one of its bad reactions and get red and swollen and ugly-coarse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to this product but can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin unless they know they don&#x27;t react badly to perfumed cleanser. Aside from the perfume issue, my face did feel soft and clean.</li>
    <li> For a basic daily cleanser this product is okay. I&#x27;m sure it got my face clean, but it didn&#x27;t leave it feeling noticeably smoother or softer. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend it over any other cleanser on the market.</li>
    <li> This product reads \\&quot;Foaming Formula\\&quot; on the bottle, but if you&#x27;re expecting a foaming wash in the sense that what you spray into your hand is foam then you will be disappointed. It is dispensed as a gel. Also, it is dye- and soap-free (which is good), but it is not fragrance-free and it does have a noticeable smell, so be careful if you&#x27;re sensitive to stuff like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that being said, this is a very good product, on par with Neutrogena&#x27;s classic orange face soap. One pump provides plenty of lather and a deep clean that is not too harsh, removes oil well and refreshes the face. Even waking in the morning after showering at night, one will find that the overnight build-up of oil and gunk will be minimal. In this size bottle you get a few more ounces than from the largest bottle of the orange liquid, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product from a trusted and established brand.</li>
    <li> The product has been used for over a month by my 19 yr-old daughter.  She normally uses \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; brands than Neutrogena but sings high praises for this product.  Coming home from a 5-6 hour stint on her feet waitressing in an indoor/outdoor restaurant, her skin can feel pretty grimy.  This product is something she enjoys using and really endorses, keeping in mind previous cleansers were either the RiteAid brand or its price competitors.</li>
    <li> really like this product, doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell. Gentle. Will purchase again. Product cleans facial skin well without over drying.</li>
    <li> it is exactly what you think it is.  its wonderful and it leaves your skin feeling so soft but no greasy residue.  its worth the money and i didnt think it would be.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea, so my face is extremely sensitive. I had tried every product on the market for Rosacea, and even the ones that people raved about would burn my face and eyes. For awhile I was just washing my face with oil, but missed the convenience of a pump bottle in the shower. I first tried the anti-redness line, and I was shocked to see the ingredients in them! The cream wash actually has alpha hydroxy which definitely causes redness in even normal skin. I was nervous about trying this product since I saw the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;, but I was amazed with how good it felt on my face. There is no burning at all, my face actually feels clean, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and it smells great. Definitely give it a try if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Just an FYI to those of us with super sensitive skin, this broke me out in welts.  I have no idea what&#x27;s in it that caused such a reaction, but I&#x27;m leaving this feedback so that Neutrogena will hopefully do something constructive with the feedback since it has labeled this product as \\&quot;Ultra Gentle\\&quot;.  It could have been the fragrance in this product, I&#x27;m not sure, but I had to use it as a hand-wash, and even then, I&#x27;ll get an occasional red blister-like bump on one or both of my hands.  I gave it two stars because at least it&#x27;s SLS-free, and it did a better job at taking my makeup off than Cetaphil.</li>
    <li> This really is gentle and the smell is nice and light. I use twice a day, morning and evening. Take it from a girl who can&#x27;t live without black eyeliner/shadow - it&#x27;s good for taking off eye make up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip I&#x27;d pass on is this : a little goes a long way. A full pump is too much unless your face is a large pizza. A pea-sized amount is plenty for me. Rinse off well as it can make you blow nose bubbles!</li>
    <li> Tried this face wash, and right away I noticed it has somewhat of a strong scent.  I would think for it to be for sensitive skin, that it would at least be fragrance free.  After washing my face with it, my skin felt extremely tight, and I was literally running for face cream.  I ended up giving it to my daughter to use since I didn&#x27;t want to waste the money.  It has not helped with her acne.  I will be searching for something else for my sensitive face, and my daughter doesn&#x27;t care for this face wash either.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser as an alternative to the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cleanser (the regular formula, not the foaming kind) &amp; this is just awful. I thought it was something else that was causing the irritation, but after taking a heaping handful of it &amp; scrubbing my face with it my face began to BURN &amp; was bright red when I was through. I also got welts. Never again. The regular formula is amazing &amp; does exactly what it promises. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this one to make me have such a dramatic reaction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the wonderful Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser product for over a decade, and I think its one of the reasons that I look 10 years younger than my friends.  I liked the idea of having a product with fewer ingredients, so I decided to try their New Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser.  My skin felt dryer, like something was alcoholic.  Upon looking at the ingredients, I saw the third ingredient was cetearyl alcohol (after water and glycerin).  No wonder!  I really dislike cetearyl alcohol.  You might as well use the popular Cetaphil Cleanser which is loaded with it, and which is an even sorrier excuse for a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; product.  The mad scientists/dermatologists who have been pushing cetearyl alcohol should be working for Monsanto.  Stick to the Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser (my favorite), or go with something like \\&quot;California Baby, Super Sensitive Shampoo &amp; Bodywash\\&quot; if you want nicer ingredients.</li>
    <li> The Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser comes in a very generous sized container.  The pump makes it easy to use and the foaming formula means you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get good results.  It does a good job of removing makeup and hasn&#x27;t made my skin as dry as soap will, but I still have to moisturize.  The only thing I really don&#x27;t like is that it has a fragrance.  I&#x27;m somewhat sensitive to fragrance and so I try to never put anything with a fragrance on my face and I was surprised that a product billed as Ultra Gentle and Hypoallergenic would contain a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Neutrogena were to make this cleanser without fragrance I would probably purchase it again, but for now, I will stick to a fragrance-free cleanser.  If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to fragrance, then this cleanser would probably work quite well for you.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so it&#x27;s difficult to find products that work with my skin. I usually use CeraVe&#x27;s hydrating cleanser because it&#x27;s fragrance-free and contains hyaluronic acid, which is recommended when you&#x27;re in your late 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra-Gentle Daily Cleanser and decided to give it a try. Although it contains fragrance, it wasn&#x27;t over-bearing and it didn&#x27;t affect my skin. The cleanser is very mild and gentle and left my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually find foaming cleansers are drying, but this one wasn&#x27;t. Some other positives were that the pump bottle was easy to use and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick to using CeraVe, but I was pleasantly surprised with this product and will definitely use it again. Neutrogena is a great brand and I really like that they&#x27;re less pricier than others and do offer products for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me Neutrogena is a synonym for high quality and I am already a fan of their facial and body creams. I have been using this product for cleaning my face as part of my morning routine and I am quite pleased with it. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves it very nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my skin or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;- I like the delicate fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s easy to use and good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product description says that it removes makeup but I find that there is still some left after washing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I&#x27;ll use this cleanser for my everyday face wash since I like the way my skin feels refreshed and so soft afterwards. For deep makeup removal, I&#x27;ll continue with [[ASIN:B005TI7LHS Simple Cleansing Facial Wipes, 25 Count (Pack of 2)]], with which I am already very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, cleans makeup off well. Leaves skin soft. Will not buy any other product.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s an exact quote from my dermatologist two days ago. She said it contains fragrance, and most fragrances contain a bad type of alcohol, so throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never thought I was sensitive to fragrance, but she said that since we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s causing my outbreak, it&#x27;s best to avoid all possible irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena makes a product very similar to this (even the bottle is identical) that contains NO fragrance. This other product is [[ASIN:B00F1D56HI Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Hydrating Cleanser]]. I had recently purchased a bottle and used it a few times before visiting the dermatologist, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get her to check it out and approve it yet, so I&#x27;m currently using [[ASIN:B000FFT8KS Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser]] instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She instructed me to stop using everything I&#x27;d been using, and stick to the products she was recommending or giving me samples of. Anything containing fragrance is off-limits.&lt;br /&gt;She recommended CereVe products (which I already have) and RestoraDerm products (which I had tried and had an adverse reaction to).&lt;br /&gt;I left with a few prescriptions and a bag of sample products, several of which are from VaniCream (whom I&#x27;d never heard of before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this product (or thinking about it), you obviously have skin issues, so it may be in your best interest to avoid this and others that contain fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, try the Hydrating Cleanser, Cetaphil, or one of the other products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her instructions included this list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID:&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil, lanolin (Aquaphor, Eucerin), vitamin E oil, scented products, colored products, antibacterial products, anti-aging products, salicylic acid products, and scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;These items frequently worsen skin problems in folks with compromised skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BODY:&lt;br /&gt;Soap options: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, Dove unscented bar soap for sensitive skin, or VaniCream bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion options: Aveeno Daily moisturizer, Vaseline ointment (sticky but very effective) or VaniCream brand ointment/cream (sticky but no allergens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FACE:&lt;br /&gt;Soap options: CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser, CereVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser or Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash (I&#x27;m not sure why Purpose is recommended, because it contains fragrance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion options: CereVe Moisturizing Lotion, Vaseline ointment, VaniCream ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HANDS:&lt;br /&gt;Soap options: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, CereVe Hydrating Cleanser, Aquanil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion options: Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion, Vaseline ointment, VaniCream ointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR:&lt;br /&gt;Free &amp; Clear shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: During a follow-up visit last week, the dr. gave approval to use any of the Aveeno products. I told her I&#x27;d been using the [[ASIN:B003O7IBZC Aveeno Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream]], and that I had a bottle of [[ASIN:B0054J2GT0 Aveeno Baby Cleansing Therapy Moisturizing Wash]] and [[ASIN:B0030UB9PW Aveeno Baby Soothing Relief Cream Wash]] at home.&lt;br /&gt;She said all of them should be fine, but she still suggested I stick to Cetaphil or [[ASIN:B0000ZHOEU Free &amp; Clear Liquid Cleanser]] (by VaniCream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was very adamant that regardless of which cleanser and moisturizer I choose, I use ONE and stick to it, not keep switching off as I&#x27;d been doing, because switching makes it difficult to narrow down the cause of the problem if I should break out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I appear to be sensitive to hyaluronic acid, and it seems that many CereVe products contain it.&lt;br /&gt;The dr. had told me during my appointment to stop using anything containing hyaluronic acid, so I was surprised when I discovered that the lotion I&#x27;d bought contained it.&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I&#x27;m not sure this very young dr. knew what she was doing, and she left PeaceHealth soon after my visit.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t tell someone to stop using something, and thenrecommend products that contain it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really weird but this \\&quot;Ultra Calm\\&quot; cleanser actually hurts my skin!!!!  I am so surprised - I&#x27;m not sure what it is that hurts it since it&#x27;s supposed to be a very sensitive product but it burns.  It also does not have good foaming and doesn&#x27;t remove my eye makeup well.  My skin also doesn&#x27;t feel totally clean after using it.  I don&#x27;t think I can even get through the whole bottle.  Definitely do not recommend.</li>
    <li> The neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser does a fine job of effectively cleaning my face, leaving in soft and well... clean feeling. There is a slight tingling sensation, however, which some may find uncomfortable. I found this product to be good for my skin, which tends to be a little oily. thanks neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this one. I usually love Neutrogena products. This one left me a bit wanting. It didn&#x27;t have a clean after feel and I broke out the next morning. Maybe I need less Ultra Gentle and more Ultra Cleaning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m generally impressed with Neutrogena&#x27;s products. In this case, however, I don&#x27;t think this non-soap product works any differently than soap would. I don&#x27;t feel like my face has been any cleaner since I started using it. In fact, even though the packaging explicitly states that this product won&#x27;t clog pores, it won&#x27;t unclog them, either. This would be fine for someone who has very sensitive skin or is allergic to soap, but to me, with fairly normal skin (just a little sensitive) and using it in the summer, when sweating is a major concern, I don&#x27;t think it cleans deeply enough. It probably works fine if you use it in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0009EILI0 Biore Pore Perfect Combo Pack Deep Cleansing Pore Strips , 14 strips [7 face + 7 nose strips]]] or something similar, but otherwise, you&#x27;re not going to get a very thorough clean.</li>
    <li> First, some background:  I&#x27;m twenty-five years old and I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne breakouts since my junior year of high school.  The first two years were really bad, but over time it&#x27;s mellowed out.  I&#x27;m still classified by my dermatologist as having \\&quot;adult acne,\\&quot; but all I have to worry about these days is a small area of skin on the right side of my chin.  That said, if I miss just one day of treating my skin with prescribed solutions and lotions, I will wake up the next morning with a terrible breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, before I apply my prescription treatments, I have to make sure my face is very clean.  Previously I had been using Clean &amp; Clear Foaming Facial Cleanser.  It got the job done as far as the breakouts went, but there were some drawbacks.  First, the smell was pretty awful.  More importantly though, it left my skin (particularly around my nose) very dry and sore - almost like frostbite.  It could even appear enflamed at times.  I actually had to get my dermatologist to prescribe some Desonide Lotion, just to treat the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser smells infinitely better than the Clean &amp; Clear, and, while it does leave a bit of facial tightening afterward, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out anywhere near as badly.  I also have to say that the Amazon price is a great deal.  This is a pretty substantial bottle of cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I&#x27;m sold as a convert.  I&#x27;m trading in the Clean &amp; Clear for Neutrogena.  I can&#x27;t afford the cleanser my dermatologist sells over-the-counter at $30 a bottle, but this will certainly suffice.</li>
    <li> Safe and gentle. I use this before and after chemical peel treatments.</li>
    <li> I have tried a variety of face washes and while some have worked better than others, I feel this one, while maybe not the best, is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this brand/kind of cleanser does just that: cleanses. It - the gel - is soft to the touch, gentle on the face, a little bit goes a LONG way, it doesn&#x27;t get too foamy/overly \\&quot;fizzy\\&quot; after rubbing it on the face, and, for me, I feel it helps moisten my face. *Recently, within the past month or so, my skin has been becoming oilier, and this product doesn&#x27;t dry it out - as others have done before - and it keeps the skin soft and clean. Thus far, as far as I can see, it isn&#x27;t one of those \\&quot;dramatically reduces acne\\&quot; kind of cleansers, but I don&#x27;t doubt it will help prevent the build-up of dirt and junk that do lead to acne, and when acne DOES start to form, then it will help keep the skin around the acne clean so there is no spreading. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If someone were to ask me if they should use it, I would recommend it. Granted, it&#x27;s nothing to rave about or go to the store to buy out all of their stock, but I can see this being a worthwhile investment, considering anything and everything positive about it and how much there is of it in just one container, and that what you do get will last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I&#x27;ve only washed my face with it once a day, but I just might see if using it twice a day doesn&#x27;t help my skin - and I&#x27;m going for overall health &amp; feel - even more.&lt;br /&gt;*I can post an addendum update later, too, to let people know how I fare with the frequency of using this product. :)</li>
    <li> I originally said this was a good cleanser, after a week.  I liked sulfate free and mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong!  My skin began to negatively react to the cleanser on day 5.  I thought it was something else, but no, it&#x27;s this cleanser.  My face is peeling and raw.  Not to mention PAINFUL.  Day 4 after I stopped using, and my face is still peeling, raw, and painful.  Ultra gentle is very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My face is still a mess, after nearly 30 days, and I decided to contact Neutrogena, customer service.  They were very helpful, pleasant, and cooperative.  They were glad I contacted them.  There is not much they can do, but they took the time to listen, and swore they would feedback the information to their quality control and their laboratories.</li>
    <li> I used this for 2 weeks before deciding to chuck it. I think it cleanses well, but is rather drying.I would use a tiny dab form the pump and my face would be dry and tightening after a few seconds form rinsing. I noticed an increase of oil in my normally oily combination skin during the day, and I think it&#x27;s because this wash strips too much off your face, forcing your pores to produce more oil than necessary. Not a good thing for someone with combo/oily prone skin already. It was so bad I&#x27;d have to wipe my eyes with a wet tissue midday because the oil stings my face....I actually used to have to do that a lot before I started using aArio Badescu&#x27;s Enzyme Gel cleanser for 3 solid months, but for some reason I decided to try this product from my derm&#x27;s sample jar. Big mistake on my part. Going back to Mario; no stripping or oily face from that product. Don&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> Gentle, lightly scented cleanser that did a good job removing my makeup which is a feat in itself.  No allergic reactions, break outs or dry skin.  It says it foams but mine did not it was the consistency of clear hand soap with the same kind of pump on top.  Honestly the best part is that it&#x27;s a big bottle for $8 or $9 that has lasted me 3 months and I use it at least once a day and usually twice a day.</li>
    <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam quite as much as you might expect, but it is possible to work it into a bubbly creamy cleanser on your hands before putting it on your face.  The scent is pleasant.  I felt it did a good job removing makeup.  Many cleansers do far worse.  I&#x27;d love it if it felt a tiny bit more moist after use, but the clean feel is nice.  And I usually use a moisturizer anyway after cleansing.</li>
    <li> This product is actually very good.  It isn&#x27;t flashy--there is no real scent and it isn&#x27;t colored.  It is very basic.  The consistency is what makes it special.  It is a lovely, thick gel that really makes your skin feel clean and fresh.  I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate me in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company ethics are what makes me give this a 3.  For some reason, I didn&#x27;t realize Neutrogena was tested on animals because I think of them as a rather pure line.  I commend them for launching the Neutrogena Naturals line that does not test on animals for the most part, though they do include a line about not testing unless required by law.  Some geographic locations require this.  This, to me, is not really a commitment NOT to test on animals, but rather a marketing gimmick to sell to people that don&#x27;t want products that aren&#x27;t cruelty free.  It just means they won&#x27;t ALWAYS test on animals.  The parent company does test on animals as well.  Animal testing, to me, is the antithesis of pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With so many products out there that are just as good that have a better commitment to eliminate unnecessary testing on animals, I&#x27;d pass on buying this one again until they make a full commitment, not one that is ambiguous with some pretty big loop holes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m normally a huge fan of Neutrogena products, but am disappointed with this one.  I have sensitive skin, so am always on the look-out for a good gentle cleanser.  This isn&#x27;t it.  It&#x27;s gentle, non-irritating and left my skin feeling soft, but it didn&#x27;t provide a deep clean.  After washing my face with this product, I used a cleansing cloth which removed makeup residue.  If I clean my face with a make-up remover before washing my face, it works fine, but I don&#x27;t want the extra step - I prefer a product that is capable of a thorough clean in one shot.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily cleanser is a new development by this company which is a great facial cleaner. Not only is it gentle on the face, but has a clean, refreshing smell! This product will leave your face feeling clean and does not irritate the skin. An added bonus is the pump they give you. It makes it very easy to get the cleaner out of the bottle and you can control the amount you get so there is very little waste.  My wife really loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend since she would use it more. This is her review: This is a great product that cleans well without over drying your skin. It doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup that well, but other than that, a great cleanser.</li>
    <li> works great for fair skin, or for people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a Neutrogena product. I tend to like their products so I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a pump, so it is easy to apply. Following the instructions, you lather it with water. The first impression was the nice sweet smell that comes with the product. The next feeling was the sense of clean my face had after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product because I really liked the feeling it left in my skin. Some people might not like the smell.</li>
    <li> I have mature extra dry skin. I use this daily. It is by far the only and I say only cleanser that does not dry my skin and make it tight. I am a junkie for trying things and believe me, I have not budged since I found this! If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle skin care line so I went out and bought this face wash. I called her back after I had used it for a week as my face was burning and it wasn&#x27;t helping with my acne. Turns out there are two kinds of this product; foaming and hydrating. She wanted me to use the hydrating. This one has fragrance in it which can irritate skin. It certainly irritated mine! I was incredibly frustrated as this isn&#x27;t cheap in CVS which is where I bought it. I would not recommend this product to people who are sensitive to fragrances in products.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical when I purchased this product, but it definitely removed a considerable amount of makeup and eye makeup. Enough for me to give the product two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Very gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> (A review from my wife) I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work on my face as I have oily skin that is prone to breaking out.  I used this cleanser to wash my face after having worn make-up all day.  I then used my acne cleaning pads.  Usually these are really grimy from stuff having been left behind.  The pad came back almost completely clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I even like the very light scent.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t foam like I expected it to.  After using Aveda&#x27;s foaming cleanser, I thought there&#x27;d be actual foam with Neutrogena, but there wasn&#x27;t.  Since it says on the label that it leaves no residue, I didn&#x27;t use a toner for the first few weeks.  My skin started breaking out far more than usual.  I went back to using a toner and discovered quite a bit of residue is left behind by this Neutrogena cleanser.  I was pretty disappointed overall.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this cleanser at first- I&#x27;ve heard about it and immediately came to Amazon to read reviews before I bought it- I&#x27;m used to using Dermalogica Special Cleansing Gel- this is very similar to that- I too don&#x27;t have a tolerance for strong smells- it does have a fragrance but it does&#x27;t bother me at all- infact, I only noticed the first couple times- but now it smells clean &amp; fresh- it does exactly what it says for less then half the price I usually pay for Dermalogica- doesn&#x27;t strip my skin or dry me out or make me oily- I have combo skin and this cleanser seems to make everything even out- I really like it- it takes off my makeup super easily- I will wash twice to make sure it&#x27;s all gone, then follow up with a scrub- I have horses and am usually really dirty by the evening from working them and and working in the backyard- if you came here to read about it, it&#x27;s worth a try, won&#x27;t make a big dent in your pocket book buying a bottle-</li>
    <li> I use this product in the shower everyday.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser because I needed something less drying for the winter months for my acne prone skin instead of the brand I usually use. Haven&#x27;t been a big fan of Cetaphil so when I saw the ad in a magazine I thought I would give this cleanser a try. It seemed fine at first, not too drying and seemed to remove my makeup pretty well.  About 2 weeks in I started breaking out badly, especially on my cheeks and chin.  I gave up after 1 month and returned the cleanser to CVS to get a refund.  While my face is still broken out, (only stopped the product a week ago) it seems to be finally letting up.  In Neutrogena&#x27;s defense, it doesn&#x27;t claim to be an acne cleanser so maybe for some individuals it is fine.  Just not for me. :(</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Works just as well as Philosophy&#x27;s Purity, but for about 1/4 of the cost. Takes off all my make up without leaving my skin feeling too dry or tight.</li>
    <li> Title pretty much says it all. This is the best cleanser I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;m a self-proclaimed product junkie. I normally shy away from grocery store cleansers (marketing for the high end stuff always sucked me in), but wanted to simplify my overall skin care regime (and not spend as much). This cleanser is a gem. Absolutely no faults with it for my acne-prone, although dry, skin. No parabens (I&#x27;m paranoid about them) or lots of other junk in it. I would have picked up Cetaphil&#x27;s gentle cleanser (because I love, love, love, their moisturizing cream), but it has parabens - argh! Anyway, this turned out to be a great buy and I&#x27;m very happy. I&#x27;ve given my friends my Roche Posay, Shu Uemura and Shiseido cleansers. I&#x27;m a lifer for this, assuming they don&#x27;t change it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice now. Each time the bottle leaked. The bottle is wrapped in a plastic bag to catch leaks. My first order the bottle leaked about an ounce which was contained within the plastic bag. The bottle had to be washed because it was covered by the leaked cleanser. My last order leaked about two ounces and the plastic bag failed to contain the leak. The cleanser had leaked through the plastic bag and into the manila envelope. What a mess! Neutrogena needs to find a better way of packaging this item for shipment. Maybe separate the pump from the bottle and seal the bottle with a tight cap?</li>
    <li> I tried this because I had such good results with Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Extra Gentle\\&quot; cleanser (which is more of a cream) and wanted to see what this gel was like, especially since the name and marketing indicated it was even more gentle than the cream cleanser. Big mistake. It is definitely great for removing makeup if that&#x27;s your main goal, but if your skin is dry, sensitive, and/or acne-prone, I believe you should avoid this cleanser like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I check ingredients in all the skin care products I use to make sure there are no irritants or pore-clogging ingredients so I&#x27;m very familiar with all the chemicals on the labels of products, and this one seemed great on all counts, until I actually tried it! Within a few days of using it morning and evening, with no other changes in my skin care routine, my face was red and blotchy, felt painfully dry and tight, and I had acne breakouts all around my mouth, on my chin, and down from the sides of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser contains added fragrance, which is just outright terrible for any product claiming to be \\&quot;ultra gentle\\&quot; or aimed at those with sensitive skin. Fragrance is usually the first thing that gets left out of any product designed for sensitivity - for good reason! This cleanser will also sting your eyes if you are not careful (and if you get any in your mouth when you wash it off, you&#x27;ll really regret it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this bottle went straight into the bin after a week, and now that I have returned to the Extra Gentle cream cleanser instead, my face is starting to clear up from all the damage caused. Never again. Sorry Neutrogena, this should never have been labeled \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; no matter what the ingredients are.</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t necessarily super sensitive, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try! Unfortunately, my skin was sensitive to this ultra gentle cleanser. After the first use, the skin on my forehead, cheeks, and the sides of my face broke out in a bumpy rash. Two days after that first face-washing, the bumps still hadn&#x27;t gone away, and I had to resort to a slathering of 1% hydrocortisone cream, which has caused the bumps to recede slightly. There seems to be several other users who have experienced this problem, and attribute this hypersensitivity to the fragrance in the wash (which is a bit cloying), so I hope Neutrogena is receptive and working to improve their formula.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cleanser for oily, sensitive skin. I am not sure what others are smelling, but I didn&#x27;t find this product to have a strong fragrance at all. Removes makeup and the pump bottle is perfect for the shower. I am going to try the hydrating version next.</li>
    <li> I normally use Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Made Simple to cleanse and remove makeup, but I wanted to give this a try since it&#x27;s less expensive.  It does remove makeup completely and there was no irritation even when rubbing around my eyes to get off mascara.  The scent is pretty strong, heavy citrus/rose more like in cleaning products than skin care.  Also, it completely strips the oils from the skin, so my face felt overly tight after using.  I prefer the soft, moisturized fee my skin has after using Purity, so I will be going back to Philosophy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve used their bar soaps in the past &amp; am a fan of their hair products.  This product is hypo-allergenic &amp; dye free &amp; even soap free.  It&#x27;s list of ingredients is quite small; however, it does include items I can&#x27;t pronounce nor have any idea about what they are.  It says it&#x27;s a foaming formula, but it doesn&#x27;t foam much.  It does leave one&#x27;s skin feeling very clean &amp; smooth.  I liked it on the whole, but didn&#x27;t find myself raving over it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser says it is ultra gentle, and truly is- in that it is so gentle it will NOT wash your makeup off. I had to use a toner before and after cleansing to fully remove the eye-shadow I was wearing. It actually made the makeup more stubborn and harder to wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also other reviewers noted there was a scent- some said there was not. Let me make it clear there is a VERY distinct and STRONG Lemon/Lemon Grass scent to this. It is not unscented so I don&#x27;t even know how they could label this as hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, and has not broken out or reacted yet to this cleanser, but I&#x27;m not thrilled as I have been in the past with my Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel cleanser. Which was great until it got discontinued of course. This will have to do for now.</li>
