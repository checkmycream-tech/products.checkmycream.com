### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
      <li>This is the best product ever</li>
      <li>Adding 15 drops to a bottle of any brand of chemical haircolour (including those not specifically made for gray) makes them cover even the silver hairs around my face perfectly.</li>
      <li>with this product i am free of coloring my gray hair for up to 8 weeks!!!!</li>
      <li>w/ Age Beautiful and L&#x27;Oreal 30 developer.</li>
      <li>This works great with any hair color product I have tried.  </li>
      <li>or so when I couldn&#x27;t find it and that time without it just reconfirmed for me that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>All areas were bright orange  </li>
      <li>I use Clairol Beautiful Reds, which is a temporary color that rinses out after so many shampoos.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>effect on the silver is really magical!</li>
      <li>An amazing product.</li>
      <li>Gray Magic Drops work so good with your coloring method to cover the gray.  </li>
      <li>Now adding a good number of drops of Gray Magic (put in more than they say if you&#x27;ve got silver to cover) to a bottle of hair dye does the most amazing thing.</li>
      <li>I have a good bit of gray hair that is resistent to accepting hair color and fades quickly.  </li>
      <li>As an added bonus, the &#x27;temporary&#x27; dye stays on ALL of my hair until it&#x27;s time for a root touch-up - Gray Magic is THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my case, though, it&#x27;d be silver magic.</li>
      <li>I always put it in to be sure those stubborn grays are covered.  </li>
      <li>Tried it again with gray magic and it worked.</li>
      <li>I purchased Ardell Gray Magic at the suggestion of the salesperson.</li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>I love them.....  </li>
      <li>This is easy to use and works even better than I had hoped.  </li>
      <li>My father was prematurely gray at a young age, but his full head of hair was majestically a brilliant silver.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions precisely, but could tell no difference in gray coverage.</li>
      <li>I have used this twice so far, and the results are good.  </li>
      <li>way I color my hair is probably unique, too.</li>
      <li>I notice that my red fades  a good</li>
      <li>Somehow this product allows the dye to penetrate the gray hair better and it really retains the color.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really does help graying hair hold the color better.</li>
      <li>My very resistant gray is accepting color better, but it does leave a reddish hue...not the end of the world, but I would rather not have the brassiness.</li>
      <li>To be fair, it does have limitations in that it has red tones</li>
      <li>I add 8-10 drops of Gray Magic to my L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme hair color and it really does the trick.  </li>
      <li>next time I colored my hair, I doubled the amount of Ardell Gray Magic hoping it would cover better.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of clearing out the grey while at the same time it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>The silver is around my face, like a frame; the Gray Magic makes this temporary hair dye stick like glue to my silver hair, turning them into what looks like professional balayage-like highlights that do not rinse away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I, of course, take protective measures to help keep the color true - don&#x27;t wash in hot water, use sulfate-free shampoo, condition every wash, and don&#x27;t over shampoo my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really useful as it hold color</li>
      <li>exactly as described.</li>
      <li>cannot recommend Gray Magic highly enough!</li>
      <li>I just tried Gray Magic, and it actually worked!  </li>
      <li>I might add that without the Gray Magic, the dye on the silver of my hair wouldn&#x27;t last two weeks.</li>
      <li>There are very few things that are better than the hype you hear, and one of them is Gray Magic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little bit sparkly red against the mass of brunette hair, and it just looks incredible.</li>
      <li>But for anyone else it&#x27;s worth a try especially for the price since it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair any more than colouring normally would.</li>
      <li>price is reasonable</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference but was recommended from a hair dresser friend.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>it really works well</li>
      <li>I have very color resistant hairs.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfy , I recommended for your hair colour</li>
      <li>I keep ordering from Amazon because of the price and fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for something to keep your color from fading so quickly.</li>
      <li>decent product.  </li>
      <li>Does a decent job in helping to color grays.  </li>
      <li>would recommand it highly.</li>
      <li>(And a little hint: it&#x27;s about five bucks at Sally Beauty Supply, and you can do even better if you use a coupon.)</li>
      <li>I use every other visit to my colorist because my hair grows out quickly.</li>
      <li>When I went into beauty supply store to inquire salesperson said she thought it was clear when it came from package.</li>
      <li>Where my hair is white, the color is much lighter.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really does help the permanent color to last longer on my hair.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the size one mucho smaller in retail store if they hsve it cost jus as much.</li>
      <li>hair color stays true with less fading even up to the time for each monthly hair cut with only the new growth showing.</li>
      <li>I put a few drops of this into my hair color and my hair came out black and it didn&#x27;t cover the roots any better than just using the color alone.</li>

<li> Not sure this does much .</li>
<li> One bottle lasts a LONG time</li>
<li> My hairdresser recommended this product to help my Clairol semi-permanent coloring cover my increasing grey.  </li>
<li> I still fade to grey at the temples.  </li>
<li> helps prolong the color and not have the grey show after two weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> With this liquid, my hair color covered ALL of my grey.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m too afraid to color my hair without Grey Magic</li>
<li> The drops are a dark brown color tending toward a red hue</li>
<li> I have black hair with a blue sheen.  </li>
<li> It was becoming frustrating to say the least.</li>
<li> I was having trouble getting henna to cover my grays only to switch to chemical colour and find out that would not work either.</li>
<li> I do that on purpose, so I never get a sharp line of demarcation as my hair grows in.</li>
<li> My grays usually start popping back after 2 weeks of washing from the time I dye my hair.</li>
<li> 25%-  50% less over time while using this.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m one of those weird people that like my blonde hair color to make my hair look blonde though.</li>
<li> I put a few drops in to try, less then the instructions say and it turned my hair black.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> It was waste of money!</li>
<li> At least until I got Gray</li>
<li> The idiotic girl who worked there gave me the single-use packet, and I didn&#x27;t now it wasn&#x27;t for blonde hair dye</li>
<li> This product works on my irritating stubborn greys and my color</li>
<li> The solution to a serious beauty emergency!</li>
<li> but I did note not perfectly.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
<li> Bad batch?  </li>
<li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work with semi/demi permanent color.</li>
<li> I was quite disappointed after trying this color additive.</li>

    <li> Gray Magic Drops work so good with your coloring method to cover the gray.  I love them.....  I keep ordering from Amazon because of the price and fast shipping.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does help the permanent color to last longer on my hair. My grays usually start popping back after 2 weeks of washing from the time I dye my hair. This solution literally hides the gray until there&#x27;s enough roots to have to re-dye, which is 6-8 weeks!! Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work with semi/demi permanent color.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever and I&#x27;ve been using it for years now.&lt;br /&gt;It helps prolong the color and not have the grey show after two weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommand it highly.</li>
    <li> Love this.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It does a great job of clearing out the grey while at the same time it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference but was recommended from a hair dresser friend.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference...doesn&#x27;t seem to make my color last any longer than without adding this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. It makes your hair color darker and it does NOT cover white hair. It was waste of money!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to help my Clairol semi-permanent coloring cover my increasing grey.  I have used it for several years, and it works as advertised.  Won&#x27;t color without it now.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get this from Amazon, but I did get it from Sally Beauty. It made my hair look like someone put an orange-ish tinted diarrhea in my blonde hair color. I&#x27;m one of those weird people that like my blonde hair color to make my hair look blonde though. The idiotic girl who worked there gave me the single-use packet, and I didn&#x27;t now it wasn&#x27;t for blonde hair dye (although she should have known!).</li>
    <li> Really useful as it hold color but I did note not perfectly.  I have black hair with a blue sheen.  Where my hair is white, the color is much lighter.  Still...</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in to try, less then the instructions say and it turned my hair black.  I am all gray in the front and have been using the same 6N color for years.  I put a few drops of this into my hair color and my hair came out black and it didn&#x27;t cover the roots any better than just using the color alone.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does help graying hair hold the color better. I haven&#x27;t colored without it for years EXCEPT for 6 months or so when I couldn&#x27;t find it and that time without it just reconfirmed for me that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and works even better than I had hoped.  I have very color resistant hairs.  With this liquid, my hair color covered ALL of my grey.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> exactly as described. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I had some much gray hair and tried to color it without this gray magic and it was disastrous. Tried it again with gray magic and it worked. Just add 10 drops for every ounce, then shake and apply..you won&#x27;t regret it. Thanks</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the size one mucho smaller in retail store if they hsve it cost jus as much. It does help prolong color.</li>
    <li> An amazing product. Add to your quality boxed hair color to help aid with gray coverage. I use every other visit to my colorist because my hair grows out quickly.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice so far, and the results are good.  My very resistant gray is accepting color better, but it does leave a reddish hue...not the end of the world, but I would rather not have the brassiness.</li>
    <li> The solution to a serious beauty emergency! I was having trouble getting henna to cover my grays only to switch to chemical colour and find out that would not work either. It was becoming frustrating to say the least. This product was a miracle for me! Adding 15 drops to a bottle of any brand of chemical haircolour (including those not specifically made for gray) makes them cover even the silver hairs around my face perfectly. To be fair, it does have limitations in that it has red tones so I do not think it word work on someone who is using say, a platinum blonde which is why I give it only 4 stars. But for anyone else it&#x27;s worth a try especially for the price since it doesn&#x27;t damage your hair any more than colouring normally would.</li>
    <li> Home hair color did not work to cover my white hairs.  Only salon hair dye would work.  I just tried Gray Magic, and it actually worked!  Now I can touch up my roots in between salon visits.</li>
    <li> There are very few things that are better than the hype you hear, and one of them is Gray Magic. It is a miracle in a bottle that actually works. I&#x27;ve been usiing this for years, and I buy it in quantity - I couldn&#x27;t do without this anymore than I could do without hair dye!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, though, it&#x27;d be silver magic. My father was prematurely gray at a young age, but his full head of hair was majestically a brilliant silver. I inherited his eyes, his gait, and the premature silver hair around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now trying to cover gray hair is enough of a trick, but sparkly silver? NOTHING sticks to silver hair. At least until I got Gray Magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I color my hair is probably unique, too. I use Clairol Beautiful Reds, which is a temporary color that rinses out after so many shampoos. I do that on purpose, so I never get a sharp line of demarcation as my hair grows in. It all sort of blends. With the Clairol product, it will not lighten your hair, it just deposits color on the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a brunette, and I add a mix of Clairol shades to get a winey/red/brunette mix. Now adding a good number of drops of Gray Magic (put in more than they say if you&#x27;ve got silver to cover) to a bottle of hair dye does the most amazing thing. The silver is around my face, like a frame; the Gray Magic makes this temporary hair dye stick like glue to my silver hair, turning them into what looks like professional balayage-like highlights that do not rinse away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect on the silver is really magical! It&#x27;s a little bit sparkly red against the mass of brunette hair, and it just looks incredible. I might add that without the Gray Magic, the dye on the silver of my hair wouldn&#x27;t last two weeks. As an added bonus, the &#x27;temporary&#x27; dye stays on ALL of my hair until it&#x27;s time for a root touch-up - Gray Magic is THAT good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend Gray Magic highly enough! (And a little hint: it&#x27;s about five bucks at Sally Beauty Supply, and you can do even better if you use a coupon.)</li>
    <li> I still fade to grey at the temples.  I&#x27;m too afraid to color my hair without Grey Magic so I have nothing to compare.</li>
    <li> This works great with any hair color product I have tried.  I always put it in to be sure those stubborn grays are covered.  I refer this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I was quite disappointed after trying this color additive. I followed the directions precisely, but could tell no difference in gray coverage. I use Developlus Satin color and 20 volume developer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next time I colored my hair, I doubled the amount of Ardell Gray Magic hoping it would cover better. However, it still didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these results, I decided to try Developlus Cover Gray Developer, also sold on Amazon. It works!</li>
    <li> Very satisfy , I recommended for your hair colour</li>
    <li> Not sure this does much . I don&#x27;t notice a difference With hair .</li>
    <li> decent product.  price is reasonable</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this product for years when we color our hair at home.  It helps hold the semi-permanent color longer and keeps it from fading before the next coloring.  Somehow this product allows the dye to penetrate the gray hair better and it really retains the color.  The drops are a dark brown color tending toward a red hue but it doesn&#x27;t make your hair red or even have a reddish tint when finished.  I use an auburn dye and my husband a medium brown dye and the color is not altered by these drops.  I would definitely recommend this product if you are looking for something to keep your color from fading so quickly.</li>
    <li> This product works on my irritating stubborn greys and my color seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> Amazingly enough it seems to actually work.  I notice that my red fades  a good 25%-  50% less over time while using this.  One bottle lasts a LONG time</li>
    <li> with this product i am free of coloring my gray hair for up to 8 weeks!!!! it really works well</li>
    <li> I purchased Ardell Gray Magic at the suggestion of the salesperson. Never used it before. Opened packet, color was orange. Mixed it w/ Age Beautiful and L&#x27;Oreal 30 developer. All areas were bright orange  where applied. Washed it off after 20 minutes, clown orange, looked like my granddaughters hair chalk. Worked for hours re coloring, washing, repeat. Can manage till I get to salon for repair. Have been coloring hair for 40 years, NEVER an experience like this. When I went into beauty supply store to inquire salesperson said she thought it was clear when it came from package. Bad batch?  Wish I had taken a photo, too panicked to think anything but get it OFF me!</li>
    <li> Does a decent job in helping to color grays.  Just add several drops to color.</li>
    <li> I have a good bit of gray hair that is resistent to accepting hair color and fades quickly.  I add 8-10 drops of Gray Magic to my L&#x27;Oreal Excellence Creme hair color and it really does the trick.  I, of course, take protective measures to help keep the color true - don&#x27;t wash in hot water, use sulfate-free shampoo, condition every wash, and don&#x27;t over shampoo my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair color stays true with less fading even up to the time for each monthly hair cut with only the new growth showing.</li>
