      <li>I have used Nair milk and honey roll on wax and was happy with it, but I could not find in my store</li>

      <li>I used this for a while and loved it.  </li>
      <li>I loved the fact that it washes off with water.</li>
      <li>It also smells good and stores</li>
      <li>I asked my husband to pick up any roll-on waxer, since I figured I didnt know which would be good anyway.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re done, any remaining wax or residue comes off with warm water and a washcloth, I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation for it at all, and as a bonus, it smelled really nice!</li>
      <li>Works great on legs, and husbands chest :)</li>
      <li>Love this product, works great.  </li>
      <li>Love this product, it works great.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to read the instructions, if you follow them the result will be great.</li>
      <li>And if you keep at it, you will find that when the wax is the right temperature so you have the perfect sticky consistency, you will be able to remove all the hair and get the results you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I know hilarious times will continue in my household as we use this product!</li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have used any kind of wax and I am really impressed with it.</li>
      <li>Amazing product....</li>
      <li>If smells really nice.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m thrilled I tried it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Effective for bikini area.</li>
      <li>15 seconds in the microwave makes it the perfect consistency, it rolls on straight from the tube</li>
      <li>and you can wash excess wax with just warm water.</li>
      <li>It also smells really nice</li>
      <li>Unless I have fancy spa equipment to keep this wax warm, I probably will not buy this again.</li>
      <li>It really is coming off, and I have to say I am happy with the product, plus it gives us a good bonding time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
      <li>Great product, Easy to use, so much simpler than using a heated bath of wax, would be happy to recommend</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s probably best to get waxed professionally.</li>
      <li>but it was the most effective wax i could find in terms of speed and removal.</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean off, smells great and works every time on my legs.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, the wax heats nicely in the microwave and rolls on easily.</li>
      <li>Washes off easily with just warm water, both skin and the re-usable strips.  </li>
      <li>This is not the strongest wax, but it&#x27;s so easy to use and nice on the skin that it makes up for it.  </li>
      <li>What i love the most is that the wax is water soluble, and washes off with warm water easily.</li>
      <li>It may work better if you can get it to roll on better.</li>
      <li>The roller also helps spread the wax more uniformly than the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish they included more strips, but I just buy more strips separately from another brand on amazon.</li>
      <li>so I did 10 more seconds...</li>
      <li>and I was being cheap!</li>
      <li>The two strips that did come off took off most of the hair it was adhered to.</li>
      <li>:) I think I would have an easier time having someone else rip the strips off my legs.</li>
      <li>I had to heat the wax up quite a bit more than was recommended - but again microwaves vary and I&#x27;m sure it has a lot to do with the settings of my microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The wax didn&#x27;t seem to be grabbing some of my hairs - I&#x27;m guessing this has more to do with my skin/hair rather than the waxing product.</li>
      <li>Love the fact that it comes with the re-usable strips.</li>
      <li>My daughter used it on her hand on the top and it removed the hair there, but for stubborn whisker like hairs -- it won&#x27;t budge.</li>
      <li>and hopefully it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>It started working better when I pulled off the strips faster.</li>
      <li>but you have to go over some areas more than once and getting the backs of your legs</li>
      <li>so I kept doing it that way for about three more strips</li>
      <li>I even tried with better strips (gigi muslin) than the paper ones that come with it.  </li>
      <li>You may need more strips than provided.  </li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>I wish it had more paper strips, but they are washable.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to use baby powder to make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.</li>
      <li>but this one had more reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i dont know how some of these people enjoyed it</li>
      <li>well (make sure you either replace the block in the tube or store it open-end-up</li>
      <li>I love this wax,Iove the scent which seems floral.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Would like to see the package come with more strips than what is included, but you can get buy with what they send.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I will stick with shaving until I find a better alternative.</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>(making me more skepical).</li>
      <li>I also tried it 3 times to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just using it incorrectly --</li>
      <li>What I really do love about this which made me give 4 stars rather than 3</li>
      <li>I decided to cut the strips to get more use out of them.</li>
      <li>Otherwise a great option for fast hair removal.</li>
      <li>it would have been amazing to get the full eight weeks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited this product worked!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a great product for people new to waxing-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> best home waxing stuff out there.. it cleans with just water!</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm. Easy to use. Product arrived before the estimated time without any damages. I would recommend this is you&#x27;re trying to save money!</li>
    <li> it worked well on my legs but there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of wax. probably won&#x27;t buy again. prefer bliss wax.</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T FORGET TO RECAP IT. Otherwise, all the wax will spill out and ruin your bathroom shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Also, doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
    <li> Is the best product that I&#x27;ve used till now to wax by myself. The hair goes away with one or two passes and the skin remains so soft and clean. If some residues of wax remains, it goes away with only water.</li>
    <li> I searched and searched for this at my local stores after reading an article about at home waxing and this was featured in it. I was about to give up hope until finally success! I was so excited and I went straight home to use it. Obsessively read and followed the directions carefully. Pulled up the first strip and nothing but a few hairs were on it, tried another with similar results. I am so disapointed! The only thing this did that it promised to do was wash of easily. I&#x27;ve given in and made an appointment with a salon. This sucks!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all... the roll on applicator broke off the first time i used it, spilling wax all over my leg - huge sticky mess. When I finally got the wax on and removed the strip, absolutely NO hair came off.  I just threw the whole mess out.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> If you have high expectations for this product, you will be disappointed. However, I was looking for a convenient at home roll on wax, and this is it. It does not get all of the hairs in one try. Also, the paper strips that come in the package are not particularly effective. I use muslin strips from Sally&#x27;s. Nevertheless, the wax heats nicely in the microwave and rolls on easily.</li>
    <li> After doing much research, I went to walmart and picked this stuff up. I left shaving for way too long and wanted to try an at-home wax. Almost got the argon oil nair product but this one had more reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Smells fantastic. Easy to use. Package contains everything you need. Not messy at all. Doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: DOES NOT REMOVE HAIR. I think I took out 15-20 hairs in total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to go shave my legs now. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Kind of want my $13 back.</li>
    <li> The easiest way to wax!! Love this product</li>
    <li> I bought this to wax my legs for prom, so today i followed the directions on the back of the container, it states to microwave for 10-15 seconds which actually turns into about 20 to 30 seconds to mke it just right, so i rolled it on my legs and it was painful as usual and i did what it said to do, but it turned out to be so messy. I did it by myself it may be easier for someone to do it for you, but if your doing it GOOD LUCK!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and makes skin very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Effective for bikini area. I had trouble waking with the argan oil version by this brand, but this one and the original one, which they don&#x27;t sell anymore do work. I wish they included more strips, but I just buy more strips separately from another brand on amazon. You can use the strips several times in one session.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I thought it would be less painful on my legs and less time. But quite the opposite. Its very droopy and does not pull hair out easy so you have to keep appying and removeing. Hurts and not worth it. I do waxing as a professional and wanted a roll on for my own personal use, but this stuff sucks.</li>
    <li> I heated this in the microwave for 15 seconds per instructions and massaged it. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to spread evenly. It would grab occasional hairs but not all of them. It may work better if you can get it to roll on better.</li>
    <li> good product works extremly well and fast easy good for sensitive skin fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is not the strongest wax, but it&#x27;s so easy to use and nice on the skin that it makes up for it.  Great for less-hairy people or for areas with lower hair growth.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not a weak product, but just don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect if you have legs with 2 or 3 hairs growing out of each follicle like I do!  When you&#x27;re done, any remaining wax or residue comes off with warm water and a washcloth, I didn&#x27;t experience any skin irritation for it at all, and as a bonus, it smelled really nice!</li>
    <li> Love this product, works great.  I wish it had more paper strips, but they are washable.  I tried other brands, and a lot of them have sticky wax that&#x27;s not easy to wash off.  What i love the most is that the wax is water soluble, and washes off with warm water easily.</li>
    <li> So I hate shaving my legs, probably like every other girl out there, so I decided to try wax (I purchased the milk &amp; honey flavored though). The roll on seemed to be less messy (so it says), so I thought why not, 8 weeks of not shaving? HEAVEN. Wrong. I tried multiple times thinking that maybe I was going something wrong because no matter how hot or how cool the wax was, not a single hair was coming out! Eventually I ran out of wax strips. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews on different home wax products, each having 5 vs 1 star, I didnt know what to buy. Since I am on bedrest and being a waxer by salon only, I was very skeptical to begin with of these weak \\&quot;sugar\\&quot; waxes, thinking they would not work. I didnt want to wait for shipping, so I asked my husband to pick up any roll-on waxer, since I figured I didnt know which would be good anyway. This is the one he picked up. I have rather thick hair (spanish decent) however am a waxer, but still thick and quite hairy (making me more skepical). I followed the directions, heating the wax, actually to 15-20 seconds. The wax for the price worked amazingly!!! It took off hair just like in the salon (I had someone do it for me, easy though, roll direction of hair, rub paper and hold skin taut when you pull against hair growth). It was much less messier than using stick wax and sooo easy to wash off. Where have you been all my life? If you do it right, you wont have a problem. I am a fan!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this on my underarms and it works well. It lasts a while, as I only have to use it every couple of weeks or so.</li>
    <li> Another convert!  Love this product, it works great.  I am so happy with it -- no more $40 wax jobs.  Love the ease of use... such a change from the other waxes I have used.</li>
    <li> This with extra reusable strips makes home waxing a breeze.  Easy to heat.  Easy to apply.  Easy clean up.  With warm water in the shower, it rinses right off.  With warm water in the sink (or a pan), the wax just melts off the strips for easy clean up.  I like the scent.  I also have dark hair (no Swedish bikini goddess here) and this product makes my legs look smooth and beach ready.  I did try another scent/blend from Nair that was a disaster.  This is the only one I will use at home, ever.</li>
    <li> I love this product. So easy to use and you can wash excess wax with just warm water.</li>
    <li> No more mess.  Clean results. You may need more strips than provided.  You may need to microwave the wax several times during waxing session as it tends to cool too quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in a hurry, thinking it would be interesting to try something new. Now I wish I had read some of the reviews before my purchase. In my experience, the result as bad as the reviews that said it only took out \\&quot;5 hairs\\&quot;, in my case the hair removal was only about 50% successful, meaning the little stips only took out 50% of the hairs. I do not believe it was user error, because I followed all the directions. As a note though I do have coarser hair, so that might have had something to do with it. That said, there are a few pros, I really liked how easy it was to apply and wash of the wax, and the directions claim that the wax strips are re-usable (washable).</li>
    <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m highly disappointed about this product. I am not a beginner at waxing. I was looking for maybe a less messy way to wax my legs. I read the directions,and heated the wax for 15 seconds. The wax applied smoothly, but when I ripped off the strip only a few hairs came off. I guess I will be sticking to my Sally Hansen Brazilian wax kit. Never had a problem with it before. I should not have switched. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> This is my first time waxing, and while I&#x27;m not amazed by the product, I&#x27;m not disappointed either. I probably didn&#x27;t let my hair grow out enough, but this only removed about half the hair on my legs. I&#x27;m going to try again in a few days to see if that makes a difference, but of the hair it did remove, it is so smooth with no breakage. Everything was removed by the root. Also, the product is exactly what is says: &amp;#34;easy application.&amp;#34; Just pop it in the microwave for 15 seconds and you&#x27;re ready to go! It does cool down quickly, so you&#x27;ll have to reheat it between legs. What I really do love about this which made me give 4 stars rather than 3 is how easy it is to clean up. Warm water removes it from the cloths (reusable cloths are a plus!) and legs. I didn&#x27;t even have to use soap. While some wax does ooze from the applicator when you put it down making things sticky, just get a damp towel and you can clean everything up in no time. All in all, I would buy this again just because it did remove most of my hair, and I normally have to shave every day. Anything helps, especially in the summer. This would probably work wonders on someone who has thinner hair, though I do think you would need to buy a new container for each wax if you wax your entire legs. There seems to be just enough for two whole legs in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nair&#x27;s roll-on wax for a few years now and I love it! I will not using any other wax on my legs for at home use. I do not appreciate this seller swapping out the cotton cloths without noting that in the description, because they look thinner than the ones Nair provided.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product after reading reviews for it and decided to order it.  Plus those packs of razors get expensive, I needed an alternative to hair removal.  Tonight we tried it out for the first time, and to be honest my husband is acting like a 7 year old who found a really cool science experiment.  He is obsessed now, with waxing my legs.  It really is coming off, and I have to say I am happy with the product, plus it gives us a good bonding time. Ladies if your guy is willing to wax your legs for you, take him up on it.  I know hilarious times will continue in my household as we use this product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin (eczema), so I recently started waxing because shaving irritates my skin too much. After trying homemade sugar waxes with no luck, I decided to try this product because of the convenient roller packaging. It&#x27;s great! It dispenses a nice thin layer of wax and pulls the hair right off with the strips and does not adhere to skin or irritate it. I do have to re-microwave a couple of times during the process, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. The fact that it&#x27;s water soluble also makes it great, because I can just wash off any sticky spots on my skin and also soak/rinse and re-use all of the cloth strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for people new to waxing- it&#x27;s super easy to use and does not make a big mess. Not to mention that it&#x27;s one of the cheapest options available- I can get a little over 2 half-leg waxes out of one roller. I recommend it mostly for legs (and possibly arms) though; I have had little success using it for my underarms, and the roller is a little too wide to maneuver in the bikini area.</li>
    <li> THis product is my new crush. I love the simplicity, no mess no fuss - heats evenly, and removes every last hair for smooth skin and amazing results. MY only complaint is it does tend to leak around the nozzle, but I keep it in a plastic bag, and throw the bag out every time I use it.</li>
    <li> with this wax I can do the work myself and feel like a pro.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, just hit few seconds on the microwave, is water base, so doesn&#x27;t stay, it&#x27;s easy to remove. it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> I have very fine, blonde hair and only shave about once a month. This helped keep my legs smooth for a while but there was really only enough wax for about 2 uses. It wasn&#x27;t very good about getting all of the hairs so you might have to wax the same area a few times. I will stick with shaving until I find a better alternative.</li>
    <li> Amazing product....a better replacement to my previous Nair Peach Melon Wax. This is less messy for application than a stick, even spread once you figure out how to maneuver the roller. The included wax strips are pretty decent and can be washed and reused.</li>
    <li> Didnt work as I expected, i guess my hair is hard to remove.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Cant get it in store anymore</li>
    <li> This is literally the worst wax product I have ever used in my entire life. It doesn&#x27;t put enough wax on an area with the roll-on applicator, and then when I tried it without, I ended up having to do 6 passes over the same patch of skin. Had to use my store of cotton strips because I went through all of the provided strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw it in the bin. JFC what a waste of money, time, and cotton strips. Never effing again. Save your money and get the usual beeswax pot.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those out there that want a smoother body. I have no problem epilating my legs, but this is a MUST HAVE if you want a smooth chest, belly and bikini line. I use each strip 3 times in a row without a problem but then you do need to throw them in a bowl of hot water and wash them. Let them dry and then back to the waxing! Would like to see the package come with more strips than what is included, but you can get buy with what they send. Just plan ahead and work in small sections!!</li>
    <li> this wax did a great job at removing the hair and did not irritate my sensitive skin. afterwards, the wax would easily wash off the strips and the applicator. BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK!!!! the new one with argon oil SUCKS, it doesnt wash off easily at all. in fact, i had to throw away the strips i used because the wax would just not come off!</li>
    <li> WIFE&#x27;S REVIEW:  I LOVE this stuff.  15 seconds in the microwave makes it the perfect consistency, it rolls on straight from the tube so no mess, it grips the hair well (roll on wax, smooth on paper, wait a few seconds, riiiip), and it washes off easily with just warm water.  It also smells good and stores well (make sure you either replace the block in the tube or store it open-end-up or it will slowly leak out - I did that once; fortunately, it washes from other surfaces easily as well).  I have used the stuff in pots (messy), stuff that would only (sort of) clean up with a special solvent (yikes - messy and harsh on the skin), and even tried homemade sugar wax and this is hands down the most convenient, effective, gentle all-around-great product I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m stocking up!</li>
    <li> Product suck i dont know how some of these people enjoyed it but this wax does not remove the hair at all it rolls on and when you use the strip and yank it off not one hair comes off dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and washes off with water!</li>
    <li> I opened and next day I found the wax was all over the. Place</li>
    <li> I give myself brazilians with this wax every month and it works wonderfully! The trick is to use baby powder to make sure the wax doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin. If you know how to use this product, it works like a charm and for about $3.50 a brazilian wax</li>
    <li> Never waxed my own self before but this wax is amazing!!  Easy to warm, easy to apply, Gets ALL the hair, and I am a hairy person sadly.  Washes off easily with just warm water, both skin and the re-usable strips.  I dry mine quickly in the oven on WARM setting so they are ready to re-use as soon as I need them.  Costly but worth every penny.  Kept my legs hair-free for 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. wasted my money.</li>
    <li> good product. Easy clean up and application. Doesn&#x27;t get all the super fine hairs, but for a cheap at home wax it works really well</li>
    <li> Bought this hoping it would be an alternative to going to a spy and gettin waxed to save from the everyday shaving ritual. This product is horrible and sticky , followed the instructions to a T and even warmed it up more as others suggested. Pay the 10 bucks if you like messy sticky goup on your body thats a pain to wash off .</li>
    <li> Mess free .... Easy to use .... love it</li>
    <li> I use this on my bikini area &amp; it works great. It is relatively painless (all things considered) &amp; is easy to clean off...recommended for beginner waxer as it is hard to screw up the results with this product</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be great to get at least a couple days a hair free legs it would have been amazing to get the full eight weeks but I didn&#x27;t believe that for a second but just to get two to three or four days free would be great so I did everything the box said heated up in the microwave for 10 seconds then tested to make sure it wasn&#x27;t to hot. Made sure my legs were clean and dry then proceeded to roll on a thin strip of wax on my leg covered it with the wax strip patted it down to make sure it got a good hold of the wax then pulled very fast towards the hair and bam nothing came out of my leg the only thing that came off was the wax I thought I was doing somthing worng so I tried again a differnt way and so on still each way I could think of nothing came out. I had cut my wax strips in half to make more so when I had about ten left I was pulling in a dignoal way and I got I think about five hairs to come out so I kept doing it that way for about three more strips then the method just quit working so the remaining strips I just tried to pull faster so I can say I am very disappoint and that was just at it not working the next day I had big sore red spots all over my legs, they hurt so bad I wanted to go to the doctor and a couple spots looked that a layer of skin was gone this is a horrible product and I hate that wasted ten dollars on it and plan on trying to getting my money back.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions to a T and nothing happened. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have never waxed before and, hence was very nervous.  It was not at all as bad as I feared. I wish I had started using this product at the beginning of the summer.  I thought I was ordering the bikini-area wax, but apparently this is for legs.  Anyway, I used it for bikini area and it worked just fine.  Not too messy either.</li>
    <li> You get what u pay for and I was being cheap! I&#x27;ll stick with the professionals. I wasted time, money, skin cells, and blood! Learn from my mistake!</li>
    <li> My mom bought this product for me at walmart and I tried it out and did everything it said and it didn&#x27;t work! I&#x27;m sad and disappointed that her money was wasted! My legs were even hair enough to use and it took off maybe 5 little hairs when I tried it and it left these little red bumps on my legs probably from where the hair wasn&#x27;t pulled off but probably a little layer of skin was!</li>
    <li> This product did everything it promised except remove my hair! haha. It was really easy to heat up, apply, and wash off with minimal mess (it also smells nice). However, it barely removed any hair. I am a second time wax user, so I might be doing something wrong. It started working better when I pulled off the strips faster. You need to pull them really quickly and aggressively like you&#x27;re taking off a bandaid! I&#x27;m going to try it again in a few days and hopefully it&#x27;ll work better.</li>
    <li> The word Brazilian is misleading. In no way will this package give you a Brazilian wax, if that&#x27;s what you assumed. Maybe ok for leg hair, but the roller pulls longer hairs when applying wax and doesn&#x27;t put out a thick enough wax layer to remove all hairs at once. Get a professional wax.</li>
    <li> This item does not work like it says it does. I have used this on my chin area and it refuses to move the hair. My daughter used it on her hand on the top and it removed the hair there, but for stubborn whisker like hairs -- it won&#x27;t budge. Baby fine hair it won&#x27;t grab either.</li>
    <li> I bought this product under the impression that I might be out $10 or so because there was definitely some negative feedback, but it was cheap enough that I figured I might as well try it.  I had hoped that this wax would be easier to use and have I could have an easier clean up time and I was absolutely right.  The roll-on feature made applying the wax easier and cleaner than I could have ever imagined!  I&#x27;ve tried one other wax on my bikini area before, which was made out of strip-less wax, and that was ridiculously messy which made the whole process even more tedious and painful.  Laides, when you&#x27;re doing something as delicate as waxing your bikini area, you want something that&#x27;s simple, quick and clean, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  Because the wax is water rinsable, you don&#x27;t have to spend days waiting for the wax to come off of your skin, and all of the strips can be washed and reused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product was that pulling the strip up from one wax application didn&#x27;t get all of the hair off.  I had to go back multiple times to get the rest, and even then not every hair was gone (which was easily fixed with tweezers).  The good part about all this was that for some reason I found that this wax felt less painful than the one I had tried before, so going back multiple times wasn&#x27;t terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product!  It&#x27;s incredibly easy to use which makes the process faster and simpler.  In my opinion the worst thing about waxing (besides the obvious pain... ow), is the stressful, sticky situation using wax can bring.  So having an easy roll on application with water rinsable wax is definitely worth the $10.  And if you keep at it, you will find that when the wax is the right temperature so you have the perfect sticky consistency, you will be able to remove all the hair and get the results you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
    <li> Seller was great - Product did not work as intended however.</li>
    <li> I will have t try this product again, maybe my skin is just to sensitive right now. I have never gotten a full on wax before. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair was exactly long enough. It looked like it pulled a lot out, but I would have to go back over the same area a couple times. The wax didn&#x27;t seem to be grabbing some of my hairs - I&#x27;m guessing this has more to do with my skin/hair rather than the waxing product. It was easy to use, and I really like that you can reuse the fabric strips rather than buying more all the time. I had to heat the wax up quite a bit more than was recommended - but again microwaves vary and I&#x27;m sure it has a lot to do with the settings of my microwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all seems like a quality product for those with a nonsensitive skin :) I think I would have an easier time having someone else rip the strips off my legs.</li>
    <li> Super simple to use, easy to wash of with water only, no mess, no overheated wax. Would and will recommend.</li>
    <li> 👎 awful, didn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Nair (same company that makes this) DOES have other waxes that work perfectly fine though.  Will stick to those in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a regular spa brazilian wax person until we had to cut out some expenses. This roll-on wax got great reviews, so I tried it out. The first and second applications strip off well, but after that, the wax cools so you&#x27;d have to microwave it again (which isn&#x27;t always the most convenient thing to do after having ripped off two strips of hair down there...)  But! The two strips that did come off took off most of the hair it was adhered to. Unless I have fancy spa equipment to keep this wax warm, I probably will not buy this again. Nevertheless, it was worth a try, and it works the way it promises to.</li>
    <li> My friend recommended this product to me but after I read some of the negative reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work on very very thin (think baby) facial hair.  Let me just assure you that it really does work if you follow the directions on the packaging.  We didn&#x27;t overheat the product and we applied a very thin layer (even removed some wax if I thought I applied it too thickly).  It was fast, strips were thick and reusable, wax was effective, and it was all very easy to clean up.  I would recommend this to anyone needing to wax.  I&#x27;m so excited this product worked!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first but I LOVE!! It left some stubble here and their but I just went over it with a razor. The wax goes fast so you will have to buy more.... If smells really nice. It doesn&#x27;t hurt too bad but it&#x27;s wax so it&#x27;s expected! I was able to use the same strip about 4 times before I got a new one. Make sure you pull the skin tight before you pull the strip or it won&#x27;t work so well. Happy waxi g everyone!</li>
    <li> Have used several wax products and like this one the most for legs and arms. Will buy again and will recommend.</li>
    <li> I used to use a roll on wax by another brand that was a sticky nightmare, the type of stuff that was really difficult to wash off but it was the most effective wax i could find in terms of speed and removal. This one is so easy to wash off, and yes, easy to heat up (20 seconds in my only 700 watt microwave), effective at removing hair, and stayed melted for long enough for me to do my upper legs but would definitely need to be re-heated if you&#x27;re doing the entire legs, maybe even a 3rd time. I&#x27;ll probably repurchase. Oh, and the wanna-be pleasant fragrance is wayyyy over the top and unnecessarily strong, was really bothersome. Would have been 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for that. Oh, and i&#x27;m waiting til the day someone can make this into a container that doesn&#x27;t leak, but that may be impossible. Must keep the packaging in order to store this in, and you&#x27;ll see how much seeps out by the time you are ready to wax again, but it&#x27;s still contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed hair that was pretty long, 1/2 inch, so i cannot speak for hair shorter than that. Also, my hair was pretty much virgin hair, not stubble, so i can also not speak to its effectiveness on stubble, which is usually coarser and can be harder to pick up with a thin sticky wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if i have the same product that others are saying doesn&#x27;t work? I just waxed my upper legs right now, they are now completely hair free, what up?</li>
    <li> I find this wax clean and easy to use...</li>
    <li> This is def the best and easiest wax u can get for the price&lt;br /&gt;1: you can un - sticky urself by just a wet towel beside you&lt;br /&gt;2: u heat it for a v lil while and roll it on&lt;br /&gt;3: it&#x27;s quite strong as long as u don&#x27;t get any water into it ( I use hot water to keep it warm!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good enough!</li>
    <li> I used this for a while and loved it.  It is easy to clean off, smells great and works every time on my legs.  I have used newer ones (DON&#x27;T RECOMMEND) and prefer this one.  I will give one heads up.  If it is your first time using it will miss some hair, but hair grows back slower and thinner.  Following uses will remove more hair and last longer.</li>
    <li> Ouch! Even just rolling on the wax HURTS. And make sure to pull in the OPPOSITE direction of the hair growth. Note that even when you do that, though, it doesn&#x27;t work that great (so you have to apply the was again ... and again ... and ... OUCH). It&#x27;s probably best to get waxed professionally. It also gets VERY messy after a few waxes ... and hairs get caught in the roller and you have to work hard to clean it out ...</li>
    <li> It takes some practice to wax legs-I recommend watching a couple videos on YouTube and then going at it.  But this stuff is decent-it&#x27;s easy to clean up, minimally messy, effective if your technique has a little florish.  My only real complaint was that it did leak a little around the applicator.  There was enough in the bottle for two at home below the knee leg waxes for me-but I&#x27;ve got fine textured body hair and I&#x27;ve been waxing myself for a while.  It&#x27;s not the product, it&#x27;s the practice that does it for this stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it was recommended by some magazine/beauty product reviewer as one of the best home wax kits for brazilian wax -- FAIL.  TERRIBLE product for bikini/brazilian wax.  Does not grip hair, leaves ingrowns and even infected follicles.  Even after multiple applications, over 60% of the hair remained unremoved -- with sticky wax stuck all over it.  I also tried it 3 times to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just using it incorrectly -- 3rd time was not a charm.  Awful experience everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on underarms as well, and it works a little better but still had the same fundamental problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that it is easy to apply in a thin layer with the roller applicator and that it washes off easily with water, but what use is all that if it doesn&#x27;t serve its primary function to get the hair off.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used Nair milk and honey roll on wax and was happy with it, but I could not find in my store so I  tried the Brazilian spa clay roll on wax. I love this wax,Iove the scent which seems floral.  I used it on my legs and waxed my daughter&#x27;s legs, for the first time, as well. She said it was not painful and after using on my legs and hers - I still have 1/2 the bottle left. You do not need to roll it on thick. It takes me 15 - 20 minutes to wax my legs. It&#x27;s easy and quick. Read the directions and you should have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I think the persons trying to wax bikini lines may be having problems due to the skin may not be completely dry. I leave the nether regions and facial hair to professional aestheticians.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for legs, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I definitely recommend this product. I have thick, coarse, dark hair- after shaving but after using Nair roll on waxes, the hair grows out thinner and wispy. No more razor bumps or irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I give this product 4 stars ONLY because I feel as if it doesn&#x27;t stay heated. Other than that I think this is a great product and its very convenient!!</li>
    <li> I really wish I would have read these reviews before I wasted money on this product.  I usually buy my home waxing kits at Sephora but thought I&#x27;d see if any of the cheaper products might work.  I don&#x27;t understand how you can market and sell a product for one specific purpose when it&#x27;s the one thing it CAN&#x27;T DO.  I see I&#x27;m not alone here when I say removing 5 hairs isn&#x27;t what I paid for.  I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t shave my underarms every day, so now I get to go on vacation with fuzzy pits.  Hooray!  Thanks for nothing, Nair!</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work, but you have to practice.  I like the reusable strips and might just try to use them with a homemade sugaring wax.</li>
    <li> Great product, Easy to use, so much simpler than using a heated bath of wax, would be happy to recommend</li>
    <li> The product was not messy, it was easy to apply, and it smells nice. However, after following the directions it would only pick up a few pieces of hair. I tried to change the heating time, pulled the strip parallel to the surface of application...doesn&#x27;t matter. Just stick to the crème Nair or old fashioned shaving.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed, I&#x27;d seen this on some lists of best waxing products.  It didn&#x27;t come off when I pulled the strip.  I&#x27;ve used a Gigi pot to wax and it worked fine, but this just stayed gooey.  I even tried with better strips (gigi muslin) than the paper ones that come with it.  But I would say don&#x27;t waste your money if you&#x27;ve got thick, dark Mexican hair like me, it probably won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the gigi&#x27;s pot did work in pulling the hair out but you have to go over some areas more than once and getting the backs of your legs is really difficult.  I would&#x27;ve tried a roll on one if I were going back.  I&#x27;ve given up on waxing since then and am back to a razor.  However, it does kind of seem like the waxing made the hair grow back more sparse.  (Although initially it is really itchy when the hair has to push through the skin again).</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of bad reviews on this but I tried it because the prewaxed strips didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature was perfect with microwaving, the application went on smoothly and evenly. The paper strips were just enough for the bottom half of my legs but the wax is super easy to wash off the strips and use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things you need to remember before rating this product badly:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Your hair needs to be long enough but not too long! If it&#x27;s too long, the hair will break but if its too short, the wax won&#x27;t grab the hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Wash your legs before so dirt/sweat won&#x27;t impede the wax.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Use lotion after so you don&#x27;t get irritated. There will be ingrown hairs (a few) and some irritation but you are RIPPING hairs from their follicles so it is bound to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was way easier to use than wax you have to apply with a stick and keep in hot water. I definitely recommend it to first timers. Just remember to grow out your hair! Wear pants for a while and accept the hairiness for a month or so till you&#x27;re ready ^_^</li>
    <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve ever used! I was skeptical at first because of the bad reviews but I&#x27;m thrilled I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and I was done in 5 minutes. I saved $40 on salon wax. I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the bad reviews, the hair pulled off the first time, the applicator is soooo convenient and the strips are good. Yes, you get just a few strips but no biggy.&lt;br /&gt;Try it! Be sure to read the instructions, if you follow them the result will be great.</li>
    <li> Wife uses it - very happy</li>
    <li> This wax kit exceeded my expectations by far. It was so easy to use (as long as you read the directions) - I heated it for 15 sec initially, but it was a bit tough to roll on (and the first rip did not pull off all the hair) so I did 10 more seconds...perfect. All the hair came out with just one rip for each section. For underarms, it usually takes two rips (top half upward and bottom half downward) and voila! Complete!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax in this system is also water soluble which makes clean up SO much easier than many other kits. I have used the Sally Hansen lavender home wax kit with similar results - but it is more complicated to use, not water soluble, and because it is a tub of wax with a stick you have to stir the wax, it tends to get on stuff when you use it, whereas the roll-on was a total breeze to use and clean up. The roller also helps spread the wax more uniformly than the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - and since the wax is water soluble - when they say you can reuse the strips - they mean it! Just rinse with lukewarm water and rub a little - wax and hair cleans right off. Hang over a towel or something to dry - ta-da...no more buying new strips!</li>
    <li> First time do-it-yourself waxer and have never bikini waxed. Easy to follow instructions. I decided to cut the strips to get more use out of them. Didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I had anticipated and the results are totally worth it! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been waxing for 15 years. This is by far the easiest product to use. No sticks or mess. I use muslin strips and it removed the hair easily. The hair has to be long enough to wax it off, so if your hair is short, you will have a tough time with any wax. I loved the fact that it washes off with water. I didn&#x27;t believe it at first, but it does. I was so excited about how it worked that I emailed my sister - who is an aesthetician!&lt;br /&gt;For those that wax regularly, give it a try. You will be surprised.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull very much hair out...</li>
    <li> Bought this wax along with a hard wax kit. Tried both of them and this is by far the better option. It is so easy to use and it gets all hairs that are long enough. The other waxing kit I bought gave me a rash, this one did not. It also smells really nice and it&#x27;s so easy to wash off. This is the first time that I have used any kind of wax and I am really impressed with it. It is amazingly easy to use. Will deffinetly buy again!</li>
    <li> Very quick and easy to use. I find the strips provided not enough and have to have buy additional ones on the side. Otherwise a great option for fast hair removal. Pretty efficient for shorter hair if you are used to waxing.</li>
    <li> I was a user of their Nair Peach Melon wax and have been a home waxer for years.  That was my go to wax and nothing else worked (for reference I have fine-coarse hair on my arms), so when it was discontinued I was trying to find another wax that was similar to it.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it and was going to pay ~$60 for two tubs that that wax since thats what it was going for.  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t, this wax is AMAZING!!! I think it actually works better than the peach melon one, definitely my new go to wax!!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this when I read some of the other product reviews, but it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly, effectively and as painlessly as can be expected.</li>
    <li> Relly easy to use and minimum mess!!! You just have to heat it a few times during the process in order for it work better.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be easier and last longer than shaving, but it hardly removed any hair at all. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this it&#x27;s a waste of $10.</li>
    <li> Came on time and worked like its supposed to</li>
    <li> It just arrived yesterday and I tried it on my legs. I like it&#x27;s smell. It has convinient packaging/cover that even helps prop up the bottle between use. Love the fact that it comes with the re-usable strips. I could use a single strip for my whole leg (below knee)! I like the wax&#x27;s consistency, it warms in 15-20 secs in the microwave &amp; stays warm for long. The wax is pretty strong and didn&#x27;t leave behind any hairs so didn&#x27;t need to redo any area. I felt my skin was softer than when it is when I use other waxes or it may be my imagination. The best thing is the roll on bottle, it makes everything so convinient! I was afraid the wax might make the roller sticky &amp; hard to roll but no such troubles. I just wish the bottle was a little bigger for the price but it&#x27;s still cheaper than getting waxed by a professional. I do believe it could be used for the bikini line as well, haven&#x27;t tried it though.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this to wax her legs and the wax didn&#x27;t stick well at all.  She tried for 3 days in a  row and barely got 1/2 a leg waxed before the hassle wasn&#x27;t worth it.  She would not buy this again.  Safe your money and get a professional wax kit or let the professional&#x27;s do it.</li>
    <li> YEEE-OOWW-CH!  Works great on legs, and husbands chest :)</li>
