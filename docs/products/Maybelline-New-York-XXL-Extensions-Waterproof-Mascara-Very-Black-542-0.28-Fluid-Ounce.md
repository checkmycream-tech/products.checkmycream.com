      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>Perfect, soooo happy to find these as Maybelline&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued!</li>
      <li>It was the best of the Maybelline line.</li>
      <li>The product itself is very good</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>It was a great price and works great</li>
      <li>But got it within a couple of days - great service.</li>
      <li>Works great for me.</li>
      <li>Every time I have this mascara on I get great compliments .</li>
      <li>I like this mascara because it&#x27;s great on my lashes.  </li>
      <li>I just love this mascara  is awesome, my eyelashes look great.......</li>
      <li>I love the Maybelline products &amp; i am very happy Amazon carries them.</li>
      <li>and it has a good shelf life.  </li>
      <li>so I will have to ask her how good it is.</li>
      <li>This mascara makes my eyelashes full and curled!!!</li>
      <li>Bought this from target exceptional shipping.</li>
      <li>You will love it!</li>
      <li>they had more to purchase!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>Although I love the definition this brand gives my lashes, it smudges my under eye area all throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>So glad to find it on here</li>
      <li>I tried many mascara from Sephora store.  </li>
      <li>My all-time favorite mascara was the non-waterproof version of this.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff........</li>
      <li>I can never find it in stores and it is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>, I was VERY impressed with how long it lasted.</li>
      <li>Fair price and fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>The other unopened one was in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>anyway, these are working fine.</li>
      <li>I figured this one would do just fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not hard to apply it just takes longer to apply, but is more troublesome to remove.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the fuss.</li>
      <li>It is the best for thin eyelashes.</li>
      <li>and I find some mascara rubs off where it touches my eyelid and have some darkness right under my lower lash from the mascara - almost like dust.</li>
      <li>Price was right as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>Really good for active types who want something that will endure.</li>
      <li>I totally love this mascara speacially for night time for very long and bold eyelashes.</li>
      <li>It was hot day with elevated humidity.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really care for it</li>
      <li>As for quality, I cannot firmly judge because it was so old, but the extensions part made my lashes look very beautiful and thick.</li>
      <li>There are two steps to this mascara, first the moisturizing layer (which is white) and really lengthens the lashes, then you apply the darker mascara.</li>
      <li>I bought a brand new tube of this mascara.</li>
      <li>I love this mascara and it is so hard to find at a store anymore.</li>
      <li>If you want a mascara that washes off completely at the end of the day though, buy something else, because this product WILL fight to stay on.  </li>
      <li>All in all, its the mascara that lengthens my lashes the longest by far.</li>
      <li>It seemed pretty dry but worked.</li>
      <li>you however have to make sure that you put enough of the black over the white application or your eye lashes looks gray.</li>
      <li>There is no other mascara that comes close to it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof mascaras but this was cheap</li>
      <li>I have tried soooo many other mascaras and they weigh down my eyelashes and they uncurl.</li>
      <li>Had a hard time finding this discontinued item from Maybelline &amp; would love to find another two to five for the same price or close to what I paid for it!  </li>
      <li>This mascara tends to clump severely and smudges like no other mascara I have ever used.</li>
      <li>There was barely anything in it!</li>
      <li>the extension part was pretty dried out</li>
      <li>This is the first time this has happened and I have ordered a few times.</li>
      <li>Got this in the mail and the white part was fine, but the actual black mascara was old, dried, and clump up into one big mound on the brush itself.</li>
      <li>After you first apply the extension, apply enough of the black mascara over the white extensions to cover it all.</li>

<li> I already have long lashes but this gem extends them even further.</li>
<li> The mascara side was dried up it seemed like it was really old.</li>
<li> I received the product earlier than expected as well!</li>
<li> I was kind of disappointing as one of the packages was open and it was a little watered down.</li>
<li> Item was old and dried out!</li>
<li> i am a black girl with short eye lashes.</li>
<li> but still you could get a few coats out of it same as the mascara part</li>
<li> on which extends your lashes let it dry a little and then add the dark layer to cover up the white.</li>
<li> Sad to say that I discovered this mascara only several months before it was apparently discontinued.  </li>
<li> not like the other ones i bought from another seller (those were all cakey.</li>
<li> however, for some unknown reasons they are cheaper than the non-waterproof ones?!</li>
<li> I tried different makeup removers and all failed to remove product completely from my eyes.</li>
<li> Most of the expensive ones did not work well for my thin lashes.  </li>
<li> I really love this product and hated when it left Walmart.</li>
<li> When I opened the tubes, they were dried out and the caps were loose.</li>
<li> Obviously used or at least opened by someoene else.</li>
<li> Not worth the price.</li>
<li> May clump if rushed slowly put the white layer</li>
<li> Of course, it was quite dried out (I mean what do you expect after 2 1/2 years of moderate use)</li>
<li> it looked a horrid mess</li>
<li> Makes lashes long and thick, and stays on!  </li>
<li> but it&#x27;s not phenomenal and it seems to shed a little</li>
<li> I have to rub a little too hard to eventually get it off....</li>
<li> , i&#x27;ll go stop being lazy and go to rite aid or something.</li>
<li> When you put it on the ends of your lashes, it curls and looks weird because they are going different ways and are wispy, not cute.</li>
<li> Not good extension for thin, short lashes.</li>
<li> Sucks that they discontinued it .</li>
<li> not good</li>
<li> Not a really good waterproof mascara as it will smudge.</li>
<li> I hated it &amp; thought it was way too high for the small amount &amp; size of goods ordered!</li>
<li> The one problem is that its very hard to take it off even with makeup removers .</li>
<li> However, the waterproof claim is so blatantly false, that I felt I had to write this review.</li>
<li> It also flakes a little and can be annoying when they fall in pr around your eyes :/</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a dramatic difference.</li>
<li> Does no good, it&#x27;s discontinued!...</li>
<li> I was extremely sad to find out they no longer made it at the store.</li>
<li> One day, I was in desperate need of a mascara and this popped into my hand.</li>
<li> So sad!</li>
<li> This product is very very difficult to remove.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t smudge flake or clump. Will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I really love this product and hated when it left Walmart. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> There are two steps to this mascara, first the moisturizing layer (which is white) and really lengthens the lashes, then you apply the darker mascara. It&#x27;s not hard to apply it just takes longer to apply, but is more troublesome to remove. All in all, its the mascara that lengthens my lashes the longest by far.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t really care for it</li>
    <li> I love the Maybelline products &amp; i am very happy Amazon carries them.</li>
    <li> I just love this mascara  is awesome, my eyelashes look great.......</li>
    <li> This is my fave! I didn&#x27;t like that it was waterproof, but I bought what I could get. It seems to have started clumping and dropping mascara crumbs on my cheek faster than 1 bought out of the store.</li>
    <li> Love it. This mascara actually covers  all my lashes, and the length, and shows off my eyes! And it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> This product has been hibernating in my makeup collection for 2 1/2 years. It used to be my mothers, but somehow got lost into my stash of makeup. One day, I was in desperate need of a mascara and this popped into my hand. Of course, it was quite dried out (I mean what do you expect after 2 1/2 years of moderate use) the extension part was pretty dried out but still you could get a few coats out of it same as the mascara part, I was VERY impressed with how long it lasted. As for quality, I cannot firmly judge because it was so old, but the extensions part made my lashes look very beautiful and thick.</li>
    <li> My all-time favorite mascara was the non-waterproof version of this. I was extremely sad to find out they no longer made it at the store. I figured this one would do just fine but it&#x27;s not phenomenal and it seems to shed a little and I find some mascara rubs off where it touches my eyelid and have some darkness right under my lower lash from the mascara - almost like dust. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect, soooo happy to find these as Maybelline&lt;br /&gt;Discontinued! Thank you.Price was right as well.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had more to purchase!</li>
    <li> Makes lashes long and thick, and stays on!  It doesn&#x27;t streak or fade, even after swimming in the ocean all day and messing with goggles!  Does everything a mascara should do.  If you want a mascara that washes off completely at the end of the day though, buy something else, because this product WILL fight to stay on.  Really good for active types who want something that will endure.</li>
    <li> Got this in the mail and the white part was fine, but the actual black mascara was old, dried, and clump up into one big mound on the brush itself. it looked a horrid mess and i couldnt do anyhting with it. had to throw it away instead. I wont be buying makeup off of here again, i&#x27;ll go stop being lazy and go to rite aid or something.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear waterproof mascaras but this was cheap so I decided to try it out. When you put it on the ends of your lashes, it curls and looks weird because they are going different ways and are wispy, not cute. It also flakes a little and can be annoying when they fall in pr around your eyes :/</li>
    <li> Sad to say that I discovered this mascara only several months before it was apparently discontinued.  Now I can only find it on amazon.  Love the idea of applying a base first before the color.  I&#x27;ve used much more expensive mascara in my 70 years and nothing compares to this.</li>
    <li> I received my order and I had to throw two packages away. They looked as though they were already opened and just scotch taped back together. When I opened the tubes, they were dried out and the caps were loose. Obviously used or at least opened by someoene else. Nothing that I would put on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw them away too soon. I should have asked for a refund, I think I will. Never have I received anything in this condition before.</li>
    <li> Item was old and dried out! Buyers beware!</li>
    <li> Works great for me. Does what its suppose to.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointing as one of the packages was open and it was a little watered down. The other unopened one was in perfect condition. This is the first time this has happened and I have ordered a few times.</li>
    <li> i am a black girl with short eye lashes. this product does give length and volume. you however have to make sure that you put enough of the black over the white application or your eye lashes looks gray. After you first apply the extension, apply enough of the black mascara over the white extensions to cover it all.</li>
    <li> Had a hard time finding this discontinued item from Maybelline &amp; would love to find another two to five for the same price or close to what I paid for it!  The shipping cost of over twenty dollars....I hated it &amp; thought it was way too high for the small amount &amp; size of goods ordered!</li>
    <li> Not a really good waterproof mascara as it will smudge. Not good extension for thin, short lashes.</li>
    <li> I tried many mascara from Sephora store.  Most of the expensive ones did not work well for my thin lashes.  I like this mascara because it&#x27;s great on my lashes.  The curl stays after applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was still sold in stores.</li>
    <li> I totally love this mascara speacially for night time for very long and bold eyelashes. I&#x27;m so upset maybelline discontinued this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this from target exceptional shipping. The product itself is very good i am in the 50 range and makes my eyes look bigger. My eyelashes seem to like this product.</li>
    <li> Every time I have this mascara on I get great compliments . That&#x27;s why I had to come on here to order it. Sucks that they discontinued it . The one problem is that its very hard to take it off even with makeup removers .</li>
    <li> Although I love the definition this brand gives my lashes, it smudges my under eye area all throughout the day.  The mascara on my lower lashes comes off onto my under eye area....quite ugly and embarrassing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and now its discontinued! So sad! I received the product earlier than expected as well! You will love it!</li>
    <li> There was barely anything in it!</li>
    <li> I bought a brand new tube of this mascara. It seemed pretty dry but worked. I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a dramatic difference. However, the waterproof claim is so blatantly false, that I felt I had to write this review. It was hot day with elevated humidity. This mascara ran and smeared. I hate to think if it rained what would&#x27;ve happened. Washing it off wasn&#x27;t a problem since obviously it&#x27;s not waterproof.</li>
    <li> This product is very very difficult to remove. I tried different makeup removers and all failed to remove product completely from my eyes. I have to rub a little too hard to eventually get it off....not good</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued this, I should have kept it on the shelf since it is all I have used since it came out! So glad to find it on here and it has a good shelf life.  It is the best for thin eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Does no good, it&#x27;s discontinued!... Looked all over till I found it here.. It was the best of the Maybelline line. I will not be buying Maybelline again!!</li>
    <li> I buy this mascara in bulk.  I can never find it in stores and it is my favorite.  I always get compliments when I use it. There is no other mascara that comes close to it!</li>
    <li> I already have long lashes but this gem extends them even further. May clump if rushed slowly put the white layer on which extends your lashes let it dry a little and then add the dark layer to cover up the white. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> i just don&#x27;t like it being waterproof. it&#x27;s very hard to clean them off at night. however, for some unknown reasons they are cheaper than the non-waterproof ones?! anyway, these are working fine. not like the other ones i bought from another seller (those were all cakey. bleh). i would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Fair price and fast shipping.  I bought it as a Christmas gift for my sister so I will have to ask her how good it is.</li>
    <li> I ONLY buy this mascara!! I have tried soooo many other mascaras and they weigh down my eyelashes and they uncurl. This mascara makes my eyelashes full and curled!!! Buy this, you will NOT regret it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff........just wish they still made it.  Why is it when something works, they take it off the market????</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it is so hard to find at a store anymore. It was a great price and works great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why Maybelline discontinued this product!</li>
    <li> Not as waterproof as it used to be.  Found that it smudged on my eyelids.  Overall, I like the product.  Wish it hadn&#x27;t have been discontinued.  Impossible to find in the stores.  But got it within a couple of days - great service.</li>
    <li> Water resistant yes. Waterproof, no. This mascara tends to clump severely and smudges like no other mascara I have ever used. I threw it out after about the 5th time using it. Wasn&#x27;t worth the fuss.</li>
    <li> The mascara side was dried up it seemed like it was really old.</li>
