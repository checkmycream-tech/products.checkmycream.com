<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does the job! But tears your skin up</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this could get negative reviews. I literally use this razor to shave my head every morning and I have never cut or gotten razor bumps from it. This is also not a one time throw out type of razor, I change my throw out my razor after every 3-4 uses.</li>
    <li> Work Great  have been using them for years!!</li>
    <li> I really tried to like these razors. They were cheap, but I soon found out that they weren&#x27;t worth the price I paid for them.</li>
    <li> Simple, light and smooth.  Those people who spend a fortune on 5 blade razors are wasting their money.  They believe the commercials on TV.  What a waste.  This disposable razor gives me a very clean shave and I can barely feel the razor.  At about 33 cents a razor, I can shave all week and then toss it.  What will 33 cents buy you these days?  Barely anything.  That is pocket change.  Please, BIC, whatever you do, do not discontinue this razor.</li>
    <li> This razor works, but the design prevents flushing the cut hair out of it, so it gathers there and becomes useless far faster than most other disposable razors.</li>
    <li> Blades get hair stuck in between them that is very difficult to unclog rendering the shaver junk.  I also didn&#x27;t feel like the blades were very sharp as they would pull hair instead of cut it sometimes which is very painful.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, my face/hair is different than other people.  It is a pain to shave, hard to get it all off, and my face suffers from it.  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of disposable and electric and I have not found something that really satisfies me.  THIS TOO is not perfect, but it is the best possible product for me.  I will use THREE shavers (!) each time I shave... and throw them all out at the end.  I know this is probably different than most men in the world that re-use the same disposable for many shaves in a row.  Since these are so inexpensive, I don&#x27;t feel bad doing so.  Anyways, the reason is that 1) sometimes they are not sharp right out of the package 2) most of the time they fill up with hair and can&#x27;t be cleaned 3) for a combination of reasons they start to cut my face and they have to be discarded.  So maybe I feel like a millionaire... being able to use new ones each time and throw them out during my shave.  Unfortunately, at the end of all this, my face is still beaten up and sore... in fact, I always have to shave at least the night before I go somewhere important... to give my face enough time to recover.  I would recommend these for the same reasons as I mentioned.</li>
    <li> These disposable razors are of good quality like most bic products, and you can&#x27;t go wrong by getting 30 of them for $10</li>
    <li> Not the closest shave, and it often takes a couple passes--but it&#x27;s super cheap and functional. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> OK, you need to buy these razors and get rid of the goofy ones from China that have the moisturizer strips that always warp and lead to cuts.  These are made in a free country…Greece…Lord knows they need all the help they can get.  These are the best quality razors for the most affordable price I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you can&#x27;t buy something made in the US, at least buy it from a country that can vote out it&#x27;s leaders!!!!!</li>
    <li> These disposables are very smooth on the skin and the results are acceptable, just not extremely close. I had to go over rough spots several times, but it caught the whiskers after that. Definitely worth the price for us with sensitive faces.</li>
    <li> A woman here. I don&#x27;t like spending money on razors, and these seemed to be about the least expensive available on subscribe &amp; save. Not terrible, but not really good enough. Next time, I&#x27;ll try the second-least expensive option.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, to a limited amount of three uses (in my case). I know they are disposable, but to use these devices once and trash them it&#x27;s almost immoral (economically , environmentally, etc). Since I am sure most people do reuse them they should last a couple of tries longer</li>
    <li> Very bad razors.  These things tear my face to pieces and leave long hairs.  I don&#x27;t mean a little stubble, they leave 1/8&amp;#34; long hairs all over my neck.  Second uses of these razors are out of the question.  I&#x27;m disposing of the two unopened bags I have and getting something better.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, actually better than higher priced, &amp;#34;big name&amp;#34; brands....we will and already have recommended this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> Different stokes for different folks. They are okay for me but not great. I see by some of the reviews that some folks feel that they are great. I am not one of them. They are okay for me but I only get about 2 shaves and have to discard them. My last BIC&#x27;s were single blade el cheapos and I got about 10 shaves from those. All in all these are okay for me and I will use them up.</li>
    <li> for the price and what I use it for the best. my head that is. I use 3 if its long and 2 for a trim. saves money on barbers</li>
    <li> Just as good as the Schick ST2 sensitive razors and cheaper per razor. Will purchase again for sure.</li>
    <li> good for couple shaves, no more</li>
    <li> my husband loves these disposables... He has very sensitive skin</li>
    <li> These razors appear flimsy and not able to remain sharp beyond two shaves.  I would not recommend them.</li>
    <li> These are such great razors at a really affordable price. They last for at least 6 shaves and probably more if  I wanted to push it.</li>
    <li> Requested by the homeless shelter staff</li>
    <li> Serves its purpose well and economical</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I acknowledge that a disposable razor should only be good for one shave, so be it, but this doesn&#x27;t even get one shave done. With minimal stubble and trying to keep the blades free from loading up, this razor goes gives up half way through a shave. If your good with paying double since you use two razors, go for it.</li>
    <li> My wife was very happy and with the price!</li>
    <li> I ran out of Gillette&#x27;s Sensor2 Plus Pivot razors and mistakenly bought these to replace them. If you have very sensitive skin, these might be fine but I prefer the Gillettes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors plane your beard more than shave it. You have to make many, many passes before your beard is mostly shaved. Moreover, the handle is poorly designed so the razor can spin in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are inexpensive which is nice but I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> Imagine taking a butter knife to your face... I would imagine that &#x27;Bic Twin Select&#x27; accomplishes a similar type of shave.</li>
    <li> Great products,and easy to use</li>
    <li> i am a white person , with normal skin , and by the time i get done shaving my face with this type of razor , i am left bleeding in so many places, i like there single blade razor alot better, DONT BUY THE TWIN , buy the SINGLE blade</li>
    <li> I wish these were a better quality razor.  they don&#x27;t stay sharp very long-last about a week.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I been using bic twin select for a year now but went over to a safety razor for a better shave. I can buy 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades for $11.95 that will last me a year that take up no space. no bags of bic shavers all over the bathroom.</li>
    <li> I typically use the black handle Bics.  Those became harder and harder to find. Finally the only store (a Walgreens) that still carried them near me stopped carrying them. Those razors had a sharper blade longer head and a bar that helped push growth down. Although i can still find online vendors that carry them i decided to give these a try. These compare to the Gillette Good News. I believe the Good News are slightly better but at almost twice the price. The shave is ok not to close i think this was originally designed for sensitive faces so the blade isnt as sharp as the Good News. Some of these plain and simpler razors are  sometimes hard to find as the stores carry the more expensive triple, quadruple and five blade models with fancier handles and lubricating strips, vibrating handles etc. Some of them are way overpriced for doing essentially the same job.  In essence expect a ok but not close shave with this model razor. The biggest selling point its the price. You can usually find these around $4-$4.50 in most cases. Nothing spectacular it does a adequate but not great job of a shave. I would not push my luck with anything more than 4 shaves with these. I toss mine out after 3 shaves personally. As well i would be wary of tackling more than 3 day growth with these. The blade just isnt sharp enough. In that event i usually will first tackle my beard with my electric clipper /trimmer and bring the beard down.</li>
    <li> This is a very cheap razor.  I think I would have gotten the same quality at a dollar store.  Will not order again. Only work for one shave and I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in a timely manner, undamaged in a package properly designed for size, protection, and ease of opening.  Product is as advertised and does what is advertised.</li>
    <li> A nice close painless shave. I don&#x27;t buy these because they are cheap, I buy them because they do a great job. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Effective and soft -  These disposable razors  work well on sensitive skin  and have done  a good job so far.</li>
    <li> Great price and arrived on time.  I actually bought these for my daughter and she said they work very well, for disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think these gave me a good shave.  The Kroger ones are better and made in the USA</li>
    <li> They do what they are suppose to do. Not the best disposable razors but for the price it&#x27;s not a dad buy.</li>
    <li> Ya these razors do not last long, but they do the job. I have extremely thick hairs on my face, often resembling rhino horns, and these do the trick every time. I use them for a max of 2 times. The trick is to shave with hair trimmers first.</li>
    <li> These unit work just fine, very basic but gets the job done. A bargain for the price. I would recommend this razor.+</li>
    <li> I have used the Bic Twin Select razors for more than a year.  They are a great value and give a good shave.  With my medium thickness beard, I get up to seven shaves before changing razors.  The only downside is these razors have no ridges on the handles. Ridges would promote a firmer grip with soapy hands.  But for the price, these razors cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> Great product for 1 or 2x use.</li>
    <li> Flimsier than &amp;#34;Good News&amp;#34; blue twin disposable blades but the price is less.  I like to buy my disposable shavers in bulk to last me awhile and I don&#x27;t have to go to the drugstore every other week to buy overpriced retail shavers.</li>
    <li> Not recommended for sensitive skin, I was a little too cheap on this one. The blades are sharp enough, but for me not a close enough shave without irriatating skin.</li>
    <li> These are great razors and they don&#x27;t cost as much as the &amp;#62;2 blade razors</li>
    <li> Great razors and a great quanity, package arrive intact and these razors are just what he was looking for ty.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like these, gave to homeless shelter and bought new brand</li>
    <li> These are good and reasonably priced disposable razors.  Shave close and economical to use every day.  Would reorder these razors again.</li>
    <li> These are the only disposable razors that I find last for any amount of time. I do have a light beard so do not know how well they work on someone with a heavy beard.</li>
    <li> Nice product and good price</li>
    <li> It is good. I occasionally treat myself&lt;br /&gt;to an old fashioned shave. This product&lt;br /&gt;does the job and I have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because like the rating states, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a cheap plastic razor that can be used as a backup razor, for travel etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to shave my tattoo area every few days. But I use a new one every 3 shaves as it dulls easily. Nowhere near as good as 3-5 blade razors but I think we all know that. Very light razor, which for me, I don&#x27;t like and would not use this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive and worth a try of you don&#x27;t want to spend more money on a quality razor.</li>
    <li> I discovered these disposable razors a few years back, and this particular model is tough to find in my neck of the woods. I&#x27;ve discovered that it lasts for a great deal of time, gives a close shave time and time again, and doesn&#x27;t cost me an arm and a leg to buy. Great value.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These razors do the job.  Good for travel razors.</li>
    <li> Terrible razors.  Work once (if that) before they become too dull.</li>
    <li> Bic Twin Select, Sensitive Skin: For my use, these are Great razors! Of course, every individual person would have their own preferences, based on their own experiences, but I highly recommend the BIC brand to anyone.</li>
    <li> They are good copy of Bic fake</li>
    <li> This products is ideal for me, it is not only of good quality, but also the best price for the product I have found.  The razor gives me a very close, smooth shave, is easy to use, does not cause scratches or nicks, and I get at least 15 good shaves from each razor.</li>
    <li> I buy these every couple of weeks, it just seems more sane to buy these than to buy other branded ones which are ridiculously expensive. With a couple of packs of this you&#x27;ll have a fresh shave whenever you need it. Instead of waiting for a cartridge refill. Also, its great because if you ever have company you could just pass them one of these.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as expected</li>
    <li> I get the men&#x27;s because skin is skin and I am not interested in paying more for the same product in pink</li>
    <li> Super cheap compared to the big razor companies and work very well</li>
    <li> Seriously that&#x27;s all I need to know about these razors. My partner is content with them and I know this only because he doesn&#x27;t complain about them. Disposable razors are ridiculously expensive so I have looked high and low to find the best razor at the best price. That&#x27;s key for me. I&#x27;m sure there are much better razors out there but they come with a hefty price tag. I have ordered these with the Subscribe and Save option so that I never have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Your not going to find a better disposable razor for the money...</li>
    <li> Perfect! My husband loves twin blade on for shaving.</li>
    <li> FOR THE CHEAP PRICE  YOU GET 3 PACKS OF DOUBLE EDGE BLADES WHICH CONSISTS OF 10 BLADES PER PACK..30 BLADES FOR 12.00 AND CHANGE..GO FOR IT GUYS..BEEN BUYING GILLETTE FOR YRS AT LIKE 8.00 FOR 10</li>
    <li> Have been using these blades for about 4 years.  This is after trying many, including the most expensive razors with all the latest innovations.  They all give you a good shave the first time.  For me it comes down to how many good shaves can you get for the dollar.  The Bic is best in my experience.  I used to buy these in stores, but I don&#x27;t see them there anymore.  Amazon is my source.</li>
    <li> After trying a few brands, I’m convinced you can’t get a better value than the BIC Twin Select.  I have a fairly heavy beard and the blades stay sharp after 8 or 10 shaves.  I haven&#x27;t suffered any nicks with these.  The razor design features a compact head for getting into those curves like under the nose.  Some of the cheap razors are not nearly as compact.  The head angle and extension is well designed for easy and comfortable holding in the hand.  Each shaver comes with a clip on protector that covers the blades.  While these can easily come off with some other shavers like the ones I’ve gotten at cost co, the blade covers on these snap securely in place.  There is a minimum of plastic to negatively affect the environment, yet they are rigid and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These will keep me going for another year or two&lt;br /&gt;All for the price of a couple of the fancy ones......How many blades will they&lt;br /&gt;cut you with now?  5...6?</li>
    <li> Does the job, can&#x27;t use more than once when hubby uses but I can get a few uses out of it (finer hair).</li>
    <li> Nice clean shave. Very economical for 30 razors. I use it to shave the nether regions and it didn&#x27;t give me any nicks or cuts. Actually much better than the disposable razors I was using before. They had the lubricating strip that stopped lubricating after the first or second use and just got in the way. Without the strip the shaving cream allows the razor to just glide. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> good razor considering the price&lt;br /&gt;I bought these wanting a decent throw away one use as I shave with them only after the weekend- otherwise I shave with an electric</li>
    <li> no frills - just a ggod shave. very consistent. i get 7 shaves per razor. i have a really tough beard.</li>
    <li> Cheap clean close painless shaves, what&#x27;s not to like? Use it while it is sharp, then throw away and use another FRESH ONE.</li>
    <li> these are great for the face legs and anything else you want to shave.</li>
    <li> much better than the other brands but these don&#x27;t pivot so they don&#x27;t shave as close as easy as the ones that do pivot</li>
    <li> I suppost to get 3packets and only got one packet and they feel really cheap not wort it, spend a few more bucks and get a better shaver.</li>
    <li> Just right for husband&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> cheap yes, but does a crap job of shaving too.</li>
    <li> Worked as intended. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My teen uses these.  That means they are tossed out after each use.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great.</li>
    <li> Is my beard getting tougher or are Bic Blades not as sharp as they used to be. Have to shave twice to get it smooth.</li>
    <li> not the best  won&#x27;t order them again</li>
    <li> Great razor at a better price.</li>
    <li> I get as good a shave as I do with any of the more expensive razors but for a lot less money.</li>
    <li> Great value. Very comfortable shave. I plan to purchase these razors in the future.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised</li>
    <li> nice disposable razor. recommend.</li>
    <li> The  reason I give this product one star instead of the five stars I had intended to give  is because the first to packages I ordered were really good. I mean for a disposable razor i was getting anywhere from 4 to 5 and at times 6 shaves from every razor! In the world of disposable razors that is unheard of!  So before I even finished the second bag of razors I quickly ordered more packages of razors thinking I had finally found very good disposable razors. Was I ever wrong! Now I am lucky to get even two complete shaves from the razors from the second batch I ordered. Most times I have to change to a new razor to finish shaving which is a complete joke. How could all of the razors in my first order be so great while all of the razors in my second order simply SUCK! I swear I have had to switch to a new razor half way through shaving because the new one I was using dulled on me. Maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky and get good razors with your order but as for me I will never order these again. I have one bag left, so using two razors to complete one shave means I should be done with them very soon. And in this case the sooner the better!!!</li>
    <li> My husband complains about the strip on all the razors at the grocery store.  This one doesn&#x27;t have the strip and works great!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the quality &amp; price. The best Bic razor for comfort!</li>
    <li> Not very good for shaving legs.</li>
    <li> Work very well and am surprised that they stay hold up well and last a good long while. Razors ,like most everything else, have gotten to be way, way over priced but these do the job quite nice and at a fair price.</li>
    <li> So far so good! Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> You honestly get what you pay for and while these come at a good price with the Bic brand name, they arent a great Bic.  The ordinary single-blade Bic you find in stores are better quality than these.  Having said that, at this price point, you really cant complain.</li>
    <li> THese razors are great.  They are very thin, sharp and easy to use and the price and service is great.</li>
    <li> Dollar shave club???  HA!  If I&#x27;m careful and keep it clean I can get about 8 shaves out of one of these razors.  I paid about $12 for THIRTY razors so I am in the Nickle Shave Club!  literally 240 shaves for $12 &#x3D; $0.05 per shave.  Why spend more?</li>
    <li> Great buy and didn&#x27;t have to drive in the snow to get it</li>
    <li> Sharp. I don&#x27;t have much to shave, but I can actually reuse these a few times before I need another one. Probably 20 years ago these would be considered the standard non-disposable quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll say i was surprised by how well these work. After being hit with a lot of commercial and personal reviews of how three bladed and more shavers give a better shave, i was reluctant to try these out myself. But the price of these was the main thing that won me over, or to at least give these a shot. The price of these three packages of ten shavers each (30 in total), was about the same price of a single eight pack package of some of the three or more blade shavers i&#x27;ve found in stores! Not only that, but the shavers work great and give a just close enough shave, but not so close to cut at your skin. The only slight drawback is that they don&#x27;t have a swivel head, but i had no trouble at all at making the adjustment. I would reccomend these to anyone! But of course, to each their own</li>
    <li> Super cheap option but a pretty uncomfortable shave (and I&#x27;m not that picky).  Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> I bought these razors for my brother and he likes them a lot. I will recommend them to anyone who need a clean shave for low price.</li>
    <li> Use for shaving in the shower. I like the narrowness of the blade for around ears, nose, etc. I also like the green blade cover. Its easy to find if it drops to the floor. The 1st razor is on about 10 days of shaves and still sharp. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Simple razors that get the job done. I use them to shave my head as well and find that the more simple the razor, the easier the shave. Plus I never feel bad just throwing one out if something is not right about it.</li>
    <li> I bought these to donate to our local homeless shelter. They were so appreciated! I have used BIC before and love the quality of the product!</li>
    <li> These are good razors to use once or twice then get rid of. Nothing fancy, just a reliable disposable razor.</li>
    <li> I have always preferred these over more expensive brands and triple/quad shavers.  They are light weight and work great.  I can get several smooth shaves from them.  WalMart sometimes has a four pack for $2, but amazon had a 30 pack for $11.97 with free shipping over $35.  Was buying other items, so these were just $.40 each.  That&#x27;s a good deal on a good product.  I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I got this for a stocking stuffer gift for my boyfriend who kept running out of razors. This will last for several months!</li>
    <li> not that strong but work fine</li>
    <li> These razors work well. They are from Greece. I like that. They are a great deal on Subscribe and Save, as well.</li>
    <li> best I have ever found</li>
    <li> I switched to this razor away from the Gillette (good news disposable) strictly for cost reasons.  This razor was less that half the cost of the good news razor when I made my purchase.  This razor takes a little getting used to but works pretty good for me and lasts about the same as the good new razor.  One change I had to make was to use my left hand for shaving foam.  This is because the handle has very little grip on it.  Also took my skin about a month to get used to this razor.  Overall, I would buy it again but its not the best razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin? You will have sensitive skin after using these dull non-stripped razors. These razors should be shipped with a styptic pencil to stop the bleeding. If those ISIS fighters shaved, I would send them over there to torture them.</li>
    <li> Not bad for disposable razors.Some are hit or miss.Grab one out of the bad and you could get a nice sharp one,whereas the next time you may get one not quite up to par.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  I can get one or two uses out of one shaver.  These definitely aren&#x27;t for multiple use and are small/slippery with soapy hands in the shower...but they do the trick for a quick shave if you&#x27;re not too environmentally conscious.</li>
    <li> After using these things for a few months I had to come back and lower my rating. I routinely go through 2-3 of them in a single shave because they clog with hair so easily. And I don&#x27;t even have a beard, I keep short stubble. The blades are pretty sharp sure, but it doesn&#x27;t matter when they are coated in hair that can&#x27;t come out. Opt for a better designed disposable or go up to a 3-5 blade.</li>
    <li> I like these razors good enough to write about them. They actually work good enough for about two good shaves or one if there&#x27;s more hair to cut off after a few day&#x27;s worth of beard growing. And after using a few uses now, I have never had one skin cut which is great. For a cheap razor to get a clean shave, I think these work good enough for getting that done.</li>
    <li> I used a gillette fusion for 8 years.  Why did I switch to these disposable?  Because after using the same razor for 2 weeks, my face would start to break out.  Unfortunately, changing the razors more often would cost an arm and a leg.  Finally, I had the bright idea of searching amazon for disposable razors. (As an avid amazon shopper, I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to think of this.)  Now, I use each disposable razor for two shaves.  The result?  Equally as close shaves, fewer pimples, and more money!!!</li>
    <li> I am a bic disposal twin blade user for years best throw away shaver on the market...what I love about prime is i got delivery from the USPS today a Sunday  way to go amazon prime</li>
    <li> They are very small, but it was a good deal. If I buy again I will buy larger ones. But they are OK</li>
    <li> 1) The shaving head only contains 2 blades which makes it light and compact. It&#x27;s easy to shave right up under your nose.&lt;br /&gt;2) There is no \\&quot;moisturizer bar\\&quot; to goop up your face while shaving. The more passes you make over your face, the thicker that goop becomes. The razor rides up on top of it and so it actually reduces the closeness of your shave. Plus, it&#x27;s almost impossible to wash that goop off your face when you are finished with the shave. And that bar makes the shaving head more bulky so that shaving close to the underside of your nose can be a problem. The absence of the \\&quot;goop bar\\&quot; on this shaver completely eliminates all of these negatives.&lt;br /&gt;3) The blades are sharp for a quick close shave and they hold their edge very well through multiple shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you looking for a good shaving soap/cream that makes your shaver glide over your skin? Try the Simply Right liquid hand soap from Sam&#x27;s or the Medium Thick Shampoo from Pantene. Just a nickle-size (or smaller) dab of either product with water will provide a smooth shave - at least as smooth as that goop without the disadvantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune on personal grooming.</li>
    <li> I normally rely heavily on user reviews here on Amazon, but you folks let me down this time. I guess I have been spoiled by my long-time favorite - Schick Slim Twin(Five Stars,  available on Subscribe and Save). The Bic falls short on 2 counts: The head is noticeably wider and thicker than the Schick, thus making it more difficult to get to the area under the nose for example. The Bic has a larger, cheap feeling hollow handle, compared to the Schick&#x27;s rubberized handle.. Don&#x27;t like the feel. Pros: A very sharp pair of blades, no \\&quot;lubricating strip\\&quot;, which does nothing. I will go back to my old fav after this.</li>
    <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s almost a clone of the Schick Slim Twin, which I am a die-hard fan of that razor, still use it, better than or as good as any other razor I&#x27;ve used (not falling for 3-4-5-6-10-20 blade razors) and now that Schick has decided to discontinue the Slim Twin :( ...I&#x27;ve been looking for a replacement.  This is it! It&#x27;s not 100% the same, but as close as I&#x27;ll get...until I win the Irish sweepstakes and buy enough stock in Schick to tell them to bring back my favorite razor!!!  Anyway, my nurse is here with my meds now so I have to go:)</li>
    <li> gets the job done and the cheapest alternative.  i like the schick slim blades little push gizmo better as that helps clean out the space between the blades.  also a smaller head. but these are a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a beard so i use these for the neckline and high cheek area.  works for that fine.  for a full shave its pretty bear bones..</li>
    <li> As the blades on shavers proliferated (I believe they are up to four blades - anyone for five, six, or eight?) and it seemed impossible to find a shaver that didn&#x27;t have that goopy slimy \\&quot;lubricant\\&quot;, I began looking for a better answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4-bladed shavers were becoming too big to shave close to the underside of my nose and the lubricant strips created a thick layer of goop that kept me from getting a close shave. Plus it was hard to wash that goopy stuff off. It was like having K-Y Jelly on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here is the answer. A small, handy shaver with 2 super-sharp blades and no lubricant strip. For a shaving soap I use a white-liquid hand soap like the store brand sold at a Club store or I use Pantene Medium-Thick Shampoo. Just a small dab of either one - the size of a dime or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this combination, I can get a super-smooth shave and the blades stay sharp through many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light to medium beard so your experience may vary but I cannot believe that you would get a worse shave than you are now getting. The blades just might not last as long as they do for me.</li>
    <li> These are the worst razors that I have ever tried. They simply don&#x27;t work. I have had to go over the same location again and again and again and still they leave hairs intact.</li>
    <li> Very good blades and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I had been using Schick Slim twins for a decade, but they&#x27;re so expensive I had to find a replacement. these were only 12 dollars for 30 razors, so they&#x27;ll last a whole year. They don&#x27;t have the cleaning bar, pivoting head and lube strip but with good enough Shaving gel you don&#x27;t actually need it.</li>
    <li> Real Bic razors - a very good price for a large package.  Razors are expensive and don&#x27;t seem to go on sale locally, this was a good price for the quantity.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I like these trim good</li>
    <li> I have a full beard which cuts down on real estate. The super-duper, three blade razors are hard (impossible?) to rinse/clean.&lt;br /&gt;These cheap, two edge Bics look like they are gonna be just the ticket!</li>
    <li> These are the best disposable razors that you can buy - period.  I&#x27;m a razor snob and because of my beard (manly) I can&#x27;t use a electric razor and have to shave daily.  I refuse to throw stupid $ at fancy triply/quadruple blade BS when something simple will do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every disposable razor on the market and this product performs better than any of them - and the price totally kicks a$$ on the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically buy like 100 of them and don&#x27;t have to worry about buying razors for many many months.</li>
    <li> I like these razors, fine.  They are not like the luxury three or four blade varieties, but just fine for normal use, and a great value.</li>
    <li> I end up cutting my face with these, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Im totally satisfied with this item</li>
    <li> Great item, purchase for my husband. Works well for price and quantity. Is as described on site. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> By far the worse disposable shaver I had ever used.  I don&#x27;t know if I received a bad lot but these shavers are terrible.  Tried several from each bag and the same bad results, a rough and dull shave.</li>
    <li> ok but cheep lookiong and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;wouldnot  buy again.&lt;br /&gt;the blade works well&lt;br /&gt;just not a quality feel to them</li>
    <li> its exactly what i needed and more i love the razors they do a great job its does more than what i expected</li>
    <li> Work surprisingly well with any shave cream. Incredible price! My new favorite. I never get razor burn, and I&#x27;m kinda sensitive to that.</li>
    <li> ok for a discount razor</li>
    <li> Gives a great shave for a great price.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. These things are very painful to shave with. Save your money and invest in a decent package of razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> These razors are great. Unlike the BIC Metal I tried before these, they do not chatter on my face, they do not cut me, they provide a reasonably smooth shave, and they last for a very long time. Hard to believe the same company makes both products.</li>
    <li> I bought about 100 of these shavers on Amazon five years ago and am only now coming to the end of them. I love their light weight, maneuverability and effortless cutting ability, even against the grain. The green Bic shaver works around my nose, jawbone and neck better than any \\&quot;high-tech\\&quot; contraption or old-fashioned \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;. They&#x27;re also much better than the standard orange and white Bics, which always seem to nick my face no matter what precautions I take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find you can double the useful life of these shavers by simply prepping your beard with a hot towel (I get about ten shaves per shaver). Using a green Bic shaver and aloe vera gel instead of shaving cream (I like to see what I&#x27;m doing with sharp instruments around my face) I haven&#x27;t cut myself in years.</li>
    <li> Not quite up to the super 5 bladed Gillette razor, but very good for a much more reasonable price. Glad to find it here as Walmart seems to have stopped stocking it locally.</li>
    <li> Goodbye Mach 3!  Spending $90 a year on razor blades is just crazy!  No, these may not shave quite as closely as the Mach, but in my case I was more concerned about my sensitive skin and the nicks I always get.  The design of these razors and the quality of blades leaves my skin closely shaved and nick free.  I just ordered two more packages.</li>
    <li> It is very difficult to find a good disposable razor that will be effective at shaving while also maintaining sharpness through multiple shaves.  I have tried just about every razor out there from Schick to Gillette and even the newer off brands like Wilkinson&#x27;s sword razors.  Every disposable razor on the market these days suffers from one affliction or the other.  It is either very dull and doesn&#x27;t last or is sharp but still does not remain sharp enough to use many times.  BIC razors are both durable through many shaves and also will not break you out that much, as one would expect with most sharp razors.  That&#x27;s a big deal to me because I have very sensitive skin and cannot use just any brand.  It&#x27;s way too expensive to buy the Gillette handled razors and their ungodly replacement blades for all of their prices.  It&#x27;s insane that you would have to pay upwards of $20 or $30 for 5-10 replacement cartridges for Gillette Pro Glide razors and/or the other Gillette series handled razors.  Not to mention paying anywhere from $8-$12 for the razor and handle alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been impressed with the BIC disposables so far and believe I would keep ordering them for many reasons.  Not the least of which is a great value for many blades that will last longer.</li>
    <li> These babies work great and give you a close shave and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. I was skeptical at first but one day on a whim I took the plunge and have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> not good at all&lt;br /&gt;feels very plastic and it can not shave clean!</li>
    <li> Good price, does the job - seems like a winner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s widely known that female razors are a total racket.  You pay so much more for disposable for soft grips and bright colors and whatever.  Men&#x27;s razors give me the same shave for the fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time with Bic, and I chose this one because it saved a ton of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap (not going to feel bad giving up these to guests)&lt;br /&gt;- sharp blades (not sure about more than 2 uses if you are doing a lot of areas though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- plastic handle is not comfortable at all when doing legs (but cheap, so who cares)&lt;br /&gt;- twin blades need more swipes than the glorious venous razors (again so cheap, who cares)</li>
    <li> very cost effective disposable. no need to pay extra for fancy 3 &amp; 4 bladed shavers, 2 blades works fine.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than to keep buying gillette cartridges.</li>
    <li> Ugh!  Worst razors ever.  Do not buy them!!</li>
    <li> I have a very pickie husband who hates electric razors and every razor I buy him he does not use, He uses these and likes them</li>
    <li> The shavers work very well.  They are so economical and are each reuseable for several shaves.  The package contained 3 packs of 10 shavers.  What a deal.</li>
    <li> These razors give several good shaves.  They cut better and smoother and last longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> These blades work very well for the price per blade. It is much cheaper than using cartridge blades. I was so pleased that I ordered twice.</li>
    <li> These are run of the mil single blade razors. Great deal 30 razors will last me like 5 years since I only need to shave every week or so.</li>
    <li> These razors suck. They cut bad, and leave pimples on my face afterwards. Honestly, any cartridge razorblade sucks, I would recommend a dual edge razor. They aren&#x27;t hard to use like people claim, and it cuts your hair like butter.</li>
    <li> Product is designed well so that cleaning hair off blades is easy under water, drops right off, versus other brands it can get clogged up. the twin blades do a great job cutting hair while being easy on the skin, and blades last a long time.</li>
    <li> Compared with the black plastic double blade disposable design it is also smaller and less likely to leave nicks on irregular surfaces despite firmer pressure. It retains its edge through at least seven days of daily shaves. It does not produce ultra-close shaves, but certainly adequately close.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product - that there is no lubricating strip I can understand, however a razor for men that does not include a swiveling head? Perhaps a bit more experience will help me to hone my skills but I found this razor difficult to maneuver around my upper lip as well as a few other areas. I&#x27;ll look elsewhere for my next razors and pay a bit more for swivel heads and lubricating strips.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t give me a close enough shave. I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;ve got thick hairs..</li>
    <li> meh , these last maybe a shave or two. Much more durable and smooth options out there.</li>
    <li> Great Deal, good quality.</li>
    <li> These razors are cost-effective for single-use applications. I have a thick beard and each razor gives me 1.5 shaves. I find these to be more cot effective than other shavers that claim longer life (and are more expensive.)</li>
    <li> I really wanted the twin blade swivel type but could not find them.  These work pretty well for me.  And the price is decent.</li>
    <li> These razors seem to wear out quicker than the 3-blade Bics, but since I have SO many of them now, it doesn&#x27;t matter so much. Not the sharpest razors I&#x27;ve ever used, but they&#x27;re good enough for what you pay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out why these are called &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; razors.  There is nothing about them that is better for sensitive skin.  That aside, they are inexpensive and get the job done as well as any other disposable razor.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price. Nothing spectacular about the razors themselves, but they got the job done. And contrary to the pictures posted, they actually give you 3 packages for a total of 30 razors. Not too shabby!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using these, and no complaints so far.  I want to see how many close shaves I can get from one.  Then I will consider raising my rating to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the single blade disposables that said they were for sensitive skin.  Shaving was a bloodbath.  Tried these recently, and a huge difference.  No nicks.</li>
    <li> Cheapest shaving yet.</li>
    <li> As a female I personally don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase these again. Even with shaving cream I ended up with quite a few cuts probably 8-12 the first time I shaved my legs. I don&#x27;t particularly have thick hair or a lot of it either but I&#x27;ll probably stick with the ones with the lubricating strip as those don&#x27;t cut me too often. Purchased to keep in my duffle bag for trips. I guess they&#x27;ll serve as a good backup for when my expensive ones run out. I wouldn&#x27;t expect more than a few shaves with these. The price is good but they simply didn&#x27;t work for me. I do tend to have sensitive skin, but even so I expected more for this brand.</li>
    <li> Great!  Better than the stores!</li>
    <li> They have no glide strip and I get better shave from disposable tri blade models but for the price these are pretty good.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and the blades are okay, but the handles are surprisingly slender and harder to grip than most disposables.  These really should not be marketed to men.</li>
    <li> If you want a smooth and painless shave use only one and max two per shave, I tried more than two and it hurts.  They are pretty cheap and they do a decent job.</li>
    <li> Only good for about 2 shaves each before getting cuts. I&#x27;ll be donating the rest. Two stars because of low price. Get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Great value if you use razors alot.</li>
    <li> I liked the Gillette disposable shavers I bought most recently.  But, as good as they were, they didn&#x27;t last as long as the Bic razors I&#x27;d used before.  So, it&#x27;s back to Bic.</li>
    <li> These are the best, sharpest razors I have ever used.  Everything else is just noise.  Even the more expensive three and four blade, I don&#x27;t think they work as well as Bic Twin.  And they seem to get sharper for a couple uses.  Bravo, Bic, just wish I could find them in stores when I am in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette Fusion Powers and Proglides for all of my life.  Those are the razors with 4-5 blades.  I have been able to pull about 25 shaves from those razors before replacing the cartridges.  However, I started having a fungal infection that affected my face, so my doctor told me that one thing that might help is to use disposable razors instead that would last two or three shaves, so that I wouldn&#x27;t spread fungus over my face consistently using old cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are awesome!  There&#x27;s no discomfort or anything.  In my opinion, it shaves as close as a Gillette Fusion razor.  I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts yet, so I don&#x27;t think these razors have that problem.  I would say that these razors are great for about four or five shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s do the math.  If there are about 360 days in a year, and each razor is good for 4 days, then you only need 90 disposable razors a year.  And each pack you buy comes with 30.  So you&#x27;ll only need to buy 3 packs, and each pack costs $10, then you&#x27;ll only spend $30 a year on razors.  Now, if you shave every other day or whatever, then you&#x27;ll only be spending around $20 a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  When I bought these razors, it came as a 10 + 4 bonus for each pack.  So I really got 42 razors in the pack, instead of 30.  I felt like I hit the jackpot.  Not sure if this is a permanent thing, or BIC was just doing a temporary sale and I got one of the lucky packages.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I&#x27;ve seen on razors in a while.  First off save your money on those pricey blade&#x27;s and get these.  Its mostly the shave cream one uses that gives the close shave,  I use shave Gel only, not cream and with the gel I get a very close shave with most razors.  I bought these because they were Bic and low cost and the shave I get when I use shave gel and these Bic razors is as close as I get with a 3 to 4 blade system but less than 70% the price.  I&#x27;ve tried every razor blade out there and as I said I learned its the shave cream or gel that will determine how close a shave really is.  another good alternative is shaving soap with the brush; that with these or most disposable blades will give you a close shave.  The 3-4 blade systems are about 2 dollars per blade and don&#x27;t give any closer shave than these cheap Bics.  Use Gel shave lotion or soap and you will get a great low cost shave.  5 Stars all the way.</li>
    <li> These razors are much better than the Good News razors from gilette. Outstanding shave, outstanding value. I love this razor</li>
    <li> The best cheap razors in the world. All the other 60-blade razors are terrible compared to this, says my face.</li>
