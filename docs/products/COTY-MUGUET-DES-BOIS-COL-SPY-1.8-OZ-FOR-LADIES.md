      <li>Cute vintage bottle too.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume.</li>
      <li>Was very happy to find this fragrance is still available as it has been around for a very long time.  </li>
      <li>Nice, light scent, but it does vanish rather quickly.</li>
      <li>This lovely cologne not only brings back fond memories for me, but I find it to be the perfect scent for a hot summer day--light and bright and very refreshing.</li>
      <li>Very sweet, light summer fragrance which smells like Lily of the Valley.  </li>
      <li>This has been my favorite since the 70s: light, sweet, but not overbearing.</li>
      <li>Nice smell, not very complex or interesting though.</li>
      <li>Since I can&#x27;t afford the one I originally wanted, this will do fine.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is a light, fresh, floral-Lily of the Valley!  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this if you love a light fragrance that is very feminine and perhaps a bit oldfashioned.</li>
      <li>but it is so delicious and just as light as the pretty little flower (lily-of-the-valley).</li>
      <li>Nice scent for summer, especially, but excellent year round.</li>
      <li>Lily of the valley is my absolute favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>My younger sister has loved this scent since she was in college.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is gone very quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell very much like Lily of the Valley.</li>
      <li>What a clean and crisp fragrance!</li>
      <li>Muget des Bois is a light simple fragrance the is based on the beautiful early summer woodland flower lily of the valley.  </li>
      <li>Great Product~~~I would order other products from this vendor.</li>
      <li>i do find it wears off quickly.</li>
      <li>Such a refreshing scent!</li>
      <li>Smells exactly like lily of the valley!</li>
      <li>I enjoy it more for the nostalgia than the actual scent.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of my childhood and makes me smile when I wear it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fresh and recalls days of youth, capris, and ponytails.  </li>
      <li>Love the soft fragrance and the smell of fresh flowers is so pleasing.</li>
      <li>A classic, been around for years because it is so lovely for a young woman.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for top of the line perfume then this is not for you, but it definitely smells like Lilly of the Valley.</li>
      <li>Lovely presentation, but wish it had a box as I gave it as a present.  </li>
      <li>Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
      <li>It is just like the one I used as my first cologne.  </li>
      <li>It smalls a bit like alcohol when you first spray it</li>
      <li>It is the only scent she has used for many years.  </li>
      <li>Had this cologne years ago - love the scent - and recently got the yen to have it again.</li>
      <li>The impression it leaves is light, youthful and natural.  </li>
      <li>I did not expect it to do more than bring back lots of memories!</li>
      <li>Wonderfully smelling perfume ,only one regret that it doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>It really has the exact scent.</li>
      <li>but it smells exactly like the real thing.</li>
      <li>Lily of the Valley scent is pure Springtime to me.</li>
      <li>It is strong upon the first spray, but dries down to a very soft and true Lily of the Valley scent.</li>
      <li>Love it because the fragrance is so light and delicate.</li>
      <li>,I used it relly  fast.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance lasts for several hours, and I so enjoy wearing it.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
      <li>I would really like to purchase parfum as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The price was reasonable and the delivery was prompt.</li>
      <li>and you are left with a light close to the flower scent.</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t afford a pricey scent, this one is still a real bargain and very feminine.  </li>
      <li>This is fairly light, so it isn&#x27;t real long lasting, but then it is a cologne, so it isn&#x27;t as strong as a perfume would be.</li>
      <li>For the past several years I have enjoyed the convenience of purchasing it on Amazon and have always been pleased with the product and service.</li>
      <li>And thank you Coty for not changing the formulation for all these years - unlike many other companies that have destroyed their classic fragrances by re-formulation.  </li>
      <li>I have always loved the fragrance of the lily of the valley that grew in my grandmother&#x27;s flower bed next to the front porch--what a heavenly scent wafted on the summer air from those tiny white bell-shaped flowers.</li>
      <li>I have been trying to find a perfume that smells like the Lily of the Valley flowers since my previous favorite brand discontinued their lily of the valley scent.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>More like the original smell, tiny bit alcoholic though.</li>
      <li>Very subtle and pleasant, not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>Finally - after years of trying to find just that RIGHT fragrance</li>
      <li>I love this scent, but I was only able to use less than half of the bottle and it would not longer spray.  </li>
      <li>So old school but classic.</li>

    <li> Had this cologne years ago - love the scent - and recently got the yen to have it again. Did the search and found it.</li>
    <li> When I saw the bottle of this perfume, I thought it was &amp;#34;Emeraude&amp;#34;, which I love,but it wasn&#x27;t. Was not too happy with it. Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Finally - after years of trying to find just that RIGHT fragrance - I found it!  This is the most authentic lily of the valley fragrace I&#x27;ve ever come across.  I will be ording a LOT more.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. i do find it wears off quickly.</li>
    <li> Lily of the Valley by Coty has been around for years. It is a very light scent and not over powering.I love it and so does my mom!</li>
    <li> This cologne has a very delicate aroma, and slightly resembles lily of the valley flowers, but the aroma is not as strong, nor does it last as long, as it used to, years ago, when this fragrance was popular and could be purchased everywhere.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, classic lily of the valley fragrance. It reminds me of my childhood and makes me smile when I wear it.</li>
    <li> moms loves it great cmopliments</li>
    <li> this product had very minimal fragrance.  plus it doesn&#x27;t remotely smell like lily of the valley.  very disappointed.  feel like i was ripped off.  will not order from them again.</li>
    <li> Love it because the fragrance is so light and delicate. I would really like to purchase parfum as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> I was delighted that I ;could find the Lily of the Valley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll send for more when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> I lives coty cologne,,this just didn&#x27;t smell  like rhe coty cologne I used to buy five years ago..but I used it,</li>
    <li> Nice colors on bottle .it&#x27;s ok .for the price. Crabtree and Evelyn closed nearby pref its lily of the valley .heard they changed .it .  Would like to try many lily of the valley. Prefer sharper notes.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is gone very quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell very much like Lily of the Valley. Disappointed in this and would not recommend</li>
    <li> It is just like the one I used as my first cologne.  Nice, light scent, but it does vanish rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Lovely presentation, but wish it had a box as I gave it as a present.  The fragrance is a light, fresh, floral-Lily of the Valley!  A classic, been around for years because it is so lovely for a young woman.</li>
    <li> This perfume truly duplicates the scent of Lily of the Valley. Very subtle and pleasant, not overpowering at all. We&#x27;ve had positive results when spraying artificial sprigs in bouquets and boutonnières for weddings.</li>
    <li> Have been spritzing this fragrance since the 1960&#x27;s.  Lilies of the Valley is simply my signature scent ... it&#x27;s fresh and recalls days of youth, capris, and ponytails.  No one does it better than Coty.  So old school but classic.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite since the 70s: light, sweet, but not overbearing. Nice scent for summer, especially, but excellent year round.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume strictly for sentimental reasons.  I did not expect it to do more than bring back lots of memories! and it has.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, nicely wrapped in a bubbled envelope and the scent is very pleasant, true lily of the valley. Unfortunately, does not last long.</li>
    <li> Smell delicious - just like the &amp;#34;Lilly of the Valley&amp;#34; flowewrs !</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t afford a pricey scent, this one is still a real bargain and very feminine.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> How wonderful to find the perfume that I loved as a teenager in the 1970&#x27;s still available now. It brought back memories of those simpler times. What a clean and crisp fragrance! I will definitely be purchasing it in the future. The price was reasonable and the delivery was prompt.</li>
    <li> I adore this scent. It is strong upon the first spray, but dries down to a very soft and true Lily of the Valley scent. Cute vintage bottle too. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Was very happy to find this fragrance is still available as it has been around for a very long time.  Lily of the valley is my absolute favorite scent.  This is fairly light, so it isn&#x27;t real long lasting, but then it is a cologne, so it isn&#x27;t as strong as a perfume would be. Still very nice and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom.  She used to wear it when I was young.  Brought back memories for me, and mom just loves it!  Such a refreshing scent!</li>
    <li> Smells exactly like lily of the valley! Got it for my mother for christmas and she absolutely loved it! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is a knockoff but it smells exactly like the real thing. Love the scent. Came well packaged.</li>
    <li> Great Product~~~I would order other products from this vendor. Thank you so much for having a great product . :)</li>
    <li> This does not smell quite like I remember it-but it&#x27;s been 20+ years so it&#x27;s entirely likely it could be my sense of smell and not the cologne. At any rate, it arrived very promptly and in great shape.</li>
    <li> This is the drug store stuff you remember from childhood. I enjoy it more for the nostalgia than the actual scent.</li>
    <li> Great buy and love the scent.  My husband is crazy for it.  Since I can&#x27;t afford the one I originally wanted, this will do fine.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this if you love a light fragrance that is very feminine and perhaps a bit oldfashioned. It was my wedding scent and I grow Lily of the Valley in my flowerbed. I am an oldfashioned girl through and through.</li>
    <li> Very sweet, light summer fragrance which smells like Lily of the Valley.  Reasonably priced.  I would recommend more for the warmer weather.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully smelling perfume ,only one regret that it doesn&#x27;t last long ,I used it relly  fast.I wish they sold bigger bottles of it .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not that it isn&#x27;t a nice scent.  But from when I was a child, I always loved the lily of the valley scent.  As with one of the other reviewers, My grandmother had them growing in her garden.  I loved the scent, so I bought the perfume.  It didn&#x27;t smell like them to me.  So I was disappointed.  Maybe they can just make it smell a little stronger like lily of the valley-without making it overpowering of course.  Because it is a delicate scent.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this cologne for quite a while.  Always loved the scent.  So glad to find it on line.&lt;br /&gt;D. Opala</li>
    <li> Now that I bought it for the memory, I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. Nice smell, not very complex or interesting though.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful price for a scent-sa-tional product!  Thanks so much.  I have searched thru the stores for this wonderful scent with no luck. Amazon came thru once again.</li>
    <li> It smelled just like I remembered it smelling as a kid. If you are looking for top of the line perfume then this is not for you, but it definitely smells like Lilly of the Valley.</li>
    <li> My younger sister has loved this scent since she was in college.  It is the only scent she has used for many years.  She ran out nearly two years ago &amp; had been searching for it with no success all that time.  Silly girl - I knew where to turn.  Thank you Amazon Marketplace for not letting me down on finding this item.  And thank you Coty for not changing the formulation for all these years - unlike many other companies that have destroyed their classic fragrances by re-formulation.  Muget des Bois is a light simple fragrance the is based on the beautiful early summer woodland flower lily of the valley.  It is a floral, but with a hint of cyphre or grassiness.  The impression it leaves is light, youthful and natural.  I ordered a bottle and had it shipped directly to her as a surprise.  And the headline tells you how she reacted.</li>
    <li> My aunt&#x27;s favorite. She always wore it in the spring!</li>
    <li> Memory in a bottle.  Lily of the Valley scent is pure Springtime to me.</li>
    <li> Love the soft fragrance and the smell of fresh flowers is so pleasing.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find a perfume that smells like the Lily of the Valley flowers since my previous favorite brand discontinued their lily of the valley scent.  I have tried several other brands and so far this one comes the closest. It smalls a bit like alcohol when you first spray it but once on that goes away and you are left with a light close to the flower scent.</li>
    <li> This is not a long lasting fragrance once you spray it on but it is so delicious and just as light as the pretty little flower (lily-of-the-valley). It really has the exact scent.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but I was only able to use less than half of the bottle and it would not longer spray.  There is no way to get the bottle apart to fix the sprayer either</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Ooohh my Lily of the Valley perfume! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I used to get this for my Mom when I was a kid for Christmas. So I found it and I thougt I would be a kid again and get it for Mom this past Christmas. She about Cried and all the memories of Christmas Past came back to us. Thank you COTY</li>
    <li> I love single note colognes, which are very hard to find.  That&#x27;s all I will wear, so was thrilled to find this again after searching for years!  I wore it as a teenager.</li>
    <li> It arrived in time for the holidays, but the packaging left a little to be desired. It had string with a missing tag.</li>
    <li> I have always loved the fragrance of the lily of the valley that grew in my grandmother&#x27;s flower bed next to the front porch--what a heavenly scent wafted on the summer air from those tiny white bell-shaped flowers. Coty has done a wonderful job of re-creating their delightful scent with Muguet Des Bois. It is a delightful fragrance, very fresh and true to its name. This lovely cologne not only brings back fond memories for me, but I find it to be the perfect scent for a hot summer day--light and bright and very refreshing. The fragrance lasts for several hours, and I so enjoy wearing it.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Muguet (Lily of the Valley) for my sister-in-law for Christmas for years. For the past several years I have enjoyed the convenience of purchasing it on Amazon and have always been pleased with the product and service.</li>
    <li> More like the original smell, tiny bit alcoholic though. Hope this is not an old bottle. If so, wish the company would bring back the real stuff I remember.</li>
