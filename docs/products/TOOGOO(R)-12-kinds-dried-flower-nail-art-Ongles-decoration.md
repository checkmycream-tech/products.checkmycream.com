      <li>This Product is Unique..</li>
      <li>After that she still sent me to just made fun of me......</li>
      <li>This is worth the wait.  </li>
      <li>But their price does indeed make it worth the wait.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve seen some wonderful dried flowers out there made for nail-art, and these are definitely NOT among them.</li>

      <li>the flower is tiny and most of it were broken&lt;br /&gt;please do not purchase it</li>
      <li>But pretty</li>
      <li>This is what I put first place</li>
      <li>makes my nails look hot</li>
      <li>Need to put exact picture of the item</li>
      <li>most of the flowers were fairly large enough to cut pieces off of it and use on nails...</li>
      <li>The color variety isn&#x27;t even remotely the same as pictured, nor are they as brightly colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>This was a real bummer.</li>
      <li>received this to the very limit in a delivery date limit,which means it took 2months.</li>
      <li>I was really disappointee with them.</li>

      <li>The most sadness thing is this  is totally different products from the picture, all flowers were super tiny those big size ones is not there at all.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re actually super tiny</li>
      <li>In the picture there is more than one small flower in each compartment, but what I received was one large flower per compartment.  </li>
      <li>You can cut them in half or 1/4 to fit on your nails.</li>
      <li>i received larger spread out flowers that are way to large for nail design.</li>
      <li>I give it 3 stars because just one out of all the dried flowers were completely into tiny pieces which it will not be easy to work with.</li>
      <li>First time buying, not what I thought, some flowers are way to big to put on even big toe nail..</li>
      <li>Most of the flowers were either half-there or broken up completely.</li>
      <li>Im usually not picky about the nail art i get - even if its not as described as long as i end up liking it.</li>

<li> I was disappointed with what I received, but they are very pretty.  </li>
<li> not sure how to use it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered these to use on my nails and was somewhat disappointed. There is no variation in the types of flowers I got. They&#x27;re all the same kind, just different colors. I did get twelve different colors but I was hoping for more variation. They&#x27;re actually super tiny so I hope I can still find a way to use them. I attached a picture.</li>
    <li> They say for your nails but they are way too big to fit. I was really disappointee with them. I doubt these would even fit the widest of nails.</li>
    <li> I Did not received the product as advertised,,, as you see on picture I took,...package I received does not have the variety on the description from seller, I guess for the price is good but don&#x27;t expect to receive what&#x27;s on seller picture....  I would not buy again and will not recommend if you are expecting to get what is on sellers picture..</li>
    <li> these flowers are amazing, I just wish that i would of received the flowers that where on the picture</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the picture...not even like flowers. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just read yoho&#x27;s review. That us what i exactly want to say!! This item is totally disappinted and waste money!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t even want to give it a star. I wish u would-be read the reviews before purchasing. I will not be purchasing anything from this seller again. These flowers are broken, if they even are flowers... Looks nothing at all like the picture! I can&#x27;t do anything with them.... You&#x27;re a horrible person to even think this is ok.</li>
    <li> The ones I received weren&#x27;t at all like the ones shown here or from the ones I saw when I ordered them. They were small clusters of tiny tiny tiny flowers. The cluster was too big to apply to an entire nail and when I cut them down for size, they fell apart and I couldn&#x27;t use any of it. I ended up throwing them out. Total waste of my money and NOT at all like shown.</li>
    <li> Tried to use, they took a powder on me.</li>
    <li> the flower is tiny and most of it were broken&lt;br /&gt;please do not purchase it&lt;br /&gt;waste of money and my time</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some wonderful dried flowers out there made for nail-art, and these are definitely NOT among them. Very cheap. Most of the flowers were either half-there or broken up completely. The color variety isn&#x27;t even remotely the same as pictured, nor are they as brightly colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied to the nail AS DIRECTED, they look awful. The color changes upon adding top coat and makes your nails look like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend these at all.</li>
    <li> they are garbage!!!!!!! they where  dried up but not flowers!!! just a waste of money!!! false advertisement....do not buy these... you will be disappointed....</li>
    <li> Very fragile. Very cute though. Like the variety of colors but would like all different ones instead of duplicates. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> In the picture and description it said that I would be sent different flowers and colors, but when I received it, I received the same types of flowers, just in different colors. Some colors were very similar. The set was cute and I&#x27;ll use the flowers, but I wanted some of the daisy type flowers, and received none.</li>
    <li> My daughter does her own nail designs and she loves the colorful art. Definetely will recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> It was not what I wanted. The product itself is nice nd the service was great...but it turned out to b what I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> This is worth the wait.  I will totally use these dried flow nail art for the summer. I like them a lot</li>
    <li> the flowers are not assorted styles as advertised. Got all mixed colors of the same starburst style.  no mini sunflower style or little 4 petal ones. all were the style of tiny flowers coming out from the center. the jars are awesome to use for glitter though!</li>
    <li> It would have been nice to get more in each container but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> not sure how to use it</li>
    <li> I denied to lie on my review,then she started message me to make fool of me and made me scared of the her.....This is what I put first place&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This is totally different products from the picture!!@I received this to the very limit in a delivery date limit,which means it took 2months.The most sadness thing is this  is totally different products from the picture, all flowers were super tiny those big size ones is not there at all.I really wanna return this product but I don&#x27;t wanna waste my time for calling and pack back! I think Amazon should get rid of this from web.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, FYI.&lt;br /&gt;I left this message very honesty,cuz I don&#x27;t want anybody feel get sad buying this.After left this opinion,the lady from this company e-mailed me to say that\\&quot;no one have problem with size of these flower\\&quot;\\&quot;we know the actual item&#x27;s flower size is small,also even if you want the big size flower in the picture, we don&#x27;t know where you can buy the same product as the picture we put it up\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;She asked me to put this opinion change to something better,but when she find out I am not agree with her and the company,just said they will refund the money to amazon account since I don&#x27;t satisfy, just saying \\&quot;have a nice day!\\&quot; like I am a punk.After that she still sent me to just made fun of me......I can&#x27;t believe what happened!&lt;br /&gt;I felt the most terrible and saddest feeling from online shopping ever!</li>
    <li> most of the flowers were fairly large enough to cut pieces off of it and use on nails...but there was one disappointing flower in the bunch that never should have made it past inspection. Small and ugly..... but the rest of it was nice.</li>
    <li> they are not all of the same flowers they were different from the picture of cousre and not look as  nice as the ones as advertised</li>
    <li> These flowers are very beautiful but they are a tad big for me.  In the picture there is more than one small flower in each compartment, but what I received was one large flower per compartment.  It also states &amp;#34;12 kinds dried flower nail art.&amp;#34;  They are all the same type of flower.  I was disappointed with what I received, but they are very pretty.  Hopefully I can think of something to do with them.</li>
    <li> Love these beautiful and easy to work with.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I give it 3 stars because just one out of all the dried flowers were completely into tiny pieces which it will not be easy to work with. I thought I was going recieve what was in the picture but no. Mostly recieved just 3 pieces. They took a week longer to receive but yea.</li>
    <li> These are great flowers for your nails.  You can cut them in half or 1/4 to fit on your nails.</li>
    <li> Im usually not picky about the nail art i get - even if its not as described as long as i end up liking it. This is not the case. The dried flowers are to large and awkward for me to use on my nails and the picture just does not match what i received - i was expecting small dried flowers for placement on nails- i received larger spread out flowers that are way to large for nail design. This was a real bummer.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t quite what I expected but they will work</li>
    <li> These r OK but they always send show all these different ones but u only get the flat ones no to happy with this product</li>
    <li> These are so delicate and have been a joy to work with. the results of using this element in my nail art is beautiful!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t 60pcs at all. If you are looking to have the same flower as they show in the picture you won&#x27;t get it. I choose it because has two different flowers but I never got em. Just 3 flowers per color. Totally disagree.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture . I didn&#x27;t even get flowers pattern :(</li>
    <li> I recently started getting in to nail art. I was recently introduced to dry flowers. I was alittle scared at first to use them with so many people say they didn&#x27;t like them. However, I fell in love with them the moment I started using them. This are delicated so any one who is not patient I would not recommened it.</li>
    <li> Some of the flowers were missing, does NOT look like the picture at all and what flowers I did get were broken or unusable. Not to mention that I got about 3 of each flower, some were even empty or there was one or 2. Don&#x27;t buy unless you like to grt ripped off!!! So NOT worth it.</li>
    <li> I revived dry flower but not the same one like the picture on the web . I revived tiny dry flower .</li>
    <li> Product received was just as decribed.  Ony reason for 4 star is shipping does indeed take much longer.  But their price does indeed make it worth the wait.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t evern know how to use these. I mean it looks like a flower from someone&#x27;s garden. Do I put the whole thing on my finger or cut them into small pieces? I don&#x27;t know. Oh well, I will find some use for them. After all I did pay for them.</li>
    <li> it is nothing like the picture shown and quality is sooo bad&lt;br /&gt;Very unhappy with this. Need to put exact picture of the item</li>
    <li> Was excited to receive these until I opened them up and realized they were nothing like the picture. They looked like dyed weeds not individual flowers</li>
    <li> First time buying, not what I thought, some flowers are way to big to put on even big toe nail.. And broken... I&#x27;ll try something else.. But pretty</li>
    <li> this is not what i thought it was, it&#x27;s in the trash as we speak</li>
    <li> Some of the flowers were missing, does NOT look like the picture at all and what flowers I did get were broken, too small or unusable. Not to mention that I got about 3 of each flower, some were even empty or there was one or 2. Don&#x27;t buy unless you like to get ripped off!!! So NOT worth it.</li>
    <li> Good product just that they were too big for what I wanted to use them for. I was using them for nails.</li>
    <li> This Product is Unique.. Alot of people have never seen them.i cant wait to try it on a client.it is different.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected they are totally different then what you see here!</li>
    <li> These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price. They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this. It works great and leaves no residue or sticky spots on the teeny stars and stuff.</li>
    <li> i like how these look on the acrylic nails some are hard to work with but they look nice on the nails</li>
    <li> My sis loves it all I know</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the stuff people invent theses days it supper  makes my nails look hot cant wait to rock them this summer</li>
