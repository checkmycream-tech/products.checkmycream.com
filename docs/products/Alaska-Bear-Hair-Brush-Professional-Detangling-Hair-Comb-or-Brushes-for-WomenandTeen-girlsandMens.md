      <li>I have very fine hair</li>
      <li>they love it, so I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this type of hairbrush it truly works for detangling your hair.</li>
      <li>Gets tangles out of hair better than a comb.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter can get most of the tangles herself before I have to finish things off.</li>
      <li>It feels great on the scalp,  gently massaging it while detangling my hair.</li>
      <li>Love it ....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned several brushes in this style before, but putting this through my hair gave the the best scalp massage EVER.</li>
      <li>Satisfied.</li>
      <li>Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair.  </li>
      <li>I have many detangling brushes that look like this.  </li>
      <li>:) I love it too.</li>
      <li>I plan to buy a couple more because I find myself wanting one for my purse &amp; gym bag as well.</li>
      <li>My wife and daughter love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this brush based on the customer reviews &amp; it&#x27;s now my favorite brush.</li>
      <li>OK... I don&#x27;t have much hair, but I still appreciate a good brushing/scalp massage.</li>
      <li>This brush is lightweight and easy to grip.</li>
      <li>Tangles brush out easily and painlessly.</li>
      <li>but it does make it easy to spot.</li>
      <li>The bristles are mounted in a cushiony rubberized center which gives beautifully and makes brushing very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Using it on fine, medium length hair was a breeze.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is an oval paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fine brush.</li>
      <li>For my granddaughters, who have long, beautiful hair which tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>but it had a very strong chemical smell when I first got it.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m not a fan of the color pink), it works great. :)</li>
      <li>I can see how if I was working through a thicker head of hair, this would be a nice mix of gentle pressure (no hair pulling) and ability to stand up to tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One day while brushing my hair, she came up to be and made that cat sound that turns your head.  </li>
      <li>It is the most effective &amp; almost completely pain free brush we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>But almost immediately my hair was smooth and sleek, with no</li>
      <li>The brush is light weight but sturdier than it looks/feels.  </li>
      <li>I really enjoy this brush.</li>
      <li>: Free</li>
      <li>they aren&#x27;t nearly as gentle or effective as the Alaska Bear Brush.</li>
      <li>The Alaska Bear seems to have slightly more flexible bristles and slightly more gentle bristle tips.  </li>
      <li>am sharing this story, because I am sure there are other animal people out there trying to find a great brush...</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s GREAT on my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
      <li>With my thick hair, I prefer one with stiffer bristles, but I think this one would make an excellent brush for children with tender heads or those with finer hair.  </li>
      <li>The brush is a bright pink color, so it should be easy to find.</li>
      <li>The Alaska Bear SHOWER BRUSH is the perfect brush for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
      <li>But for fine, thin hair, this is a wonderful brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bristles are quite fine &amp; flexible with rounded tips making it very scalp friendly.</li>
      <li>Perfect for all hair types: fine, thick, curly, and straight hair&lt;br</li>
      <li>Made primarily of plastic, this brush by Alaska Bear works pretty well at untangling longer hair.  </li>
      <li>Great brush, I have other wet de tangling brushes that are not as good as this one.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli</li>
      <li>brush is perfect after a shower and hair wash for anyone who has long or short hair.</li>
      <li>This Alaska no-tangle brush is very lightweight and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my 15 year old grand daughter that lives in another state.  </li>
      <li>Rarely does she call me but upon using this brush the day she got it she made a point of &amp;#34;texting&amp;#34; me, &amp;#34;Grandma</li>
      <li>Designed for smooth and easy brushing, works great on wet or dry hair&lt;</li>
      <li>When anyone else brushes her hair with all other brushes it has not been a good experience.  </li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I think they priced the product right as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Her birthday is right after Chrstmas</li>
      <li>When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t brush through as easily as I thought it would</li>
      <li>My hair is almost waist-length, but not real thick, and it tangles easily.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think the fine, soft bristles on this brush could even get through my hair but the tangles came out easily, without pulling, leaving my hair feeling soft and sooth.</li>
      <li>Great for removing tangles from thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have used it for several days and have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out like most brushes, so I don&#x27;t see a bunch of hairs in it.</li>
      <li>Salon Professional hair care product, use in the shower for tangle free hair.&lt;br /&gt;►  </li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was actually doing anything -- it was that soft and comfortable feeling.  </li>
      <li>Would like something a little more fine in bristles like my old hairbrushes used to be but appreciate the fact that it is free of animal cruelty.</li>
      <li>The other brands we own are the Sharkk, the &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush, and OceanPure.  </li>
      <li>But either way, this is a way more gentle and safe way of brushing through hair than my usual comb and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Soft flexible bristles detangle hair with ease, eliminate tangles quickly and painlessly&lt;br</li>

    <li> My hair is almost waist-length, but not real thick, and it tangles easily.  I didn&#x27;t think the fine, soft bristles on this brush could even get through my hair but the tangles came out easily, without pulling, leaving my hair feeling soft and sooth. I was especially impressed how well it worked in the shower.  Wet or dry, this brush works great for me.</li>
    <li> definitely helps with tangles</li>
    <li> These wewe a gift so I can&#x27;t rate the product Good delivery Good price</li>
    <li> Love the brush! It&#x27;s hard to buy a brush unseen but I believe I made a good choice.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my two year old granddaughter.  Her birthday is right after Chrstmas so I haven&#x27;t given it to her yet, but I did check it out.  It looks to be just what she&#x27;ll need as she moves from baby hair to big girl hair.</li>
    <li> I have very fine thin hair and i have to be carful with how much hair fall out I have. This brush works great I think.</li>
    <li> Satisfied. Great for my daughters hair</li>
    <li> Initially I wrote &amp;#34;Cheap looking doesn&#x27;t seem worth it&amp;#34;  my 15 year old daughter just asked me for another one and said it&#x27;s best brush ever! I apologize for an initial bad review. She told me it doesn&#x27;t pull hair when tangled and she wanted an extra one.</li>
    <li> Love it, I have not seen any shedding, it detangles wet and dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have many detangling brushes that look like this.  They all work moderately well on my daughters&#x27; hair (one very fine and curly, and the other one thick and straight)...  That is, they get through the tangles but there is still a certain amount of pulling and pain.  The Alaska Bear seems to have slightly more flexible bristles and slightly more gentle bristle tips.  My daughters prefer it slightly :).  The other brands we own are the Sharkk, the &amp;#34;Wet&amp;#34; Brush, and OceanPure.  We also had a TangleTeezer which we liked but the lack of handle made it awkward to use.  I threw the Michel Mercier ones out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the brushes are used for general daily combing.  On days that they have absolutely horribly tangled hair (especially the one with fine hair), I go with the electric Remington Tangle Tamer and Marrakesh X Dreamsicle Leave-In Treatment and Detangler with Hemp and Argan Oils.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter love this brush.  Works for both of them.  Didn&#x27;t even have to use de-tangler for my daughter&#x27;s hair when using this brush.  A great investment.</li>
    <li> The brush is light weight but sturdier than it looks/feels.  Using it on fine, medium length hair was a breeze.  It was a good purchase!</li>
    <li> Great brush, I have other wet de tangling brushes that are not as good as this one. Sturdy bristles that do not crush when thrown in to a gym bag, and great price, will be ordering another</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 15 year old grand daughter that lives in another state.  She has long thick hair and has always had problems with tangles.  Rarely does she call me but upon using this brush the day she got it she made a point of &amp;#34;texting&amp;#34; me, &amp;#34;Grandma thank you for the hair brush. I got all my tangles out and it didn&#x27;t even pull my hair!&amp;#34;  So 5 stars!</li>
    <li> For my granddaughters, who have long, beautiful hair which tangles easily.  they love it, so I love it.</li>
    <li> Great for removing tangles from thick curly hair. My granddaughter can get most of the tangles herself before I have to finish things off. If you deal with thick curly hair you know you require a detangler and other brushes.  This is perfect for the start and finish steps for very curly hair with a minimum of breakage</li>
    <li> This brush is much better than I expected.  I have very fine hair and it helps give it fullness and softness.</li>
    <li> Great brush, great price plus fast delivery... an all around 5 star transaction. This brush is  probably the best brush I have used in years.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> When it came today it was a nice product until I found all these lines on it  And you can see them clearly</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first.  I have very thick wavy hair that tangles easily.  This brush works better than any other brush I have used and it does not tear the hair.  Tangles brush out easily and painlessly.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought this shower brush had bristles that were far too flexible.  They didn&#x27;t feel like they went through my hair so much as over it.  With time, I saw that the brush does work.  I don&#x27;t have knots and tangles left when I go back over it to check with my regular brush.  With my thick hair, I prefer one with stiffer bristles, but I think this one would make an excellent brush for children with tender heads or those with finer hair.  The soft touch is extremely gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by AccMarket.</li>
    <li> The Alaska Bear SHOWER BRUSH is the perfect brush for my thin, fine hair.  I usually use a comb in the shower (along with a conditioner) to detangle my hair before styling.  Since this brush is advertised as both a \\&quot;shower brush\\&quot; and \\&quot;the best detanglng brush ever!\\&quot; I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is a hot pink plastic, with an oval design and an easy-grip handle.  The bristles are very fine, very flexible, and very soft, with little nubs on the ends to protect the scalp.  The bristles are mounted in a cushiony rubberized center which gives beautifully and makes brushing very comfortable.  I used this in the shower after shampooing -- I applied a bit of my usual conditioner and then ran this brush through my hair.  At first I wasn&#x27;t even sure it was actually doing anything -- it was that soft and comfortable feeling.  But almost immediately my hair was smooth and sleek, with no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big plus is how few strands of hair were left in the brush after using it.  When I use a comb (or ordinary brush) to detangle my hair, I always find hairs left behind -- sometimes a lot of them!  But with the Alaska Bear brush I found NO hair in the brush after detangling in the shower.  It&#x27;s such a soft, gentle brush that my hair was detangled without losing a strand.  Later, when I used the brush with dry hair, I did find one or two strands in the brush.  But either way, this is a way more gentle and safe way of brushing through hair than my usual comb and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat is that this brush may not be a good fit for those with thick or coarse hair, since the bristles are so soft and flexible that they may not stand up to a more strenuous job.  But for fine, thin hair, this is a wonderful brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Please note:  I was provided a sample of this product for review; the opinions expressed here are my own.]</li>
    <li> This Alaska no-tangle brush is very lightweight and easy to handle.  The beads on the tips of the bristles help separate the hair quite nicely.  Unlike many nylon bristle brushes the bristles are quite thin.  I don’t have long hair, but by brushing it separates the hair strands, fluffing them up quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve tried other brushes of this nature and they feel as if they are massaging my scalp, but this one simply detangles.  Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair.  The entire bed of bristles is slightly rounded with the side and end bristle splaying out slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an oval paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  There’s no silicone on the handle, but I didn’t have any problem holding on to it.  When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  Children will especially love it when their hair isn’t being pulled by a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Hot Pink. Designed for smooth and easy brushing, works great on wet or dry hair&lt;br /&gt;►  Soft flexible bristles detangle hair with ease, eliminate tangles quickly and painlessly&lt;br /&gt;►  Perfect for all hair types: fine, thick, curly, and straight hair&lt;br /&gt;►  Features a rubberized non-slip grip, soft and thin bristles with rounded ends&lt;br /&gt;►  Salon Professional hair care product, use in the shower for tangle free hair.&lt;br /&gt;►  Brush size: 9” x 3”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all types of hair, save very thick hair.  With the thinner bristles thick hair might be problematic to comb out.  The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!) or to just have on hand when the hair gets slightly windblown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush!  Granddaughters have no more issues with brushing their long hair.  Goes thru tangles without them saying ouch.</li>
    <li> Made primarily of plastic, this brush by Alaska Bear works pretty well at untangling longer hair.  If the hair is wet, treating with conditioner, will help immensely in the untangling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristle stems are very thin and the nibs very tiny, which makes the brush fairly gentle on the hair, while still capable of getting the job done.  The brush provides good coverage, and feels great running across the scalp, as it doesn&#x27;t scratch or causing irritation.  The rubber coated handle provides a nice secure grip, and feels great to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for evaluation.</li>
    <li> We used it on our 3 yr. old grandaughters rats nest, it&#x27;s no miracle worker but with a lot of work and detangler spraying it finally turned out quite well. If used everyday we would never have a problem, but when you let it go, wow, what a job.</li>
    <li> this brush is ok for young girlswith thin hair and for boys but Not intended for Women s Hair.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is four, and she has long hair. You can probably guess that her hair gets tangled and knotty. It is sometimes a trial for her mother to get all the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is perfect after a shower and hair wash for anyone who has long or short hair. The bristles are soft and flexible and detangle hair with ease. The brush is a bright pink color, so it should be easy to find. It came well packaged and, enclosed in a hard plastic. Very easy to remove the plastic, and start brushing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with hair extensions this brush is perfect. It us also good with wigs and hair pieces. It did have a slight plastic odor outside of the box, but the odor dissipated after a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 05-20-14</li>
    <li> I know this says &amp;#34;shower brush,&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t work so well on my hip-length naturally curly thick hair when it was wet.  The bristles have too much flexibility to &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; into the mass of wet tangled curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s GREAT on my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  Very gentle, but definitely gets all the way to the scalp, and removes tangles better than a lot of other more expensive brushes I&#x27;ve tried.  I like the size, too -- it&#x27;s a bit smaller than a lot of other brushes, but that makes it more packable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll continue to use this, and toss my other brushes.  I just won&#x27;t use it for detangling wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sample was provided for review.)</li>
    <li> Would like something a little more fine in bristles like my old hairbrushes used to be but appreciate the fact that it is free of animal cruelty.</li>
    <li> Prefect for relaxed hair gets the job done</li>
    <li> I love this type of hairbrush it truly works for detangling your hair. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> essage ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is amazing!  My 7 year old has very long blonde thick hair that she had always had a hard time brushing it on her own.  When anyone else brushes her hair with all other brushes it has not been a good experience.  I plan on getting another one for my sister for her girls.&lt;br /&gt;I never write anything on products I have purchased good or bad but had to with this one!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t brush through as easily as I thought it would</li>
    <li> This hairbrush is so much more than I expected! I&#x27;ve owned several brushes in this style before, but putting this through my hair gave the the best scalp massage EVER. It feels SO good. I showed my husband and he also went &amp;#34;AHHHHH&amp;#34; to the scalp massage effect after a stressful day at work. It&#x27;s perfect perfect perfect.</li>
    <li> Nice. Gets tangles out of hair better than a comb.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter, perfect for her. Doesn&#x27;t make her wince when I brush her hair :) I love it too.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my granddaughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> OK... I don&#x27;t have much hair, but I still appreciate a good brushing/scalp massage. This brush is a great choice for that, and I enjoy it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cushioned bristle base is my preferred brush style, as it allows me to apply pressure without having to re-adjust my grip or force. The bristles themselves are a little on the soft side, so using it is a bit more gentle than when I use my other brush (that has bristles that are more stiff and wire-like). I can see how if I was working through a thicker head of hair, this would be a nice mix of gentle pressure (no hair pulling) and ability to stand up to tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though tangles are the least of my worries, it does a good job of flattening everything down after washing. So long as I don&#x27;t have to take it out in public (I&#x27;m not a fan of the color pink), it works great. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
    <li> Well, the color makes sure even if you have poor eyesight you can find it in the shower stall. That may be one plus! It is meant for less thick and more thin hair, in my experience, and the backing for the bristles allows some give and take which is wise, for this is to detangle, not to pull out hair, anyhow. It&#x27;s not heavy and while plastic all around, can therefore be used in water and wet situations. I was asked to try this out and this meets the standards for such a product, and the price seems sensible for this shower brush.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this brush. I have used it for several days and have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out like most brushes, so I don&#x27;t see a bunch of hairs in it. It feels great on the scalp,  gently massaging it while detangling my hair. After using it, my hair has a real full-body look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli</li>
    <li> I am always losing my brushes, but I won&#x27;t loose this one...it&#x27;s pink!&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good as it is easily untangles my hair and doesn&#x27;t pull it.&lt;br /&gt;I think they priced the product right as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  8/10/14&lt;br /&gt;  I know this will sound crazy, but, I have a very finicky cat who doesn&#x27;t like to be brushed.  Well, she has a very finicky owner who thinks she should be brushed everyday.  We were at a standoff.&lt;br /&gt;When this pink brush arrived, she paid a lot of attention to it. One day while brushing my hair, she came up to be and made that cat sound that turns your head.  :-#&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what she wanted, but as a joke, I tried to brush her with my brush...this Alaska brush.  She loved it!  She let me brush her for half an hour...a true miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Well, needles to say, this is now kitty&#x27;s brush, and at least twice a day she comes up to it, and meows.  She actually wants to be brushed!  I tell you it&#x27;s a miracle...no more cat hair anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;I am sharing this story, because I am sure there are other animal people out there trying to find a great brush...look no further...and at such a low price.  Good luck!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush based on the customer reviews &amp; it&#x27;s now my favorite brush. This brush is lightweight and easy to grip. The bristles are quite fine &amp; flexible with rounded tips making it very scalp friendly. The bristles are seated in a soft rubberized base that depresses slightly on pressure. I found other de-tangling brushes with flexible bristles but the rubberized base was quite firm...they aren&#x27;t nearly as gentle or effective as the Alaska Bear Brush. I do wish these came in other colors besides Hot Pink but it does make it easy to spot. I plan to buy a couple more because I find myself wanting one for my purse &amp; gym bag as well. The price on Amazon is very affordable too. l I guess it&#x27;s fair to say I can&#x27;t bear to be without my Alaska Bear Brush. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s a fine brush.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing brush. It is the most effective &amp; almost completely pain free brush we&#x27;ve ever used. Ftr I used to do hairprofessionally &amp; I wish I&#x27;d had some of this brush back then. Most importantly is that my little one hardly cries &amp; with any other brush or comb I&#x27;ve tried this one is the only one that doesn&#x27;t traumatize her.</li>
    <li> Love it ....but it had a very strong chemical smell when I first got it.</li>
    <li> Our girls really like the brush. It does not pull the hair, because it has very weak brush teeth. It could leave hair bit messy though.</li>
