### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an awesome shaving gel.  </li>
      <li>Consequently, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the ideal shaving lubrication.</li>
      <li>Even though it is Aloe infused and has great moisturizers, the Edge Gel does cause some irritation.....due to the scent....</li>
      <li>Great Product and works well.  </li>
      <li>The lathering was not as good</li>
      <li>it does a good job when using it to shave</li>
      <li>I find this gel to be superior to the foamy Gillette product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved all the Edge variations.  </li>
      <li>It smells good too.</li>
      <li>REally great stuff, I love the smell and it takes cares of my nubs.</li>
      <li>I had better luck at the dollar store buying shaving cream!</li>
      <li>its a great shaving cream to use it was cheap</li>
      <li>It easily worked into a good uniform foam</li>
      <li>more specifically, the delivery mechanism.</li>
      <li>I wont let it happen any more.</li>
      <li>I suppose it&#x27;s appropriate, considering this product was designed for men.</li>
      <li>This shaving gel does not create an enjoyable shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For some reason, it&#x27;s slicker and works better.  </li>
      <li>has a good scent to it and overall a good shaving cream to use.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>And I suspect that the problem is becoming widespread -</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to clean up any more messes.</li>
      <li>I use it with a Gilette Fusion ProGlide and it works very smoothly and quickly.</li>
      <li>adequate price, fast delivery, good product</li>
      <li>I called them up to complain and they sent me a coupon for a free product.</li>
      <li>makes my skin feel smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Edge since it first came out many years ago, in a number of permutations.  </li>
      <li>now it comes out as a very light blue foam.  </li>
      <li>I used the first can a couple of times and</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, Edge&#x27;s rich, thick lather softens even the coarsest hair and ensures a clean, close swipe of the razor.</li>
      <li>Scent is strong and feels tingly on my sensitive skin - occasionally leading to after-shave</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m less satisfied with the packaging --</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think, in this day and age, that Edge would be able to devise a nozzle that doesn&#x27;t continue to dribble gel for the next ten minutes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Edge.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m becoming less enthused about it every time i shave.</li>
      <li>The first time it happened, I thought it might have been caused by the altitude change during a recent ski trip.  </li>
      <li>when i first used it years ago it came out as a blue gel...</li>
      <li>This is the second time a relatively full can of Edge randomly drains itself out on its own.</li>
      <li>You know the old saying: &amp;quot;no matter how much you jiggle and dance, the last drop ends up in your pants.&amp;quot;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Edge Gel for years but in the past year I had 2 cans leak the entire contents into my medicine cabinet leaving a huge slimy mess to clean up.</li>
      <li>Edge Gel for Sensitive Skin is currently the closest thing to shaving nirvana.</li>
      <li>I have also found it to be quite economical; for my beard only a very small amount of gel will foam my whole face.  </li>

    <li> This is an awesome shaving gel.  I seem to get a closer shave with Edge gel products than with shaving creams and also seem less likely to cut myself or have skin irritation afterwards.  I highly recommend Edge.</li>
    <li> I used to use this in past and since switched Gillette. Currently using Gillette comfort advantage shaving gel, and will try the [[ASIN:B001E5E1VY Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Moisturizing, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6)]] next. The lathering was not as good and it was not bubbly enough for me. Hence I stopped using Edge brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased two cans of this product. I used the first can a couple of times and then one day I opened my bathroom cabinet and there was foam all over the cabinet from front to back! I called them up to complain and they sent me a coupon for a free product. I had a second can that I used that did the same thing. I would not buy the product again. I am afraid the can could explode! I had better luck at the dollar store buying shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Look under &amp;quot;hirsute&amp;quot; in the dictionary, and you&#x27;ll find my portrait. I need to shave every day to keep from looking like a sasquatch. Consequently, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the ideal shaving lubrication. Edge Gel for Sensitive Skin is currently the closest thing to shaving nirvana. Easy to apply, Edge&#x27;s rich, thick lather softens even the coarsest hair and ensures a clean, close swipe of the razor. It helps reduce nicks and cuts, and soothes any irritation. And there&#x27;s plenty of gel in each canister! I would definitely recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m less satisfied with the packaging -- more specifically, the delivery mechanism. You&#x27;d think, in this day and age, that Edge would be able to devise a nozzle that doesn&#x27;t continue to dribble gel for the next ten minutes. Every day, I pop the cap off to find semi-congealed, foam-encrusted goop caked down the front. I suppose it&#x27;s appropriate, considering this product was designed for men. You know the old saying: &amp;quot;no matter how much you jiggle and dance, the last drop ends up in your pants.&amp;quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Edge since it first came out many years ago, in a number of permutations.  There IS a difference between Edge and the Gilette, and between Edge and the &#x27;house-brand&#x27; drugstore brands.  For some reason, it&#x27;s slicker and works better.  I&#x27;ve loved all the Edge variations.  I have also found it to be quite economical; for my beard only a very small amount of gel will foam my whole face.  Highly recommended, and like another reviewer states, it makes that little lube strip on razors unnecessary.</li>
    <li> I had 2 cans in a row explode.  The first time it happened, I thought it might have been caused by the altitude change during a recent ski trip.  But the second time it happened, the can never left my house.  No, I didn&#x27;t shake the can or knock it around.  I just got a little every morning and then put it back under the sink.  I&#x27;ll try another brand instead.  I don&#x27;t want to have to clean up any more messes.</li>
    <li> Before I had this, I used to just shave in the shower. It worked alright, but I would get razor burn, like small bumps and red irritation. Now that I use this, it has decreased dramatically. I use it with a Gilette Fusion ProGlide and it works very smoothly and quickly. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> Twice now I have had cans leak product through the nozzle. It doesn&#x27;t stop until the can is empty, it make a terrible mess in the medicine cabinet. And I suspect that the problem is becoming widespread - you can not send Edge (Schick) an email about the problem, their \\&quot;Contact us\\&quot; link on the edge webpage does not work. Believe it of not you get a page \\&quot;not found\\&quot; message. They are ducking the issue. Try it yourself:  [...], you&#x27;ll get a message that says: 404 - File or directory not found.</li>
    <li> Great Product and works well.  Would definitely buy this product again from the Seller.  Delivered as promised and packaged well.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.  Prevents irritated razor burn rashes, etc.</li>
    <li> adequate price, fast delivery, good product</li>
    <li> its a great shaving cream to use it was cheap it does a good job when using it to shave has a good scent to it and overall a good shaving cream to use.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel smooth</li>
    <li> This shaving gel does not create an enjoyable shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Feels cold when you apply it to your face&lt;br /&gt;2) Foamed gel is thick &amp; takes a little extra time to clean off face &amp; razor (compared to shaving cream).&lt;br /&gt;3) Scent is strong and feels tingly on my sensitive skin - occasionally leading to after-shave irritation.&lt;br /&gt;4) Gel foam will dribble out of the pump nozzle after each use. Have to rinse out cap every time.</li>
    <li> REally great stuff, I love the smell and it takes cares of my nubs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Edge Gel for years but in the past year I had 2 cans leak the entire contents into my medicine cabinet leaving a huge slimy mess to clean up. I wont let it happen any more. Switchng to another brand</li>
    <li> It brought tears to my eyes. I never new a shaving gel could move me so deeply.</li>
    <li> Even though it is Aloe infused and has great moisturizers, the Edge Gel does cause some irritation.....due to the scent....Not enough to discourage buying it. So...go for it...get the Edge.&lt;br /&gt;Beware.....either choose this one or the Unscented....otherwise...the ones with the scents are neat,,,but the burn due to irritation will..EOWCH ! &lt;br /&gt;Best one...ha..Nivea Unscented</li>
    <li> This is the second time a relatively full can of Edge randomly drains itself out on its own. You walk into the bathroom to see the entire contents of the can leaked out all over the counter. Not cool!</li>
    <li> This is just what you would buy in WalMart. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about it, its shaving cream.</li>
    <li> the last few cans i&#x27;ve bought dispense the gel like a foam.  it spits it out with a lot of air.  when i first used it years ago it came out as a blue gel...now it comes out as a very light blue foam.  i&#x27;m becoming less enthused about it every time i shave.</li>
    <li> I find this gel to be superior to the foamy Gillette product. It easily worked into a good uniform foam and I find no reason for a change to another product.</li>
