<li> I used it on dark spots that I got recently, they are minors</li>
<li> I will never use that tan color as way too dark for a blond Swiss girl that just wanted a simple Coppertone tan color not an out of Africa tan</li>

<li> Blend medium and dark for a deeper tone.</li>
<li> I did not like the thickness of this product and only wanted to use it in a very small spot.  </li>
<li> I mix it with a little self-tanning lotion and use it all over my body.  </li>
<li> The sponge applicator ripped within a few strokes.</li>
<li> and they looked and felt pretty bad.  </li>
<li> It actually does not do anything, except having a fake uneven tan.</li>
<li> needs something a bit softer so you don&#x27;t have to push so hard to apply it.</li>
<li> A little difficult to blend alone but mixing it with a little lotion remedies the problem.</li>
<li> It was thick</li>
<li> Just too thick for me.</li>
<li> but it isn&#x27;t enough to cover my bad veins.</li>
<li> Thankfully this wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be unhappy with this product.  </li>

    <li> I bought the Tan shade as I do tan but it isn&#x27;t enough to cover my bad veins. I did wet my legs with a washcloth as other reviewers suggested. The sponge applicator ripped within a few strokes. It was too orange/peachy in color. It was supposed to dry quickly and not come off on clothing. I let it dry 45 minutes before dressing. I walked &amp;#34;near&amp;#34; my white bed spread and it brushed off on the white. I walked down the steps and my ankle brushed the step and it rubbed off onto the carpet. I tried to buff some of the excess off but by that point my veins were just as noticeable. I threw the product away. I prefer to use dark foundation make-up- it lasts and does not rub off. Thankfully this wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!  Covers beautifully!</li>
    <li> Bought the product. It didn&#x27;t cover up anything. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> If you use makeup you will have the same result. I asked for  color tan but it is more like dark red, like you are red skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product...shipped super fast.</li>
    <li> I like the way it looked on my legs.  It blended very with my complexion.</li>
    <li> This really does work &amp; does not come come off until you use soap!</li>
    <li> It met my expectations very nicely.  thanks</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t be unhappy with this product.  A little difficult to blend alone but mixing it with a little lotion remedies the problem. It provides good coverage with a satin look.  Blend medium and dark for a deeper tone. Also purchased for a friend and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product but i have an issue with application tip, it does not hold together well and flakes off as you rub it.  needs something a bit softer so you don&#x27;t have to push so hard to apply it.</li>
    <li> Great seller and quick delivery.  I only gave this 4 stars because though it does cover...don&#x27;t wear white.  As long as you don&#x27;t sweat it does not rub off on your clothing, but my legs get sweat in humid weather...something I never realized til I wore this.  My first experiment I wore it on my ankles after it dried, to bed on white sheets.  Woke up and did not find one stain from wearing it to bed.  You do need soap to wash it off and tan is very tan.  The price is great.  The coverage is good.</li>
    <li> Very good coverage and doesn&#x27;t come off until you shower.</li>
    <li> It worked wonderfully for me.  I read reviews from others about how thick it was and that it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly and easily. It was thick but I just mixed it with tanning cream or other lotion to make it thinner.  Went on great.  It&#x27;s a go for me.  I love it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  I mix it with a little self-tanning lotion and use it all over my body.  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> I really like the product, but I wish it didn&#x27;t rub off on my clothes and furniture, otherwise, it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I actually use bare legs on my face as it lasts all day long, unlike other makeup I have bought with this guarantee.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. It truly does what is advertised. I will try the Medium color next time. Tan is a bit too dark for me, but it works really well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It actually does not do anything, except having a fake uneven tan. I used it on dark spots that I got recently, they are minors but this did not do the job it claims it does. I got a better cover up using my foundation.</li>
    <li> This product does give a good color and coverage BUT it does rub of on clothes and shoes way to easily which sucks.</li>
    <li> The TAN was too dark for me. But because I choose that color (not realizing how dark &#x27;TAN&#x27; was) your company wanted to charge me again to just exchange it for a lighter shade. The additional cost to exchange it was so not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was an even exchange to a lighter shade. So I just lost $25.00. I will never use that tan color as way too dark for a blond Swiss girl that just wanted a simple Coppertone tan color not an out of Africa tan shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms Arnold</li>
    <li> It did just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I actually bought 2 colors both fair and tan. I use the fair first to cover discoloration on my legs then the tan for a nice look. NOTE that tan is bery dark andgoes on smooth and dries quickly. I suggest a shade lighter than you think you will need</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Sponge applicater wore off quickly but I  just use my own.</li>
    <li> I did not like the thickness of this product and only wanted to use it in a very small spot.  I had to do my entire leg and they looked and felt pretty bad.  Just too thick for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Does the job. Looks better than any product I ever tried for covering veins.</li>
