      <li>This nail polish was awesome!</li>
      <li>I think OPI is one of the best shatter/crackle</li>
      <li>Just got this in and let me tell you, if you love shatters, this is a must have!!!!!</li>
      <li>Got it for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it!</li>
      <li>the color is gorgeous!</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the texture and pattern of the Navy Shatter, so I purchased this color, loving how it looked in the bottle.</li>
      <li>That looks great too.</li>
      <li>Great seller.</li>
      <li>Very nice looking and a great concept</li>
      <li>Good product, OPI makes great nail polish.</li>
      <li>polishes out there (and I own about 2 dozen)!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried the shatter polishes, but this was a must have shade, and i loved it.</li>
      <li>And the shatter effect doesn&#x27;t look good at all, it just looks like chipping nail polish.</li>
      <li>I loved it...</li>
      <li>A GOOD SELLER.</li>
      <li>i absolutely love this nail polish!  </li>
      <li>I love OPI shatter, and this shade in turquois is one of my favorites!  </li>
      <li>Works amazing and</li>
      <li>Fun color, it looks great in the sun.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS COLOR, EASY TO USE ,GORGEOUS NAILS.RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>I was more into the color than anything...guess</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it.</li>
      <li>This is probably my favorite look for toenails.</li>
      <li>I love the color of this Turquoise Shatter polish.  </li>
      <li>I love OPI&#x27;s polish.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>TO ALL GIRLS WHO WANTS TO SEE NICE CRACKLE MANICURE.WILL PURCHASE AGAIN,FAST SHIPPING  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;really nice color and real Opi product too</li>
      <li>THANKS!!!</li>
      <li>You might want to take the bottle to a nail salon and have a professional apply it with the proper prep, for best results.</li>
      <li>Put a layer of top coat to really make it shine.</li>
      <li>It looks so cool on</li>
      <li>but it quickly became chunky.</li>
      <li>Very pretty.  </li>
      <li>You could go Black under and Turquoise over which looks great.  </li>
      <li>The OPI shatter is amazing with white underneath it.</li>
      <li>It is a fun shatter color to have.  </li>
      <li>This shatter polish is so fun.</li>
      <li>WOW IS ALL I COULD THINK OF THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SAY AT THIS TIME.</li>
      <li>I wear it over lots of bright or dark colors.  </li>
      <li>I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 8/26</li>
      <li>The brush is larger and covers more area, which is optimal when you&#x27;re trying to paint the one coat of this crackle on your nail before it dries.</li>
      <li>THIS POLISH WAS NOT ONLY TWO OR MORE WEEKS GETTING TO ME</li>
      <li>SO at first...</li>
      <li>Or you could be darring and do Bright Flat Yellow under and the Blue on top.  </li>
      <li>It looks amazing with black underneath.  </li>
      <li>I CERTAINLY GOT MY MONEY TAKEN ON THIS BOTTLE.</li>
      <li>the color is much darker than picture.</li>
      <li>I bought a second bottle, that too got chunky quickly.</li>
      <li>This is hands down my new favorite shade for my toes in the summer.</li>
      <li>just a tip though, if you want more of the bottom color to show through put on the crackle when the first coat isn&#x27;t 100% dry but mostly dry if that makes sense.</li>
      <li>The only reason I say I Love it on my toes is because I do not usually use color on my finger nails, only french.</li>
      <li>If you put it directly on bare nails it will stain and damage them.</li>

<li> The black shatter in this same brand works, but the turquoise never shattered for her.</li>
<li> I found that I had to use very little of it to get it to shatter and even then, it barely had a pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> AND JUST HAS A MINIMAL OF SHATTER TO THE NAIL</li>
<li> I would never have expected this from a well known brand like OPI.</li>
<li> Old thick merchandise.</li>
<li> Have not tried it with any other color underneath yet, because I love it with the white base alone.  </li>
<li> It dried out in the bottle...</li>
<li> Paired up with a white base coat the color looks like the blue of the Ocean.</li>
<li> the polish is a thick smudge nothing like the usual opi quality.</li>
<li> O.P.I sucks!</li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>
<li> /&gt;VERY disappointed.</li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS COLOR, EASY TO USE ,GORGEOUS NAILS.RECOMMEND TO ALL GIRLS WHO WANTS TO SEE NICE CRACKLE MANICURE.WILL PURCHASE AGAIN,FAST SHIPPING  A GOOD SELLER.</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the texture and pattern of the Navy Shatter, so I purchased this color, loving how it looked in the bottle. Well, this DOESN&#x27;T SHATTER. It took me several tries of removing polish and reapplying it (a big waste of polish and time) to get the effect I wanted. I found that I had to use very little of it to get it to shatter and even then, it barely had a pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY disappointed. I would never have expected this from a well known brand like OPI.</li>
    <li> Got it for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it!</li>
    <li> WOW IS ALL I COULD THINK OF THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO SAY AT THIS TIME. THIS POLISH WAS NOT ONLY TWO OR MORE WEEKS GETTING TO ME, IT&#x27;S NOT EVEN OPI SHATTER. I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME 8/26 AND THE POLISH IS WATER OR WATER HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BOTTLE. THE COLOR IS NOT THE SAME ON MY NAILS THAT&#x27;S ON OR IN THE BOTTLE AND IT WENT ON LIKE WATER AND JUST HAS A MINIMAL OF SHATTER TO THE NAIL AFTER IT DRY&#x27;S. I CERTAINLY GOT MY MONEY TAKEN ON THIS BOTTLE. THANKS!!! FOR YOUR UNPROFESSIONALISM AND UNTRUTHFULLNESS.</li>
    <li> SO at first... This nail polish was awesome! I loved it... And then about maybe 2 weeks without putting it on... I unscrewed the lid to put some on... And it was freaking solid! It dried out in the bottle... With the lid on! O.P.I sucks!</li>
    <li> Old thick merchandise.The company replaced the item which was satisfactory.</li>
    <li> The OPI shatter is amazing with white underneath it. I use it on my toes and always get compliments!</li>
    <li> I love OPI shatter, and this shade in turquois is one of my favorites!  It is so summery and shimmery.  I get tons of compliments when I wear it.  I think OPI is one of the best shatter/crackle polishes out there (and I own about 2 dozen)!  The brush is larger and covers more area, which is optimal when you&#x27;re trying to paint the one coat of this crackle on your nail before it dries.</li>
    <li> Just got this in and let me tell you, if you love shatters, this is a must have!!!!! Works amazing and the color is gorgeous!</li>
    <li> Good product, OPI makes great nail polish. Fun color, it looks great in the sun. Put a layer of top coat to really make it shine. Great seller. Very fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This polish is designed to go over another colour and have a crackled pattern similar to the one on the bottle cap. If you put it directly on bare nails it will stain and damage them. You might want to take the bottle to a nail salon and have a professional apply it with the proper prep, for best results.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this Turquoise Shatter polish.  I wear it over lots of bright or dark colors.  It is a fun shatter color to have.  You could go Black under and Turquoise over which looks great.  Or you could be darring and do Bright Flat Yellow under and the Blue on top.  That looks great too.</li>
    <li> I buy this from &amp;#34;Majestic Beauty&amp;#34;  and the color look the same they show on the picture&lt;br /&gt;really nice color and real Opi product too</li>
    <li> The polish I received is darker than the photo...I already have this shade.  I also did not realize that this was crackle nail polish.  I was more into the color than anything...guess that would explain the $8</li>
    <li> This is hands down my new favorite shade for my toes in the summer. Paired up with a white base coat the color looks like the blue of the Ocean. Very pretty.  Have not tried it with any other color underneath yet, because I love it with the white base alone.  Definately recommend trying it. The only reason I say I Love it on my toes is because I do not usually use color on my finger nails, only french.</li>
    <li> This shatter polish is so fun.</li>
    <li> So this is not only blue shatter, but it&#x27;s sparkly blue shatter.  It looks amazing with black underneath.  This is probably my favorite look for toenails.</li>
    <li> I love OPI&#x27;s polish.  I&#x27;ve never tried the shatter polishes, but this was a must have shade, and i loved it.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking and a great concept but it quickly became chunky. I bought a second bottle, that too got chunky quickly.</li>
    <li> it chips the second day...the polish is a thick smudge nothing like the usual opi quality. the color is much darker than picture. Skip this one</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my sister, who loves nail polish and turquoise. The black shatter in this same brand works, but the turquoise never shattered for her. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this nail polish!  It looks so cool on and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it. just a tip though, if you want more of the bottom color to show through put on the crackle when the first coat isn&#x27;t 100% dry but mostly dry if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> For one the color of the nail polish is completely different than the picture. And the shatter effect doesn&#x27;t look good at all, it just looks like chipping nail polish. It looks nothing at all like pictures!!!!!!</li>
