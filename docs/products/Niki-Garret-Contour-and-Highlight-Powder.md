      <li>and this was more peachy/pink.</li>
      <li>I really love Niki Garret&#x27;s contour and highlighting kit.</li>
      <li>but I like a more dewy/light colored highlight</li>
      <li>It is the right balance for my fair skin.</li>

      <li>The shades are very easy to blend, smooth application and for a powder not as chalky as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free review sample for evaluation purposes.</li>
      <li>That would really come in handy.</li>
      <li>Great duo set, with handy mirror inside - Will be placing this in my everyday makeup kit.</li>
      <li>Although when I tried on the highlighter I was impressed with the glow - even complimenting my pale skin tone at the moment.</li>
      <li>I contour right under my cheeks from where I apply my blush, sides of my noes, and around the top of my forehead along with my neck area.</li>
      <li>Its a good product for contouring the face especially if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I just love the look I can achieve thanks to this</li>
      <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t give me the Super cakey look or the</li>
      <li>The seller was very interested in the packaging condition and my satisfaction with the product.  </li>
      <li>the color is very workable - I can build the color up for an intense contour or do a light sweep and have a more of a muted look.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and blends very well, so if you&#x27;re pale like me you can apply very little of the product and make your face look very nicely sculpted and more attractive.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s as small as it is and is perfect for taking with you actually makes it my favorite compact!&lt;br</li>
      <li>have a relatively fair skin, especially after the long Buffalo winter, so I thought the contour kit in medium might be a bit too dark for my skin tone, but it&#x27;s actually a perfect match.</li>
      <li>It could be a smidgen more light with a touch of yellow undertone.</li>
      <li>The highlight isn&#x27;t white either, which is really nice.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend and overall easy to use.</li>
      <li>Contour is all the rage right now - go into any makeup store (Sephora, Ulta) and look around.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a powder kit and it&#x27;s super fine, which means it doesn&#x27;t settle in the fine lines and wrinkles like some other highlighters and contouring powders.</li>
      <li>I very much like the texture of this contour duo.</li>
      <li>highlight color is beautiful on my skin tone, it highlights and leaves a subtle glow</li>
      <li>This contour kit is definitely in the high end range, the quality of the powders are amazing.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>love the fact that this kid is so simple.</li>
      <li>The quality of the shades are definitely more than what I was expecting, especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Overall, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>The high light doesn&#x27;t have a natural feel while the brown does.</li>
      <li>It is easy for me because I only have to think about two shades and their placement.  </li>
      <li>compared this to the new Lorac contour palette that I just bought, &amp; I actually like the Nikki Garrett get better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a light brown asian that can be lighter in the Winter and darker in the Summer.</li>
      <li>The product is very shimmery.</li>
      <li>I have tried many other kits.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got shimmer in it, normally I don&#x27;t care for shimmer in my highlights, but Ive grown to actually really like it.</li>
      <li>find myself reaching for this kit on daily basis and really enjoying adding some extra dimension to my face.</li>
      <li>do believe that because this pigment is really high that I probably will be able to actually make this into a liquid contour, although I don&#x27;t even deem it necessary.</li>
      <li>It comes in a  high quality compact with a mirror.  </li>
      <li>buy a plethora of makeup, a mix of drug store and high end.</li>

    <li> Contour is all the rage right now - go into any makeup store (Sephora, Ulta) and look around. Nearly every single makeup brand has come out with a contour kit. And nearly all of them are super expensive. Not Niki Garret Contour and Highlight. Affordable and the pigmentation is fantastic. I was not a big fan of the highlight but I like a more dewy/light colored highlight and this was more peachy/pink. Check out my full video review and demo in this review for more detailed thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided in exchange for a honest review*</li>
    <li> OMG! No longer will I pay out the butt to find an amazing contour and highlight duo. ABH contour palette is nice, but I usually contour with creams, as I have a hard time finding a powder that blends well, or does not oxidize orange on my skin, or look like mud since I am so pale. Finding a cool brown color dark enough is just not it for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niki Garret to the rescue! These colors are skily, smooth, perfect. A little goes a long way, I airbrush my foundation, so If I want to contour over it, I have to use a powder. This blends perfectly into my airbrush foundation. (Art of Air) and, doesn&#x27;t look muddy, or orange. The brown is a matte, cool brown, its not to dark. The highlight isn&#x27;t white either, which is really nice. It&#x27;s got shimmer in it, normally I don&#x27;t care for shimmer in my highlights, but Ive grown to actually really like it. This is not too shimmery that its over whelming or looks weird on my face. I like it. I add the highlight just above my blush on my cheek bones, little bit under my eyes, my cupids bow, nasal bone, and just a bit on my forehead.  The contour down the sides of my nose, forehead and temple, cheeks, and chin. It really cuts down on the amount of time and product I have to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Niki Garrett you are wonderful!  The palette is small, compact and comes with a lot of product. It feels and looks similar to nars, but without the rubberized feeling to the palette. This is now my new go to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
    <li> I am a beginner at contouring.  I have tried many other kits.  I was on a search for the perfect kit and I found it.  It is easy for me because I only have to think about two shades and their placement.  It is the right balance for my fair skin. Of course, I also purchased a very good set of contour brushes that I believe make a big difference.  The highlighter does have some gold shimmer in it so you have to be careful in your application. And the brown contour shade is perfect in my opinion. You can be fearless with it.  The blending (brushes) is where your art begins.</li>
    <li> This contour kit is beautifully packaged. It comes in a  high quality compact with a mirror.  There are two different colors featured in the compact. The highlight color is a beautiful champagne colored highlight with a light iridescent shimmer.  It feels smooth and buttery when applying. It adds a subtle highlight to your face, when applied to the right areas it brings out your features and combined with the contour gives you a full polished look.&lt;br /&gt;The other, and slightly larger half of the compact features your contour color. It is a dark brown contour but can be applied lightly and used for lighter skin colors. This compact is marketed towards medium toned skin but still works for my lighter toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;I buy a plethora of makeup, a mix of drug store and high end. This contour kit is definitely in the high end range, the quality of the powders are amazing. They are creamy, soft and very pigmented. The compact itself feels like a high end product and made from durable materials, unlike the cheap plastic lightweight compacts you usually get from drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with instructional information on how to contour if you are new at it. This a great kit for beginners and advanced makeup connoisseurs.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product in exchange for an honest review</li>
    <li> This is one of the best contour kits I&#x27;ve used to date. I think I like it just as much as I like my Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit, and this one here is just a fraction of the cost of the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a relatively fair skin, especially after the long Buffalo winter, so I thought the contour kit in medium might be a bit too dark for my skin tone, but it&#x27;s actually a perfect match. The contour powder is matte and kind of a warm chocolate color. It&#x27;s easy to apply and blends very well, so if you&#x27;re pale like me you can apply very little of the product and make your face look very nicely sculpted and more attractive. The highlighter is very sparkly and glowy, with some gold speckles in it that give you this incredibly nice, sun-kissed, glowy look. I think it will look even more beautiful in summer time when my skin will be more tanned than now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a powder kit and it&#x27;s super fine, which means it doesn&#x27;t settle in the fine lines and wrinkles like some other highlighters and contouring powders. It&#x27;s a long-lasting product, too. It stays in place, doesn&#x27;t smudge or rub off, and there is no need to re-apply the product throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself reaching for this kit on daily basis and really enjoying adding some extra dimension to my face. My face shape is more on the round side, so contouring in the hollows of my cheeks, a bit on the side of the nose, next to the hairline on my forehead and just a bit on my chin, really makes my face look slimmer and prettier. My nose is pretty long, too and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always been very conscious of, so putting just a bit of the contour powder on the tip of my nose makes it visually shorter and more attractive. I just love the look I can achieve thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a free review sample for evaluation purposes. All thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a nice contour and highlighting kit. I ordered the medium because I have very fair skin. The contour color is a bit darker than expected but it does blend well. Just make sure not to put too much on if you have fair skin. I love the highlight color. It&#x27;s stunning and gives you a nice glow. The contour has some shimmer while the highlight is more of a matte. The compact is 3.25&amp;#34; x 2.25&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a perfect size for your purse or for traveling. You really only need to apply this once a day but it&#x27;s great to have in your purse for a night out when you need to refresh your makeup from the day. The compact has a built-in mirror. I do wish it came with a small set of brushes or a double sided brush. That would really come in handy. It&#x27;s soft enough to apply with your fingers if needed but I just don&#x27;t like the oils from my fingers on my face not to mention contaminating the powder. The powder does not clog your pores or cause any breakout. It&#x27;s silky soft on your skin. It gives you great shape and definition. I highlight my brow bone, straight down my nose, under my eyes, chin, and very bottom of my cheeks. I contour right under my cheeks from where I apply my blush, sides of my noes, and around the top of my forehead along with my neck area. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I really love Niki Garret&#x27;s contour and highlighting kit. It&#x27;s been a great addition to makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I was able to blend the color out perfectly so the contouring looked more natural. The shades are very easy to blend, smooth application and for a powder not as chalky as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight color is beautiful on my skin tone, it highlights and leaves a subtle glow - this is going to be an awesome summer set duo contour and highlight kit! The medium set that I picked out is a lot darker than what my skin tone is at the moment. I went with the medium shade because I plan on darkening up over the summer so I wanted to plan ahead for it. Although when I tried on the highlighter I was impressed with the glow - even complimenting my pale skin tone at the moment. I can see me using this duo set all summer long. I did not have any irritation - no redness and the color is very workable - I can build the color up for an intense contour or do a light sweep and have a more of a muted look. Great duo set, with handy mirror inside - Will be placing this in my everyday makeup kit. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! However I&#x27;m not a fan of the highlighter. Otherwise I would have gave this 5 stars!! This came in two days and I love the dark color! The highlighter just made my akin look a yellow shimmer, ugh.</li>
    <li> I am actually surprised how much I like this, especially for the price. My only issue is that the highlight is shimmery, which I feel looks unnatural. I just use a lighter cream foundation in its place. It actually blends really well with the cream, and doesn&#x27;t clump up like I thought it would. Overall, I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This product meets beyond my expectations.  I use makeup 5x/week and I am so happy with this purchase.  Product is matte but not powdery, so it doesn&#x27;t easily come off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for simple contouring and I LOVE the highlighter. It gives a nice dewy glow without being too shiny. The darker contour (I got the medium shade) has a lot of warm undertones so it gives a contour effect along with a bronzing effect. I now consider it my go to 2 in 1. It&#x27;s easy to blend and overall easy to use.</li>
    <li> It feels like you&#x27;re wearing eyeshadow.  Do not buy!</li>
    <li> This contour duo kit is really nice!!! The quality of the shades are definitely more than what I was expecting, especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the medium dark duo, and it&#x27;s perfect for my olive skin tone. I love the matte powder, and the shimmer that comes in this is perfect. I have never had a contoir kit that was actually perfect for my original and natural color of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I compared this to the new Lorac contour palette that I just bought, &amp; I actually like the Nikki Garrett get better. I honestly think that the pigments are just all around better I like that it doesn&#x27;t give me the Super cakey look or the I have a pound of mud in my face look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that because this pigment is really high that I probably will be able to actually make this into a liquid contour, although I don&#x27;t even deem it necessary. But I could. The fact that I have the choice actually makes me really happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this kid is so simple. You have the highlighter, and then you have the actual contour color, and the compact is perfect for a touch up kit to carry with you. The fact that it&#x27;s as small as it is and is perfect for taking with you actually makes it my favorite compact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anybody who loves playing with makeup, or does makeup professionally. This really is quite honestly the perfect kit, I love the texture, and Lake a really soft and butter, it goes on perfectly, there is not a ton of wasted product when you use your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Great product. My advice is you need a brush designated for contouring.</li>
    <li> This works, and does the job. I love how it feels! It&#x27;s a light powder that you can blend so that it doesn&#x27;t look caked on. The only problem is that the color isn&#x27;t an exact match for me. It could be a smidgen more light with a touch of yellow undertone. I&#x27;m a light brown asian that can be lighter in the Winter and darker in the Summer. I got the medium.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented and was in great condition when it arrived. I like the sleek case it comes in!</li>
    <li> Like the product, very easy to apply. However the highlight is very light and not great if you have a wrinkle. There is a slight sparkle to the highlight when I did not want.</li>
    <li> Its a good product for contouring the face especially if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend for mature skin as it has shimmer in it which highlites wrinkles</li>
    <li> Best cosmetics product I have bought! Great packaging, ideal size for my purse and has a mirror! And is absolutely gorgeous on! Exceeds my expectations?</li>
    <li> The product is very shimmery. Im a little hesitant to use it if not a special occasion. The high light doesn&#x27;t have a natural feel while the brown does.</li>
    <li> I very much like the texture of this contour duo. I also like brush application, I find better control using brushes versus fingers. The medium shade is perfect for my skin tone, perfect without garish streaking . I did apply and wear the product on a humid mid-west day and did not have to reapply. The seller was very interested in the packaging condition and my satisfaction with the product.  I highly recommend Niki Garret and look forward to purchasing additional products from this line.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but still a very good product I love it! Thanks!</li>
