      <li>Bought this to replace another hair product and it works great.</li>
      <li>This product is great for covering up those areas when your scalp shows through.</li>
      <li>But it does a great job of hiding your thinning spots</li>
      <li>Great product....</li>
      <li>This is great.  </li>
      <li>Not the best product theres better out there</li>
      <li>Or prop your sunglasses on your head, or sleep on a good pillowcase.</li>
      <li>The color is also a good match.</li>
      <li>Magic?!</li>
      <li>Plan to buy more when this is used up!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be more powdery - kind of like an aerosol spray version of Toppik, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>This is a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Best used before applying a shiny coat of strong hair spray to seal it in and to add a natural shine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for what it is though.</li>
      <li>Comprehend. :)</li>
      <li>All in all, in summary....it&#x27;s OK...</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It costs a bit more, but has more ounces.  </li>
      <li>or you won&#x27;t be able to brush through it.  </li>
      <li>and you can&#x27;t go more than a day then without washing it out</li>
      <li>Ordered 4 more.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
      <li>need I say more?  </li>
      <li>The new can is working just great.</li>
      <li>Easily covers thinning areas and thickens the hair...doesn&#x27;t come out when sweating or when getting wet...washes out easy with shampoo.</li>
      <li>After using it a few times I was able to perfect the application process.</li>
      <li>product is easy to use &amp; works as advertised.</li>
      <li>and the smell is really strong.</li>
      <li>The delivery of my product was very prompt which I liked.  </li>
      <li>For me, it worked best by exposing the bald spots and then spraying only a couple of inches from the scalp and covering with un-sprayed hair for a more natural look.  </li>
      <li>It works well, it is almost like a cheap hair transplant.</li>
      <li>The can was full but nothing came out.</li>
      <li>I incorporate several  products to conceal my thinning areas in an effort to acheive optimum results.</li>
      <li>I have tried many many different cosmetic products to cover it up.</li>
      <li>This probably would be okay on a guy or short haired women who keep it styled, but not for someone with longer, more flowing hair.</li>
      <li>They look much more realistic.</li>
      <li>First off, the color is relatively accurate if not a bit darker.</li>
      <li>The method I have found that works best for me is to spray it on and let it dry before working further with my hair.</li>
      <li>Once I discovered how much to use, it provided much better coverage and was much faster and easier than any of the fiber powders.</li>
      <li>I rated this product 4 stars due to it being a good product to get the job done.  </li>
      <li>I am okay with it because I have no other choice.</li>
      <li>I bought this to substitute a product I could not find on Amazon, hoping for a slightly more affordable alternative than the external site that sells my preferred product.</li>
      <li>Maybe if you have pretty short hair, this might be ok.  </li>
      <li>Firstly, this product arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>fullness and matches pretty well.  </li>
      <li>It washes out easily and it looks like the can will last for months.</li>
      <li>real sticky when sprayed in</li>
      <li>but i like fullmore much better.&lt;br /&gt;jerome</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>and it sticks very well to my hair even when I touch and brush it.</li>
      <li>It looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>Pros - Great coverage, makes my hair feel full and coarse and not so thin ...</li>
      <li>This one has a more even spray and less of a smell.</li>
      <li>Lasted a decent time.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I used Toppik for awhile and have found that all Spencer Forrest products are high quality.  </li>
      <li>I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a new can.</li>
      <li>I was honestly very very surprised when I started to use Fullmore.</li>
      <li>I had numerous emails to them and mailed the product back so they could see it was still full.</li>
      <li>This is more like a spray paint, and it is awfully hard to style hair after sprayed.</li>
      <li>and I am self conscious about it.</li>
      <li>As far as covering thinness?...</li>
      <li>it really makes your hair fuller,but it does rub off,see if u can find a solution to this only promblem.</li>
      <li>One word of caution is that it completely stains my pillowcase so wash it out before you sleep to avoid that.</li>
      <li>I have found that less is more as when I tried to overuse it, my hair looked and felt stiff.</li>
      <li>Fullmore is one of my favorite hair thickeners, next to My Secret Hair Enhancer.  </li>
      <li>The spray has a slightly greasy feel, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
      <li>I find this product easy to spray on the areas where my hair is thin.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I only got a few sprays out of the can before it stopped working.</li>
      <li>I use this each morning and let it dry for a minute, usually with the help of my hair dryer with the cool setting on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little messy with the over spray, a fine film on all surfaces.</li>

<li> The only negative (and this is with all colored products</li>
<li> It makes my hair feel a little thicker.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little lighter than my hair color, but not too noticeable after I tease and brush my hair a bit.</li>

<li> My hair was stiff, and brown streaks followed wherever it touched.</li>
<li> I use it everyday  and find it convenient for covering up thinning spots!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> product is easy to use &amp; works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have had the hair on my crown thinning for about 5 years now. I have tried many many different cosmetic products to cover it up. Ive tried all the brands of hair fibers; Toppik, Xfusion, Kabuki, etc. I tried Dermatch and Louvre. I was honestly very very surprised when I started to use Fullmore. First off, the color is relatively accurate if not a bit darker. After using it a few times I was able to perfect the application process. I have found that less is more as when I tried to overuse it, my hair looked and felt stiff. Once I discovered how much to use, it provided much better coverage and was much faster and easier than any of the fiber powders. I use this each morning and let it dry for a minute, usually with the help of my hair dryer with the cool setting on. I follow that up with my regular hair spray and it sticks very well to my hair even when I touch and brush it. One word of caution is that it completely stains my pillowcase so wash it out before you sleep to avoid that.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace another hair product and it works great. Ordered 4 more. This is half the price of other similar items.</li>
    <li> I am a singer in a band and my thinning hair is UNcool.  After using this product, it is difficult to detect the problem.  People started asking my bandmates what I had done to resolve my hair loss. This is a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> It is literally spray paint.  Plus it is extremely messy.  I would not recommend this product.  I would try the toppik hair fibers.  They look much more realistic.</li>
    <li> The spray has a slightly greasy feel, which I don&#x27;t really like. I thought it would be more powdery - kind of like an aerosol spray version of Toppik, but it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s ok for what it is though. The method I have found that works best for me is to spray it on and let it dry before working further with my hair. I have dark brown hair and bought the dark brown spray. It&#x27;s a little lighter than my hair color, but not too noticeable after I tease and brush my hair a bit.</li>
    <li> I incorporate several  products to conceal my thinning areas in an effort to acheive optimum results. But if I had to pick one it would be Fullmore&#x27;s Colored Hair thickener. The only negative (and this is with all colored products is that it does come off on your pillow. With proper laundering, it does wash out.  Great Confidence builder!</li>
    <li> I rated this product 4 stars due to it being a good product to get the job done.  This product can be very difficult to use if you do not do it correctly and apply it to the are it is meant for.  The delivery of my product was very prompt which I liked.  I would recommend this seller to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Washed out.  Not the best product theres better out there</li>
    <li> I find this product easy to spray on the areas where my hair is thin. The color is also a good match. And it definately thickens my hair.Good stuff!</li>
    <li> This actually works and is nearly impossible to detect.  Best used before applying a shiny coat of strong hair spray to seal it in and to add a natural shine.</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair and I am self conscious about it. This product is great for covering up those areas when your scalp shows through. The only bad thing about this product is any time you touch your hair or lay on anything it comes off on your hand or pillows, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;....real sticky when sprayed in and you can&#x27;t go more than a day then without washing it out or you won&#x27;t be able to brush through it.  As far as covering thinness?...well, it&#x27;s spray paint...need I say more?  I mean, it does cover some but if you have a &#x27;real&#x27; thin area I can imagine it would look like spray paint.  All in all, in summary....it&#x27;s OK...if you have nothing else to help you with the thinness, this would be something at last but I won&#x27;t buy it again I don&#x27;t think ...no.  I bought it months ago and used it twice because I don&#x27;t like the stickiness of it and the way it makes my hair feel gooped up and hard to comb out and the smell is really strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this to substitute a product I could not find on Amazon, hoping for a slightly more affordable alternative than the external site that sells my preferred product. Mistake. This is more like a spray paint, and it is awfully hard to style hair after sprayed. Maybe if you have pretty short hair, this might be ok.  I won&#x27;t be buying again... will keep for a back up once I can get the other product.</li>
    <li> It works! This product does what it was meant to do! I use it everyday  and find it convenient for covering up thinning spots!</li>
    <li> Fullmore is one of my favorite hair thickeners, next to My Secret Hair Enhancer.  It costs a bit more, but has more ounces.  I used Toppik for awhile and have found that all Spencer Forrest products are high quality.  This washes out easily, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.  I have pretty thin hair on the crown on my head and this covers very well, and lasts approximately one month.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is great.  Works well on thinning spots, beware though, it will run if your hair gets wet, or you itch your head, you will end up with colored fingertips.  But it does a great job of hiding your thinning spots</li>
    <li> Pros - Great coverage, makes my hair feel full and coarse and not so thin ...Cons - product gets all over your fingers, but once your done fixing your hair its all good! Love it</li>
    <li> This product has enabled me to appear in public without anyone noticing that I have endured hair loss from alopecia.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it. It works great. Helps to cover up gray roots between hair dyeing. Only thing I dislike is that it makes hair very stiff, but other than that I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Firstly, this product arrived well packaged and in a timely manner. The first time I used it I only got a few sprays out of the can before it stopped working. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me a new can. No problems whatsoever. Kudos to Deals on Demand. The new can is working just great. I use this for parts of my hair that have thinned and also to cover the grey between touch ups. It&#x27;s a little messy with the over spray, a fine film on all surfaces. I am okay with it because I have no other choice. It makes my hair feel a little thicker. It washes out easily and it looks like the can will last for months. I have used Bumble and Bumble Hair Powder in the past, it costs twice as much and essentially does the same job as this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Or prop your sunglasses on your head, or sleep on a good pillowcase. The coverage was there, but I have long hair and tend to brush it back often. My hair was stiff, and brown streaks followed wherever it touched. I didn&#x27;t think about my sunglasses rubbing it off, and I ended up going through a store with brown marks all over my face. This probably would be okay on a guy or short haired women who keep it styled, but not for someone with longer, more flowing hair.</li>
    <li> it really makes your hair fuller,but it does rub off,see if u can find a solution to this only promblem.</li>
    <li> It is better than my secret hair enhancer because there is less spatter from the can.  When I used My Secret hair enhancer I would get spatters all over my face that I would have to wash off.  This one has a more even spray and less of a smell.</li>
    <li> For me, it worked best by exposing the bald spots and then spraying only a couple of inches from the scalp and covering with un-sprayed hair for a more natural look.  Lasted a decent time.</li>
    <li> It works well, it is almost like a cheap hair transplant.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Plan to buy more when this is used up!  Would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting help for thinning hair</li>
    <li> This product although a bit messy does what it is intended to do although a bit on the expensive side</li>
    <li> the best product I have found</li>
    <li> Great product....Easily covers thinning areas and thickens the hair...doesn&#x27;t come out when sweating or when getting wet...washes out easy with shampoo.</li>
    <li> This has done wonders for my confidence. I am still trying to figure out how it works. Magic?! It looks like real hair. Do. Not. Comprehend. :)</li>
    <li> Not great! But it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
    <li> I color my hair and we all know that when the roots start to show it looks terrible!  To make it between retouches just do short spurts along the regrowth and it covers beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, packaged Well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> This product (dark brown) is a level 3 color. The product does not &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and for me was itchy. Resulting in the product getting on my fingers. Hairspray does not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; the color.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last year and used it a few times. The product does what it says it will do but I just didn&#x27;t like the feel of it on my hair.  I use it only in a pinch when necessary and wash it out same day.</li>
    <li> i like this product.  i use it to fill in some thinning areas of my hair.  it gives my hair the illusion&lt;br /&gt;of fullness and matches pretty well.  i&#x27;ve used jerome russell in the past but i like fullmore much better.&lt;br /&gt;jerome russell flakes and itches.  fullmore lasts longer without scalp irratation. i reccommend fullmore&lt;br /&gt;to anyone with thinning or balding hair.</li>
    <li> Terrible product. Do not buy it. The bottle gets jammed and can not be used. The company will refuse to refund your money</li>
    <li> This company does not back up their products. I ordered 4 cans of Fullmore hair thickener. When I used the 3rd can; way past the 30 days you can return a product, I found out that the nozzle was defective. The can was full but nothing came out. I had numerous emails to them and mailed the product back so they could see it was still full. After 2 months, they said they never got the can and that they only would have exchanged it if it was within the 30 days. No one could possible use 4 cans in 30 days.</li>
