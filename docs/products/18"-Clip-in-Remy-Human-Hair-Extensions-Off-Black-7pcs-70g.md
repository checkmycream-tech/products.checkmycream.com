<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shiping, good quality!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it it&#x27;s 18&#x27; but I guess it is lol and it&#x27;s too thin ..</li>
    <li> IVE HAD THIS HAIR FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS. THE SELLER ORIGINALLY SENT ME THE WRONG COLOR HAIR.  IT CURLS VERY WELL. iT WONT LAST ALL DAY BUT IT LAST FOR A WHILE. IT DOES GET A LITTLE NAPPY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT AFTER YOU TAKE THE TIME TO COM IT OUT ITS OK. ITS NOT THE GREATEST HAIR BUT YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE.</li>
    <li> I recieved my package today &amp; they are absolutely amazing!! I love love love them! Great texture, correct length, not stringy or bad odor!! They are thin but one package is only 70 grams so i got teo packs. If you know anythinh about hair extensions  and you have thick hair like me than youd know you would have to get more than one pack. Dont complain if you dont do your research before hand. These are a great product and i deff recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I just receive it in the mail and tried it on. When I opened the packaged there were a lot of lose hairs that fell out and on by bed. I was pretty disappointed that this happen. Then I clipped it on and OMG I look Gorgeous!  U can say they are temporary extension not long lasting but use it while u got it still beautiful and usable.  Price matches the hair</li>
    <li> It was expected to get to be by December 8th... It&#x27;s November 19th. Extremely happy. Thank you and it is able to be curled. Yay :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. love the hair. Good quality. Great customer service</li>
    <li> Love it! Very inexpensive and delivered sooner than expected! Good quality hair!</li>
    <li> Super happy with my purchase! They are thin but very good quality and for that price it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get clips and the hair wasn&#x27;t even cut????</li>
    <li> It came within good timing , maybe a week. Very good hair, its thin so if you have thick hair i recomend to get more that 1 package, also came with extra clips. I dyed mine black although it says off black here, they do come a little bit more on the brownside. Also curled them, they curl within 3sec!</li>
    <li> Yeah, there great but they didn&#x27;t even come with the clips. When it clearly says clip in.</li>
    <li> For those wondering if you are able to curl them, yes. I ordered to sets of them, this is picture is only for example. I&#x27;ve had these now for almost about 2 months. As you can see they are in fair condition, and I have not used the second pair yet. These extensions are inexpensive and decent quality. I recommend these hair extensions.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase although one package is not enough... am getting ready to order 2 more. great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I love these! I would definitely order again specially for that price.</li>
    <li> Love it. Needed to order more so it can be more full, and it also doesnt curl as much as my natural hair when wet but over all great. Love the hair</li>
    <li> Love them and you can actually curl them(:</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied Thought They Would Get Here After New Years But I Got Them In 2 Weeks, Ver Satsfied With The Hair!</li>
    <li> Seems more like baby doll remi</li>
    <li> Not happy very thin!!!</li>
    <li> They were exactly what I was hoping they would be.  Full disclosure, I bought them to wear as a part of a Halloween costume and they worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t let the description fool you, no clips attached at all!!!</li>
    <li> Just what we had expected.</li>
    <li> came with no clips and as one peice. Don&#x27;t buy unless you&#x27;re willing to sew the clips yourself.</li>
    <li> Girls you have to get your hands on these.&lt;br /&gt;well it can be curled dyed it has the human hair texture perfect for your hands.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to install but hope you please read the review. You must buy 2 pK&#x27;s 70 gram will not do your hair.  The clips holds perfect. They did not came in a fancy packaging but the quality is superb after all expensive packagin are  costly . I did mine yesterday without a a professional help And it look and feels great I wore it with confidence yesterday. This is a must have if you wear extension.</li>
    <li> Purchased for GF, it has a good length, but volume isn&#x27;t enough since it&#x27;s 70g, so 2 might be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was just right, folded to reduce size, didn&#x27;t affect item, also did not perceive any foul odor, smelled just like when you open something new. No grey hairs and clips seems to hold pretty good (during my quick examination).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it! Only advice (depending on your need or hair) is purchase 2, which would be 140g and have a full and long hair.</li>
    <li> I love them! I dont think they are real but the do look better then others I have got at this price point. I find I can use my straightener on a lower setting then I do my hair just fine. I have not tried to curl them with heat yet. When put in right no one can tell. I use a shine serum on my ends to make my hair shine like the extensions.</li>
    <li> Nice hair! But a HUGE slap in the face when i found that the hair only comes with ONE clip for the entire bundle... now i have to go buy clips, string and needles. Made my life a lot harder! Lol</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing extentions for years i didnt know much and the weight because ive always bought hair then sowed the strands myself so i could be in control of the thickness. These are 70g which isnt that thick when my box finally came they were thin as hell there was seriously barely any hair on the damn weft! Dont waste your money if your lookjng for thickness but they curl really nice thats about it</li>
    <li> i was super excited when i got my package and i&#x27;m really satisfied with my purchase. the shipping was speedy and the quality of the hair is good, overall i&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! They can way before expected! &amp; I love them!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I bought packs of these because reading the review&#x27;s other&#x27;s have said 2 packs are better. I wouldn&#x27;t advise buying these unless you had baby fine hair! The wefts are extremely fine...the quality though isn&#x27;t bad...Im just going to have to keep buying my extensions from Luxy Hair.</li>
    <li> Awful product. The hair clips were not in the package at all they were not even sewn in the hair extensions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not human hair as it advertised. I tried to style them and the ends krinckled and sizzled .... So basically they suck</li>
    <li> A little annoyed. First these extensions were curly..not straight like the picture shows which is a minor thing compared to the fact that this is advertised as a 7 piece set of clip ins and what I received was one large weft with no clips! So now I have to purchase the clips and sew them in myself :/ On the bright side the hair is very soft and nice looking and it seems to be the right color.</li>
    <li> Very thin. I did not receive my order until many days after the estimated delivery date. Also, i ordered off black (1b) and was sent color (1) black... Doesn&#x27;t really match my hair..but i can make it work. Definitely will be making my own from now on, it&#x27;s super easy. No bang for my buck.!</li>
    <li> in PERFECT Condition &amp;#60;3 Absolutely Love it &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;Only Bad Thing is That it&#x27;s Thin But Besides That i Totally Love it &amp;#60;3 !&lt;br /&gt;Totally Recommend !</li>
    <li> For one this Hair took forever to get to me also its not even human it looks like baby doll hair some of the clips look like its about to come of the weft and i got the wrong length i asked for 18&amp;#34; i got 22&amp;#34; i would never by anything from here again</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for good extensions for cheap, these are them. You can dye, curl, and straighten them. The length is great. But the two set backs I experienced is that they&#x27;re more brown than off black and if you want to use these for your whole head, I recommend buying 3 packs. 70 grams isn&#x27;t much. But overall I like these.</li>
    <li> GIRLS READ REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING . it comes in a little package , it came in early i was supposed to be expecting by july 31st or aug 13 but it came in today , which is great they left it in my mailbox SO CHECK YALL MAILBOX ! the hair is soft at first i thought it wasn&#x27;t 18inch but it is i measure it , it smells like rubber so y&#x27;all might wanna wash it , and if yall don&#x27;t know how to go to YouTube so y&#x27;all won&#x27;t mess up y&#x27;all extensions . also , they are (THIN) SO IF YOU HAVE THICK HAIR order 2 or 3 package&#x27;s just in case , i order 2 because i have thick hair . its great quality . i will see that girls will say the hair will burn  LADYS NOT TRUE , the only way its if your straightner is in high heat like 200 or 100 keep it on the lowest and it wont burn .</li>
    <li> They feel like real human hair. But are thin and not even 18&amp;#34;. They are barely 12&amp;#34;. It took 3 weeks to arrive. And I am unsatisfied with the quality.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, and looks natural. very good!</li>
    <li> Extension were great for my relaxed hair. The curls were lovely, The dye took well, and The price was very Good! Will order again soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why there is such bad reviews I got mine about a week ago and I can straighten curl ect.. They are off black like it says not brown at least mine weren&#x27;t the only thing &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; I have to say is that they are too thin which they are what they say (70g) which isn&#x27;t supposed to be thick so I ordered a second set which should be perfect for me since I have fairly thin hair</li>
    <li> Good quality. But they are dark brown not black. Not happy about that since my hair is jet black.</li>
    <li> First of all, took 2 weeks past the expected arrival time for me to get them. Second, they aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;black, they&#x27;re light brown. Last, they are super thin and not wearable. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Great quality human hair it didn&#x27;t have the clips it came in a bundle which was a little inconvenient</li>
    <li> it sheds way to much, easily falls out, can&#x27;t brush can&#x27;t design.</li>
    <li> These extensions are not as they were described. They were synthetic hair, not human hair. I discovered that by doing the fire test which proved to me that they were fake. It was a complete rip-off. This was not an honest seller.</li>
    <li> Too thin.  No direction on how to use them.</li>
    <li> Did not come with clips attached or at all. So now what am I going to do??</li>
    <li> Buyer Beware, This item came in one long piece not 7 pieces lit it said.  There were NO clips in the packaging at all.</li>
    <li> They came in today and it was fast shipping loved it, Just one small thing they are very thin maybe 2 would be good. They are very soft and i am able to curl it and straighten them.</li>
    <li> These are not human hair extensions they are synthetic pieces of s***.</li>
    <li> I tried to bleach and dye this extensions for about three times already and nothing changed. Color stays the same. On the description it says &amp;#34; can be dye and style&amp;#34; but hell no. This ain&#x27;t real human hair. I can&#x27;t style nor dye the extensions. eBay sellers are more honest thn the amazon sellers. I don&#x27;t even want to describe about the product anymore cuz is pointless n yeah my &amp;#34;Worst&amp;#34; experience ever.!!!</li>
    <li> I bought two packs and both of them put together looks like 70g . These extentions are extremely thin! You would need literally 4 packs .</li>
    <li> Love this item, great condition. Shipping on amazon said 3-5days and I got this item on the 26th of Oct. it came on a weds afternoon,NOT disappointed at all. Had no problems with the \\&quot;18\\&quot; extensions came in as soon as I thought was a plus, got compliments and it is not see able . Clip in are strong holds the hair perfectly as I look great which is a triple plus. I hate shipping and waiting, never really buy items but this quality from this sweet owner I found amazon very useful. When I received packages nothing but order forms and this package from this owner gave her or him word on shipping the item as fast and there email or number incase of an issue now that is free warranty. I would defiantly recommend this nor buy again absolutely love it. Especially when u don&#x27;t have much hair. Thank you omgosh</li>
    <li> I have really think hair if you want to use this hair you would have to wash and set you hair every week so the remy clips can look like you hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the clips are awesome and the hair is so soft a little shiny but I used some shine for my real hair soo it all work out</li>
    <li> This is definitely not 100% human hair.</li>
    <li> I sewed these and another set of extensions I owned together (my hair is really thick, so i needed to buy a second set) and they&#x27;re great, very soft, though I assume they were dyed black from blonde, because they&#x27;re blackish brown, and i often find blonde pieces here and there. But besides that, they&#x27;re wonderful. I get so many compliments on my hair, now!&lt;br /&gt;I may buy another set someday.</li>
    <li> The Hair is really soft and Great quality, but the track are really thin. And when I first opened them up I didn&#x27;t think they were 18&amp;#34;. I meassured them and they are, But the ends are really thin. If you want this to look natural and full, you&#x27;re ganna need to buy 2 packs of this. But overall This is a good buy compared to other sellers.</li>
    <li> This hair was cheap and gets nappy very quick when I recieved it, it was already tangled up. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM</li>
    <li> good product for the price! buy 2 if you want extra thick</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem like human hair but  it looks a little darker than I imagined so I have to re dye my hair to match</li>
    <li> This is my second package I really love them. My hair is really thin so these give me volume.</li>
    <li> I ordered black, but received a dark brown. The hair itself is soo thing, but I didn&#x27;t expect much cause they were so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Bought for my daughter, she was happy with this. I gave the 5 star since she likes it,and i was very surprised with the fast overseas shipping!</li>
    <li> Recently received this product, it came early, it didn&#x27;t take as long as it stated which was awesome!!! The color and length is what I ordered. I ordered three packs because I like my hair thick and full. Great investment and affordable. This was my first time wearing clip ins. I&#x27;ll stick to it for a while. The hair is a little thin so you should at least order two packs.</li>
    <li> They shipped much quicker than I thought they would, good price, shipped quickly, but the clips aren&#x27;t sewn very well, a use or two and the clips on at least three of the extensions had already begun to come off. I&#x27;m very glad I purchased them.</li>
    <li> I loved them although it took a lil long to get to me but it actually is human hair and if you want thickness I suggest you purchase 2 instead of just one: )</li>
    <li> I just got them today and they have No clips im so mad!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good  product &amp; also great service!!!. Recommend</li>
    <li> Worthless!!! I want my money back!! Extremely thin and the hair is falling out and I literally just opened the package!!!!!!!! 0 stars</li>
    <li> The clips were no where to be found and it was only one piece of hair in the bag</li>
    <li> They came in extremely early. They&#x27;re the correct color and they had no blonde spots whatsoever. Yes they are a little thin but that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re 70g. Don&#x27;t complain when it tells you. Great length. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s really frizzy. But nothing a little spray won&#x27;t help. ;)</li>
    <li> looks nothing like the picture-not thick, not even, and NO CLIPS!</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved them when I first got them, but after a while they become extremely thin. Great for short term use!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the chips but the hair is soft and nice</li>
    <li> Nappy hair. wasn&#x27;t actually black. Extremely thin. I had to wear a braid the majority of the time because it was a such a terrible grade of hair</li>
    <li> i ordered these cause my hair is somewhat short. first off, they&#x27;re not real hair, of course. but i recieved them and they&#x27;re alright. it feels and looks like real hair. but they smell weird so i suggest you wash them before you use them. and i tried curling them and it smelled like burning plastic...</li>
    <li> I bought these because I always buy cheapo hair extensions. They&#x27;re really thin but I have thin hair so that&#x27;s not a problem. Color is fine and they can stand heat. A month ago, I bought the expensive kind from Sally&#x27;s as a Christmas gift to me and they were frizzy and these actually aren&#x27;t. So pretty good, but don&#x27;t expect the best extensions ever for $20</li>
    <li> it took forever for me to receive the item. when I got it it was the wrong item. so now i have to wait again to receive what i was supposed to have in the first place</li>
    <li> Its not the best extensions ever but I&#x27;m pretty happy with them. I did have a few peices that had very thin hair and looked like alot broke off around the wefts and then others were perfectly good. I like that they don&#x27;t get all thin and stringhy at the ends like other extensions do. Its the same thickness all the way down. Its good hair, definitely human. Looks natural and awesome when there in. I had to get two packs for whole head of hair but that&#x27;s not a problem since its such a good price. The clips could be better, I&#x27;m glad it comes with extra clips in the packaging cause they feel like they could break.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like them they are not real they are synthetic. They don&#x27;t even curl. Very very disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> No words can describe my disappointment.</li>
    <li> These hair  extensions are the best ones I&#x27;ve ever bought. great quality and great price also. They have a great speed time on the shipping, they arrived 4 days after i ordered them, the only thing is they are thin toward the bottom so you may need 2 packs to make them look more realistic, overall i rate them with 5 stars. i love the hair it looks very realistic, i am satisfied with my new extensions.</li>
    <li> really nice and high quality</li>
    <li> synthetic hair cant do anything with it horrible tangles up had to throw away</li>
    <li> My first set, the color matches my hair perfectly! So glad! They&#x27;re soft, come in decent packaging and shipped in about a week and a half. They&#x27;re amazing, but you might need two packs to fill your hair out fully.&lt;br /&gt;Will totally rebuy! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product for 3 reasons: #1. It took longer than expected to arrive #2. It tangles very easily&lt;br /&gt;And the most important #3. It says it comes in 7 pieces with clips added but when I opened it, it was just one long strand of a nappy hair with no clips insight... Sadly I had to make my own adjustments just so it actually fits the description. And it&#x27;s not 18 inches either</li>
    <li> If you are looking for length or volume or both you will not find it  in this product. I had to learn the hard way. The hair is so thin, the least they could have done is double the wefts, the ends are very thin and stringy. I ordered 18 inches and i have had 16 inch hair longer than what i received. I  am disappointed, wont be purchasing again</li>
    <li> I bought these extensions in october, I love them. Full set of exactly what the description gives you. i hardly take them out, I even shower with them still clipped in. Great durability. About the original length I really can&#x27;t notice any difference in length/color/texture. When I found out about this product it seemed to good to be true. ((If you can&#x27;t decide between products &amp; the products happen to be the same, usually the individual will buy the more expensive product over the product that is affordable, because society thinks if something is priced low, then its cheap. Oh boy have people been wasting alot of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m basing my rating off the smell of the product, it smelled pretty bad even after washing it a couple of times, I even conditioned it with Lee Stafford products because their products are very perfumed and it still smells funky just not as bad as when they came out of the bag. Also heads up, the first wash a lot of ink/dye/colorant washed away and stained one of my towels. This was all kinda weird for me. Anyway, other than that they are exactly what I was looking for; I just wanted to ad an inch or two to my length which is exactly what it did, I already have a lot of hair so the fact that it is under 100grms wasn&#x27;t a big deal. The hair itself is thin, straight and soft blends in well and I straightened it once and still looks ok. I threw the extensions away after 2 weeks, the smell would just not go away.</li>
    <li> The product is of very good quality, arrived at the indicated time, love this hair !!</li>
    <li> These are not AT  ALL off black, they&#x27;re definitely brown and not even a really dark brown...very odd. They are thin as others said but for the price it&#x27;s expected. I just wish they were true to color....now I have to dye. Not looking forward to what the results may be.</li>
