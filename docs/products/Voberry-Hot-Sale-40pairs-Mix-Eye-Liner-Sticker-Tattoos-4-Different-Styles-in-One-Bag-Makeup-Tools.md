      <li>Great assortment of eye tattoos.  </li>
      <li>Love the designs!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how great my eyes look after I put these on</li>
      <li>I loved this</li>
      <li>I had used &#x27;tattoo&#x27; eyeliner once before and loved it, so I gave this a try.</li>
      <li>These are sooo cool!!!</li>
      <li>I love it too!</li>
      <li>They look amazing</li>
      <li>They give you a nice variety very easy to use all you do is cut them out place them on your eye RUB with a little bit of water and you have them on perfectly practice does make perfect</li>
      <li>Good thing too because I wore a pair yesterday and my friend couldn&#x27;t believe how cool my eyeliner design was....</li>
      <li>and I keep my friends guessing which makes life interesting for me any way.</li>
      <li>I love the variety and the amount for the cost.</li>
      <li>I love these eyeliner tattoos.</li>
      <li>Yeah, these ones have most of the colored ones shown.</li>
      <li>Very fun!</li>
      <li>When you&#x27;re happy with the positioning, take  the clear plastic cover off.</li>
      <li>I like the powder eyeliner or the Golden Rose liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>but they are easy to put on and a breeze to take off.</li>
      <li>After all, you didn&#x27;t apply regular eye liner perfectly the first time you applied</li>
      <li>Most are black, but the colored ones look great, too.</li>
      <li>I originally bought these to practice with</li>
      <li>It sounds like from some of the other reviews that people give up after the first time when they don&#x27;t apply perfectly.</li>
      <li>Funky, fun, easy to put on</li>
      <li>so u don&#x27;t waste the best ones on your first attempt</li>
      <li>I ordered these in bulk I love them so much I use them all the time.</li>
      <li>They did come off pretty easily with makeup remover.</li>
      <li>These are easy to use and exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>I tried several different ways to remove the tattoos, and this one seems to work the best for me.</li>
      <li>I think it is a great idea but not really functional but definitely fun to goof off with</li>
      <li>Looks nice barely went on though</li>
      <li>i will order more in the future great colors and designs thankyou for this awsome tattoos will order in the future</li>
      <li>All the designs are super fun.</li>
      <li>These were fun for faire.</li>
      <li>more then just the product and the first two stars are meant for product, which I dont have an issue with though their ad is clearly misleading.</li>
      <li>I have yet to be able to properly put one of these on.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to have to apply some eyeliner in places along the lash line where it didn&#x27;t meet exactly.  </li>
      <li>so I could use the more intricate larger eye tattoos without messing those up.</li>
      <li>Use ones you don&#x27;t like first as practice</li>
      <li>Easy to apply after an initial experimentation to get used to positioning it.</li>
      <li>A little hard to master, but once you get it, they are so cute, and you can create many adventurous looks with them</li>
      <li>they are kind of hard for me to get even, but there is a bunch to chose from and are alot of fun to play with</li>
      <li>Splash water on the eyelid and smooth out the design, if necessary.</li>
      <li>but they are kind of hard to put on right.</li>
      <li>It is very important that the paper towel be very, very wet</li>
      <li>First cut out the designs, being most careful and as close as possible for the part along the lash line.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t take long to put on; there&#x27;s lots of variety; and they really do last for days - some designs better than others.  </li>
      <li>remove, use a wipe (make-up or diaper) to gently remove as much of the design as possible.</li>
      <li>I messed up the first time, but even so it gave me valuable input on what to do differently.</li>
      <li>These are hard to get positioned so they will look okay.  </li>
      <li>ok, harder to apply than I expected</li>
      <li>I put a very sheer eye shadow over the tattoo, one that can&#x27;t really be seen, to help set it.</li>
      <li>Gently remove the paper towel, and peel the paper back of the tattoo slowly, making sure the design has been transferred to your eyelid.</li>
      <li>With the large amount of tattoos in the package, be prepared to sacrifice a few the first couple of times you are applying them.</li>
      <li>however they are not, theyh are the wet down temp tattoo and on top of that it took forever</li>
      <li>really hate seeing people saying these don&#x27;t work when with the right techniques, patience, and a little practice they work great.</li>
      <li>Just applying make-up remover and letting it sit a little bit didn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> Your eyelids will feel a little tight at first.</li>
<li> Only received 3 packs of black eyeliner tats...very loud and colorful for dramatic look.</li>
<li> Stand in the mirror with the design facing out (remember that when it is applied and flipped over it will go on the opposite eye) to see where you want to position it with your eye closed.</li>
<li> Cute in theory, extremely difficult to put on and slightly itchy</li>
<li> The only downside is having to cut the shape out before applying, but simple small personal care scissors work well.</li>
<li> Place the side with the design against your eye, with the eye closed and cover with a sopping wet paper towel against the tattoo, blank side out, for 60 seconds.</li>
<li> the effort to put them on was not worth it for me personally, however, if you are a makeup person these are for you!!!</li>
<li> I wound up ordering several packages to use as everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Im not much of a make up person so</li>
<li> only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because they are very hard to cut small enough with the dramatic designs to make them easy to put on.</li>
<li> Apply some make-up remover, baby oil, or cold cream over each eye, and go back to the first eye and remove with the wipe.</li>
<li> I had ordered from a diff company and they were all black designs.</li>
<li> I rub a little petroleum jelly on the design to get it to come off without a hassle.</li>
<li> (If not, more time with paper towel, but I haven&#x27;t ever had it not transfer - with the very wet towel for 60 seconds.)</li>
<li> A pair will last an entire night of crazy club-hopping.</li>
<li> I thought that they would be hard to put on</li>
<li> I had a hard time getting them to stay on</li>
<li> so it can penetrate through the thick paper the tattoo is on.</li>
<li> There is no need to rub, which can be very hard on your delicate skin around your eyes.</li>
<li> You can also add glitter, crystals, and false eyelashes for</li>
<li> very difficult to apply and</li>
<li> shipping was bad</li>
<li> Very bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Looks like I ordered 2 of  these. Good thing too because I wore a pair yesterday and my friend couldn&#x27;t believe how cool my eyeliner design was....I finally told her the truth but she doesn&#x27;t know some are for her.</li>
    <li> This has to be the funnest eye liner to wear. I thought that they would be hard to put on but they are easy to put on and a breeze to take off. Not like the ones I bought I had a hard time getting them to stay on and when they did Talk about a pain to get off again. It&#x27;s amazing how great my eyes look after I put these on and I keep my friends guessing which makes life interesting for me any way.</li>
    <li> Needs instructions in English included</li>
    <li> Very fun! Easy to apply after an initial experimentation to get used to positioning it. The only downside is having to cut the shape out before applying, but simple small personal care scissors work well. The design holds up well too.</li>
    <li> they are kind of hard for me to get even, but there is a bunch to chose from and are alot of fun to play with</li>
    <li> Looks nice barely went on though</li>
    <li> I loved this I wear one set every weekend</li>
    <li> i will order more in the future great colors and designs thankyou for this awsome tattoos will order in the future</li>
    <li> They look amazing but they are kind of hard to put on right. Use ones you don&#x27;t like first as practice so u don&#x27;t waste the best ones on your first attempt</li>
    <li> Very bad. No on can wear these.</li>
    <li> very difficult to apply and shipping was bad</li>
    <li> I had used &#x27;tattoo&#x27; eyeliner once before and loved it, so I gave this a try. I love it too! A pair will last an entire night of crazy club-hopping. I rub a little petroleum jelly on the design to get it to come off without a hassle. All the designs are super fun.</li>
    <li> Cute in theory, extremely difficult to put on and slightly itchy</li>
    <li> These are hard to get positioned so they will look okay.  They did come off pretty easily with makeup remover.</li>
    <li> Yeah, these ones have most of the colored ones shown. I would definitely recommend these ones. I had ordered from a diff company and they were all black designs. So, buy these ones if you want the colors!</li>
    <li> You must be a master to get these on. If not it will take minimum of 30mins to apply. Totally recommend if your into neat eyeliner like tats. You must cut out perfectly, (tip) bend so it has a curvature like your eyelid, (DONT FORGET) to take plastic off (which I did after I had applied one eye), Keep eye slightly open or design might tear. Im not much of a make up person so the effort to put them on was not worth it for me personally, however, if you are a makeup person these are for you!!!</li>
    <li> They suck, dont was te Your money on this...</li>
    <li> They give you a nice variety very easy to use all you do is cut them out place them on your eye RUB with a little bit of water and you have them on perfectly practice does make perfect so you have plenty to use and choose from with 40 for only 3 bucks. I ordered these in bulk I love them so much I use them all the time.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get these to stick on</li>
    <li> ok, harder to apply than I expected</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and exactly as pictured. Lots of variety to choose from and you cant beat the price!</li>
    <li> Funky, fun, easy to put on</li>
    <li> only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because they are very hard to cut small enough with the dramatic designs to make them easy to put on.</li>
    <li> Great assortment of eye tattoos.  Im giving this product  two stars because I rate based on more then just the product and the first two stars are meant for product, which I dont have an issue with though their ad is clearly misleading. Their ad states stickers however they are not, theyh are the wet down temp tattoo and on top of that it took forever it seemed to get to me, I ordered a couple items from China two weeks after this purchase and still recieved it before these eye tattoo got here. They alsio short chabged me, it states 40 when I only got 36 temp eye tattoos. I wont be ordering froim them again.</li>
    <li> I love these eyeliner tattoos. They don&#x27;t take long to put on; there&#x27;s lots of variety; and they really do last for days - some designs better than others.  These designs are intricate enough that you don&#x27;t need to wear eye shadow with them. Most are black, but the colored ones look great, too. I originally bought these to practice with so I could use the more intricate larger eye tattoos without messing those up. I wound up ordering several packages to use as everyday makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used regular temporary tattoos, these are easier. First cut out the designs, being most careful and as close as possible for the part along the lash line. Stand in the mirror with the design facing out (remember that when it is applied and flipped over it will go on the opposite eye) to see where you want to position it with your eye closed. You can also arch your eyebrows when applying to avoid the creases on your eyelid from causing breaks in the tattoo. When you&#x27;re happy with the positioning, take  the clear plastic cover off. Place the side with the design against your eye, with the eye closed and cover with a sopping wet paper towel against the tattoo, blank side out, for 60 seconds. It is very important that the paper towel be very, very wet so it can penetrate through the thick paper the tattoo is on. There is no need to rub, which can be very hard on your delicate skin around your eyes. Gently remove the paper towel, and peel the paper back of the tattoo slowly, making sure the design has been transferred to your eyelid. (If not, more time with paper towel, but I haven&#x27;t ever had it not transfer - with the very wet towel for 60 seconds.) Splash water on the eyelid and smooth out the design, if necessary. Move on to the next eye. Your eyelids will feel a little tight at first. I put a very sheer eye shadow over the tattoo, one that can&#x27;t really be seen, to help set it. Be prepared to have to apply some eyeliner in places along the lash line where it didn&#x27;t meet exactly.  I like the powder eyeliner or the Golden Rose liquid eyeliner. You can also add glitter, crystals, and false eyelashes for fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest I have had the tattoos last is 3 days.  With the large amount of tattoos in the package, be prepared to sacrifice a few the first couple of times you are applying them. After all, you didn&#x27;t apply regular eye liner perfectly the first time you applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove, use a wipe (make-up or diaper) to gently remove as much of the design as possible. Apply some make-up remover, baby oil, or cold cream over each eye, and go back to the first eye and remove with the wipe. I put the make-up remover on the wipe. I tried several different ways to remove the tattoos, and this one seems to work the best for me. Just applying make-up remover and letting it sit a little bit didn&#x27;t really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hate seeing people saying these don&#x27;t work when with the right techniques, patience, and a little practice they work great. It sounds like from some of the other reviews that people give up after the first time when they don&#x27;t apply perfectly. I messed up the first time, but even so it gave me valuable input on what to do differently.</li>
    <li> These were fun for faire.</li>
    <li> I have yet to be able to properly put one of these on. I love the variety and the amount for the cost. I think it is a great idea but not really functional but definitely fun to goof off with</li>
    <li> These are sooo cool!!! Love the designs!! A little hard to master, but once you get it, they are so cute, and you can create many adventurous looks with them</li>
    <li> Only received 3 packs of black eyeliner tats...very loud and colorful for dramatic look. Do not recommend .Text the company with no regards.</li>
