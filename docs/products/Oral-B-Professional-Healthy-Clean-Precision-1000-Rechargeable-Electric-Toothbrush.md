<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The tooth brush works pretty good but the battery doesn&#x27;t fully charge after a few months of use.  I bought 2 at the time and both seem to have lost some speed even after leaving on he charger all day. That said, they still run fast enough and do the trick.</li>
    <li> this is my second OralB tooth brush. one is kept in my office. this one is left at home. It does a good job!</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electric tooth brushes for many years and found them to be a top quality product. This brush is no exception. Excellent price and very prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> Met my expectations. Does a good job of cleaning your teeth. Charge holds well. Head is small enough to fit in my small mouth and reach my back molars.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is perfect!!  It cleans my teeth and gums well.  My husband had a stroke and his hand is weak and using this toothbrush has been so helpful for him.  I&#x27;m so glad to have gotten it.</li>
    <li> Item works as advertised, however item was shipped in white box without barcode. So much for the $15 Rebate. Item turned out to be $15 more expensive than expected.</li>
    <li> this has helped me increase my oral hygiene considerably. the brush has a two minute timer with brief 30 second interruptions that let you know when you&#x27;ve spent enough time in one quadrant of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like how many different brush options are available as well, not limiting your mind to have to &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;battery life is good, wish it would last longer than a week so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bring my charger with me all the time on the road.</li>
    <li> Having used the Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush, I was concerned whether this toothbrush would compare in a positive way. I am pleased to say that I feel it is just as good if not better. It was less expensive but so far it does an outstanding job at making my teeth feel clean and the replacement heads are less expensive too.</li>
    <li> it, of course, does a better job brushing than you can do with a standard brush. But be prepared to drool while using it. The charge appears to last a week (brushing twice per day) and a full recharge takes around 24 hours. It is supposed to act differently if you press the on/off button more than once but I have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> Works for me.  Compact.  I still use a regular toothbrush because I feel there are still spots that are missing between the teeth.</li>
    <li> Love the Oral B and use it every day.  Recommended to me by my dentist.  Get&#x27;s my teeth clean and doesn&#x27;t harm my gums.  I use soft bristles.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric toothbrush, but I am quite impressed. The 30 second timers help to keep me on track, the toothbrush head fits perfectly around my teeth, and the speed seems right. The downsides: I have to reload toothpaste 1/2 way through, as not much fits on the head, and this model doesn&#x27;t seem to have more than one speed (the manual says some models do). But, like I said, the one speed seems to be just fine. My teeth are visibly whiter, and this toothbrush gets them much cleaner than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Good product for the price. High quality, I expect it to last for a long time. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> At the time of purchase, this excellent electric toothbrush was sold with an offer of a $15 rebate from Procter and Gamble. Despite submitting all the required materials both completely and in time,  P and G rejected the submission based on an \\&quot;incorrect\\&quot; UPC. My toothbrush was shipped with the \\&quot;Frustration-Free\\&quot; packaging, and the labels from that package were used as directed for the rebate. Amazon came to the rescue by covering the rejected rebate with an equal unrestricted discount.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush and charger have a tiny footprint, so they take up little precious counter space. It is easy to keep clean. Its operation is straightforward and without gimmicks. The two minute timer gives thirty second notices to help spread the cleaning over four quadrants. Now, if they put an mp3 player in it to pass the time . . .</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that the brush can go for two weeks without needing to be charged so I tested it and took it to France for a 1 week trip and left the charger back in the US....it was out by day 5 and I wasn&#x27;t brushing twice a day everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush. I would recommend it to anyone who uses electric. I&#x27;ll never go back to regular. The battery is strong and seems to be able to last. I like the brush heads it uses. Gets my teeth squeaky clean. My dentist is happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist noticed when I switched to an electric toothbrush. That being the case this was a gift for my adult daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric toothbrushes before, but not as excellent as this one.  It&#x27;s not too strong but strong enough to give the best clean I&#x27;ve ever had.  It gets the tartar at the gum line like nobody&#x27;s business.  I wholeheartedly recommend this tooth brush.</li>
    <li> The batteries indicator was useful. And the timer help me to clear one area at a time. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been using this for two months now. We are very impressed with the thoroughness and speed of brushing. We have yet to have a check-up at the dentist for a final verdict. But based on our experience, and after a lot of research, we have no reason to believe our teeth and gums aren&#x27;t healthier than using a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We share the motor body, but each have our own bush heads. We can get several days of brushing between charges. The 30 second timer for each quadrant goes by quickly since it&#x27;s almost fun to brush now (I know, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;d ever say brushing is fun!). An added benefit is we seem to be using less toothpaste...which is nice since we buy expensive, natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> The device seems quite effect when fully charged. The brush is right sized and feels very adequate.  The only question is when is the device fully charged? However, when charged it may be used for two weeks in accordance with directions.</li>
    <li> I do not think I will be going back to using a standard toothbrush, ever! My teeth feel so clean using this toothbrush versus a standard manual one. The timer works well and the instructions are very clear. I chose this model because it had a solid rating on Consumer Reports and did not cost a fortune like some of the sonic toothbrushes or the models with more bells and whistles. I just needed a plain old toothbrush and this suits me fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older unit that would no longer hold a charge. I love the timer feature. My only complaint is that sometimes the low battery indicator comes on rather late. I will call their support line the next time it happens.</li>
    <li> This was an improvement over a stsndard tooth brush. Though it can be a bit harsh, it seemed to improve my gum health and remove stains from my teeth. Its lower price made it a good value.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thing. I am a lazy brusher and this is very easy to use and strong enough. My mouth is now cleaner because of this product.</li>
    <li> After my last Braun toothbrush dies (after a number of years) I reluctantly decided to give this one a try.  Great item.  So far so good.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have never been good at brushing my teeth and always get reprimanded by the woman who cleans my teeth. This time after using the Oral-B, she said, you&#x27;ve finally learned how to brush your teeth. She even thought I had been flossing (ha ha) I use the head that has the little floss things on them spend about 15-20 seconds on each area (about 2 minutes total) and my teeth feel really clean. The tartar buildup has been much less than before. I love this little gem and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I was hoping to get some great tooth-brushing at a great price, and this really does the trick -- way better than the electric toothbrushes I had when I was younger.  It spins fast, vibrates a bit, and does not get dirty easily like from what I read in cheap model sonic care reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this toothbrush a couple of weeks and the metal (under the brush head) is rusting already. Previously, I had the Oral B Vitality; perhaps I should have stuck with that model. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works well, holds a good charge.  Very pleased with this product and I recommend it to others looking for this type of toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Oral-B Precision 1000 and just absolutely love it.  I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance...it does one hell of a good job and the brushes last a good 2 months of use (2 or 3 times per day).  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had the basic Oral-B model for several years and was very found of. The battery began to ran a little low and I&#x27;ve decided to buy Oral-B 1000 model. this model seems better than the basic model. it runs faster and provides a &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; felling. it also notes every 30sec to proceed to another section. it seems negligible, but it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> Great price for an electric toothbrush. Our daughter uses this one and she loves it, quick and easy in the mornings and evenings to use. Just make sure toothpaste doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;clumped&amp;#34; up between the removable top brush and base - it can get pretty nasty if not cleaned regularly.</li>
    <li> Big meh.  I had upgraded from using the $7 disposable vibrating brushes to this device and found it wasn&#x27;t all that much better.  Sure it vibrates AND spins but I didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;holy moly that&#x27;s a powerful clean&amp;#34; that I had heard about from electric toothbrush promoters.  So I returned it and bought the Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite instead.  Yes it was twice as much money but the end result was worth it.  The Sonicare provided the powerful pulses I had heard about where the Orabl-B Precision 1000 simply fell short.  In my opinion, if you&#x27;re going to spend more than $10 on a tooth brush, you might as well get something that gets you that after-the-dentist feel and the Oral-B Precision 1000 just didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Compared to more expensive Oral-B models but eventually agreed with one commenter who said: &amp;#34;Do you really need 8 different brush options?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very true. Am very satisfied with the one and only brush option...</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush and a very good price. It was exactly what we were expecting. I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that this is a &#x27;bad&#x27; toothbrush, but it&#x27;s not a game changer either.  If you&#x27;re looking to an alternative to the Sonicare toothbrush, or similar technology, this isn&#x27;t it.  This operates totally differently.  I find that the brush heads are a bit too small (if you go with the small round ones)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d give this toothbrush a 6 out of 10.</li>
    <li> Oral B are the best made of the electric tooth brushes.  There is a no muss no fuss aspect to them.  Use it, rinse the head. Replace on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the Oral B brushes. It cleans away the days build up and seem to knock off the harder corruption. My teeth are clear and feel great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year now.  The batter is still strong and easy to recharge.  You can get aftermarket brush heads to save some money and make this an inexpensive electric brush to maintain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d switched to a regular toothbrush from my lower-end electric, and within a year I had cavities despite not changing my brushing habits. My hygienist recommended that I switch back, so I did some research and purchased this model. I&#x27;ve been using this brush for several weeks now and am very happy - buildup is occurring more slowly (or so it feels to me) and I&#x27;m very glad I chose a model that has a 30 second timer. After using this model, I&#x27;ve realized that I wasn&#x27;t brushing properly, since I wasn&#x27;t actually timing myself. The timer on this unit ensures that I get each quadrant for the full 30 seconds, and that in and of itself is worth a bit of money up front since it could save me hundreds on dental work!</li>
    <li> I almost bought a different brush because I didn&#x27;t like the size of the stand.  The price was right for this, so I got it anyway and I was pleasantly surprised to have the option to use only the small charger part of the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this type of brush in general, I have mixed feelings.  People told me, &amp;#34;your mouth will feel so clean that you&#x27;ll never use a regular brush again.&amp;#34;  Feels about the same to me.  That said, I enjoy it so far.</li>
    <li> I bought the most basic model of Oral-B&#x27;s electric tooth brush 5 years ago and now it is not holding charge. I started looking for a replacement and decided to try this model: one level up compared to the basic model with more features and still using the same charger.&lt;br /&gt;I received it a few days ago and charged it for a day. The moment I put it in my mouse, I was surprised by its power. I really like it. I hope it will last long. Let&#x27;s wait and see. I highly recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush. Now that I have one, I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long! I have zero complaints with this toothbrush. The charging stand is nice and small so it fits on the counter. It holds its charge a long time. Heads pop on and off easily so you can&#x27;t swap them out with no hassle. It really makes my teeth feel more clean than a regular toothbrush. I had a little bleeding the first time I used it but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and it was just from the back teeth which aren&#x27;t used to getting such a good brushing. This toothbrush really makes it easy to get the back teeth! No more lectures from the dentist!</li>
    <li> This has been my first rechargeable brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now, &amp; it continues to do well.</li>
    <li> This is my first real electric toothbrush and it works great. (We had cheap $10 battery electric brushes but they were useless and we went back to regular ones a few years ago). I noticed using the 30 sec timer really helps to ensure that I brush all areas in my mouth and I also brush much longer than I did with a regular brush. It definitely works because I would get a lot of tar build up on my lower front teeth (behind) and since my teeth cleaning and buying this brush, it&#x27;s still clean. We ended up buying two sets!</li>
    <li> As far as the toothbrush goes, it is a really good value for the money.  It works great and (to me) does as good as a job as some of the more expensive models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars, but the packaging was not retail and normally that would not be a big deal but the packing left a residue on the body of the toothbrush that as very hard to get off.  I actually was not able to get 100% off it off but it does not effect how the brush itself works.</li>
    <li> I came to this toothbrush after being fairly dissatisfied with regular \\&quot;basic\\&quot; toothbrushes and decided to give this a try from the Vine Program on a whim. After 3 weeks of using it, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. The first few times I used it my teeth felt immaculate and clean for the first time in a few years (keep in mind I haven&#x27;t had an electric toothbrush in all that time either). This brush is definitely nice and gentle on the teeth and perfect for those that have fairly sensitive gums like me. Features such as the built-in start and stop vibration timer are nice for those that don&#x27;t want to spend the whole night brushing their teeth before moving on to the next set. As others have said, the initial charge can take the better part of a day sometimes so I wouldn&#x27;t try and use this brush on the first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real qualm with the product is that the brush head is fairly worn down after the past 3 weeks, but the heads aren&#x27;t that expensive at $5-$15 a piece depending on if you get generic or name brand replacements. I might be a little biased in that compared to a regular toothbrush, this thing seems great but the difference really was astounding after a few weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Travis S</li>
    <li> My hygenist had recommended I purchase an electric toothbrush to deal with plaque build up. Lo and behold, the Oral B Electric Toothbrush came up on the Vine program the day after. Kismet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used anything other than a plain old toothbrush. I thought I was going high tech when I got one with an angled head. The Oral B Electric took a bit of getting used to, but I have to say my teeth feel really clean. The set up and use were simple enough for me to use immediately after it was charged. I like the fact that the replacement heads are economical, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I am a convert. I get positive reinforcement for using the toothbrush because my whole mouth feels fresh and clean after using this product. The Oral B Electric Toothbrush is a win for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried the Oral-B electric toothbrush before, and I came away still loving my Sonicare.  I tried it again, wondering if perhaps I was too harsh in my review of the Oral-B, but I still love my Sonicare.  There are some aspects of the Oral-B that I do like, however there are a few points that say \\&quot;no way\\&quot; to me.  For instance, the thickness of the brush head is a big deal killer for me.  I measured the brush head of both my Sonicare and the Oral-B.  The Sonicare brush (I like the compact size) measurement from the middle of the brush head is 10mm (1 cm), and the Oral-B is 18mm.  That is almost twice as thick as the Sonicare.  When I am brushing and going around from the side to the front, the brush pops out of my mouth and lips because I have a smaller mouth.  If you have a big mouth with lots of teeth, maybe this is not an issue for you.  Thanks to my orthodontist in the 70s I had four plus my four wisdom teeth removed, so I feel like I have hardly any teeth, the arch of my teeth is a lot smaller than someone with a full set of teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the Oral-B brushes behind my front teeth.  This is why I prefer the compact size Sonicare brush.  I don&#x27;t like the way the Oral-B buzzes in between quadrants, and I really don&#x27;t like the way it makes a weird buzzing, stop-start thing when your two minutes are up, and then continues to go.  The Sonicare just stops after two minutes.  If you want to continue, just press the button again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final assessment of the Oral-B is personal preference.  I still prefer my Sonicare.</li>
    <li> ...for those used to smaller heads. I struggle with it, but my wife uses only this smaller round head. I prefer the larger head toothbrushes. This particular brush charges fast and the vibration/movement is strong enough to help clean, but not so strong that it&#x27;s painful as I&#x27;ve experienced with some powered brushes.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush.  It is a step up from the basic model but still uses the same brush head which is really nice since I had extras and did not have to throw them away and upgrade to new brush heads.  This model has noticeable more power and higher RPMs and really makes my teeth feel really clean.  This brush vibrates every 30 seconds unlike my old brush that only vibrated at the 2 minute mark to tell you you are done.  Then new brush does not give you a unique 2 minute vibrate warning, you have to keep count of the 30 second indicators to know when 2 minutes are up (i.e. 4- 30 sec indicators) Can not go wrong with brush.  It is worth the extra money from the basic model.</li>
    <li> I would like to say that on the bright side, I did in fact receive my product quickly (2 weeks). Perhaps too quick? Opened the box it came in, pulled out my brand new purchase and quickly realized I&#x27;d received a dirty toothbrush. It looked like a vehicles windshield would after hours of driving on the highway along the forest. Insects, dirt, and scum was found wrapped all around the product.</li>
    <li> I am very happy!  I was using a battery powered tooth brush and decided to try electric. The pulsing power makes brushing even easier to achieve clean teeth without damaging my gumm or tooth enamel.</li>
    <li> I wanted a good electric toothbrush at a decent price, and this one fit the bill. For only $50, this thing is a great value for those people concerned about oral hygiene. After going electric, you&#x27;ll realize how inefficient manual brushing is, and you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> After much research I chose this unit because of the power of the unit and the price. I felt that i did not need the extra &amp;#34;features&amp;#34; of the 3000 oral-b and other ones. This toothbrush does its job with minimal frills, although it does have a vibrating indication of when to move to the next section of your mouth. I believe 30 sec for each quadrant, then a larger vib signal after the 2min is up. Makes sure you don&#x27;t go too long and most importantly, makes sure you don&#x27;t just hold it there a few seconds and feel like you are done.</li>
    <li> Two or three times a day.  Love the timing hesitation feature. Bought one for my grandson, 12 years old.  He loves it and we don&#x27;t have to remind him to brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush!  Motor is both powerful and quiet and does a very thorough cleaning!  Easy to handle and remains charged well over a week using it three times a day.  Excellent value!  The best electric toothbrush I have ever used!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush - my dentist was impressed on my last visit, said everything looked perfect, and asked what toothbrush I was using.  He wasn&#x27;t surprised to hear it was the Oral-B.  I especially love the little storage area for toothbrush heads.  Super handy!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable for a first time user.  I remove the brush and rinse after every use and it still looks clean 1.5 years later.  The charger is very small and easy to take on trips.  I travel enough to where I just have toiletry bag already packed with everything I need and I usually use a normal toothbrush, but I am glad when I come home to this one.  It vibrates differently every 30 seconds to remind you when to change positions, so I feel like I&#x27;m getting a much more even brushing.</li>
    <li> I was going to originally buy this for the price of like 100 dollars for one. Glad I waited and bought it online! It&#x27;s great! I got one for my dad as well.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is amazing and very gentle on your gums and teeth. It really scrubs away the yuck on your teeth and is gentle at the same time. Good product if you ask me.</li>
    <li> I have switched from a traditional brush to this one a few months ago and I love it. I will say that if you are buying this, do not buy cheap replacements. They feel cheap and nothing like the good brushes.</li>
    <li> Very EASY SETUP…WORKS GREAT. DOESNT TAKE UP TOO MUCH SPACE.&lt;br /&gt;VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND PRICE OF THIS.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely Recommended!</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this toothbrush.  It seems to always work well and I feel like I&#x27;m gettting a very deep clean with my teeth.  I felt the price was good and product was excellent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas.  She&#x27;s always wanted an electric toothbrush and this particular model is a step above the most basic.  It operates on a 2 minute cycle with 30 second intervals with a pulsating vibration that signals the user to switch to the next quadrant of their mouth (upper-left, -right, lower-left, -right). Though the feature might be minor and the only real difference between this and the most basic model, my wife loves it to keep track of recommended cleaning time and thoroughly brushing her teeth section by section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole unit comes in a 4-piece package. The electric motor handle, charging base, brush head storage tray, and one rotating toothbrush head. The charging base snaps nicely into the storage tray and can be easily separated if you need to clean the storage tray.  The charging base and handle are both waterproof and do not have any fine crevices to them so it makes it easy to wipe off any gunk. The storage tray can hold an additional four toothbrush heads -  which there are a handful of different types depending on the type of cleaning you are attempting for your mouth. The tray features a basic semi-clear, hinged cover but it is not waterproof (especially since there is a large opening on the lower-front portion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no indicating light that signals a full charge. The handle does an indicating light on the front that will blink intermittently when charging.  However, upon full charge the light does not light up at all. Seems a little backward in design but when the toothbrush sits on the charger all day, there&#x27;s a good chance you have charge enough for your 2-minute brushing. So other than this minor design choice, its the perfect beginner electric toothbrush for my wife&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy wife, happy life.</li>
    <li> I take too long and feel inefficient with a normal toothbrush. This one has an unmistakeable pause every 30 seconds letting you know to shift quadrants. After I finish, I do another thirty second pass of problem areas and the gumline through the whole mouth, making the entire brush take 2:30 minutes. It feels very clean and effective. It&#x27;s also quite gentle compared to other products, but without feeling less effective for it. On top of that, the small tip insures you get more mileage out of your toothpaste, because you only need a dab anyway; if you have 15 dollar prescription toothpaste like me, this is a lifesaver. I got it on sale, and it definitely feels worth more than I paid.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised. Easy to handle, compatible with multiple brush heads. There is a green blinking light when the brush is charging and it stops blinking when fully charged. That is the only characteristic I found a bit confusing.</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes brushing fun and easy.  I have a problems with brushing too hard, but with this, I just set the brush on top of each tooth and let it do its job.  My teeth feel clean and slippery afterwards.  Just using the basic brush head alone, my teeth are whiter.  No kidding--I&#x27;m a serious tea and coffee drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head itself does a clockwise/counterclockwise rotation.  Turning the head with my hand I get 20 degrees on each side (totaling in 40 degree sweep max).  Its impossible to see how much of that range is utilize with the naked, with the handle turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unit comes with charging station, snap in brush head holder, one brush head and the handle.  The handle has no exposed contacts so I can assume it is an induction type charger.  Basically you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it wet when placing the handle on the charger or getting the handle wet when you&#x27;re cleaning it.  If you choose to not use the snap in holder, it takes up minimal space and it mostly stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few cons I found with this toothbrush:&lt;br /&gt;- vibrates to the point of tickling my nose&lt;br /&gt;- I have to turn the handle off if I take the brush out away from my mouth otherwise, it&#x27;s toothpaste-saliva everywhere (most noticeably the mirror)&lt;br /&gt;- price of replacement heads are steep.  If you&#x27;re OCD about germs and getting the best brush and are buying for the whole family, then the costs can add up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the cons will lower my rating or recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;Vibrations no longer tickle my nose.  I must have become accustomed to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A feature I forgot to mention above is that there&#x27;s a 30-second pulse indicator, letting you know 30 seconds has passed.  It does this 3 times which the fourth is the grand finale of pulses and lets you know you&#x27;ve brushed for 2 minutes.  According to the directions, they spilt your teeth into 4 quadrants and the 30 second pulse is to switch quadrants.  I don&#x27;t always follow it, but I like the feature.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist has been pushing me to purchase an electric toothbrush for over a year now.  I finally purchased this Oral-B based on the reviews and good price.  I love it!  Very simple...but I feel like I just had my teeth cleaned by the dentist after every use.  I assume it&#x27;s doing a great job cleaning my teeth and gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the frustration-free packaging - no frustration whatsoever.  Plus, no extra plastic and packaging to get rid of.</li>
    <li> Not sure why there are so many different electric toothbrushes or at least, why they have to create small differences to market them under different names - this toothbrush functions smoothly, keeps a charge long enough to take on a trip without bringing the charger, and a lot of different brush heads fit it. And its down in the reasonably-priced end of the marketing spectrum. My teeth feel clean and the dentist agrees.</li>
    <li> The only thing i dont like is how much the replacement heads cost but other then that there is really nothing wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Cleans well but a lot noisier than my other Oral-B Electric tooth brushes. I even tried to switch differently heads and it didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
    <li> I was able to get a deal on this toothbrush and I absolutely love it.  It is easy to use with one button, charges quickly and doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.  I suggest this toothbrush for anyone who is wanting to get an electronic toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is a fine product.  My family has used this brand for over twenty years and still find it to the job.  Easy to use and this was a good price.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> Only one speed, but it does the job and the price is right.  What more can I say?  Happy New Year.</li>
    <li> Now that I have started using my electric brush I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to normal brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend a compatable cheaper brush head for replacements. The ones in the stores are a bit rich for my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;All else is amazing and just as described. (Thanks for a great product)</li>
    <li> I used to have really bad breath in the morning although I brushed my teeth with a regular toothbrush the night before - so my dentist recommended I get an oscillating. I hate the way it feels in my mouth, I guess because I&#x27;m not used to it but now when I brush my teeth at night it doesn&#x27;t smell in morning. More than I could ask for.</li>
    <li> After just a few days, my teeth are already feeling so much cleaner, for longer.  I bought the floss brush heads, and I can definitely tell I am brushing areas I wasn&#x27;t getting to with my traditional toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try an electronic toothbrush at a dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  I like that the pulse timer keeps me focuses on brushing for the right length of time in each mouth quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that I didn&#x27;t have to make the same investment as a Sonicare brush would have cost me.  This thing does the trick!</li>
    <li> Altho this product is touted to be one of the best, I find its cleaning ability is far behind a hand held toothbrush I got from a health food co-op. My favorite toothbrush has a large oval brushing head, fine, soft bristles which get between the teeth, brush the tongue &amp; gums without causing the gums to bleed.</li>
    <li> Expensive but so worth it. I ended up getting a tongue scraper too because this is exclusively for teeth and gums (and maybe the exfoliating of lips).</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush!  The price was right, and it is more effective at cleaning my teeth than my older model Oral-B.</li>
    <li> a no frills Oral-B brush. I&#x27;ve always had Oral-B brushes, this one is the lower-end of features (and price) and is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using  an Oral-B Professional Rechargeable for years and I can honestly say that by using this tooth brush my cleanings at the dentist have been quick and easy!</li>
    <li> For some reason, this model pauses like 1 minute into the brushing.  I returned the first one I received but the replacement did the same.  Some kind of defect, but after the slight pause, it brushes as before.  I guess it&#x27;s a quark I can live with for the price.</li>
    <li> I have used this for the last few months and my teeth have never felt better. It&#x27;s amazing and worth every penny</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an electric toothbrush, no more and no less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes a fairly loud noise that could irritate anyone who is trying to sleep, and doesn&#x27;t actually feel as aggressive as I would like in an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush made me decide to go back to non-automatic toothbrushes. It was so disappointing I lost hope in Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey, do what you want.</li>
    <li> Was as expected!!!! I gave on to my wife for Christmas as her sonic care is on its last leg. I have an Oral B and love it!</li>
    <li> This is the third one of these I have bought.  I have an old one that is still going strong but I wanted to buy the rest of my family one.  The first one, I bought for my son.  Then, I bought one for my daughter and I just bought one for my husband for Christmas.  It works great and so much better than a manual toothbrush.  I don&#x27;t like the brush that come with it because I think it is too small.  Oral b makes a bigger replacement brush that is perfect so that is what we use.  Great price @ $26, cheaper than I could find anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Have had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for 10+ years and finally had to replace the original one - the Precision 1000 is a marked improvement on the original toothbrush!!</li>
    <li> Pretty awesome toothbrush. Battery lasts a bit more than a week for me. It tells you when to move from mouth quadrant to mouth quadrant. It feel comfortable in the hand and in the mouth. And best of all, my dentist (really my dental hygienist but you get the point) said I had less tartar and my teeth look great!</li>
    <li> My dentist swears by nothing else but for the family to use Oral -B electric toothbrushes. In fact, my children love the fact that the brush operates for 2 minutes and tells them when they should stop. it has helped me reinforce good habits!</li>
    <li> Good price for a toothbrush that leaves your teeth feeling like you just had a professional cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Good value for a professional brush.</li>
    <li> I like the brand and it is why I have bought toothbrush from them. I  like the fact that it only needs to be plug in every 2 weeks. good quality, I did not notice any differencein the brushing with a toothbrush from the same brand (around $10) in a supemarket.&lt;br /&gt;the design is nice and well done.</li>
    <li> i bought this brand brush about 10 years ago and it was great! the charge lasted forever. i bought this new one about 3 months ago and i have to recharge it more than once a week.</li>
    <li> Works great. Learned my lesson with 3rd party brush heads. I&#x27;ve tried several generic brands -- don&#x27;t use them; they last 1/3rd of the time and don&#x27;t cost 1/3rd of the price of genuine Oral-B heads. So factor the price of those into your decision to buy this.</li>
    <li> I did lots of research, I can&#x27;t find a reason to spend more money, this one does pretty much 90% of what the more and most expensive brushes do.  Much better than traditional brushing.</li>
    <li> This puppy cleans you up well! My teeth look better than ever and I feel much happier now!  Get it!</li>
    <li> This is a decent toothbrush for the Amazon price.  We previously owned the top of the line Oral-B.  That&#x27;s a nice brush, but its battery dies after about a year or so and cannot be replaced.  The separate timer is unnecessary.  None of the Oral B batteries can be (easily) replaced, but I will not spend $100+ on an item that has to be discarded in 1-2 years.  This is the right price point and its RPMs (or whatever they are) do a good job of cleaning.  The least expensive Oral B I find a little too lightweight and there&#x27;s no charging light.</li>
    <li> Great! I brush 2 times per day, and one a full charge (I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time), it lasts around 30-40 days until it starts to slow down from needing a charge. This is a great toothbrush, and leaves my mouth A LOT cleaner than a normal toothbrush. Come on guys, buy this. Should be a no-brainer. It&#x27;s inexpensive too!</li>
    <li> Omg. This is the best tooth brush I have owned.  I finally replaced my old one.  Wish I did this long ago.  My teeth feel cleaner after each use.  Power is strong and last a couple of weeks between charges.  I really like the small brush head.  I formerly used a bigger one but this is much better. I see no reason to buy the fancier and pricier brushes.  My husband has a pricier one and this works better in both of our opinions.</li>
    <li> works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;owned one same brand  that I had FOREVER&lt;br /&gt;it does take a LONG time for first charge but after that stays charged and works well</li>
    <li> Works well. Takes 2 days to recharge battery. While charging, a green light flashes: Very annoying especially at night. I like the small charging stand.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush. I wish replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive (for me). My dentist thinks it&#x27;s working really well, much better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush gets into the crevices of the teeth (especially if yours are not even and tend to overlap).  It is excellent for dealing with cleaning the gum line, as well.  I downrated it because there is sometimes a problem removing the head to clean it, and it can cut your hand if you wrestle it too hard.  Otherwise an excellent product.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is the 15 sec intervals. Unhappily my mind wanders, (brushing teeth is boring) and I lose track of where I should be. Otherwise have no complaints and an electric brush makes y teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but battery life is about 1/5th of previous models.  Charges slowly, drains quickly.  The opposite was true for earlier versions of this product.</li>
    <li> It was everything I expected. My boyfriend has one as well with out the storage on the side for heads it&#x27;s very convenient. It works well.</li>
    <li> Works great, goes a long time between charges! Great buy for the price! I would buy it again. I have had it for one month.</li>
    <li> this machine is good, as described&lt;br /&gt;good for your teeth and gums&lt;br /&gt;holds charge for 1 person for a week&lt;br /&gt;Love this type of brush and will keep using them.&lt;br /&gt;the best</li>
    <li> Awesome upgrade from the vitality series! This thing is blazing fast and gives a great clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a lot better built product than vitality series for sure.</li>
    <li> Hesitated on buying since it seemed cheaper than the $89 model suggested by my dentist (which they tried to sell me - no doubt a moneymaker for them). This brush leaves my teeth feeling clean like my manual toothbrushes (and cheap Kroger-variety electronic toothbrushes) never did. It pulsates every 30 seconds to let you know to switch to another part of your mouth - for a total of 2 mins brushing time (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left). The charging system is great and waterproof, and the brush seems to be more aggressive than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it to and my teeth feel and look brilliant! Also the battery lasts much longer than my previous toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my kids with braces hoping to keep those metal mouths clean and tidy. They work great and I love the timer feature on them.</li>
    <li> I have been using the tooth brush for about 2 months. It does perform well and has a high level of performance. The only thing it when I used to use my manual brush my teeth felt clean all day. With this I get to about the evening hours and my month starts really like it needs another brush. I have yet to replace the head and it still looks like it is in good condition.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The off and on switch could be better and easier to turn on and off.  The brush rotation works good on the gum line.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, fast, cleans great! Love the attachment for extra heads, yet detachable to take the brush for travel.  Does not need to stay plugged in to maintain the battery; good for energy savings.  Great value!</li>
    <li> While not as full featured as other brushes in the Healthy Clean/Pro Care line it does the job well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for anyone looking for an inexpensive rechargeable toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My old Oral-B battery died after several years  of use so I replaced with this model It is even better than my old Oral-B and I can&#x27;t imagine brushing my teeth the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; way.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Where have you been all my life? Excellent price from an oral hygiene leader! My dentist always compliments me on my home care.</li>
    <li> Would prefer it without the annoying new bells and whistles (charging light, elapsed time signals) but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I used to have an older model of Oral-B and the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.  This one is so much better.  The movement is better, it let&#x27;s you know when you need to recharge and my teeth feel even cleaner that with the previous one.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these. We have 2 sets of these and enjoy the clean feeling they provide after brushing. Many people feel its a waste of money to buy these, but to get a cleaner mouth with less the effort, it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical of electric tooth brushes being any better than a manual tooth brush.  This went on sale for $26, so I figured why the hell not.  I must say, this thing has impressed me!  It took a few brushes to get used to the commotion in my mouth but now it&#x27;s great.  I have noticed MUCH better plaque removal and a generally cleaner feeling mouth.  Now when I floss I barely get anything from between my teeth because they&#x27;re so clean.  The battery life seems to be a week or so, and will of course be dependent on your usage.  Overall I am very satisfied and will continue to use a mechanical tooth brush over the manual brush.  If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying one, do it!  You will not regret purchasing one of these.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Works wonderfully. Very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> i have been using oral B electric tooth brushes for years.  my old one was still working but grimy after years of use.  this new brush was more powerful than my old one.  it might be because it has a fresh battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, it works great.  i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is easy to use effectively and is nearly foolproof.  It lets you know when 30 seconds has elapsed,(lets you brush consistently on each side), and also lets you know if you are brushing too hard.  The light flashes when it is time to charge the battery, (which does not take long).  The tops are easy to exchange and they offer specific ones for between the teeth and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectivness, i can see a marked improvement both between teeth and the gumline.  it also takes less time to brush overall.  We will see what the dentist has to say in a few months.  If i had to find a negative, it would be the noise.  I cannot compare to other offerings, (as this is my first rechargeable toothbrush), but it is loud enough that you could not use it in the next room without waking somebody up.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I can say about this toothbrush. I have never had a problem with any Oral-B products, and with this one, the trend continues! There is a reason why Oral-B is the #1 dentist endorsed product! Anything to make your visits to the dentist less painful and more pleasant does it for me! Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever electric toothbrush, and I guess I&#x27;m just not super impressed. It&#x27;s a little unwieldy (especially the stand it sits on), and mine takes FOREVER to charge (which may just be a problem with mine). I do like the clean it gives the teeth, but I don&#x27;t necessarily believe it&#x27;s anything a toothbrush can&#x27;t do (except for maybe the clean I get around the gum line). I haven&#x27;t been using it that long...after a month or two I&#x27;ll try and update. If you&#x27;re an electric toothbrush connoisseur well, then, you probably know more than me about this sort of thing. If this would be your first venture into the electric toothbrush market I would say...\\&quot;Do you really need it, is there something else you need more or want more? Then pass on this stick with your good old manual toothbrush.\\&quot; For the person who is just dead set on experiencing what the electric toothbrush can bring to their lives I would say \\&quot;Spend no more money what this one costs...it&#x27;s more than good enough.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Best price worth every penny</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush, but not sure if I like it as much as the Sonicare. As others have said, it isn&#x27;t quite as &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; as the Sonicare. I also find that a good amount of toothpaste doesn&#x27;t actually foam up (not sure if that&#x27;s because of the small brush head). On a positive note, the smaller brush head allows you to get to difficult-to-reach places. Overall, I think it was a good purchase. Keep in mind, the frustration free packaging does not have the UPC so you can&#x27;t submit the rebate!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second Oral-B we&#x27;ve had.  This replaces an older version.  It is much faster than the older one which makes it even better.  This is a simple model, but does all you need to get really clean teeth.  I love the way you can give individual attention to each tooth as you move around your mouth and feel like you are doing a very thorough job.</li>
    <li> Motor runs great, but there is mouth-moisture leakage where the brush goes on to the toothbrush holder.  I tried new brushes, but they leaked also.  The fault seems to lay in the prod, where there is too much play.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how old my electric toothbrush had gotten until I tried this brush and the speed caught me by surprise.&lt;br /&gt;The 30 second timer is useful and the brush it self is easy to use.</li>
    <li> As with my previous 3 or 4 Oral-B tooth brushes, this is a very good tooth brush. I like the 4 &#x27;warnings&#x27; that indicate you have spent enough time cleaning the current quadrant of your teeth but that may be a novelty that wears off. I can&#x27;t compare to other brands as I have only used Oral-B for over 15 years. Each new model seems a little better than the last.</li>
    <li> I had it replaced once. IT DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE AND DOES A VERY POOR JOB OF GETTING ONES TEETH CLEAN. Since it was a gift it was especially disappointing. DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for years now..&lt;br /&gt;Have to buy a new one every now &amp; then...... Nothing keeps you mouth as clean as this.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel awesome after using this. This holds a charge for about a week, brushing two minutes twice a day. It is worth noting that it takes quite a while to charge, and the charger does get somewhat warm.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, at my dentist&#x27;s suggestion, I bought a very simple Braun Oral-B electric toothbrush. It served me well for over 10 years before its battery finally gave out. Having had such a great experience with Braun Oral-B already, I really wanted my replacement to be Braun Oral-B, too. Unfortunately, all the models I saw in stores were too expensive and had all sorts of bells and whistles that I didn&#x27;t really need. I was thrilled when I came upon this model here on Amazon - simple and affordable, with many positive reviews to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the frustration-free packaging, which truly was frustration-free! The product arrived in an easy-to-open brown cardboard box without any fancy branding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I plugged it in, it took almost 24 hours for the battery to get fully charged. Just be patient. A green battery-shaped light flashes while charging, and then the light stays off when the battery is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the battery is fully charged, I unplug the toothbrush. With just me brushing twice a day for a little over 2 minutes per brushing, my toothbrush&#x27;s battery lasts a full week before the red plug-shaped light comes on, telling me that the battery needs to be re-charged. I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes to re-charge, but mine takes at least 5 hours. I plug in the toothbrush in the morning when I see the red light, and it&#x27;s fully charged by the time I go to brush my teeth at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is only one button on the toothbrush, and the basic functionality is simple: Press the button once to start, press the button again to stop. Assuming you want to brush for the dentist-recommended 2 minutes, the toothbrush gives a short pulse every 30 seconds and another longer pulse after 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compartment on the side is a brush head holder that stores up to 4 brush heads. It&#x27;s a separate piece that snaps on around the charging base, so if you don&#x27;t want to use it, just don&#x27;t attach it. You can buy additional brush heads with different colored rings around the base of each brush head (so each person has their own color), and multiple people can share one electric toothbrush by swapping out the brush heads. I don&#x27;t share my electric toothbrush, but I still use the holder to rest my brush head when I take it off every night. I don&#x27;t know how necessary it really is, but the instructions say to clean the brush head after use by taking it off, holding it upside down, and running water through it. I do that after brushing in the evenings, then let the brush head dry in the holder overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/17/15: So, I noticed recently that I generally brush for 2 1/2 minutes at a time, and my toothbrush now lasts 4 days unplugged, before the plug-shaped light starts flashing red. Still, it works perfectly fine as long as I keep charging it as necessary.around the base of each brush head (so each person has their own color), and multiple people can share one electric toothbrush by swapping out the brush heads.

    <li> Having recently come from a manual tooth brush, I can confidently say that the Oral-B CP1000 is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  My teeth feel like they have been polished.  My dentist noticed the difference after less than 2 weeks of use.  I also like the timer as you puts you into a good brushing routine.  The bristles are holding up very well (going on the 3rd month and still going strong) which was a concern as I never got a month out of a manual brush.  The brush is easy to clean and the charging station is tiny which is great for our small bathroom.  The entire product is well designed and made in Germany to boot.</li>
    <li> Works well for me. More oomph than my old Vitality model from this maker, and the handle doesn&#x27;t get grubby like the Vitality did.</li>
    <li> I have tried both the spin brush Orale-B and the Sonicare. I will say flat out that I don&#x27;t really have a preference. I feel that both work well and have similar features. One thing you can count on, with either brush, is a very clean feeling after you brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B is comfortable to hold and features a 30 second timer so it lets you know when its time to change quadrants during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to either toothbrush is the cost of replacements for the brushes. They really need to be changed every 3 months or so even if you have some kind of sanitizer.</li>
    <li> The brush it&#x27;s self is mediocre, I like my Sonic Care much better. This one seems jerky and less well-made. I spend $35 on the item when there was a rebate deal going with Oral-B for $15 right before Christmas, and had I gotten the rebate I would say the brush was worth about $20. No way would I have bought and kept it at $35.  But, after taking the frustration free box apart to send in the required codes for the rebate I couldn&#x27;t have returned it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware if you ever see a rebate offer from Oral-B they don&#x27;t seem to have any interest in actually rebating you anything. After hearing nothing from them for 6 wks I called this week to find out where my rebate was (and to check on a friend&#x27;s rebate who bought this item after I told her about the deal). The rebate center couldn&#x27;t find anything for my friend or myself. Both rebate refunds magically disappeared. Strange enough if it had just been my rebate, but for both of them to go missing is far fetched.</li>
    <li> This seems to work the way it&#x27;s supposed to, although it seems to lose its charge pretty fast.  It&#x27;s slowing down by the time I&#x27;m done, and that&#x27;s probably more than 1 but less than 2 minutes.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush that I purchased about two weeks ago (at a reasonable price) does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I am pleased with it.  I have interchangeable heads and the whole family uses it.  The dental hygienist has commented on the family&#x27;s improvement in oral health.</li>
    <li> This is the most basic of rechargeable electric toothbrushes, but it works very well. The charge lasts for quite a while, and while it doesn&#x27;t feature automatic shut-off, it does beep every 30 seconds to make it easier for users to know when the 2-minute recommended brushing period has elapsed. The handle is very reasonably sized (in fact, my 5-year-old daughter has been the recipient of this toothbrush) for people of all ages and sizes. It does come with a charging stand add-on for more brush-heads if you happen to be sharing with other family members. All-in-all, it&#x27;s a great basic brush that would work for any member of your family!</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for years and years and years.  In fact, the poor old thing must be more than ten years old.  Given the fact that it probably does not have much more life left in it, I decided to try the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The head is larger than the Sonic, and the first time I used it I found it to be a bit cumbersome.  (Got over that fast, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B leaves my teeth feeling extremely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a collar (like the Sonicare) that traps gunk beneath it unless frequently cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is made by Braun, which is a very reputable company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the device and the brushes is much more reasonable than the Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I am going to toss the Sonicare, and stick with the Oral-B.  Time, of course, will tell how durable it is, but for now I am quite satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 is a great toothbrush. I&#x27;ve used a Sonicare in the past and the Oral-B leaves my teeth feeling just as clean as the Sonicare at a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part of the setup is removing the toothbrush from the box (which isn&#x27;t that hard). Once out you simply attach the brush head and plug in the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back I&#x27;ve seen with the Oral-B is that the battery doesn&#x27;t last near as long as the Sonicare. The Oral-B battery only lasts for 2 or 3 days. The Sonicare battery lasts for more than a week. If you travel a lot you will need to bring the base with you unless you are going on a short trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 is an excellent option for anyone looking for an electric toothbrush but doesn&#x27;t want to pay for a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased the Sonicare Pro Results at the behest of my dentist.  He was concerned that I wasn&#x27;t getting quite the cleaning that I should be using my cheaper Oral-B toothbrush.  When I saw this more professional brush come along for review, I thought it would be great to try and compare with the Sonicare.  My wife also really wanted to try a nicer toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the toothbrush is quite sturdy. The small head is great for getting in hard to reach places in your mouth. MUCH nicer than the &lt; $10 Oral B brushes I have been buying.  It charges fairly quickly and seems to hold a charge well. We got about 4+ days of use out of a single charge.  I liked the base of the toothbrush as well, especially  the fact that the extra toothbrush holder was removable, allowing for less counter space to be used. One thing I did not like was the fact the charging light blinks once it is charged.  There were a couple of times we woke up in the night and saw a blinking light. I had to shut the bathroom door to keep from being annoyed by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For teeth cleaning, the brush was just OK. It felt more like a polisher than a deep cleaning.  I really didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting between my teeth well and really taking the gunk away, rather than just moving it around.  I later spoke with my dental hygienist and she said the same thing, that the rotating brush just moves things around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result of this experiment, the brush is OK, but didn&#x27;t feel right for my wife and I. I continue to use my Sonicare and we have purchased a second head to go on it for my wife. She is much happier now, using the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush Quality is par and is a plus for the price purchased, it does what it says and you will notice right away on your teeth thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this toothbrush to replace an earlie version..little money for a great toothbrush.  Check for rebates too..the packaging was tricky to find th UPC on.</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift to replace my 8 year old Oral B Electric Toothbrush.  I really like it but I liked my old one too.  I bought a Soniccare electric toothbrush a month earlier but didn&#x27;t like it. Fortunately, my husband did and so he took it.  I am happy to be back with Oral-B.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the speed of the brush plus, the full and the low battery indicator. It just need a compact brush holder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several Oral-B products over the years and they continue to get better.  Unfortunately as several other reviewers have stated, they simply refuse to issue the rebate.  They claim the UPC code isn&#x27;t valid for the rebate which is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Rebate Denied&amp;#34; letter they mailed me had a copy of every document I submitted - EXCEPT for the UPC code.  Since the rebate requires the original UPC code cut from the box, I guess I won&#x27;t be trying to resubmit the paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s too bad since they do make good products; but I&#x27;m uneasy doing business with any organization that appears to be acting in bad faith.</li>
    <li> I wanted a very basic toothbrush - not something will all the bells and whistles that I would never use.  This one is perfect.  Has a timer, which I really like, and that&#x27;s it.  Way less expensive than other brushes - but does a great job.</li>
    <li> I cannot stand the cheapo electric toothbrushes (~$10) from the stores.  I bought a $20 Oral B Pro Health and loved it.  It wasn&#x27;t easy finding the refill heads, but after about a year or so it finally died.  I couldn&#x27;t find another Pro Health so I was afraid they were/are discontinuing it.  I can&#x27;t afford the $100 electric toothbrushes so I did my research and bought this.  I am SUPER happy with it!  Love that I don&#x27;t have to fumble with replacing batteries and trying to get the closure back on for the battery compartment.  This thing is more powerful than the Pro Health and my teeth feel so clean!!  I also love the intermittent timer for the four quadrants of your mouth as well!  You cant go wrong with this tooth brush!</li>
    <li> Does a great job.  My dentist noticed without my saying  a thing. I also puchased one for my son who is a challenged young adult - what a difference it made!</li>
    <li> Works well, keeps my teeth clean.  I like that it tells you to switch to another section of your mouth by vibrating every 30 seconds.  Replacements heads are a little pricey though.</li>
    <li> The oral hygienist mentioned that powered toothbrushes were getting to a price point where it made sense to purchase one, and offered a few suggestions during one of my teeth cleaning appointments.  So I went to Amazon and balanced out the features and ratings on various toothbrushes.  I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for a while, and have seen the benefits of using it over time.  Even my dentist comments now on how little work his oral hygienists have to do with removing plaque buildup during each visit.  A great toothbrush at a reasonable cost, and a lifecycle that can be extended with careful cleaning every now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Charge holds for a week with daily brushing (2x per day)&lt;br /&gt;2.) Interchangeable toothbrush heads and many inexpensive knock-offs that also work in the market, including ortho head attachments&lt;br /&gt;3.) Timing sensors vibrate gently to help you time how long to brush each set of teeth&lt;br /&gt;4.) Rather durable build&lt;br /&gt;5.) Results are evident with extended use of this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Takes close to 16 hours to reach a full charge&lt;br /&gt;2.) Some parts can be harder to clean.  I usually have to do a deep clean on it once a month to keep the head attachment area clean&lt;br /&gt;3.) Tends to hold some water and drip on the bathroom counter even after drying it off after each use&lt;br /&gt;4.) Not the easiest toothbrush to travel with</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is very powerful and provides a deep cleaning. I have permanent retainers and it cleans under them very well. It is worth the investment to get this tooth brush. When it recharges it flashes a green light. We close the bathroom door and it doesn&#x27;t bother us.</li>
    <li> After around 12 years of trouble free use my last electric tooth ceased working.  It was also an Oral-B, and that was about a year ago.  At that point, admittedly, I was less than pleased with expense involved in purchasing manufacturer recommended brush heads.  So much so that I set out to do things &#x27;the old fashioned way&#x27;, convinced that just as good a job could be done using quality standard tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I’d taken much forgranted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the past year I&#x27;ve went through one after another of a variety of standard toothbrushes at the rate of about one a month or more.  The amount of time spent brushing my teeth more than doubled and it became a painstaking sort of tedious task, one I’d started dreading early on.  Then there came the extra expense and hassles in taste testing and stockpiling breath mints - which were always kept on hand since my teeth and breath didn&#x27;t feel nearly so clean as they had before reverting back to &#x27;standard&#x27;.  (The expense doesn’t seem like much until tallied for 12 months!) About the only good thing coming about from the electric hiatus was, perhaps, slightly better developed biceps due to extra physical effort being put forth in brushing!  In all, the traditional way of brushing wound up costing only slightly less than did the electric and that&#x27;s WITH recommended brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding brush heads . . . well . . . rest assured I&#x27;m all for bargain prices.  Go way out of my way, in fact, in search of them (bargains).  As an only parent to a pre-teen who grows at remarkable rates, I&#x27;ve become adept at DIYing, pinching, digging deep, and bypassing unnecessary excess and expense (thus the attempt at going &#x27;standard&#x27;).  However, it bears pointing out that I always used manufacturer recommended brush heads with my last electric toothbrush - always, UP UNTIL about the last 4 months or so.  Much as I may feel recommended heads are overpriced, and troubled as I may be by shelling out themoney for them, truth is, my last toothbrush gave out after a few months of using the cheapies.  Sure, it (the toothbrush) had been in service for quite a long time, but at a cost of nearly $100, seems to me it just about ought to have lasted a lifetime!  Whether it was old age, cheap brush heads, or neither, or both that brought about the end is hard for me to say at this point.  Wishing now I&#x27;d held on to it, or at least saved the model number for sake of comparison, but I didn&#x27;t, because I set out to go about things the old way and that was to be the end of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did also, some 8 or so years ago, buy a rechargeable electric t brush (also Oral-B) for my son.  It was far less expensive than my last one, but cost about the same as the PHC Precision 1000 being reviewed here. His lasted about 3 yrs and that&#x27;s with using only recommended brush heads.  I’d have been a bit more upset over it, perhaps, if not for it having been three cavity free years. . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, and back to the present point in time, a good bit of time went into selecting this particular (reasonably priced, but overly titled) model, the &amp;#34;Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000&amp;#34;.  Personally, I&#x27;m fine without all the extra readouts and so forth.  It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a charge quite as long as my last one did; however, it&#x27;s lasting just over a week in between charges and with this I&#x27;m well satisfied.  Honestly, I&#x27;m soooooo glad to be &#x27;electric&#x27; brushing again!  I&#x27;m much happier going about life with dentist-office-clean feeling teeth.  Thought of that along with the black Friday bargain price made it too difficult to just let pass by.  You can bet I&#x27;ll be scoping out one similar for my son.  AND it must be admitted, along with this tooth brush I purchased a 4 pack of bargain priced brush heads, but now I&#x27;m more than a bit leery about using them since it was only after this that there came to mind timing involved in demise of my last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anythingchanges, malfunctions, or altogether ceases to work, you can bet I&#x27;ll make a point of noting it here.  Perhaps others will see to doing the same?  In all, as it now stands I’m more than pleased with this purchase, especially since I could say this standing two feet away and not be worried about whether my breath is offensive (well, most days that is, but can’t be expecting full on freshness 24/7/365).  Anyhow, hope this helps!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. It cleans her teeth better than her old one she said. So that&#x27;s all I needed to hear. Very pleased. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Been using Oral-B toothbrush for many years. When it became time for a new one there was no hesitation.  The built-in timer is great.</li>
    <li> great electric toothbrush! have one for myself &amp; love it. if you&#x27;re on the fence, i would recommend this particular model.</li>
    <li> Great tooth brush even tells me when I am done! I would recommend it to anyone over the regular battery brands</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase! It works perfectly. I have been using it for a while and never gave me any problem. I will be buying replacements for the brush soon.</li>
    <li> build quality seems to be pretty good. pricey for what you get. Shipping was fast got in the time posted. everything as expected. easily stalls motor while using not powerful, tiny head, hard to get used to. just ok</li>
    <li> if you&#x27;re not one of those crazy dental fanatics but do want an electric TB that will not cost you your first born, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;compared the feature with the higher-end models, not a big deal and certainly not worth x3 the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cool feature - the stand has room for more TB heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing battery life, i didn&#x27;t charge it for two weeks on a trip cause i forgot the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Oral-B would not honor the $25 rebate voucher.  I sent in all the required information and was told this was not sufficient but what else was there to send.</li>
    <li> This model performs much better than a previous Oral B that I had used for over 5 years and had a NiCad battery that was beginning to fail. The model 1000 has a lithium ion battery that will last much longer than the battery in the older Oral B, because it can withstand &amp;#34;topping off&amp;#34; (i.e., frequent, but unnecessary recharging) of the battery.&lt;br /&gt;The new model 1000 also gives a much more rigorous cleaning than the older one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a couple of weeks now.  I liked my old Sonic Care brush much better.  This one doesn&#x27;t allow much room to put toothpaste on the brush and what&#x27;s there seems to drip down the brush too easily.</li>
    <li> I really do like to use when I&#x27;m not in a hurry, as I brush alot longer. My dentist has been trying to get me to use for a few years. The benfits are great for your gums.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much and i purchased this for the second time now. First time when i purchased it, after a months usage battery stopped charging, there were no indication of charging, etc. I am not sure, why it stopped charging (motor was working fine) and eventually i was not able to use. I returned it and purchased another one month ago. It is working till now and fingers crossed.</li>
    <li> What can I say? It leaves my teeth cleaner than any manual brush ever could, reduces plaque, holds a charge. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I have a SoniCare and opted to buy this Oral-B because of the small round brush size and material.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mix of firm bristles, soft bristles and bristles of rubbery material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is particularly good for cleaning teeth that may be crooked or slightly overlapping, as well as cleaning the back of the front bottom teeth where dental hygienists spend the most time picking, scaling and removing stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the long brush of the SoniCare, I can concentrate on individual teeth with this small round brush head. It&#x27;s overal light weight and streamline shape has a nice feel that&#x27;s easy to maneuver. I use it twice daily and it lasted a month before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still use my SoniCare for my third daily brushing because it has a faster speed and pulse stream which forces water/toothpaste between the teeth and at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do caution that you be aware of the length of time you are brushing when using this Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;SoniCare automatically shuts off. Oral-B does not. You will get a cycle-time alert with a brief pause, but you&#x27;ll need to keep track of how many &amp;#34;pulse pauses&amp;#34; so you don&#x27;t over-brush. Don&#x27;t brush more than four pauses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally get deep in thought while brushing my teeth and lose track of time.&lt;br /&gt;With the SoniCare, I&#x27;m apt to say, &amp;#34;Oh, I&#x27;m done already,&amp;#34; because it automatically shuts off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was deep in thought while using the Oral-B and didn&#x27;t realize I had brushed longer than advised by dental professionals.&lt;br /&gt;The next day, my teeth were sensitive and ached a bit. Over-brushing with an electric toothbrush over-heats the teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if you&#x27;re a person brushing to get it done, then no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does not arrive fully charged and it took a good 16 hours to fully charge for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;After that, the charge time is perhaps a few hours.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace another Oral-B that I had for many years. This one is solid and it greatly improves on the brush storage with a holder for multiple brushes and a nice swivel cover for the brushes.</li>
    <li> Had gum issues with other brush brands. I like the brush options available.  Using the sensitive brush currently and could not be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> We had a more expensive, earlier model that finally didn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  My husband read the description of this one, and thought it would suit nicely.  It works great!  We don&#x27;t need the timed read-out or a smiley face to encourage us to brush long enough. :-)</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a cheaper electric toothbrush to this one a few months ago and have been very happy with it. I especially like the vigorous spinning motion and the smaller brush head, which allows me to get to my back teeth better!</li>
    <li> Very happy with it. Both my fiancee and I use it (yes, we do have separate brush heads) and we are happy with the clean feeling we get from it.&lt;br /&gt;I have the Orab B sonic, which I also like, but this one brushes harder (more rotations) and I think does a better job.</li>
    <li> This product works wonderful and the price was great.  I am very happy with product. Had an electric toothbrush years back and the battery went dead so I didn&#x27;t have one for years and I really missed having one.</li>
    <li> Im so happy with this toothbrush! It cleans brilliantly.. Don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a manual.</li>
    <li> Love this and so does my husband and son!&lt;br /&gt;Works great due to size of brush, more like a dentist office,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet if it would&#x27;ve been better to go with the higher speed 3000 model, but I just had a dental cleaning yesterday and they said things are looking better!</li>
    <li> The old one had gotten mighty slow and this one takes off in more ways than one!!!&lt;br /&gt;We love it!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is by far the best I have ever used.  After I bought mine, I also bought one for each member of my family.  Very happy</li>
    <li> Its an Oral-B what else need to be said about the product. Took quite a long tome for the inital charge once it charged up I got 6 days out of without the next charge. Good product...</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality.</li>
    <li> This Oral B toothbrush is great.  The speed of the brush is fast, so it makes it impossible to put toothpaste on it and turn it on before putting it in your mouth. We had toothpaste all over. It charges fast.  It comes with an attachment to the charger base to hold four brush heads for more family members.  It has a cover too to protect them. The cord is a nice length.  No complaints about anything yet.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered this toothbrush I figured I would be writing a negative review. but this electric toothbrush has won me over with its ease of use and cleaning power.  In particular, it does a fantastic job of getting in between teeth, or at least shoving toothpaste in between your teeth.  The smaller head allows you to get in back of and around your chompers easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off a star because this model claims to have a sensor that lights up if you press too hard against your teeth.  I tried (to the point of nearly snapping the brush head off) but could never get the sensor to work.  It also stops and starts every 30 seconds.  This is supposed to be a notification to switch to brushing a different \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; in your mouth but I find it just annoys me and disrupts my brushing.  Have we become so dumb that we need a reminder on our toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these minor gripes, I really do believe I am getting a superior brushing of the teeth and gums compared to a manual toothbrush and even one of those throwaway \\&quot;spinner\\&quot; brushes.  Twenty bucks for three refill heads isn&#x27;t a horrible price.  You&#x27;ll pay more in the long run if you switch to this versus sticking to cheap manual toothbrushes.  Perhaps you&#x27;ll get your money back in the form of smaller dental bills.</li>
    <li> It does the job for me.  I don&#x27;t know why they recommend that you do not charge it after every use.  Other than that I love the toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Holds charge very well, several weeks between charges.  It&#x27;s works well and I&#x27;m glad I researched and went with this model.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get an electric toothbrush.  I picked this one.  Works like it should.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Braun electric tooth brushes are just really reliable. Don&#x27;t by the $100 expensive ones in Bed Bath and Beyond, by this one. It doesn&#x27;t have all those bells and whistles, but it does the job great.</li>
    <li> My husband &amp; I bought the electric toothbrushes, for each other, as Christmas gifts. We r e a l l y like them. I would recommend them to everyone.</li>
    <li> Timer works great for even brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Teeth felt so smooth like I just got home from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Could have came with another head.</li>
    <li> My wife had been requesting one of these for some time.  I finally got her one and at a great price.</li>
    <li> great product highly recommended functions well, it has really gone above and beyond my expectationss for 35 bucks you cant beat it</li>
    <li> I love, love, love Oral-B electronic toothbrushes.  I have been using them for over 3 years and never had a tartar problem since (brushing at least twice a day)!  I HIGHLY recommend them, and Amazon&#x27;s price just under $40 for this one was GREAT!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any model lower than this one though.</li>
    <li> I rated this product a 5 because it performs flawlessly. It is everything I expected and more. I had a Braun brush before this one and loved it. But this Oral-B outperforms it. I love the feature that lets you know you have brushed long enough in one area of your mouth. It hesitates briefly then spins again. It does this 4 times for each quadrant of your mouth. When it has run for 2 minutes it hesitates for a longer period to let you know you are done brushing for the 2 minute period. It holds a long charge and is powerful. I had many heads for the old brush and didn&#x27;t want to waste them. So, I purchased this one. I am glad I did. I would recommend this Oral-B to anyone who wants clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a 4 year old Oral B model. The old one (i don&#x27;t remember the model number) was a darker blue with a chrome on off button. It didn&#x27;t have the nice holder for the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one fails to disappoint. Which, less ambiguously, means it succeeds. It&#x27;s simply an on/off no frills pulsing electric toothbrush. Lighter weight than the older model we had and good quality. Pulses every 30 seconds to let you know it&#x27;s time to move on to the next mouth quadrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging is simply a brown box, like bulk packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing much to say about it, if you enjoy clean teeth and rotating brush heads this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> April 2&lt;br /&gt;After waiting ten weeks and contacting Amazon after eight weeks, Oral-B finally sent me my rebate.  Their rebate form says the wait is 6-8 weeks.  Not true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the toothbrush itself, it seems to work well.  I owned an electric toothbrush several decades ago, but it did not brush as well as this one.  I do not use flouride toothpaste, so I generally just use water or sometimes mouthwash.  Teeth feel very clean though after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 16&lt;br /&gt;I have been waiting two months for the $15 rebate that was offered for the purchase of this toothbrush.  I see that several purchasers&#x27; rebates have been refused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 21&lt;br /&gt;Decided to contact Amazon and notify them that Oral-B was not fulfilling its coupon obligations.  If after several months of waiting for Oral-B you have not heard from them, take the time to use Amazon&#x27;s contact forms and notify Amazon.  Amazon can put the requisite pressure on that company to follow through on its obligations.</li>
    <li> Chose this oral b because I have used one for years the last on already worn out. Found this at a special price so purchased&lt;br /&gt;it, am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I got it over a year ago during Black Friday 2013. It cleans my teeth better than a standard toothbrush. On a full charge it typically lasts me somewhere between 5-7 days. I would change the heads on it every 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the dentist recently and it was my shortest dentist trip I&#x27;ve had in my life. The hygienist said there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot to clean on my teeth. I think I owe a lot of that to this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has braces and was having problems getting her teeth clean .my daughter said her mouth has nver felt so clean she loves it</li>
    <li> The first time I used this too brush I had to stop several times because it felt too powerful; however I didn&#x27;t stop and now my teeth feel much better.  This is a POWERFUL toothbrush that does it&#x27;s job! I didn&#x27;t give it five stars yet because I have yet to see my dentist, if they say my teeth have improved I will change the rating to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> We used to have an E-series Sonicare.  It cleaned OK but the head design is a complete disaster.  The head design on the E-series Sonicare allows for water to accumulate inside, where it turns moldy.  It is almost impossible to clean.  It is not a question of laziness on the part of the user, the design is just terrible.  Sonicare&#x27;s higher end models have a completely different head design which doesn&#x27;t suck, but you have to pay a lot more to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B, on the other hand, has a good head design.  It is simple to clean and there are no obvious places where water can accumulate or remain stagnant.  This toothbrush is loud, but it gets the job done.  It doesn&#x27;t take as long to brush out teeth and we rarely have to go over any tooth twice.  Even though this is a lower-end model, it has head storage for 4 heads (which most Sonicares do not have).  The head storage is easy to clean- it can be removed from the charging base and put through the dishwasher if you want.  The head storage also positions the heads in a way that allows them to dry and even has a cover to keep out debris and germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is loooong and the on/off button is a little small and never where I expect it to be if I am not looking at it.  But this is a small complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely consider Oral-B electric toothbrushes in the future.  The low end models are not crippled like other brands.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to pay the big prices to replace and old Sonicare or buy a Braun. I tried this one because of the price and features. Love it - a great value and it seems to work as well or betetr than the expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush for traveling only and it is great!  Has the feature that buzzes every 30 seconds so I can brush an area and know when the time is up to change to a different area.  I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I really like this electric toothbrush.  Very simple design and not too bulky.  Great battery life and reminders while you brush to let you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush met all my expectations.  The battery holds charge for 7+ days and it is very powerful.  The brush head is small and round -- seems to fit my mouth better than the oblong brush heads.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush is very powerful and seems to be exactly what&#x27;s needed in an electric toothbrush product.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> The Braun rechargeable toothbrush that my husband and I had been using for a number of years finally died so we did not hesitate to buy a new one.  We could not find the model we had been using so we chose this model. It completely stopped working after a month.  Hugely disappointed in the new model&#x27;s reliability.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist, and I will recommend it to my customers. Actually I will recommend to every one. It is a great tool.</li>
    <li> Other brush modes (pulsate-pulsate-spin versus spin-pulsate-spin versus pulsate-spin-pulsate) seem pretty pointless to me. This one works just as well as a more expensive one that I had. The only difference is that this one stops/starts vibrating to let you know you&#x27;ve brushed for 2 minutes and my expensive one had an LCD screen that, when the vibrating stopped/started to let you know you&#x27;d brushed for 2 mins, the LCD screen showed you the time and a smiley face when you hit 2 mins. Woohoo...LOL</li>
    <li> Had good reviews so bought the Oral-B.  My wife&#x27;s teeth are very sensitive and never could use an electric tooth brush.  Got her to try it once and for the first time she can now use an electric brush.  That&#x27;s the plus.  I&#x27;m happy with it.  My only negative is that it takes 36 to 40 hours to recharge.  Never had an electric tooth brush that ever took that long to recharge.  Its a wee irritating but I can live with it.  Otherwise it does a good job.  Waiting to see what the dentist has to say.  I use the regular brush one time and the next time the floss brush.  See if I get a better cleaning from the Oral-B.  Only you dentist know for sure.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush. It works great and the brush head is compact enough to effective clean molars. The charging station works great and is quite fast. I haven&#x27;t had any issues till date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head holding case could have had a draining hole as residual water from the head seeps into the catchment area. If uncleaned can quickly become a petri dish for algae and fungus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that I chose this model because they had a $15 cash back and I haven&#x27;t seen a response till date. It&#x27;s been more than 3 months since I mailed them the cash back form. At $45 (full price) I could have dropped in another 30 and bought 2 Sonicare toothbrushes at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read similar complaints on Amazon reviews while buying. Should have steered clear of Oral-B.</li>
    <li> This is a good brush that holds a good charge.  It is easy to hold and the base is convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought it to replace a reliable, decade-old Oral-B unit the charger of which I had misplaced.  This model is definitely an improvement in several ways.  Its slimmer and longer body profile provides a good grip for an easy reach.  I have found this entry-level unit powerful enough to give my teeth a very good cleaning.  Moreover, it is light and compact for my travels.</li>
    <li> lots of timing functions that are not particularly necessary, but this brush is inexpensive and does an excellent job at cleaning.  Battery is long lasting.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve been using oral-b for years, this model has great value and cleans really well with standard or generic heads</li>
    <li> I DECIDED TO GIVE THE HEADS FOR THE ORAL B A TRY AFTER ALL THE HYPE ON TV AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT THE BRUSHES IN COMBINATION REALLY DID MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MY TEETH.  BEFORE I GOT THIS  BRUSH HEAD AND THE DEEP SWEEP TO USE INTERCHANGEABLY EVERY OTHER NIGHT, THE DENTIST HAD MENTIONED I NEEDED A CLEANING AT MY LAST APPT. THE NEXT TIME, ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, I ASKED HOW MY TEETH WERE DOING AND HE SAID THEY LOOKED FINE AND DIDN&#x27;T SEEM TO NEED A CLEANING AT THAT TIME. THAT WAS HUGE TO ME AS I HATE THE NEW CLEANING PROCESS! THIS COMBINATION OF BRUSHES, THE FLOSS ACTION AND THE DEEP SWEEP LEAVES MY TEETH FEELING REALLY CLEAN ALL THE WAY TO MY GUMS. THE MOTION IN THESE HEADS ACTUALLY SEEMS TO DO SOMETHING TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH RATHER THAN JUST GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES LIKE SO MANY DO. FOR THE 1ST TIME, I ACTUALLY ENJOY BRUSHING MY TEETH AND WITH THIS BRUSH, MY CARPAL TUNNEL DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME DURING OR AFTER BRUSHING MY TEETH AS IN THE PAST BEFORE I DISCOVERED THESE 2 HEADS &amp; THIS BRUSHING SYSTEM. I&#x27;D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE BUT ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE WITH LIMITED WRIST MOTION.</li>
    <li> Bought for daughter and she loves it.  Very slim and hold a charge well.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very fair and does everything that one could want out of an electric toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to all!</li>
    <li> Useful for the whole family of 3 of us! I just bought 3 more brush heads, everyone is using this handle with their own brush head. Very convenient!</li>
    <li> love the whirling capability of the brush head.  makes my teeth feel clean and fresh.  would recommend the electric toothbrush with replaceable heads.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a SoniCare electric toothbrush for several years.  It is more expensive, but after using the Oral-B I&#x27;m convinced it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B is loud...the kind of loud that makes me wonder if the motor is doing okay.  The brush head that it comes with is thick...and I have to open up more than is comfortable to get to my teeth.  If I happen to bite down on it at all...mostly because it just doesn&#x27;t fit in my mouth well...the motor bogs down easily to the point of stopping completely.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen with my SoniCare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B handle is slimmer than the SoniCare...and I like that...it has multiple heads for different purposes that can be purchased (all are round and spin though) and a decent case to store them in right on the charger.  That is handy.  There is no cover on the head...so it is exposed to anything that flies by while on the charger.  I like the brush covers on the SoniCare and that the heads are smaller and the traditional toothbrush shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving the Oral-B to my daughter, who is loving it since it is much nicer than the $5 electric toothbrushes she&#x27;s had until now.  She doesn&#x27;t seem to mind opening so wide.  I will be surprised if the Oral-B motor/battery lasts several years the way the SoniCare does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare [[ASIN:B000UK2W4C Philips Sonicare HX6932/10 FlexCare RS930 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] for a few years now and have to say that the Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush almost compares to it.&lt;br /&gt;Now, there are intrinsic differences that will always separate the two products, the obvious being that the Sonicare vibrates the brush head while the Oral-B oscillates and the difference in brush sizes - the Oral-B brushes a fair deal larger than the Philips which directly translates to comfort preferences for various people.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B does a fantastic job of cleaning the teeth and gums. The brust tip&#x27;s gentle oscillating motions never felt too harsh but were strong enough to give me a feeling that the brush was doing it&#x27;s job of sweeping away plaque build up. The battry life is pretty good from what I&#x27;ve seen.  I&#x27;ve used it for a week without leaving it on the base to charge and the brush is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;A reccommended buy!</li>
    <li> We have been using the Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying this Oral-B, however, takes toothbrushing to a new level of \\&quot;clean feeling.\\&quot;  In fact, it feels and rather sounds like the dental hygienist&#x27;s final step in buffing the teeth.  For me, this is a positive feature because my dentist has pointed out some plaque recently, and the Sonicare hasn&#x27;t seemed to budge it to a noticeable degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband claims that the Sonicare is the best, that anything stronger is bad for your teeth and gums.  That might be true. Who can say?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hedge my bets, I&#x27;m alternating between the Oral-B and the Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This is a good, solidly performing toothbrush. It reaches into all corners of the mouth well, is easy to manipulate, and the little pause every 30 seconds is a nice reminder of the time I should be brushing--even if I don&#x27;t always follow it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only quibble I have had with the unit I received is that the light does not work properly. When I first got the unit, the light stayed on for three straight days. Unplugging and starting again did not work, and the problem has continued. Since it seems to charge well, I just plug it in overnight when it needs a charge. The problem with the light was hardly worth the hassle of returning it for another unit, but I did give this just an *average* 3 stars instead of the *above average* 4 that it might otherwise have received.</li>
    <li> At the age of 46, the Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 is my second electric toothbrush. I had another over 10 years ago (different brand, if I recall correctly) and was never impressed with it. Took up too much space, didn&#x27;t feel right ergonomically, didn&#x27;t give me results that much better than a regular brush, and refills were pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B Professional Precision 1000 has me convinced and converted. Not *quite* the \\&quot;I just got back from a teeth cleaning\\&quot; experience, but remarkably close. Lightweight and the base is stable and small enough. I really like the station with multiple refills (color coded!) for the family, that is genius, and we&#x27;re both using it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that seems a bit \\&quot;off\\&quot; to me (so to speak) is the position of the on/off button. At least the way I use it, I find it far too easy to mistakenly turn it off with my thumb while brushing. After a few weeks, though, I&#x27;ve retrained myself to how I hold it that this is no longer an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a really great investment, and I wonder why I waited so long. I have no problem rating it just under 5 stars, rounded up.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by my dentist.  It works great and the price was good.  I have a sensitive mouth and the rotating brush is gentle on my teeth and gums.  It&#x27;s not the most powerful so it doesn&#x27;t brush my tongue so well, but I keep a regular toothbrush nearby if my tongue needs the extra cleaning.</li>
    <li> Replaced a model from 6 years ago.  This one is solid and for a good price.  Like most rechargeable batteries, I don&#x27;t leave this fully charged or discharged to avoid.  I use a timer to charge the battery 3-4 hours a day for longevity.</li>
    <li> Still working perfectly fine - 2015&lt;br /&gt;Cleans the tartar</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended that I think about trying an electric toothbrush when I was at my last cleaning visit, so I compared prices and found this one was the most economical.  I have been using it and WOW, what a difference in how clean my teeth are.  There is no comparison between a manual brush and an electric.  I just love using it, because the thing gets my teeth much cleaner and my arthritic hands don&#x27;t have to work so hard!  Super great for people with arthritic fingers.  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to handle.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> this is the best electric tooth brush that i have personally purchased. it is powerful and gives you that just from the dentist feeling.&lt;br /&gt;the only con is that the brush heads dont last anywhere near the 3 months they are supposed to.</li>
    <li> I almost purchased the 5000 model, but switched to the 1000 since the additional features in 5000 didn&#x27;t justify the price tag. I was looking for a basic, but powerful rechargeable tooth brush and the 1000 model was just right for me. The battery can hold good charge and i was able to use it for full 5 days without re-charging and without any loss of power.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I was looking to find out which battery technology was used in this tooth brush and could&#x27;t find the answer anywhere. This tooth brush uses NiMH battery. Though i was hoping for Li-ion, after doing some research on battery technology, I came to the conclusion that NiMH is the appropriate battery type for tooth brush application.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, with a coupon, this toothbrush was a steal for what it offers.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a while and you really do feel almost like you do after a trip to the dentist after every brush/floss/rinse. Great feeling, good product its a bit pricey but for that feeling it maybe be worth it plus there is a fine rebate right now as well. It seems like good quality item all around-give it a try</li>
    <li> Works really well and is a great price.  From the picture I was unsure of how it would work but it exceeded my expectation.  Holds a very good charge and has good power.  It will do the job between my checkups!</li>
    <li> The item arrived sooner than  promised. It works great with my existing tooth brushes. Spins very fast and the low charge indicator is nice to have.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He says it makes his teeth feel fresh and clean and it helps start his day off right :)</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was not expecting much from a home/consumer toothbrush . . .but the clean feeling provided by the Oral B Professional Healthy Clean Precision 1000 toothbrush is first-rate.  In my own experience it is far better than budget priced consumer electric tooth brushes.  I am so pleased with this brush that I will be buying individual brushes for my entire family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a solid feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speed of the brush appears to rival that of professional-grade brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks nice sitting on its charger on the bathroom counter, and takes very little space---just a few inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set up was simple.  You attach the cover to the brush head storage tray, attach the tray to the charger-base, place the handle on the charger.  No hassle set up.  I left the handle on the base for about an hour before I tried the brush. It was charged and did a great job from the very first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean up is a snap.  For some reason, this unit has been easier to keep clean than other brands that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult back surfaces now feel squeaky clean.  This brush does a great job in those hard-to-reach areas.  I am eager to hear the opinion of my hygenist at my next professional cleaning appointment.  After four weeks of regular use, I feel comfortable saying that this brush makes me feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning every day.  It&#x27;s really that good.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I had never used an electric toothbrush prior to receiving the Oral-B. I always wondered if the results were worth the expense -- after all, I can get a free toothbrush twice a year from my dentist when I get my teeth cleaned, or I can spend $5.95 for a pack of four brushes at any big box store. After using this rechargeable brush, I think a plain old non-electric tooth brush does just fine. For one thing, it takes hours and hours to charge the Oral-B for the first time, for another there is no cover for the brush when it is recharging, and third I find the time allowed to brush to be a little short for me. That was another thing: I thought I could brush as long as I wanted with an electric toothbrush, just as with my regular brush. The motor also seemed loud to me, but maybe some people would not be bothered by that. My teeth felt clean, but no cleaner than with a manual brush. To buy or not to buy I think is up to the individual -- if you like an electric toothbrush over a manual one, this is probably just as good a choice as any.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for a while now, and I wanted to see how the Oral-B Healthy Clean Precision 1000 stacks up against my Sonicare Healthy White Easy Clean.  Both are basic rechargeable electric toothbrushes with few fancy features, but a emphasis on cleaning ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is a more aggressive toothbrush, while the Oral-B is gentler.  Sonicare seems to acknowledge that it&#x27;s toothbrushes are aggressive because it gives them a feature called Easy-Start that ramps up power over the first 14 times you use the brush so you and your gums can get used to the punishment.  No such feature is present or needed for the Oral-B.  Instead of vibrating up and down against the gum line, the Oral-B&#x27;s brush head oscillates rapidly.  It is supposed to pulse as well, but it must be too subtle for me to see or feel.  The overall feeling is a little rubbery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed is that the brush head is thicker than the one on the Sonicare, meaning you&#x27;ll need more room between your teeth and cheek when brushing your side teeth.  The distance between the tip of the bristles to the back side of the brush head is ⅞\\&quot; vs ⅝\\&quot; for the Sonicare.  It&#x27;s not a problem for me, but I can see it might be an issue for someone with a smaller mouth.  It may also be the reason Oral-B doesn&#x27;t give you a cap with your brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Sonicare, but I want to point out some advantages of the Oral-B.  First of all, it&#x27;s cheaper.  As I write this, Amazon is offering the Oral-B for around $50 as compared to $66 for the Sonicare.  The replacement brush heads are cheaper too.  $25 will buy you a thee pack of Sonicare brush heads, but a four pack of Oral-B heads.  And while you seldom see Sonicare heads discounted, my local BJ&#x27;s has six packs of Oral-B heads for under $30.  That&#x27;s less than $5 per head.  That&#x27;s a big savings over the life of the brush.  I&#x27;ve been guilty of not replacing my Sonicare brush heads as often as I should, just because they&#x27;re so darn expensive.  $5 per head makes me feel better about chucking old brush heads in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of brush heads, Oral-B offers a wide range of them.  The owner&#x27;s manual lists eight different heads you can buy.  There are brush heads for people with sensitive teeth, wearers of braces, people with crowns and bridges, people who want to whiten and more.  My local BJ&#x27;s has floss head brushes for $32 per six pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B comes in an easy-to-open box.  All the packaging is cardboard.  No frustrating plastic clamshell that needs to be cut open with scissors.  I&#x27;m all for eco-friendly, frustration-free packaging.  Well done, Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, if you take the Sonicare out of your mouth while it&#x27;s running, it&#x27;ll fling toothpaste and saliva all over the bathroom.  That&#x27;s not recommended with the Oral-B either, but it makes a lot less mess.  Sounds kind-of silly, but about the third time you have to clean your bathroom because you were careless when you swapped your toothbrush from one side to the other, it starts to seem less silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gut feeling is that the Sonicare cleans better, but I have no evidence to back that up.  Either brush will clean much, much better than a manual brush.  The Oral-B is gentler, cheaper and has more options for people with sensitive teeth or dental work.&#x27;re so darn expensive.  $5 per head makes me feel better about chucking old brush heads in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of brush heads, Oral-B offers a wide range of them.

    <li> I came to this electric toothbrush after a year of using the [[ASIN:B002CVTVVY Philips Sonicare HX6972/10 FlexCare Plus Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]. I really like the Philips toothbrush, and have bought several as gifts for family. The Oral-B Professional is of comparable quality, and that is high praise for a machine that costs half to a third (depending on which model you buy) of the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both do a very good job of cleaning your teeth. The Philips, I think cleans a little better, but that could be a result of another feature it has over the Oral-B---a timer. The Philips has a cool trick of alerting you after a preset time to clean another quadrant of your teeth. The Oral-B does not, which means you have to be a little more disciplined in switching it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Oral-B is gentler on the mouth and gums than the Philips, which frankly will vibrate the heck out of your teeth before you get used to it. The Oral B seems to have a snarky reference to the Philips in its \\&quot;features\\&quot; listing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had oral surgery and I could not handle the Philips toothbrush in my mouth. Since the surgery a month ago, I&#x27;ve been almost exclusively using the Oral-B. The Philips does have a few more bells and whistles, but at half the price, the Oral-B toothbrush is very hard to turn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an updated review, The rebate came at last.  I guess the letter I wrote explained my problem.&lt;br /&gt;So I am updating this review and raising the feedback to four stars. It would be five if the recharger was able to hang on the wall like my last Oral B Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought the Oral B Brush with Amazon prime on August 30.  I was familiar with the product I have one already.&lt;br /&gt;I was attracted to buy now by the offer of a $20.00 rebate.  When the brush arrived I followed directions filled out the form and cut&lt;br /&gt;out the indicated section from the box and sent it in.  Quite a time passed and I received a letter from the rebate center stating&lt;br /&gt;I had not fulfilled the requirements of the offer, because I did not send the cut out portion of the box containing the required code.&lt;br /&gt;  That statement simply is not true, I did send the section of the box the first time. The rebate center is in error.&lt;br /&gt;I replied with a letter to that effect and I have waited for response but none has come. Good brush, I&#x27;ll keep it but I feel like I have been had.&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;TIP\\&quot; make a copy of everything you send for a rebate..</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Sonicaire toothbrush. It works about the same but it is cheaper and the replacement heads are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B toothbrush is really great.  The price was good for this wonderful product.  It is light and efficient, too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this toothbrush at all.  It is noisy and hesitates often, pausing for a a few seconds almost every time I use it.  Each time I use it, it requires several hours to fully recharge which thankfully turns the obnoxious flashing recharge light off.  I can&#x27;t imagine why there are so many positive reviews when hardly anything is likeable about this brush.</li>
    <li> I admit, I&#x27;ve been a long-time skeptic of electrical toothbrushes... but I am a convert after trying this gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing with this I feel almost like I visited a Dental Hygienist, without the pain/discomfort that usually follows that visit. The toothbrush does all the work and I get a great clean-feeling mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a pretty basic model, but I don&#x27;t know that I would need more than this ever. It beeps to let you know to move to another section of your mouth, ensuring enough time is spent on each area. The batteries seem to last several days between charging. The brushes are holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you have a little disposable income and care about your hygiene, get an electric toothbrush- your life will improve.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning teeth and gum line.  Really like the rechargeable features that will help prolong the life of the battery and brush, as well as the 30-sec. interval timing indicators.</li>
    <li> For the price this was a very good purchase.  The brush has and maintains an aggressive speed which I believe does a better job of brushing.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an electric toothbrush. Having only used the cheaper ones I didn&#x27;t really know what was so great about this one that it cost a little more but I&#x27;m pleased that I took that chance. the 30s timers help me get an even brushing and the battery blinkers and smart charging mean I don&#x27;t have to think too much about when to charge it.</li>
    <li> pretty much just vibrates, not much spinning action. barely use it. do a lot of research before buying an electric brush.</li>
    <li> It seems to clean pretty effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting this for brushing, BUT I highly HIGHLY suggest getting soft/thin manual tooth brushes as well for proper gum care. You can look up videos for how to properly clean your gums and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this toothbrush after previously using the most basic toothbrush out of Oral-B&#x27;s electric toothbrush line. My mouth feels much cleaner than it did before; could never go back to the old model, let alone a manual toothbrush. The battery life isn&#x27;t as long as with the old toothbrush, but since I don&#x27;t care so much about that, it still gets 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works well, but the recharge lite constantly blinks. It was suppose to stop after recharging and I kept it on the charger for 24hrs and it still blinks.Oh well!</li>
    <li> Has a timer so each mouth quadrant is brushed equally (what my dentist wants).  I replaced a much older version with this one.</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my teeth feel as though I have just had a dental cleaning at the dentist.  It also seems to remove tea and coffee stains from my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is my first electronic toothbrush, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.  I can say however that it&#x27;s unlikely that I will go back to manual brushing.  My teeth feel genuinelly more clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is durable and feels very solid, the attached stand comes with an optional brush holder (Name-brand brushes cost a lot but generics tend to work fine), the battery works fine (I haven&#x27;t tried traveling with it yet)... All in all I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the base price it&#x27;s definitely worth trying out if you&#x27;re thinking about giving a mechanical toothbrush a shot.</li>
    <li> I bought htis for my mom and she is really impressed with this and she like the way it works and she feels very comfortble with this tooth brush, thank you Oral-B</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t die.  Wish it could spin faster, but I guess that&#x27;s done by the more expensive models</li>
    <li> Well built toothbrush.  Has a powerful motor.  Brush heads are easily replaceable.  The induction charger system is great.  Nothing to plug in, just place the toothbrush into the charging base and an LED will signal when the charge is complete.  Can&#x27;t find anything to complain about regarding this excellent product.</li>
    <li> Beware of the rebates on this item. Numerous users are reporting that they are being denied for no upc symbol submitted. I personally had mine denied for this even though I included mine. Oral-B includes a photocopy of everything submitted. What&#x27;s funny is that you can clearly see where they removed the tape on my form that held the upc symbol to make the photocopy. Very shady behavior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this item expecting a rebate. I&#x27;ve done 100&#x27;s in the past and this was my first ever denial. Fake reason to boot.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works great, without breaking the bank. I opted for the extra little case in the charging base for storing spare brush heads, but it turns out that if I don&#x27;t like it, that part detaches easily, and I can use the convenient little charging base without the extra storage case.</li>
    <li> This is a nice electric toothbrush that does a good job of cleaning your teeth. I was disappointed that it was missing the brushes when I received it, but I was able to purchase Oral-B replacement brushes, although they cost more than I thought they would! I liked that they included colored rings to fit on the brushes to allow more than one family member to use the unit and keep track of which brush is theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had the brushes, it took over 12 hours for the unit to charge initially. After that, it has worked fine. It&#x27;s easy to use with clear direction on use of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the convenient storage place for the brushes that is attached to the base. Those with sensitive teeth or gums may prefer the [[ASIN:B008PEMNJY Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Sensitive Gum Care Precision 3000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] that has a lower setting. However, this model is still a good toothbrush that is easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I used an electric toothbrush years ago, but I don&#x27;t remember being very impressed by it.  For the past ten years, I have used only a manual toothbrush and nothing else.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that using this toothbrush not only felt wonderful on my teeth and gums but also left my teeth feeling smooth and my mouth feeling clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get too much into the technicalities of the product, let me talk a little bit about the installation of the toothbrush, if it can be called that.  This Oral-B toothbrush was a breeze to set up and start using!  There wasn&#x27;t much to assemble apart from putting the head onto the electric toothbrush then putting it on top of the base and plugging everything in.  If you can&#x27;t figure something out, there is a very thorough step-by-step guide in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had everything set up and began using the toothbrush, I noticed an immediate difference from my usual hygiene pracice.  After brushing a tooth, it felt so much smoother than usual.  I didn&#x27;t realize how badly my old manual toothbrush had been cleaning my teeth until I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While brushing your teeth, the toothbrush will buzz every thirty seconds to give you an indication of how long you&#x27;ve been brushing and how much longer you should continue to brush for.  The manual mentions using different modes of the toothbrush for whitening or cleaning, but that is not applicable to this model of toothbrush; only one mode exists.  There is a pressure sensor built into the toothbrush that will let you know when you&#x27;re pushing too hard.  That&#x27;s occasionally a problem I have, and it was nice to have a reminder to pull back a little bit on my pressure.  There are other heads that you can purchase for your toothbrush, but I think I&#x27;ll probably keep the one I have for a very long time.  The bristles seem to be sturdy and firm, and I like the way it feels in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts as long as the product description tells you it will: about a week, using it two times per day.  That&#x27;s about a thirty-minute battery.  It takes about the same time (maybe up to an hour) to fully recharge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the only two complaints I have is that the toothbrush isn&#x27;t the best about getting between the teeth.  It gives an awesome cleen to the front and backs of teeth, but a manual toothbrush seems to get between everything better.  Also, regularly, the toothbrush won&#x27;t evenly spread the toothpaste around my mouth.  What I mean is that the glob of toothpaste that I apply to the bristle will end up falling off the toothbrush once I turn it on, instead of lathering my teeth like it&#x27;s supposed to.  I&#x27;m really not sure what causes this, but it happens frequently and is a small nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this toothbrush and use it regularly.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be consistently using a manual toothbrush again for a long time.  I highly recommend trying out this product if you&#x27;re looking for a durable toothbrush that scrubs your teeth well.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I buy. I moved across the ocean and couldn&#x27;t bring my previous one as it was 220v, so I got another one, that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
    <li> I have used a Sonicare rechargeable for the the last 5 years; until it failed to recharge and had to be discarded. This Oral-B is superior for many reasons. The rotating head is more natural and easier to use than the reciprocal head of the Sonicare. The replacement heads are less expensive and there is a good variety to chose from. The rechargeable batteries can be taken out and replaced when they die. I think the effectiveness of teeth cleaning of both products is similar, but for me the better product is the Oral-B.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many Oral-B products in the past and have always been satisfied with them.  The quality of this one, however, was terrible.  Definitely would not recommend this item to anyone.  Will have to look at other manufacturers in the future.</li>
    <li> It comes with an organizer for brush heads.  Unlike Sonicare, Oral-B brush heads are compatible amount different models.  The cost of brush head replacement is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the most expensive electric tooth brush, but this product gets the job done. You feel that dentist clean feeling without spending so much. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> As far as rechargeable toothbrushes go, this is one of the better ones I have used at this price-point.&lt;br /&gt;The brush-heads snap securely to the base, the base has proven to be waterproof to the extent that I have had no issued brushing in the shower, and the simple design makes it practical -even for travel. Good options for various brush-head attachments and does not seem to quickly accumulate that old-toothbrush pasty grunge that we&#x27;ve all come to dislike.&lt;br /&gt;The oscillating brush is an improvement over lower-end brands that merely vibrate. While I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that the brush makes me feel like I just came out of the dentist&#x27;s office, I don&#x27;t think any consumer electric toothbrush manufacturer could make that claim credibly.</li>
    <li> My dentist complimented my oral health after only using this brush for a month. He asked, &amp;#34;Wow, looks like you&#x27;ve really been keeping up on brushing, are you brushing more?&amp;#34; and I said &amp;#34;no,&amp;#34; because I was not brushing more, just using this new toothbrush. I used to have a manual toothbrush, this is my first electric one. I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! Decent price to begin with, but I&#x27;m waiting on a mail-in rebate from the manufacturer, so I&#x27;ll update my review once I receive it...&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive teeth and gums and have no issues using this.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really easy to open. I had the brush put together within minutes of getting the package.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older Oral-B toothbrush with a failing battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this one has indicator lights to let you know the charge state, so you know to recharge it before you&#x27;re half-way through brushing your teeth and the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT like the way they&#x27;ve changed the timer feature.  My old one would pulse after 2 minutes, which was perfect.  This one pulses every 30 seconds, so I have to keep track of how many times it has pulsed.  On the bright side, that does mean I end up brushing a bit longer most days.</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Sonic Care before and I prefer Phillips over Oral-B.  Phillips is also recommended by my dentist.</li>
    <li> I dithered for a while over which electric toothbrush to buy -- wondering if it was worthwhile to spend more on a higher-end brush for features the Precision 1000 doesn&#x27;t have, like multiple speeds and a timer display. Having owned and used the Precision 1000 for two weeks now, I don&#x27;t think those extra features would have been worth the extra cost. The Precision 1000 is all I need in an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does an excellent job of gently cleaning my teeth and gums at its single set speed. I don&#x27;t feel that I need a faster or slower speed. My teeth feel very clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer feature in the handle (it buzzes every 30 seconds, and buzzes longer at 2 minutes) is all I need to keep track of my brushing time. A display would just be redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Higher-end models also tout a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; 3 minute &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; mode, but since this toothbrush doesn&#x27;t turn itself off after 2 minutes, you could just keep brushing for a longer time. (I often do.) After the 2-minute timer goes off, the brush just starts a new 2-minute countdown and keeps going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On brush head size: I have a small mouth (my dentist always complains). While the brush head does seem slightly large, and I have to open my mouth fairly wide to brush the chewing surfaces of my molars, I don&#x27;t have any trouble reaching all my tooth surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pressure sensor and the instant tactile feedback it gives you (the brush will stop pulsating if you are pressing too hard on your teeth). It really helps me brush correctly. I always wore out the bristles on my manual toothbrushes way too fast, and my dentist told me I was brushing too hard and wearing away part of my gum. With this brush, I can avoid doing that because it tells me the instant I press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawbacks of this toothbrush have to do with the battery, and I don&#x27;t think other electric toothbrush models are much different there. The toothbrushships completely uncharged, so you have to charge it before you can use it for the first time. It took almost 24 hours to charge the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery suffers from the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; effect you used to have in cell phone and laptop batteries -- where you have to discharge it completely before recharging it, or else it will lose capacity. It&#x27;s a bit annoying to go through a whole charge cycle once a week, rather than just being able to keep it charged. (It took about 12 hours to charge the second time after being completely discharged. If you brush twice a day, you&#x27;ll need to keep a backup manual brush to use while it charges.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it was a great choice to purchase this model of electric toothbrush. It has features that are useful without being overkill, at a decent price. If you&#x27;d like to step up from a manual toothbrush, I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Love this model of toothbrush.  This is my second one to replace the first set that was several years old.</li>
    <li> Been using it for about a week and could not be happier with its performance. I had an electric toothbrush several years ago, but when it finally stopped working I did not buy another because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money. After several years of using a regular brush and not feeling like I was getting my teeth clean enough, I finally bit the bullet and bought another electric brush. I was originally looking at the Oral B 3000 but after looking at what I was getting for twice the price of this one, I decided I could live with less features. The performance has been great and my teeth feel really clean.</li>
    <li> Unlike lots people have said sonic care is better in reviews, We love oral b much better. Better quality and price. Sonic care is gentle on your gum but simple vibration always makes me feel like my teeth are not clean. takes much longer to clean but we&#x27;ve used 4 years anyway.. We were very skeptical getting Oral b  because of reviews but We are very happy that we both agree it cleans much better and better made as well.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t the most expensive electric tooth brush, but this product gets the job done. You feel that dentist clean feeling without spending so much. I recommend it!</li>
    <li> feel that it must be a returned item each and every time I use it the motor skips after 20 seconds of brushing</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement of the Braun electric toothbrush predecessor.  Reasonable  price was the main reason and the former one she liked.  However, I have to remember that  twice during the 2-yr repair warranty of the now discarded unit, I had to drive to the authorized repair center to have it replaced .  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed that after only 2  1/2 months this one won&#x27;t hold a charge.  Here I go again having to drive about 20 miles for this Braun unit and I ask myself if it&#x27;s worth it.  How long will the replacement last?  R. Clark, Sylvania, Ohio</li>
    <li> Lightweight, doesn&#x27;t seem to have the speed of my old Oral-B.  Brush was pretty stiff.  Keeps a charge a long time.</li>
    <li> It is convenient to use, and very good at cleaning my face. I like it! I will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> Works well and fits into the space I intended for it. My husband and I share the base and each has a place for the brush.</li>
    <li> After much research and comparing a variety of brands, I bought the Oral-B Pro 1000 because it was reviewed favorably (price, performance).  It lacks the bells and whistles that some of the more expensive Electric Toothbrushes have (i.e. UV sanitizer). By the way, the UV sanitizer is a waste of $ (per the ADA).  So again, it came down to price and performance for me.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had considered purchasing several more expensive electric toothbrushes but after reading the reviews decided this would meet my needs.  It exceeds my expectations.  It is so easy to charge and use and does an excellent job.  Requires infrequent charging, no extra bells and whistles but that also appeals to me. I had used an Oral B previously and it lasted probably ten years.  I&#x27;m expecting I will receive the same benefit from this newer purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my second/spare brush. Its very good and has bare minimum features but everything that i need. I had to contact oral b customer support also and happy to know they are very helpful too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked electric toothbrushes even though I am not impaired in any way. This one comes with a great assortment of tips and brushes and seems to be perfect.  I would like it even more if it came with a charger stand that did not include a supplies box attached to the charger so I could put the box away.  Unfortunately, if I remove the box, the charger is less stable standing on the counter.  Not a big deal.. You just need a little more space for it.</li>
    <li> Despite coming in a bulk packing, this product is excellent. Now I think that I never brushed my teeth well. I think my dentist is going to miss me. Come with two different ring&#x27;s color, for me and my wife.</li>
    <li> The wife and got a pair of these we upgraded from a couple of older oralb&#x27;s.Yes they work great their pricey enough for us not to upgrade to the more exspensive oralb&#x27;s with options we wouldnt use.The only negative I have would be the on off button should be a little lower im always reaching for it to turn it off.My wife says it doesnt bother her.But she says the button is a little tough to push but it doesnt bother me so go figure.</li>
    <li> I have use other battery operated toothbrushes but this one exceeded my expectation and surprised me.  It is the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that works well for me. Recommended If you are not sure which electric toothbrush to buy.</li>
    <li> I felt that I really would be needing a new electric toothbrush soon, and at this price was well worth the purchase.  While this is not the top of the line in the series it certainly does a good job.  I may purchase another if they still have the same price.  I might add that I also found a 20.00 rebate coupon online, and because Amazon allows you to use your rewards from American Express and Discover I was also able to use my rewards.  I think I ended up paying less than 15.00 for the product.  I would buy again, may buy another one.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this toothbrush.  Easy to use, 30 second &amp;#34;reminder&amp;#34; pulse is  great feature, and small enough to easily brush the hard-to-reach areas.  I am hoping the rebate issues others have had are not true.  I am giving this 5 stars on the assumption that my rebate is processed in a timely manner without issue, making this a great value.</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as I expected. Great product, I will buy it again when the battery goes out.</li>
    <li> The product is built to last.  So far it has lived up to my expectations for a reasonably priced rechargeable electric toothbrush.  The 30 second timing program has helped me make sure that I am spending enough time on the care of my mouth, which in turns helps with my overall health.</li>
    <li> I would purchase this again. I had a sonicare for years and finally had to replace it a couple of years ago. The second sonicare didn&#x27;t last long before it started making a horrible vibrations that made me toss it. I really like the oral-b -- the only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t keep a charge more than a few weeks. I love the size and timing feature.</li>
    <li> This thing works well! I always feel much cleaner/fresher than I otherwise would feel with a manual brush.  It is completely waterproof as I take mine in the shower with me.  Charging station is attractive and doesn&#x27;t require too much counter space. Unfortunately the charging station always gets a build up of residue where the brush makes contact.  I tried ensuring I rinsed the brush thoroughly but it didn&#x27;t help. It wipes off fine but I would certainly prefer to not have to. Also wish the brush head was a little bigger to hold more tooth paste but neither of these issues are worth docking it a star. Whether or not this is superior to any other electric brush I cannot say because this is my first but I like it!</li>
    <li> Gets teeth even cleaner than my previous sonicare toothbrush! It really is the best. And I love the feature that alerts you that you&#x27;ve been brushing for one minute, two minutes, and so on..</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and I..we love it..everyday it feels as though you had your teeth cleaned by the hygienist!  We didn&#x27;t have one before to compare it to but this is awesome...we especially like the brush..it is round and spins as does the work for you.  It is like they use at the dentist when polishing your teeth.  I was surprised at the price.  Very reasonable for the quality, however the tooth brush replacements are expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent tooth brush.  The battery lasts a long time. The secret to the longevity it to remove the toothbrush after each use and place on the platform. Cleaning each piece off of this will make sure that gunk will not get in, causing malfunction.</li>
    <li> The directions advise to fully kill the battery, and fully charge it twice each year. I&#x27;m doing so. I&#x27;m also following the recommendations to change the replaceable head every 3 months, and to soak the head for a few hours in hydrogen peroxide a couple times each week, for disinfecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor slows down gradually as the battery looses its charge. I love its zip when the battery is freshly charged.</li>
    <li> Better than the $8-10 power brushes- but does not compare to Sonicare! I liked this Oral-B brush until my dentist (and good bud) gave me a Sonicare DiamondClean.. Wow- no going back! Oral-B is good, but if you have both Oral-B and Sonicare, you&#x27;ll never use your Oral-B again.</li>
    <li> I have been using a Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for several years but wanted to try the Oral B to see if I liked it better - I did not.  The Sonicare vibrates and the Oral B moves more in a circular fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both do a good job of cleaning the teeth and removing build-up.  But, I happen to like the feel of the Sonicare better.  I think this is just a personal preference and would have no trouble recommending either product.  Both do a significantly better job than a manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional items that come with an electric toothbrush are important - if you travel, you should make sure you have a case that will keep your brush clean and will keep the button from being pushed while packed - thus my preference is for a hard plastic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life on a full charge may be an important consideration for you if you travel for more than a week at a time and do not plan on taking the charger with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both companies offer a number of models with different features, which may be of importance or may be useless to you personally - so, before you purchase you should think about how and where you will use your toothbrush and what features will be valuable and which will not.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition with the extrasoft bristle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, and it works great so far. I have not used an electric toothbrush before, but the smaller head and it doing the work makes it somewhat difficult to know if all my teeth have been brushed all over. It&#x27;s not the brush, but it does make me think twice.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never felt so clean!</li>
    <li> got it in two days. good battery life, after full charge over night, haven&#x27;t charge for 3 days, used twice a day, about 3-4 min each time. very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only con is it is 110V only, no 220V, so can&#x27;t take with over sea, but for short trip, the battery should hold for few days.</li>
    <li> first product I can remember where you can feel the benefit of it right away, I use it often and can feel the difference good product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel like a professional when I use it.  I don;t even feel healthy.  I don&#x27;t even feel percise.</li>
    <li> Well, with all the hype of the electric \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrush age and myself as a long time user. I have to say for the price, this is unbeatable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrushes do a great job polishing your teeth leaving that smooth feeling, nothing much more. If you brush correctly, a manual brush keeps your oral hygiene well enough. BUT, the powered \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; polishing effect does whiten your teeth much better than a manual brush by loosening the buildup with those 5 digit vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through countless brush handles over the years, both oral-b and philips sonicare. They all suffer from a battery life problem and it is a big hassle to get e replacement battery for these things, people are likely to throw away and at a new one. This oral-b model&#x27;s $ sure makes that not too big of a deal...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU SHOULD NOT STICK YOUR TOOTHBRUSH BACK ON YOUR CHARGING STAND EVERYDAY!!! NEVER DO IT!! Doing it will shorten the battery life by A LOT! Charge ONLY when the battery is low! And DO A FULL CHARGE EVERY TIME! There! Biggest \\&quot;trick\\&quot; you need to know about these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a little more gentle than the other Oral-B brushes with a bit less movements per minute, but I don&#x27;t feel any difference in cleaness and it is nicer sometimes when you are not in the mood for an earthquake in your mouth. I like the Sonicare a bit better only for its bigger brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheaper Sonicare models have a HUGE handle, so they are unwelcoming, but this Oral-B model features a slim handle for the given price. Winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inductive charger is nice and the handle is totally waterproof. You also get a case that holds all your brushheads if you use different once I guess (useless for me...)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on a side note: Oral-B brushheads are usually MUCH cheaper than Sonicare onces at your local shop... or Walmart. or else.....</li>
    <li> This Oral B 1000 Rechageable Electric Toothbrush faster and slim one more useful than the older model.&lt;br /&gt;The chargong flash light did not go even fully charged, I will see and observe in the 2nd charge until then not in a position to say more.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;No hassle\\&quot; packaging box it comes in arrives without \\&quot;proper\\&quot; UPC code and often makes it impossible to get rebates without filing with local BBB of the rebate processing center.</li>
    <li> I had the Oral B Vitality (about $27 these days). The battery is starting to lose its power after four years of recharging. Had a very similar Braun model for four years before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the Precision 1000 was $39, I thought I&#x27;d see what the next model up was like. It seems pretty good. It vibrates faster than the Vitality, which could do some extra cleaning of tartar, but doesn&#x27;t seem to rough up the gums (the Vitality is gentle on the gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One or two reviewers mentioned a smaller brush head. The brush head is actually bigger than the ones I&#x27;ve seen from Oral B. I may switch to what I consider the more standard size. The on/off switch is a little smaller and more difficult to use than the Vitality. Overall, seems like a good toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think electric toothbrushes prolong gum life, when compared to regular toothbrushes -- that&#x27;s my take -- $10/year for an electric tooth brush is money well spent.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a Philips Sonicare.  On a comparison,  I like the Sonicare better,  but I don&#x27;t like having to pay $26-27 for a new head,  that is crazy.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B does a good job cleaning my teeth and the replacement heads are a lot more reasonable.  I do,  however, find the brushing timers a bit annoying and I wish there was a way to turn those off.</li>
    <li> I like the Oral-B tooth brush a lots, but I think it was very costly.  I bought it anyway, because my teeth are more of value to me than the money.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my older version , I received it very quick , could not be happier with it thanks</li>
    <li> My old Oral B was better (and lasted forever). The battery either takes forever to recharge or the indicator light is faulty. I did appreciate the suggestion to unplug for several days after charging; the charge lasts about 10 days.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Much better than my old one.  Hope it lasts as long.  Too bad the brush heads are soooo expensive.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I bought one for my wife...Love the way it handles and the feel of my teeth when I am done.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Oral B brushes over the past 10 years and this is every bit as good as any I&#x27;ve owned. I especially like the brush head holder built into the base. What I don&#x27;t like is the residue that builds up at the charging pedestal but I&#x27;ve found that if you rinse really well and wipe it off on a towel before returning it to the charge station that rarely happens.</li>
