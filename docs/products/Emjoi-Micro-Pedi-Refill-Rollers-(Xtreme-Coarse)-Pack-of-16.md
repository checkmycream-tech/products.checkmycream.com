<li> but if you&#x27;re squeamish about sanding your feet, you may need to get one of the less coarse options.</li>
<li> Product works as expected.  </li>
<li> They work, they&#x27;re just not quite as coarse, they wear out faster, and they have a tendency to stop spinning if I press down too hard.</li>
<li> Expensive unfortunately, but they do the job well.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Product works as expected.  Supplier quickly satisfied my order.  Best price.</li>
    <li> Work wonders on my husband&#x27;s heels.  I love the emjoi.  I have the electric one and we use it a great deal.</li>
    <li> These are much more abrasive than the blu ones that came with my Emjoi. Now it&#x27;s so much easier to do my husband&#x27;s feet!!! I&#x27;m super impressed!</li>
    <li> Works good, heels are soft.</li>
    <li> fast shipping great deal works like a charm</li>
    <li> These are amazing! They are the coarsest rollers I&#x27;ve found yet and they work perfectly in my Emjoi. They don&#x27;t wear out too fast and, when they seem to get low on grittiness, I just brush them with an old toothbrush under running water and I get a few more uses out of them. I&#x27;ve tried the extra coarse, super coarse, and these xtreme coarse rollers and these are, by far, the best. The blue ones work well too but I can definitely tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note on brand: The ones I reviewed come from Gisselle Beauty. I have also tried the ones from the The Pedi Store and I do not like them as well. They work, they&#x27;re just not quite as coarse, they wear out faster, and they have a tendency to stop spinning if I press down too hard.</li>
    <li> I am so confused by all the colors and descriptions - I thought these would be really effective based on description and reviews but they seem to wear out way faster than the original basic one that came with my thing. I thought it was the batteries, but replacing those didn&#x27;t help much either. If you get one of these definitely get the plug in one.</li>
    <li> The rollers don&#x27;t last long. I get about 3 five min. uses for each roller and am going back to a manual device that uses a sheet rock sanding screen that lasts for months and then can be turned over for a few more months use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s described as the EXTEME COARSE but in fact it is not any different than the blue.  I&#x27;m very disappointed. and I bought so many thinking this would be it for me.</li>
    <li> I think these are probably just as good as Emjoi&#x27;s refills. They work fine for us.</li>
    <li> Best pricing anywhere on refill rollers for Emjoi.  These fit in all varieties of Emjoi Micro-Pedi products.  High quality micro mineral rollers are available in varying degrees of coarseness.  Quality is as good or better than the original rollers that came with my Micro-Pedi.  I will continue to order!</li>
    <li> Works Wonderfully... Thank you so much AAAA++++ :)</li>
    <li> The Emjoi Xreme coarse fills the bill.  They work great and my wife loves them. They arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these refills if you own the Enjoy Micro-Pedi!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Delivered very fast. Would purchase again. Easy transaction thank you.</li>
    <li> These arrived quickly and work really well.  Much better price than the original brand.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as stated; in a very timely manner. I am pleased.</li>
    <li> Expensive unfortunately, but they do the job well.</li>
    <li> These seem to be as good as the emoji brand for less $$$.</li>
    <li> These are the BEST coarseness for my feet but if you&#x27;re squeamish about sanding your feet, you may need to get one of the less coarse options.</li>
    <li> Item was as stated in add, would buy from this shell again.</li>
    <li> This level of course roller is nothing to be scared of.  It really helps with my dry feet.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all...it keeps rotating. but never be able to get debris off...go for the original rollers even though they are a little bit more expensive, this is a waste of money...no stars if possible</li>
