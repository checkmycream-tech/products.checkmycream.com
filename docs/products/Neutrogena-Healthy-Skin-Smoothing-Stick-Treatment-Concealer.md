      <li>What can we more say about Neutrogena?</li>
      <li>i definitely love this concealer</li>
      <li>This is an oil free formula, non-comedogenic and perfect for sensitive skin prone to break outs.</li>
      <li>BUT IT COMES OFF AWFULLY EASY.</li>
      <li>not quite the right shade, but covers up spider veins pretty good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on the darker side of light complected, and I&#x27;ve had to use medium.</li>
      <li>One problem I have with it is that medium, the darkest color, is really light.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item online because it is no longer available in stores.</li>
      <li>But if I get any more tan this summer, I&#x27;ll have to go back to my good buddy Bobbi.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, color wasn&#x27;t an exact match</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s special about it, but I do like this brand for cosmetics.</li>
      <li>Overall, I had a good experience.</li>
      <li>I think I am pretty light but the medium color is lighter than I need it to be.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays reasonably well through the workday (could be touched up for evening).  </li>
      <li>This one goes on smoother, is easier to work with, and looks more natural.</li>
      <li>The only gripe I have is: I&#x27;ve only seen it in is fair, light, and medium.</li>
      <li>that are easier to apply and are not so obvious, but again, if you love it, snap it up.</li>
      <li>natural color, smooth texture</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a truly luxurious feel to it, and when I first smoothed it on, I almost dropped it</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this when I was looking for something that went well with the skin enhancer of the same brand (love it, btw).</li>
      <li>but oh well, most of my red marks on my arms are gone now anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have tried many different kinds and this is the one that passes all tests.</li>
      <li>: Covers very well; My skin is acne-prone, but this product does not break me out;</li>
      <li>now they sell out fast</li>
      <li>It blends very well</li>
      <li>love how I could even smear a little of this on, and it&#x27;s got a sheer, creamy texture that&#x27;s easy to smooth all over, and could easily sheer out to cover a large area.</li>
      <li>and I find other concealers better at coverage.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t look very smooth in the undereye area, and is better for covering blemishes.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is the only coverup that precisely matches my skin tone; others I have found are too orange or yellow.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive and covers dark circles very well.</li>
      <li>It was completely off the bottom piece and could not be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up in the trash.</li>
      <li>They know how to make products for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have some sun damage, so I have to use a little concealer every day, and it gets used up quickly.  </li>
      <li>I needed just a little \\&quot;something\\&quot; to smooth under my eyes before putting on a sheer, dewy foundation.</li>
      <li>The outside package was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;However when I took off the clear concealer cap of the product itself,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> natural color, smooth texture</li>
    <li> This is the best of its kind that I have ever used.  This particular shade matches my complexion beautifully - but for some reason I&#x27;m unable to find it in stores anymore.  I was overjoyed to be able to purchase it on Amazon.com</li>
    <li> The Amazon Subscription price for this item is much better than the best price in any of the stores in our area.  It is a great stick.  I have some sun damage, so I have to use a little concealer every day, and it gets used up quickly.  This way, I can keep replacing it!  I love Neutrogena, and I love Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is a concealer. It works like any other in the market, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything in particular that&#x27;s special about it, but I do like this brand for cosmetics. It blends good with your BB or foundation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best with acne so I tend to just use my foundation for that. One problem I have with it is that medium, the darkest color, is really light. I think I am pretty light but the medium color is lighter than I need it to be.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, color wasn&#x27;t an exact match but oh well, most of my red marks on my arms are gone now anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William G.&lt;br /&gt;Nashville, TN.</li>
    <li> Great product and price.  Quick and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Overall, I had a good experience. I received the product by the expected arrival date. I purchased this item online because it is no longer available in stores. It is the only concealer that works with my skin color and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The only problem I had was the tracking number was never posted online.</li>
    <li> works great priced ok</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this when I was looking for something that went well with the skin enhancer of the same brand (love it, btw). I needed just a little \\&quot;something\\&quot; to smooth under my eyes before putting on a sheer, dewy foundation. And I love this stick.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been a fan of cream-to-powder, or stick foundations, and this could almost be in that same category. It&#x27;s got a truly luxurious feel to it, and when I first smoothed it on, I almost dropped it, I was so impressed. I&#x27;ve been using Bobbi Brown Corrector forever, and this is creamier and easier to blend than that!&lt;br /&gt;I love how I could even smear a little of this on, and it&#x27;s got a sheer, creamy texture that&#x27;s easy to smooth all over, and could easily sheer out to cover a large area. You could even use it as a foundation stick with a little bit of powder to set it!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with it. The only gripe I have is: I&#x27;ve only seen it in is fair, light, and medium. I&#x27;m on the darker side of light complected, and I&#x27;ve had to use medium. But if I get any more tan this summer, I&#x27;ll have to go back to my good buddy Bobbi. Good thing Neutrogena foundations have SPF! ;)</li>
    <li> I DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT NEEDS TO DRY OR WHAT, BUT IT COMES OFF AWFULLY EASY.</li>
    <li> Love this concealer, not happy that its so difficult to find. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve used.  and easy too!</li>
    <li> Pros: Covers very well; My skin is acne-prone, but this product does not break me out; Great value for the product! Cons: Wears off by end of the day, but it is probably due to my oily skin. This is a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> The outside package was not damaged.&lt;br /&gt;However when I took off the clear concealer cap of the product itself,&lt;br /&gt;the concealer remained inside the cap.It was completely off the bottom piece and could not be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up in the trash.I only ordered one thank goodness.A Waste of money never a good thing.</li>
    <li> Great concealer. Thought it would be too like for my skin tone but it blends great with my foundation</li>
    <li> Get my today and I&#x27;m very happy</li>
    <li> Very good for sensitive skin/eyes.  This formula has no fragrance and is hypoallergenic, so it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes the way some cosmetics do.  It goes on smoothly and stays reasonably well through the workday (could be touched up for evening).  It&#x27;s not expensive and covers dark circles very well.</li>
    <li> What can we more say about Neutrogena? They just have it figured out. They know how to make products for sensitive skin and they know how to make them well. This is an oil free formula, non-comedogenic and perfect for sensitive skin prone to break outs. This won&#x27;t clog your pores. I have tried many different kinds and this is the one that passes all tests. I use it also as a canceler for my upper eyelids and/or eye circles. It blends very well so I never look tired.</li>
    <li> Mom uses this to cover up marks on her face but it is a thick product, requiring some finesse to apply and blend.  At 92, she dabs it on and it&#x27;s a very obvious cover-up.  Nevertheless, she love love loves it and it&#x27;s out of production now, so I buy it when I find it as it&#x27;s the only product she will use.  There are better products out there now that are easier to apply and are not so obvious, but again, if you love it, snap it up. It won&#x27;t be around long.</li>
    <li> This is the only coverup that precisely matches my skin tone; others I have found are too orange or yellow. I wish they carried these in my local drug stores. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t look very smooth in the undereye area, and is better for covering blemishes.</li>
    <li> i definitely love this concealer it is great, and i received on time and the package was really protected so i got my stick treament with no problems and intact :D</li>
    <li> You are saving about $2-3 per stick by buying online. The product works well if you like this kind of coverup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used concealer for some time and I find other concealers better at coverage. When blending this one will tend to disappear. Also the square packaging is more obvious and inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now count on my subscription to guarantee I have this product every three months.  It&#x27;s so hard to find at my local retail stores now they sell out fast plus it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> Ooh! This concealer is awesome! Just great! I am a dark skinned African-American  woman and I usually buy a different concealer that costs 3× as much. This one goes on smoother, is easier to work with, and looks more natural. I&#x27;m  ordering 10 next month thru the Subscribe and Save program before the price goes up.</li>
    <li> Love Neutrogena cosmetics.</li>
    <li> not quite the right shade, but covers up spider veins pretty good.</li>
</ol>
