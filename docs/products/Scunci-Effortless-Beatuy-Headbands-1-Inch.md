      <li>They are fairly flexible</li>
      <li>These are really good.</li>

      <li>Love these headbands.</li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>I love this headband.</li>
      <li>If that&#x27;s the style you&#x27;re going for, great, but I was going to use them for craft projects and they aren&#x27;t really going to work for that.  </li>
      <li>They do seem rather flexible, more so than most plastic headbands I have played with, so bear that in mind.</li>
      <li>Love these headbands.</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>I used to by this product at Kmart all the time, but since most are closing around my area, I&#x27;ve had to look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention when I was looking at the photo on here before I bought them.  </li>
      <li>My favorite toothed headbands so far.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt and keeps your hair out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I have to keep buying more.</li>
      <li>but these are the next best thing for those weeks between hair cuts.</li>
      <li>I expect more from scunci.</li>
      <li>Seems to work OK.</li>
      <li>But boy am I glad I did.</li>
      <li>I only wished they came in more colors!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, great price.</li>
      <li>I like to keep my hair out of my face with headbands, but these would get tangled or stuck in my hair too easily.</li>
      <li>hair is fine, curly and chin length.</li>
      <li>Also seems a bit flimsy and easy to break, but so far so good.</li>
      <li>These do not hold my flyaways back, I use these for work as a waitress and the are so rigid the they don&#x27;t conform to my head, was hoping for a great solution to frazzled hair but this not it.</li>
      <li>These will fit with any color outfit and blend in with my hair color.</li>
      <li>they are so damn cheap - DO NOT BUY these.</li>
      <li>but after wearing it a few times it stretches and fits perfectly.</li>
      <li>they just don&#x27;t fit.</li>
      <li>They grip the hair and hold it securely in place.</li>
      <li>I bought these as an addon just so I could get to the 25 mark for free shipping.</li>
      <li>They are made of some cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>Arrived in secure packaging.</li>
      <li>A rare steal!</li>
      <li>I was really excited but had to buy multiples because they were an &amp;#34;add</li>
      <li>So worth it!</li>
      <li>and they dont seem to fit my head right.</li>
      <li>However, they break pretty easily.</li>
      <li>I have a small head and fine hair, this product works great for me and NO headaches.</li>
      <li>Does everything that I needed in a headband and the price is great compare to previous headbands I purchased.</li>
      <li>The black and brown are great for coordinating with my clothes and glasses.</li>
      <li>They do break really easily, but I&#x27;ve yet to find another headband I like to wear as much.</li>
      <li>The teeth keep it in place which is great, but when i take it off, thats when the mess happens.</li>
      <li>These are comfortable and hold my hair very well.</li>
      <li>i feel comfortable and it can hold my hair very well.</li>
      <li>REALLY CAUSED A HUGE TANGLE TOOK HOURS TO GET OUT OF.  </li>
      <li>This one is my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>I love how the teeth hold my hair back comfortably.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
      <li>This creates a soft, natural hairline and still has good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>are the only kind that stays in until I decide to take them out.</li>
      <li>The thing I am not crazy about is the shape of them.</li>
      <li>the brown one broke right away.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the money, I have a pretty normal sized/shaped head and when I put this on there are large gaps at the top.</li>
      <li>These are okay in looks and they are sturdy but they pull my hair out if I am not careful when I remove them.  </li>
      <li>I tried numerous ways to try and get these to work (but really, how many ways are there to use headbands?!), and just did not have any luck.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for wanting me to come back for more, Amazon!</li>
      <li>I have very fine, slippery hair and can never get headbands to actually stay put.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use them because they are the only headbands that will hold my very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Inexpensive plastic, that work great for what I need them for which is holding back the hair from my face when applying a facial mask.</li>
      <li>Sadly, I&#x27;ll never purchase these again, even though I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Scunci products.</li>
      <li>Rather than damaged during delivery, it was a defective product in the first place.</li>
      <li>Def will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a comb that holds your hair back.</li>
      <li>I use this headband both ways, but my favorite is the second way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
      <li>They do not fit correctly and do not look good on me.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Good for everyday use!</li>
      <li>That may be a good thing if your head is larger as they&#x27;re not as likely to exert as much pressure.</li>
      <li>They break easily but for the price I get enough out of them.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t say for certain though</li>
      <li>It fits a bit too loose for me but better than the metal ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I always have a hard time finding headbands that really hold my daughter&#x27;s hair - these look good and work well.</li>
      <li>I really like these.</li>
      <li>My sister wants to steal them, so there is an endorsement from a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even with straight hair if I put it on with the teeth facing front</li>
      <li>These are made of very rigid plastic</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very flattering.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if my hair is curly or straight</li>
      <li>It works very well</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Idk I really like it.</li>
      <li>I gently opened the package and</li>
      <li>If one had curly  hair they might pull too much coming off, as they do grab the hair.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted these to work</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;ve been told my whole life I have a gigantic head.</li>
      <li>They really hold my hair where I want it to be.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Inexpensive plastic, that work great for what I need them for which is holding back the hair from my face when applying a facial mask.</li>
    <li> Arrived in secure packaging. The quality of the hair bands exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve been using them everyday for over 2 weeks and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I only wished they came in more colors!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, great price. A rare steal!</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding headbands that really hold my daughter&#x27;s hair - these look good and work well.</li>
    <li> It is pleasant, but at me is Scunci is made as the bent comb - she better than this. In the given product it is convenient, but it is heavy to get from it(her) the hair.</li>
    <li> The style is the best that I&#x27;ve found! The teeth on the headband can be used two different ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First option, you can push the teeth in at the hairline and pull back. This creates a firm hold and a smooth hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second option, place the headband slightly behind the hairline. Wiggle/push back the headband to grip the hair. This creates a soft, natural hairline and still has good hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, curly and chin length. I use this headband both ways, but my favorite is the second way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> They really hold my hair where I want it to be.</li>
    <li> These were great at first but then the comb pieces started to break, but for the few wears I got out of them I did like.</li>
    <li> I really wanted these to work but they are bent so close that the picks on the band dig into my scalp.  I even tried to wear them back a little further but they dig in behind my ears.  Just not for me.</li>
    <li> I always have little wisps escaping from other headbands.  These are the only ones that hold all the hair back without having to use hairspray.  I have a big head and the bands do hurt at first, so before using them I put them over my ears when my hair is wet and use the hair dryer on the band.  This seems to loosen them up.</li>
    <li> Although these headbands seem like they work fine with most hair, I was expecting a larger base - the teeth are about an inch long, but the solid part is quite thin, only about 1 cm wide. If that&#x27;s the style you&#x27;re going for, great, but I was going to use them for craft projects and they aren&#x27;t really going to work for that.  They do seem rather flexible, more so than most plastic headbands I have played with, so bear that in mind. That may be a good thing if your head is larger as they&#x27;re not as likely to exert as much pressure. I couldn&#x27;t say for certain though, I am not using them for long-term wear.</li>
    <li> I used to by this product at Kmart all the time, but since most are closing around my area, I&#x27;ve had to look elsewhere. Walmart, Target, Sears, none of them had what I wanted, and I became flustered. I just happened to run across hair accessories on Amazon and took a change.. and there it was! They deserved 5 stars just for having it! I&#x27;ve had help when I was at checkout, and the person was wonderful in every way! Thanks for wanting me to come back for more, Amazon!</li>
    <li> These head bands are to big and awkward to use. Now I&#x27;ve been told my whole life I have a gigantic head. These are to big for my big head. It doesn&#x27;t matter if my hair is curly or straight they just don&#x27;t fit. I have thick hair, a big head, and these things were still to big.</li>
    <li> Brain surgery years ago has left very tender spots.  Is there a softer, yet as reliable, headband that does not require a strap that goes around the back of the head?.  if not for the tender spots, these are great.  They grip the hair and hold it securely in place.</li>
    <li> Seems to work OK. The &amp;#34;ends&amp;#34; are much too long, so I had to cut off about 1/2 an inch. Also seems a bit flimsy and easy to break, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my 6 year old daughter that has issues with other headbands slipping or sliding out of her hair throughout the day.</li>
    <li> These are okay in looks and they are sturdy but they pull my hair out if I am not careful when I remove them.  My hair is not even shoulder length and once I got so tangled in one of these bands that my husband had to help me.  I thought I was going to need the scissors....  I would not buy them again.  Choose something without &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These are just what you see.  They have a comb on the inside of them, so they will hold all your hair back, and in place.  The thing I am not crazy about is the shape of them. I should have paid more attention when I was looking at the photo on here before I bought them.  They look really round and they dont seem to fit my head right.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I use them when I am working around the house or outdoors to keep my hair away from my face.</li>
    <li> Not sure it will last. Makes strange creaky noises sometimes when I put it on. It fits a bit too loose for me but better than the metal ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Came in broken, bad packaging</li>
    <li> These are made of very rigid plastic so they don&#x27;t conform to your head.  They also have deep combs which need thick hair to work properly.  I threw them away.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased these ...big mistake. The first time I purchased them, the headband snapped in half the second time I put it on. Thinking that it had been damaged in shipping (it came in an envelope, not a box) I got another set. This time, one lasted about a month and the next lasted 2 weeks. Both broke for no reason, just snapped as they are made of a cheap plastic that has little give and are brittle. As I was aware of this, I was very careful with them so there was no reason for them to break. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get these, unless you have a small head and not a lot of hair! Poor quality!</li>
    <li> I bought a similar one as this headband locally at a store, and was hoping these would be the same. Not quite. The tines break, the earpieces are too long. Not my favs, but that&#x27;s part of ordering sight unseen.</li>
    <li> One of the tooth of the headband was missing and the missing part wasn&#x27;t even found in the packaging. Rather than damaged during delivery, it was a defective product in the first place.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and often have problems with headbands not staying in place.  The teeth hold these headbands well in my hair.  They are fairly flexible so I think would fit various head sizes.  Teeth can get caught in your hair, especially if it is wavy or curly, but you can carefully pull your hair through without breakage or discomfort.</li>
    <li> Have used these headbands for years, but presently unable to purchase them locally.  When I found them on Amazon I was really excited but had to buy multiples because they were an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item which was a little frustrating.  I find the quality to be a little less than ones I have had in the past as they stretch out more easily.  I will continue to use them because they are the only headbands that will hold my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> These do not hold my flyaways back, I use these for work as a waitress and the are so rigid the they don&#x27;t conform to my head, was hoping for a great solution to frazzled hair but this not it.</li>
    <li> Better for children or adults with really small heads. The base squeezes behind the ears, and is annoying. The &#x27;teeth&#x27; really do not grip IN the hair. It&#x27;s functional for short times, like pulling your hair back when you are in the tub or washing your face.</li>
    <li> Broke one within the second day of wearing it.</li>
    <li> Hard plastic not flexible. They hurt after an hour or 2.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothed headbands so far.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt and keeps your hair out of your face.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the money, I have a pretty normal sized/shaped head and when I put this on there are large gaps at the top.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that is VERY straight and these hard to find headbands are the only kind that stays in until I decide to take them out. They have the added benefit of creating a SMALL lift to the hair behind the headband - not enough to be a bump or make you look like Snooki but enough to give the appearance that your hair has a little more volume. The black and brown are great for coordinating with my clothes and glasses.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, slippery hair and can never get headbands to actually stay put. Fabric ones, stretchy ones, hard plastic ones all fall out after a short time. These, however, do the job.  They stay in so well that they can be tricky to remove since hair gets caught in the little teeth. It&#x27;s worth it, though.</li>
    <li> Scunnci headbands - These are stiff and hurt my head.  They do not fit correctly and do not look good on me.</li>
    <li> I love how the teeth hold my hair back comfortably. They do break really easily, but I&#x27;ve yet to find another headband I like to wear as much.</li>
    <li> I have looked everywhere for these headbands. They were not the same ones I was trying to replace. The stretched out too quickly</li>
    <li> Tangles in hair, difficult to take off.</li>
    <li> I like to keep my hair out of my face with headbands, but these would get tangled or stuck in my hair too easily. The teeth keep it in place which is great, but when i take it off, thats when the mess happens. Not sure if its just my hair type, or if the teeth work too well? NOT FOR ME</li>
    <li> I bought these as an addon just so I could get to the 25 mark for free shipping. But boy am I glad I did. I usually have a hard time getting headbands to stay in my hair they just always fall out. But these work great. So worth it!</li>
    <li> Awesome! It pulls your back gently and stays in place. I have long curly hair and it&#x27;s very flattering. Def will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this headband. It holds all my hair up and the ends are not long enough to pinch your skin behind the ears. I usually wear this on the go with little time for a hairdo and to wash my face. Does everything that I needed in a headband and the price is great compare to previous headbands I purchased. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> I am pretty happy with these headbands. They hold my hair back really well because of the little teeth they have. They do cause me though to get a dull pain behind my ear which I notice certain headbands seem to cause after a few hours and they are also delicate and can tell that they could easily crack if even accidentally bent in the wrong direction.</li>
    <li> One of them broke in half very easily.</li>
    <li> These are the only bands that I can find that can hold my thick hair back without giving me those weird sprinklers of hair at the teeth. However, they break pretty easily. I have to keep buying more. I am trying to find a better one but its the best I can find for now.</li>
    <li> use daily.  couldnt find anywhere else.  great product</li>
    <li> Nothing seems to hold my hair just where I want it except a pair of sunglasses. Lol but these are the next best thing for those weeks between hair cuts.</li>
    <li> I now wear my hair natural so I pull it back at lot. These will fit with any color outfit and blend in with my hair color. They aren&#x27;t too tight and you can adjust them for your comfort level.</li>
    <li> Junk. Both of them broke within one day. They are made of some cheap plastic. I expect more from scunci.</li>
    <li> REALLY CAUSED A HUGE TANGLE TOOK HOURS TO GET OUT OF.  I&#x27;D SAY AVOID THEM IF YOU HAVE MEDIUM TO THICK HAIR.</li>
    <li> I have a small head and fine hair, this product works great for me and NO headaches.</li>
    <li> These are really good. Even with straight hair if I put it on with the teeth facing front it stays and holds my hair in place. I really like these. The ends are tight behind my ears but can be moved back.</li>
    <li> Love these headbands.</li>
    <li> These are comfortable and hold my hair very well. They break easily but for the price I get enough out of them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a boy. I wear headbands after waking up and stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of them. This one is my favorite so far. There are no points sticking out in this headband that will penetrate your scalp. It&#x27;s more like a comb that holds your hair back. Idk I really like it.</li>
    <li> can not believe i paid for this !!! One came broken - right out of the package and its just a matter of time for the other one to break bc they are so damn cheap - DO NOT BUY these. junk.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and the product was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> it is ver bulky to begin with. The picture is quite deceptive. And once you slide it into your hair, there is absolutely no way to slide it back out without making your hair look like a bird&#x27;s nest. I haven&#x27;t had issues with breakage but I have stopped using them.</li>
    <li> I Love these headbands and so does my daughter! Definately a good buy! Good for everyday use! I totally Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for these headbands, but upon first use, these were tangled and pulling my hair in very uncomfortable ways.  I use lots of headbands given the length and thickness of my hair, but I will never purchase these again.  I tried numerous ways to try and get these to work (but really, how many ways are there to use headbands?!), and just did not have any luck.  Sadly, I&#x27;ll never purchase these again, even though I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Scunci products.</li>
    <li> I tried this style headband but I got headaches. Some other reviews said this was a comfortable style, maybe for them, not me. Donated to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> These are the best headbands I&#x27;ve come across. As a dude, I mainly use this to keep hair of my face when I&#x27;m lounging or washing my face. These do a better job than other ones I&#x27;ve used and don&#x27;t pull my hair when I take them off. My sister wants to steal them, so there is an endorsement from a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with them is they tend to stretch out. I have a massive noggin amplified by an abundance of hair though so it&#x27;s not their fault. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fit tight on my head.</li>
    <li> hurts my temples badly and tangles with the hair every time while removing it and really heavy too. Never missess to give you a headache.</li>
    <li> After living the way these grip and hold your hair I had one went to put it on my head and it broke right in the middle so I&#x27;m being extra careful with the last one not to pull on the sides just slide in your hair.</li>
    <li> The product was fine but too flimsy for my long this hair it didn&#x27;t support the weight.</li>
    <li> Ends are too long and dig into the scalp.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;graspers&amp;#34; stick out thru the hair. . .these are terrible.</li>
    <li> What can I say about headbands? They&#x27;re good, they work well and hold the hair well. My kids like them.</li>
    <li> It works very well and i love it. i feel comfortable and it can hold my hair very well. i will recommend to my fir</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but they seem  sturdier than the other inexpensive ones I have bought.  The tines are close together and they stay in place well.  They are simple and,  like most inexpensive ones, do not adjust, I have a  roundish face and  probably a medium size adult head and it fits me fine, tight enough to feel but not pinch.  If one had curly  hair they might pull too much coming off, as they do grab the hair.  I have thick  but straight hair, so a little tug is all I need.  The other plastic headbands I have come out easier,  as the tines are wider apart, but this stays in much better.</li>
    <li> This is the only headband that holds my short bangs back when I don&#x27;t feel like styling my hair that day.  It fits a little snug on the head the first couple times wearing it but after wearing it a few times it stretches and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love these headbands. These are the only ones I find that can stay in without slipping.</li>
    <li> A little fragile. I gently opened the package and the brown one broke right away. I still have the black one that I use frequently, but it does hurt my head/behind my ears and I have to adjust after a little bit.</li>
