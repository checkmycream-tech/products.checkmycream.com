    <li> OMG, I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for about 50 years and a week does not go by when  a female says that I always smell so great.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Good product but they should put it in a spray bottle or a cap that would restrict the flow.</li>
    <li> Great cologne and even better price</li>
    <li> Recived order in good time, but, when I opened the package I found that after open the bottle the was no, I repeat no fragrance at all!!!!! I got nothing but colored lite yellow Fluid of some sort.This was a very bad experience!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Been wearing this brand for almost 30 years now... my sister used to buy for me for my birthday each year. However, since she has since passed away, I am continuing to purchase PS. In fact, i considered changing my cologne a few years back -- went into one of those &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; stores at the local outlet mall. After &amp;#34;trying on&amp;#34; many different scents, my family agreed that PS was &amp;#34;Dad&#x27;s cologne&amp;#34; -- what more can I say!</li>
    <li> Gift to my husband. It is our scent. Do I really have to say more. WE LOVE IT!! LOVE LOVE IT!</li>

    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  He gets compliments often on how good he smells.  The price at amazon.com was far better than the price where I normally buy it.</li>
    <li> we reorder when my husband just about out</li>
    <li> Came before I expected packed perfectly. I DO pay attention to reviews about the seller. Everything was perfect and I got everything that was written about it. Next year I plan to do Amazon for all my Christmas shopping! I hate to even get out that time of year. I love to know exactly what I am getting. I do think people need to be more honest about the product they are selling. One thing that really gets me angry when people false advertice and I have to send items back which has happened to me 3 times. But, I research the item I need and ask questions before I order.</li>
