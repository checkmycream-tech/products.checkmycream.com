<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is very durable sunscreen.  Nothing gets thru this as it doesn&#x27;t wash off easily at all!  Great for already burned or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> bought for use this summer, 4th summer on Bullfrog</li>
    <li> It sounds weird, but this is the only SPF that my daughter can have on her skin. Ever since she was a little girl half her face would be red from irritation and the other side would remain normal. It was weird, but I believe it is because her father has the sensitive skin and I have the normal tan skin, so half and half on her face. We buy this and use it often on our daughter, plus it has protection from the skin and allows her to still get some what of a tan. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone to try. It lasts a long time on the skin and of course, our daughter has yet to burn or break out from it.</li>
    <li> Very good protection. Used when sailing and now golf. Hard to find in drug stores. non-greasy</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this sunscreen out west and could not find it in the stores in the northeast. Thank goodness for Amazon as this is one of the best sunscreens I have used. Easy to apply, dries quickly without the heavy feel of most sunscreens and gives excellent protection. It also does not have any heavy perfumes that many oth sunscreens contain so it is perfect for those sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreens are so important but only work when you don&#x27;t mind using them. For that reason I give this product five stars!</li>
    <li> My kids are picky about sunscreens. they hate the feel and smell.&lt;br /&gt;They not only tolerate Bull Frog but one application and they are covered during summer camp even after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;This is great as they forget to reapply on their own.</li>
    <li> I liked this product alot, but found that I went through the bottle much faster than its none-gel counterpart. Will get this again for when I go walking or hiking, but not for when I go on vacation when I am in the sun all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of sunblock and only Bull Frog Water Armor has kept me from burning while out on the jet ski. It goes on quickly and dries fast. I&#x27;ve never had to apply it more than once, and have spent many hours out on and in the water. My only complaint is the size of the bottle - it needs to be larger because you will go through this rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Over ten years ago, on our first family trip to the Florida Keys - in blazing summer, our pasty Minnesota family was advised by the locals to use Bullfrog Quick Gel sunscreen. We were told,\\&quot;It&#x27;s the only sunscreen that works down here.\\&quot;  So we did. And were we glad! Any time we skimped and used another sunscreen one of us would burn. But every time we used Bullfrog Quick gel, we would last all day on the beach and in the water without burning. If we burned, it was due to our own negligence to reapply after swimming.  We like how easily it goes on the skin, and the alcohol makes it quickly \\&quot;dry\\&quot; without that lotion-y feel.  Our group had teens with acne, and this was also the only sunscreen that did not exacerbate acne.  We swear by this stuff! It&#x27;s the only sunscreen we use - even in pasty Minnesota (which is rarely)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013 update: We just enjoyed another 11 days of blazing summer sun on the Gulf side of Florida, thanks to Bullfrog Quick Gel! We spent 5 hours each day on the beach with no shade, and seldom reapplied. Some days we felt \\&quot;over-toasted\\&quot;, but no burns where Bullfrog was applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use estimate: An average adult can get around 10 full-body applications per bottle (for us that&#x27;s 10-days&#x27; worth). Far better coverage for the money and far better coverage than the spray bottles!&lt;br /&gt;We will use no other sunscreen EVER!</li>
    <li> This, along with its &amp;#34;Quick Spray&amp;#34; version, have been the only sunscreens I have used for about the last 10 years.  I am a bicyclist whose rides frequently last 6-8 hours.  No burns, even with no additional application.</li>
    <li> This is a great sunscreen. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is a clear gel that does not leave the white residue of other sunscreens.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few sunscreens that I can actualy stand the smell of.  I&#x27;ve had sunscreens that work well, but after applying them, the smell made me wish I would have never even tried.  Waterproof, and not too sticky, I use this product almost exclusively.  I don&#x27;t recomend it for your face though.  It has a tendency to &amp;#34;creep&amp;#34; and it tastes terrible.</li>
    <li> It works great. I only use it for my arms, feet, and legs. It is quickly absorbed. It dries instantly. I don&#x27;t go out everyday though. It does prevent sunburn.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is shiny when it goes on and is kinda thick and goopy.  It is also the only sunblock I&#x27;ve found (Ive tried neutrogena, Banana Boat and Coppertone) that works a full 12 hours in the summer through sweat and a day of fishing.  I&#x27;m willing to put up with a little shine if I don&#x27;t end the day burned to crisp where the sunblock has come off my hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bullfrog products for many years -- applies quickly and cleanly, disappears and protects me effectively. I can burn severely but I feel confidant using Bullfrog.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen for golf.  My husband has been using it for 15 years &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else.  It is hard to find in the retail stores in our area.  I will order on line from now on.</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it gets absorbed easily on skin and has no oil compared to those in lotion type sunblock. But like most sunblocks, it leaves a shiny look on skin, i was thinking that since this is a gel based product, it will give off a matte finish, but it doesn&#x27;t. Shipping is quick and the product is as described.</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite sunscreen. It is a gel. It goes on very smoothly and covers easily and quickly. I have had melanoma in situ and assorted precancerous diagnoses, so I take my sunscreen very seriously. I play golf and I run, so I am outside all the time. I put this sunscreen on after my shower. And reapply when needed, which isn&#x27;t often. After 9 holes in the sun, I do not burn. It seems to be pretty sweat proof, and I don&#x27;t have white stuff all over my car upholstery. I give it 4 stars because it can stain certain fabrics out of the bottle. But I wore it this weekend to an outdoor wedding. After I applied it, I waited about a minute until it dried completely before I threw on my dress. Worked great. Dress was fine. If it spills on a fabric, just wash it quickly.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for us, your mileage may vary however.  Used as intended, it provided ample protection while on vacation last week and the only spots showing some sunburn didn&#x27;t have the lotion applied. Applies in a gel-like state and dries somewhat quickly, with very good adhesion properties and water resistance.  The seller, AmericaRx, shipped it promptly and at a good price.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time while sailing or just out on the water.  It lasts well, doesn&#x27;t wash off in the water and it&#x27;s not greasy.  Great sun protection!</li>
    <li> Great Product , finally someone came back with the Gel . I do not like Lotions .</li>
    <li> Tested well in the Nevada desert.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen for sports and swimming.  Our whole family uses it for the beach, the pool, and out on the tennis courts.  Easy to apply and fast drying!</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen there is!</li>
    <li> I bought this after an endorsement in a magazine for people who are dark skinned and don&#x27;t want to look like Casper the friendly ghost. It is better than the spray sunscreens, however, this leaves a sticky, oily feeling too. I&#x27;m not sure if this is acnegenic but I have used it on my body. The plus about this is the gel consistency. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of this either; typical sunscreen odor. But this product is better than the spray. :)&lt;br /&gt;Update* --I have been using this all summer. Re-applying is a pain b/c it flakes on your skin and you look like you are sweating profusely. And I don&#x27;t even wanna describe the horrid smell. YUCK.</li>
    <li> Does not work well.  Beads off skin and clumps together during application and does not stay on while swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they reformulated the Bullfrog that i remember from the 90&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid bicyclist for the past twelve years, averaging about 3,000 miles every summer. [I&#x27;m a teacher, so I have lots of time to pursue my passion for cycling when school is not in session.] This means lots of hours in the sun. Skin cancer is an issue in my family, so I&#x27;m very conscientious about using sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I was complaining to a fellow cyclist about the hassle of applying sunscreen--especially how difficult it was to apply on the road without the aid of a mirror to avoid the white globs of sunscreen on your face. He offered to let me try his Bull Frog Quick Gel, and I&#x27;ve been a fan ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It applies super fast. It is every bit as effective as the cream-style sunscreens. Also, it is no more expensive than most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here&#x27;s a quick tip for cyclists:  If you ever get grease on yourself (and who doesn&#x27;t), rub on a little dab of sunscreen and the grease will wipe right off! (FYI:  This will work using any brand of sunscreen.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a downside to the product (and it&#x27;s a minor one), it is that the primary inactive ingredient is SD alcohol 40. This does give the product a distinct alcohol smell. Since I&#x27;m outdoors on my bike when I&#x27;m using this product, it&#x27;s not a big deal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bull Frog gel for decades. It is just a great product. Only problem I have is the vendor charges x$ per unit for shipping and handling so buy 1 plus 1x$, buy 3 plus 3x$. That just does not reflect the real or even reasonable cost for shipping on a 6 oz. item. Seems like a rip off.</li>
    <li> Water Armor? Yeah right. I&#x27;ve used this on four occasions for my face, neck, scalp and legs while surfing. I&#x27;ve been burned all four times. I may have been in the water slightly more than 80 minutes, but I still shouldn&#x27;t have burned as bad as I did. I think this formula is a sham. I&#x27;ll keep it to give to people I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> easy to use, quick dry, a little sticky though works great in the water and I usually swim for 60-75 minutes- it stays on the whole time.  A little soap and water and it comes off.  there is now a spray to use for my back though I prefer this for the rest of my body</li>
    <li> Wish they still made 30 SPF, instead of only 50!!  It&#x27;s still Bull Frog, but I don&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;overkill&amp;#34; approach to spf.</li>
    <li> We have been bullfrog subscreen for several years and have really liked the protection but it always went on very &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;. When it came out ib gel form, it really put it over the top....much easier to apply.</li>
    <li> My husband is a golfer and this is the only product he will use on his face because it doesn&#x27;t sweat off and get in the eyes and it is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> When my kids were small I would put apply the quick Gel on them at 9:00 am and then we would go boating on the river all day. I never would reapply the sunscreen after that.  They never burned or even tanned.  At the end of the summer they were still perfectly white and unharmed by the sun.</li>
    <li> It was recommended to me by a lifeguard trainer,a pool specialist, a dermatologist and an eye doctor. I presume they know what the best products are, so I took their advice. Oddly, I&#x27;m satisfied, particularly as I swim and live in Florida.</li>
    <li> This product worked great in the ocean.  The gel dried quickly and stayed put for long periods of time.  Since I&#x27;ve not been able to find this product in stores, I&#x27;ll be back when this bottle is gone!</li>
    <li> works very well last that&#x27;s all you need</li>
    <li> Long lasting and water resistant</li>
    <li> I had to order this from Amazon because I can never find it locally. It is my preferred sunscreen for my face. All lotions and creams seem to make my face break out. This alcohol based gel doesn&#x27;t. Because it is clear, I can reapply during a ski day without leaving white residue. I decant from the large bottle into small carry along bottles for convenience.</li>
    <li> Goes on clear.  Has some smell to it, but not too bad for outdoor use.  Works great.</li>
    <li> Mixed it with spray chemicals - really works well</li>
    <li> we still got sunburned and didn&#x27;t go in the water</li>
    <li> Great stuff, goes on like a gel not like a lotion like most sunscreen.  The wonderful thing is this stuff dries in less than a minute.  Seems to stay on even when sweating and in the water.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but can&#x27;t buy locally anymore since they added bug repellant to the formula. All local sellers have the bug repellant formula only and we don&#x27;t have a mosquito problem. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen out there. I love how it goes on and then quickly dries. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes. Also, I have developed an allergic reaction to most sunscreens where I will break out in an itchy rash for a week after using it. However, this is the only kind of sunscreen that I have found that is water proof and doesn&#x27;t break me out in an itchy rash. It is a shame that it is becoming more and more difficult to find.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this every single day.  He likes how easy the quick gel formula goes on and rubs in quickly.  It does feel like it exfoliates your skin when you rub it on because it looks gritty afterwards.</li>
    <li> It feels so much lighter than the other sunscreens. I live in a humid city and this is the best sunscreen product I&#x27;ve used while running and swimming.</li>
    <li> Love this gel, it is fast drying and stays on for hours even with perspiration, holds up with a water splashing. With a person who has very fair skin, I now order on line and only use this product for skin protection.</li>
    <li> Very happy with all items form Amazon</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Can&#x27;t find in stores here. Had to order!</li>
    <li> Bullfrog is the best. Stays on even in water. THe green orangy gel.</li>
    <li> Bull Frog Watet Armor Sport is the best for those who like to workout under the sun!</li>
    <li> I hate sunscreen creams.  This gel based product fits my needs perfectly.  Yes, maybe it does have a slight alcohol aroma, but its not offensive.  It works perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> works like a champ for water sports, and sooo hard to find in our stores. The new style of bottle is a winner too!</li>
    <li> AWFUL !!!!! I bought this gel sunscreen cause my skin is oily but this gel is VERY , VERY OILY , SUPER GREASY.</li>
    <li> My family is white...really, really white. I&#x27;m a ginger, and one of my sons is nearly transparent. Needless to say, I spend a great deal of time applying sunscreen to myself and my sons. I used to use the spray sunscreens. With all the negative press about the harmful chemicals in spray sunscreens, I started researching healthier alternatives. I found a list of &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; sunscreens to use, and this brand made the list. It is a little pricey, but I love the consistency of it. It spreads well, and does not take a great deal of time to apply. This is our new favorite.</li>
    <li> OK, so it looks like snot, but it&#x27;s not (!)...it&#x27;s clear, no white splotchy patches,  applies evenly, not too runny, not oily,  a pleasant smell...it&#x27;s one of my must-have beach accessories....don&#x27;t overthink it, just get it.</li>
    <li> I usually sweat off sunscreen.  This lasted all day.  And it&#x27;s not oily so if you have a beard/stache you won&#x27;t be greasing it down when you put it on.</li>
    <li> This has long been a favorite in our family. It stays on and it is effective through swimming. MKJy husband and daughter have fair skin and Bullfrog gives us the best protection for the longest time.</li>
    <li> Used this amazing stuff while hiking in high altitude in the blazing sunlight, and didn&#x27;t even turn pink. And while it is waterproof, a good shower with soap and water works great.</li>
    <li> Delivery was quick, product as advertised. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Bullfrog sunscreen!</li>
    <li> serice and delivery was great,didn&#x27;t expect such a rapid delivery.Sunday no less!</li>
    <li> works great does not run and is water proof</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient sunscreen that makes you feel truly protected. I can understand that people value sunscreens that wear lightly on the skin (like the Neutrogena, which we also use in our household) and while this one is not unnoticeable when applied it is not that bad (e.g., it doesn&#x27;t feel like oiling your skin) All in all, convenient and safe and still my favorite.</li>
    <li> Covers well and dries quickly to a sheer consistency.  Skin does not burn and it takes a little sweat with no problem.  The best sunscreen I have used to date.  Only issue is that it is too expensive and the containers are meager at 4.7oz.  You go through this stuff fast so pull out your wallet.  Seems pricey but it really works well.</li>
    <li> If I could deny this product even the 1 star, I would. This stuff has overwhelmingly positive reviews so I gave it a shot, once, and threw it out. The clumping is absolutely horrible and leaves little balls of goo all over the skin. It&#x27;s a pain to put on, let alone reapply and even the shower at the end of the day is a chore with all these little goo-balls. Never again. I&#x27;m not angry at you Bullfrog, but I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does what is advertised and stays on. Im not going to.but again because of high alcohol. Butns.my eyes when.running.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Arrived very quickly, too.</li>
    <li> I got this sunscreen because I had previously gotten Bull Frog Surfer Formula and loved it. Unfortunately they have discontinued that product and started selling this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my list of complaints.&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells like alcohol&lt;br /&gt;2. It feels more runny then the surfer formula&lt;br /&gt;3. While applying the gel balls up on your skin and gives the appearance of sluffing dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. It needs to be reapplied more often then surfer formula did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very disappointed in this product and view it as a step in the wrong direction for the company.</li>
    <li> Does not protect from sun.  When applied, got pasty and ended up getting sunburn.</li>
    <li> I did not like this. It flaked when I reapplied.  I am having great luck with Walgreens Clear Zinc.</li>
    <li> I am very picky about sunscreen because I don&#x27;t like to feel greasy, but it is a must for me due to my very fair skin and previous sun damage.  Purchased this product for a trip to the Caribbean.  Loved the gel...no greasy feel like with so many lotions.  And, it works, as anyone could see by the palm-sized sunburned spot on my very slightly tanned leg where I got sloppy with my application!  I am using the remainder of the bottle on my hands/arms to limit sun damage while driving/outside.  This is now my go-to sunscreen for everything except my face, but I&#x27;m sure it would work well there too!</li>
    <li> great product.  Gel goes on easy and is very effective</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!  My husband &amp; I applied this before fishing in our boat &amp; after 9 hrs on the water neither one of us got sunburnt.  It goes on quick, dries fast with no white residue &amp; is odorless.  This will be the only sunscreen I purchase from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen that I have found that I can use on my face that does not &amp;#34;run&amp;#34; into my eyes and cause them to sting! Works well.</li>
    <li> I tried this after my store brand sun block failed me. This worked beautifully. My only complaint is it drys so quickly, it takes a lot of product for full body coverage.  I also found it to be a bit too greasy for me. But, it did the job it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen.  Non-oily, cooling gel.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most sun screens but not this one.  It does have alcohol in it.  The spray is easier to use than the gel but the gel covers a little better.  It doesn&#x27;t stain, stink or feel sticky.  Better than aerosol sunscreens (that cannot be near heat).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Sunscreen. It goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t streak. It&#x27;s waterproof, and great for snorkeling.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great for water sports. I use it while surfing in Southern California in the summer, and it stays on great in the water and does not cause any skin problems for me like some of the other brands. Great Product.</li>
    <li> works great, smells  like some kind of fuel. Not sure how good it is for my systems as it enters my pores but it keeps thee sun off.</li>
    <li> Bull Frog is my sunscreen of choice because it is alcohol based and goes on clear instead of a sticky white paste like many other products.  My order was delivered in a timely manner and was right the first time!</li>
    <li> my favorite sunscreen. great stuff for your body.</li>
    <li> the best sunscreen ever made.</li>
    <li> Handier than Walmart or Freds, needed it order it and got it.&lt;br /&gt;No prob</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but I love how it goes on and stays on through a hard day&#x27;s work.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product because it is not oily &amp; it works well to block out the effects of the sun!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen for faces!  It dries quickly and lasts forever.  It doesn&#x27;t work so well on other areas, but it&#x27;s great for your face.</li>
    <li> wish we could find it around here, but glad we can at least get it through Amazon.  My husband especially loves it since it doesn&#x27;t goop up in his arm or leg hair!</li>
    <li> Works great, waterproof.  My husband is fair skinned and burns easily.  We spent a week in the sun and thanks to bull frog he is burn free!  A little sticky but it dries quickly so no big deal.</li>
    <li> The best sunblock, period!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> Although it feels a little like a very very thin plastic covering on your skin, I believe that it is the best, and the most comfortable.</li>
    <li> I like the gel, not sticky like lotions. fast delivery</li>
    <li> I used this sun screen on a trip through the Egyptian desserts and sailing down the Nile and came home not only unburnt, but I didn&#x27;t even have a tan... It doesn&#x27;t wash off with sweat, so one application can last all day...Great if you have fair skin.  The only downside - there&#x27;s an alcohol smell when you first put it on.</li>
    <li> Consumer Reports rates Bull Frog Water Armor highly.  I agree that the product is effective and lasts for a long time, but I just don&#x27;t like the Gel form. I&#x27;m balled and mainly only got this to protect my head and face, but its alcohol based so it can sting a tad, especially if you&#x27;ve been exercising and your pores are open.  Plus it leaves an alcohol smell, similar to gel hand sanitizers. Its not as greasy as regular lotion, so if you&#x27;re exercising and can&#x27;t wipe your hands after applying it, then I guess the gel is good for you.  But I would rather have it in spray or lotion formula.  The three stars is because of the gel, and not the Sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned person and this is a great, non-greasy product.  I hope they never discontinue the item.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as promissed.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen available, goes on easy and smoothly, dries fast...and works.&lt;br /&gt;I week fishing trip in the sun and no burn</li>
    <li> I have used bullfrog for many years. The first versions of the product were truly apply once and swim all day. When I lived in Australia where there was an ozone hole,  even teenagers developed skin cancer. Bullfrog was every where. I still feel this product is better than the other sun screens for protection. But I think they have tried to make Bullfrog more spray on where it is not as greasy to apply. Used to be Bullfrog was kind of greasy as you applied it but after about ten minutes it was no nonger greasy and it did not need to be reapplied. Now it says 80 minutes like most water resistant sunblocks do. I find that I only have to apply it one or twice a day and I&#x27;m not burnt. With most other sunblocks, I find that 80 minutes is stretching it a lot especially if you go in the water. Wish they would offer the old formula but this is still better than most anything else I have found!</li>
    <li> My wife advises that&#x27;s not so good for her face otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I have used Bull Frog for many years. It started with scuba diving and snorkeling because it was effective for a lot longer. I also use it for golf in Arizona and Washington and again, even with the sweating, it stays on and is effective so that I don&#x27;t have to reapply it in the middle of a round.</li>
    <li> Maybe it is just me, or maybe it is because I am a man, but I simply hate having to reapply sunscreen if I am outside in the sun.  Since I found Bull Frog sunscreen I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying.  I can put this on early in the day and forget about it.  I have used it at the beach, getting very sweaty and being in the water, and at the lake water skiing and still not had to reapply.  Thank you, Bull Frog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is similar to the old surfer formula they no longer make.  It has a consistency similar to hair gel, maybe a little bit thinner.</li>
    <li> Very nice to apply, dries almost instantly. I burns like the dickens if it gets in your eyes though, it is alcholo based...&lt;br /&gt;Extremely effective. I went scuba diving and used this for the first time. I had to apply it only once over an 8 hour period!</li>
    <li> Came just as described and great shipping A+++</li>
    <li> Went to the beach for a week. No sunburns. Dries quickly</li>
    <li> To date have used BullFrog 3 days in 100+ degree temperatures.  So far I have experienced no sunburn and minimal discomfort from the stuff sweating into my eyes.  Although I wear a huge hat and long sleeved shirts, both my primary care doc and dermatologist nag me regularly about using sunblock.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried, including those recommended by Consumer Report magazine, work for me.  I sweat, the sweat along with the sun block run into my eyes, I wipe my eyes because of the sting, and in the process wipe off the sunblock and its protection.  I picked Bullfrog based on the recommendation of a neighbor.  He is a retired game warden who captained a boat off the coast of central California.  His crew would regularly evaluate sunblock products and agreed Bullfrog is the best.  My neighbor&#x27;s skin is the ultimate recommendation; although he&#x27;s old enough to be retired from many years on the ocean, his skin looks like a baby&#x27;s.  Didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars only because I have used it such a short time.</li>
    <li> I have used Bullfrog quick dry gel for years and I LOVE IT! I fish a lot, and find that I do not regularly reapply sunscreen as the directions require. Nonetheless, one application of Bullfrog takes care of me all day. I&#x27;m sure the manufacturers would frown on this, but this stuff is the bomb. It also dries in seconds, and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty white greasy film on your skin. Buy some today and save your skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works very well. I used it for a week at the beach with no sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that it is very difficult to clean off afterwards.</li>
    <li> I love this product and hope it&#x27;s never discontinued. I am an avid fishermen and this stuff is applied just once in the morning before heading out in the ocean. After the trip just a nice color and no sunburn to contend with.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 20 star review if I could.&lt;br /&gt;Just apply sparingly and rub it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Do not goop it on. This stuff I&#x27;d the best</li>
    <li> Smells really good (floral). Goes on clear, but once you&#x27;re in the water (or it dries), it turns white. In fact, the white stayed on for 8 hours even after our shower. Unfortunately, just because it stayed on that long didn&#x27;t mean that it worked that long. Overall, it was good, but I&#x27;d rather stick with Bull Frog sport lotion instead.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works great! A little strong on the smell in my opinion. But great product!</li>
    <li> When applied to skin, it left little bits (about the size of a pencil lead) of \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; that were a pain to remove. It kind of looked like clumps of dead skin. The good news is that we didn&#x27;t get burned, but we felt gross until we had a shower.</li>
    <li> Every year when I go to Destin Florida for a week vacation I always purchase Bull Frog Quik Gel.  Every year I am amazed that I can apply this stuff ONCE in the morning and it will last 8 hours easily.  I am extremely active on the beach - competitive volleyball, swimming in the ocean, and of course relaxing in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 4 bottles because previous reviewers indicated that it takes a lot to cover themselves.  I was on the beach 7 days, applied to my whole body (aside from face) and I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 2\\&quot; - I didn&#x27;t even go through ONE bottle!!  If you are using this up quickly then you are not applying sunscreen correctly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is QUICK DRYING GEL, so take a small amount and *quickly* rub it on (seriously, like 10 seconds or less!).  It is NOT like ordinary suncreens where you have to rub for 5 minutes to get it to absorb and dry.  If you rub too much it will indeed begin to flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this does leave you glistening a bit.  Because I walk to the beach shirtless and stay that way all day it never bothered me at all.  But I probably wouldn&#x27;t apply this stuff and then put on a nice shirt (but who wears nice shirts to the beach with sunscreen anyway?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is the perfect sunscreen for beach or lake users!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note* I do NOT use this on my face (I have sensitive skin/can be acne prone).  I used Bullfrog Ultimate Sheer Protection Sunblock Face Spf 30, which I also reviewed...AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen ever. Stays really well in water and never get sunburned when I use it. Been a bull frog fan since I was a kid growing up on hot kentucky lakes and pretty much hate all other sunscreens because this stuff is so awesome!</li>
    <li> I mean this is good stuff. Goes on well and doesn&#x27;t leave a white ghost face like other sunscreen. I usually cake on my sun screen so that&#x27;s why I get that white ghost face. When I cake on sunscreen or use this product I feel it&#x27;s about the same protection. So to me it&#x27;s a cosmetic thing. Personally I don&#x27;t care bout my looks that much so I&#x27;ll get the more cost effective regular white lotion type sunscreen next time. 4 stars cause of the price otherwise a solid product</li>
    <li> Works well as a sunscreen. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
    <li> When playing sports outside, I sweat a LOT and towel off at LOT!  Most sunblocks wear off, BF Gels do the best job of keeping me from burning even after hours of sweating in the blazing sun.</li>
    <li> bullfrog GEL (I have never used spray or lotion).  It is good for ALL DAY.  In and out of the water as often as you want.  If you rub your skin with a towel - you will have to reapply, so just wrap yourself instead.  Soap will also take it off, so reapply if you wash your hands with soap and water.  I always use the gel on my ears, face and  front/back of neck.  I generally have a base body tan before hitting the beach and only have to use a max of eight on my body, legs, arms and feet.  Although sometimes because of shoes worn, my white feet need Bullfrog.  It has a somewhat strong odor but it goes away in seconds, for great protection it is easy to tough it out for a few seconds!  Years ago I discovered this product and found using it on my kids then ages 14 to 2 gave them super protection, all over their bodies for hours.  I always applied in the car or at home so we didn&#x27;t pick up gritty sand with the gel.  No kid wants an exfoliating rub of bullfrog standing in the sand at the beach with sand already covering them from feet to knees.  At that time the product had to be applied and 10 mins later rubbed to activate, now it&#x27;s just put it on and to.</li>
    <li> Best product for protection.  I much prefer the gel and it is not available locally even though we have lots of sun and golf year round in South Texas.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff, I have used it for years and it really works.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would mess around with lotion.  It is also the favorite of my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> So... this stuff works great if you are willing to put up with a couple of inconveniences.  My experience has been that this only works to its full potential if:&lt;br /&gt;1) you apply it 30 min or so ahead of when you plan to go out and it has a good chance to dry&lt;br /&gt;2) when you put it on, only &amp;#34;spread&amp;#34; it - do not try to rub it in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our best success has been if we get up in the morning and apply this before ever going outside (or getting wet or sweaty), and sit for 15-30 min to let it dry.  (usually under a ceiling fan or the AC vent).  When we think to do it this way, we have consistently gotten 8+ hours of protection, without reapplication, even when swimming in a pool or in the ocean.  Both the wife and I are fair-skinned, and tend to be either ghostly or red...  With the Water Armor sunscreen, we avoid the unpleasantness of sunburn.  We&#x27;ve found that if you put it on when wet or sweaty already, you are going to have to reapply more frequently.  If you can start dry and let it dry, you can pretty much go all day without too much worry, even when active, sweaty, or swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many others have noted, this stuff is bad for &amp;#34;pilling&amp;#34; if you try to rub it in too much.  The more you rub the worse it gets, so the trick is just to spread it evenly in as few strokes as possible.  We&#x27;ve noticed that this is aggravated too if you have been in contact with other sunscreens too.  (She uses Neutrogena stuff for her face, and when they mix, its just a pill-y mess...)  Really annoying until you get the hang of spreading it &amp;#34;just enough&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel of the sunscreen is a little heavy / waxy, but not too bad.  Definitely not as noticeable as some sunscreens that leave you feeling greasy.  Especially if you let it dry out correctly, it isn&#x27;t too obnoxious.  Definitely worth that though, since it works as well as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, -1 star for convenience in putting it on (and the !@#$%^&amp;* pilling); but superb performance ifyou can deal with the hassle of the application process.  This is the stuff we use all the time, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Wow...i looked all over san diego and the internet (after not finding it anywhere in stores) to find bullfrog&#x27;s surfer formula 36 spf.....they discontinued it.  Instead, this is what I found as a replacement.  Let me start by saying that I live in southern California and am currently working in Temecula, which is 90-105 every day in the summer and usually clear sky &#x3D; sunburn.  I would put on the surfer formula in the morning, then drive an hour to work and even with only one application, the surfer formula lasted ALL DAY...not a couple hours, ALL DAY.  So they discontinued it and i found a couple of replacement options, I went with water armor......BAD choice.  I decided to stick with bullfrog because being from Louisiana, my family was huge open water fishermen and women and this is what I grew up with.  First of all, the water armor creates this weird wax particles or something when rubbing it in....it&#x27;s annoying and you have to rub extra.  Then, make no mistake, unlike the previous surfer formula this WILL STAIN YOUR CLOTHES!!!  Bad day in my opinion for bullfrog.  I will not buy any bullfrog ever again until they bring back surfer formula.</li>
    <li> This may be highly rated by Consumer Reports as most effective for sun protection, but it makes your face greasy and shiny, which if it does that, it can&#x27;t be good for avoiding clogged pores and buildup of bacteria sitting on your face all day long. Others may not be bothered by a greasy looking face while you&#x27;re out in the sun all day, but this product wasn&#x27;t for me. I prefer something that goes on like a lotion, dries quickly and still provides protection.  I also agree with another reviewer about how as it goes on it becomes gritty.</li>
    <li> My husband will not use the spray or lotion/cream sunblocks, only this gel product.  You do have to be sure to keep it out of your eyes; it will sting. Given my dry skin and my dry climate, I cannot use it on my face on top of makeup because it will cause the makeup to flake off, very visibly.</li>
    <li> Greatest sunblock ever will not wash off just because you get wet</li>
    <li> I very seldom give a product endorsement ... but Bull Frog sunscreen has finally started making a gel that is as good as the old one they used to make many years ago! I lathered up with it once this morning, and have literally been out in the sun all day (on 2 different lakes), and I am not sunburned. (My dad&#x27;s side of the family is from Scotland, and I have reddish hair &amp; freckles, and I can sunburn in about 20 minutes, with no sunscreen on.)</li>
    <li> This is the best waterproof sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found, and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  I have very fair skin that burns easily.  I can put this on and stay in the water for hours without having to reapply- no sunburn!  It has a nice smell and goes on easily.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> OUTSTANDING protection, even if a heavily medicinal scent.&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily, just don&#x27;t rub on too hard or for too long (it can&lt;br /&gt;pill up and slough off if you deplete it of moisture that way).</li>
    <li> Not nearly as greasy as some sunscreens. Bull Frog works great and is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> With a lifetime of outdoor summer water activities, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  This is hands down the best thing out there for sunscreen that lasts on despite the water.</li>
    <li> Watery and stings when applied.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Product is as described.</li>
    <li> I used the old surfers formula for many years - I loved it, I even slept with on my face about every night and swore that kept my skin looking real good - I loved that stuff!  Suddenly I could not find it anymore - so I was forced to try the new water armor quick gel.  I smelled like alcohol, stung my face after shaving just like alcohol, and dried my face out in minutes just like alcohol.  I went into the water and the first wave that hits me makes me blind from the alcohol going into my eyes and stung real bad- ouch!!  Than I go home to find out I am sun burned as if I had no sun block on!  Once again I loved the old surfers formula - easy to see that corporate greed caused them to make over a perfect produce into a disaster!</li>
    <li> Bullfrog gel is the best sunscreen, ever. If you have never tried it, you need to.</li>
    <li> This is the only non-lotion gel available. It is excellent and dries quickly and is non-greasy. i recommend it to everybody that doesn&#x27;t like lotion.</li>
    <li> It does a good job protecting your skin but it has a really strong odor - the odor is so strong it burns my eyes when I put in on my face.  Alcohol?  I won&#x27;t buy it again because of that.</li>
    <li> We needed this screen this last week in the Sierras and on a tuna trip in so cal. Perfect</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Would recommend this product for all outdoor activities always wear sunscreen whenever you go outdoors&lt;br /&gt;even to run errands.</li>
    <li> I have to give 3 stars but the pros and cons are something to consider: PROs: It does prevent sunburn when applied properly and does have a pretty good level of waterproofness BUT I experienced these CONS:  1. It has weird tendency to cause your skin to exfoliate after applying. I used it this morning, (applied 30 minutes before going out) and while out on the boat and after sweating a little, (this stuff has a melting consistency)  so i kept rubbing it back into my skin and I noticed dead skin starting to roll off.  I guess if you want to exfoliate your skin this might be a good thing, but I find it weird, NOT SEXY and  aggravating.  2. It causes your skin to shine from the minute you apply. 3. It never really really sinks in and disappears.  4. DO NOT use on face or forehead as it does migrate into your eyes after sweating.  *I found this out the hard way going down the interstate doing 65  mpg and having to pull over and douse my face with bottled water,( I was rendered blind until I could get it off.) Wash your hands well after applying to avoid irritation to eyes.</li>
    <li> I love that this is gel-based and not lotion based. It covers easily and quickly and you do not need to spend minutes trying to rub a white lotion in. It goes on clear but leaves a bit of residue that can be brushed off. Well worth the money, I wish I could find it in my local drug-stores.</li>
    <li> As a former caddie, this was really the only stuff that I trusted for 4 hours straight in the South Carolina sun (usually with only 1 application, and although I don&#x27;t recommend that, I never got sunburned). People who are new to it will probably not like it at first because when you rub it in, it will look like your skin is peeling (if you haven&#x27;t tried it, you&#x27;ll know what I mean almost instantly), but the key is to ignore that, and focus on how you are not getting sunburned.</li>
    <li> I love Bullfrog quick gel.  I cannot stand the greasy feeling of lotion.  There is only one draw back...it has a somewhat powerful alcohol smell.  Well worth it in my opinion.  I also ordered a bunch of these as I cannot find it here in Okinawa and they sent me the six with all the same expiration (6 months to use).  I was not happy with that.  Normally in the store you get two season out of it.  Not with this order.  If some of them would have had 6 more months on the expiration, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Still burned after generously applying and in water for 30 minutes then walked back inside.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen on the market.  The gel evaporates quickly so there is no greasy feeling left on your skin.</li>
    <li> I ride road bikes. I wakeboard. I coach baseball. It is the only thing that effectively works for me. Not Nutregena. Nothing with all the same ingredients as nutragena. Many have the same ingredients. Not bullfrog.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
    <li> Bullfrog is very good for athletic activities because it doesn&#x27;t run into&lt;br /&gt;your eyes when you sweat. It&#x27;s also paba free. It&#x27;s a bit gooey when you&lt;br /&gt;first put it on, but it quickly drys. It can stain the colors of clothes</li>
    <li> The gel form makes this spread easily (even on the face), and last all day.  I put it on legs, arms, and face before golf and get protection that allows a gradual tanning over my snow bird time in the desert!  I let it dry a few minutes, then put SPF makeup right over it for extra protection.</li>
    <li> Even with thick, repeated application my husband still burned so badly that he peeled! This was after less than 5 hours in the Caribbean sunshine.</li>
    <li> Great on arms when playing golf.</li>
    <li> Best sunscreen there is!  Goes on quickly, does not leave greasy sticky residue, and does not easily rinse off.  I SCUBA dive and this is the best product I have found.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Bull Frog for years and always loved it! Bought this for my family and they love it too!</li>
    <li> I remember Bull Frog being awesome back in the day - was hoping I found the same product here, but think I need to keep looking for whatever kind it was I have memories of. This one is okay. It dries quickly and keeps the burn away, but it kind of balls up if you overlap the areas where you&#x27;ve already applied it in a way that makes it look like your skin is severely peeling. It gets the job done (as far as preventing sunburn, which is what this product is all about) but I don&#x27;t like the balling up aspect of it.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does not run too much with sweat.</li>
    <li> product is as described and delivered as promised!!!</li>
