      <li>This is priced right and does a very good job at getting rid of coffee stains on teeth.</li>

      <li>Very comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>they make a huge difference!)</li>
      <li>I did notice that it did have more of an effect when I was in the tanning bed</li>

      <li>I love this whitener.  </li>
      <li>Works better then my dentist whiting trays</li>
      <li>Glad I did the research before buying this product.</li>
      <li>Better than the creast strips is you ask me.</li>
      <li>Great way to replenish your supply without purchasing the whole set with mouth guard again.</li>
      <li>I imagine if I went more often it would be even better.  </li>
      <li>I was so glad when I found it here.</li>
      <li>Just make sure to get in between teeth</li>
      <li>I used it at home, and while it was okay, it wasn&#x27;t anything I was going to brag about..</li>
      <li>Try it, and you will love it.</li>
      <li>I love this item.  </li>
      <li>Better than zoom..</li>
      <li>i use it ALL the time :)</li>
      <li>I did notice some more sensitivity</li>
      <li>I got better results with this than I got with Brite Smile---for which I paid $300.</li>
      <li>(Make sure you visit the dentist for custom</li>
      <li>I have nothing better to do when tanning aside from listening to music or napping.</li>
      <li>absolutely LOVE this product SO much!!!!</li>
      <li>Twilight Teeth is pretty good product.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth to begin with (use sensodyne toothpaste) and experienced some sensitivity after using this, but not terrible.</li>
      <li>THE SAME THING WORKS VERY GOOD</li>
      <li>I used daily when tanning and my teeth were so bright!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, very pleased.</li>
      <li>The product worked fine</li>
      <li>It is half the price here and a wonderful value.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a huge difference after just one use.  </li>
      <li>I have not noticed a huge difference yet.</li>
      <li>I have never gotten so many compliments on my smile as I do when I use this product.</li>
      <li>Just for precise details, I used what they called a \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; bed and would be under the lights for 10-13 mins (which was the max allowed for this bed).</li>
      <li>Do not use it without UV light, though.  </li>
      <li>Product works great when tanning but have to use it regularly.</li>
      <li>My teeth are beginning to get whiter after applying the UV light each night for 45 minutes.  </li>
      <li>I paid for Twilight whitening and received cheap stuff.</li>
      <li>I experienced no sensitivity or white spots as others described.</li>
      <li>nice price for kit but priced high for just the refills.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and it shipped very fast</li>
      <li>However, I was excited to take it to the salon and see how it worked in a bed.</li>
      <li>The light doesn&#x27;t do anything and the tray is not for full mouth.</li>
      <li>Love to use this first thing in the morning after I brush my teeth</li>
      <li>This is the only one that has worked the best so far.</li>
      <li>I would have liked to have seen a bigger difference and more teeth</li>
      <li>Super fast results and super cheap!</li>
      <li>This product works and is quick and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I have pretty good white teeth</li>
      <li>Shipment was fast and the product is extremely easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the at home kit because I stopped tanning due to risk for skin cancer, and the results have been amazing!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used a few times and see a big differance.  I will keep using it because it is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 3 times...only in my home but not in the tanning bed.  I see a difference already and it is very easy to use and relatively inexpensive.  Go ahead, BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Good product. I bought this replacement to go with the kit that I purchased at my tanning salon</li>
    <li> Twilight Teeth is pretty good product. Overall it&#x27;s easy to use and gives fast results! Just put it on for the 10-20 minutes or whatever you usually tan and you&#x27;ll walk out seeing results within the first use. I did notice some more sensitivity so I personally started using it every other day .</li>
    <li> I have used this product before, but purchased it from salon. I was so glad when I found it here. It is SOOO much cheaper, and is the exact product. If you haven&#x27;t used this product before...Refill does&#x27;t come with the mouth guard needed for it&#x27;s use. You have to by the \\&quot;Starter Kit\\&quot; You simply place mouth guard,(it opens your lips to expose your teeth. Then you paint your teeth with Accelerator (that&#x27;s what comes in refill) then you lay back while tanning and relax. When finished...Brighter Teeth...really! It works.</li>
    <li> I used this product pretty much every day for 2 weeks and did not see any difference at all in the color of my teeth. I&#x27;ve seen other people who say it does work but I sure don&#x27;t know what I did differently. I was very careful to follow the instructions. Just for precise details, I used what they called a \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; bed and would be under the lights for 10-13 mins (which was the max allowed for this bed).</li>
    <li> The product worked fine but I had to buy the mouth piece that I was under the impression, came with it. when you buy it anywhere in a store it comes with a mouth guard.</li>
    <li> Want really white teeth and like to tan? Then this is your product. Amazing results with just one use! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I love this product and it shipped very fast</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile...It is half the price here and a wonderful value.  It may be used with red light collagen lamps as well as tanning bed/booth lighting...or even if you are out in the sun.  I got better results with this than I got with Brite Smile---for which I paid $300.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few times and didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. Perhaps this is because my teeth are fairly white to begin with, but overall I was dissapointed. You would be better served purchasing a 9.5% hydrogen peroxide at home whitening gel, which I have great results with. (Make sure you visit the dentist for custom trays-- they make a huge difference!)</li>
    <li> Wish it came in a larger container. I used daily when tanning and my teeth were so bright! Now I use about three times a week and they are white but not bright. I previously smoked, but no coffee or wine.</li>
    <li> It suppose to be used in the tanning bed, that&#x27;s the reason I bought it.  I might have gotten a couple shades lighter with this.  The only draw back is, only the top and bottom teeth, 3 top, 3 bottom are visible during the process.  I would have liked to have seen a bigger difference and more teeth shades whiter.</li>
    <li> Great way to replenish your supply without purchasing the whole set with mouth guard again. This product works really well. I will use again.</li>
    <li> This company was very nice to deal with. My item came on time and they also sent me three packs of sample lotion.</li>
    <li> I used Twilight Teeth in my tanning bed for the first time this morning. I noticed &#x27;some&#x27; difference in the whitening process, but nothing to jump up and down about. Actually, I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed. Before I give it my &#x27;final&#x27; opinion, I&#x27;m going to use 4-5 more times.</li>
    <li> It does work, but you have to follow the directions precisely for best results. If you are looking for an overnight thing, this is not it, as it does take a few times before you see any real results.</li>
    <li> I guess its made by the same ppl who make twilight teeth but the tube that came looks lot different from last one I ordered and seems a lil low like it was opened prior  and poured out some idk.. but I used it and it seems to work like the stuff i buy at my tanning salon</li>
    <li> WHY PAY DOUBLE FOR THIS AT THE SALON IT IS THE SAME THING WORKS VERY GOOD</li>
    <li> Love to use this first thing in the morning after I brush my teeth and I am getting ready! Never seen my teeth so white before!</li>
    <li> Love this product...works great!  Just wish it would have been more clear on the fact that it was refills only and not the kits with the mouth piece.  nice price for kit but priced high for just the refills.  but will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this off amazon because my tanning salon wanted $40 for it and I got the whole kit for $15. Absolutely the best teeth whitening product I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried all the different crest whitestrip products as well. I don&#x27;t really understand why the kit comes with the blue light, I have never used it and only use this product in the tanning bed and it works great!!</li>
    <li> I use every kind of whitener on the market, WhiteStrips, bleach trays from my dentist, Celebrity Sexy teeth...and they are all great, but NOTHING gets my teeth as bright as the Twilight Teeth! It&#x27;s the only reason that I tan in the tanning bed. I love it! I recommend it to anybody seeking fast results. I have never gotten so many compliments on my smile as I do when I use this product. Give it a try, it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to many other teeth whitening options. (but make sure you start off with the kit &amp; not the refill...you need the guard that holds your mouth open!!)</li>
    <li> I love this item.  I noticed a huge difference after just one use.  Be careful to apply it all over teeth, because I could see where I missed a few spots.  It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth like other whitening products.  I will be getting the refill soon.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Always used this product</li>
    <li> Works better than expected, I have to say that I was not certain that this product would even work for me but its great and my family and friends have noticed a much whiter smile.. I have used this inside a tanning bed and outside a tanning bed and it works either way.. I did notice that it did have more of an effect when I was in the tanning bed and im sure it was due to the extra light and heat but as mentioned before, it does work either way and you will notice a difference after the first 3 or 4 uses.</li>
    <li> Followed everything as directed. Used in tanning bed for several sessions and have seen no change at all. It arrived on time and everything was as expected. I experienced no sensitivity or white spots as others described.</li>
    <li> Works better then my dentist whiting trays</li>
    <li> I was honestly quite skeptical at first upon seeing this product listing, but because of amazons great 30 day return policy I decided to try it out.  I could not have been happier with the results!  I purchased the at home kit because I stopped tanning due to risk for skin cancer, and the results have been amazing!  I experienced noticeable results after the first few days, and after a week it was a transformation!  I have used this product now for a month, and my teeth are several shades whiter.  My only complaint is that I did drool quite a bit on the mouth guard for the home kit.(gross, i know) I would definitely recommend trying this out, and if it doesn&#x27;t work out, just return it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! Super fast results and super cheap! With this product I seem results in a week! And you can do it while tanning your killing two birds with one stone!</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE this product SO much!!!! If you want whiter teeth in no time, I highly suggest this! Go tanning, but it on your teeth with the pink thing that comes with it to keep your mouth open, brush the whitening gel on your teeth and that&#x27;s it! You can tan and whiten your teeth! It&#x27;s so amazing. It really does work. Try it, and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Very good refill! Exactly as described. Great price. Only problem is you have to buy it as an add on.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money for me. The light doesn&#x27;t do anything and the tray is not for full mouth. Even if they were giving away I wouldn&#x27;t take it. Why would you only try to bleach the front teeth? They need to do something with the product. My tanning salon sells it for RIDICULOUS amount of money. If I had paid that I would have been really pissed off.&lt;br /&gt;They need to redo the kit!!</li>
    <li> I go tanning every day, right after I get the coffee that stains my teeth. Lol. This product is awesome. Totally works, I didn&#x27;t bother to buy the whole kit with the mouth piece, no need for it.</li>
    <li> Worked like whitening strips in a shorter period of time!</li>
    <li> I bought this from the place I was tanning at but payed a lot more money I was happy to see him sell it a lot cheaper it works great and will buy again thank you</li>
    <li> Great product and great price! Only use it every couple years because of how great of a job it does! If I didn&#x27;t smoke wouldn&#x27;t have to keep it up every few years.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter, since it was cheaper on Amazon, than the other place she had been buying it. Anyway, she&#x27;s used it for quite sometime on a regular basis and loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit out of curiosity, and I was shocked when I saw the results the first time. I was actually embarassed at how noticably whiter my teeth were, so I kept my mouth closed for the rest of the day, assuming someone would cry foul. It takes a few times before the white is even but I have had really good results with this product. I have nothing better to do when tanning aside from listening to music or napping. I would hands-down rather do this while Im tanning than have to \\&quot;waste\\&quot; good time at night doing a whole other process. I have been quite happy with it and will be purchasing another refill soon.</li>
    <li> I would give this product no stars. The refills are half filled, didn&#x27;t look like they were sealed, are  watery, and looks nothing like the Twilight refills. They are labeled P6 Whitening.  I have used Twilight whitening before this is NOT same product. I paid for Twilight whitening and received cheap stuff.</li>
    <li> Very convenient teeth whitening. Works well with or without the tanning bed....just need the blue light you can buy separately if not using tanning bed.</li>
    <li> This product works well and came sealed and packaged with no damage as expected. I used it to get my teeth white for my wedding.</li>
    <li> Better than zoom.. best whitening for your teeth ever. Make sure u have the little blue light machine before u order this. I got the zoom whitening before... this is 1000 times vetter. Been using this for about 4 years now. I Can Go wrong.</li>
    <li> I love this whitener.  I use it every 2nd or 3rd time that I go to the tanning bed and it is extremely effective.  The results are instant.  Do not use it without UV light, though.  You will be wasting an expensive product for less than visible results.</li>
    <li> Product works great when tanning but have to use it regularly. Good product for a good price. Don&#x27;t like the taste but it does work.</li>
    <li> Product exactly as described. Would purchase from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> works so good, I literally swear by this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I smoke and drink coffee and my teeth are sparkling white!!!</li>
    <li> The liquid leaked out and there&#x27;s almost nothing left.</li>
    <li> amazing product for amazing price!!</li>
    <li> This is priced right and does a very good job at getting rid of coffee stains on teeth. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I would use it again and again and getting it from Amazon.com couldn&#x27;t be easier!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works! It&#x27;s crazy, I&#x27;ve got some fake teeth/veneers in on my top row of teeth and it didn&#x27;t leave them out of my whitening experience. Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Do not recommend. Did not work as promised on the website or in the descriptions. I saw no change whatsoever, and would not buy again.</li>
    <li> i love that it has the mirror on the box so you can put it on anywhere, especially if you use the tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I use this while tanning and after a few uses, there is noticeable whiteness to my teeth.  This is the only one that has worked the best so far.</li>
    <li> I used the Twilight Teeth while tanning for two months, about 100 minutes, and saw absolutely no difference. I have started brushing with baking soda and can now see a difference. But the Twilight Teeth does not work. It was a waste of $25. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love twilight teeth! its always amazing and always works!! i use it ALL the time :) BUY IT you wont be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Perfect product for tanning ~ I can really tell a difference in the whiteness of my teeth after 1st use. Will order again. A+++ Seller!!!</li>
    <li> Great, I use 1X a week.  Had teeth professionally whitened, and then use this to keep teeth white.  Much cheaper than what the dentist had to sell.  Very comfortable to use.  I drink lots of coffee, so the once a week use seems to be working for me.  Much cheaper than buying from a tanning salon.  No complaints</li>
    <li> I have pretty good white teeth and I even get complimented on them out if the blue sometimes. I tan about once a week and use this when I do. It works. I don&#x27;t use the mouthguard as I find that it is awkward and actually obstructs light to some of my teeth. Just paint it on the front of all your teeth as far back as you see when you bare your teeth, then tan while baring your teeth.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is relatively easy to use, and does not make my teeth sensitive like Crest Whitestrips and other over the counter products do. It works well.</li>
    <li> When you order the system, go ahead and get this, you&#x27;ll need it later on.  Seal is tough to break, make sure to open before you get in the tanning salon!</li>
    <li> this product works so well I love it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past few days and results are beginning to show.  My teeth are beginning to get whiter after applying the UV light each night for 45 minutes.  Shipment was fast and the product is extremely easy to use.  For the price, the refills are a good buy and I will continue buying in the future!</li>
    <li> This product works and is quick and the price can&#x27;t be beat. My tanning salon sells it for $50! I didn&#x27;t notice any white spots and only felt a little tingle when applied. I saw immediate results. The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t lighten and bonding or crowns. I have a little bonding that fills a slight gap in my front teeth and it really stood out after one use so I can&#x27;t go overboard. I may just have my dentist remove it because my gap is small and I&#x27;d rather have whiter teeth. Also, I drink coffee daily and twilight teeth seems to work on that type of stain.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference when using it. Thought it was the whole thing when I bought it, but ended up being a refill. Not satisfied at all.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if the product they sell on here is expired or a knock off but it doesnt work nearly as good as the product I pay full price for at the store.</li>
    <li> shipped slowly. but it seems to work good.</li>
    <li> I rated this 5 stars because it really does work, and is really quite innovative. Now, that being said... IF you plan on only using this system at home, I would probably only give it 3 stars. The light from the kit that they send you is definitely different from the light you would get in a tanning bed. I used it at home, and while it was okay, it wasn&#x27;t anything I was going to brag about.. and it was a mess. I drooled everywhere! However, I was excited to take it to the salon and see how it worked in a bed. I was blown away! I use a bed with a 12 minute max time, and it took me a little while to get lotion and the gel on, so I was in the bed for about 9 minutes total. My teeth were SO much whiter, I could definitely tell it worked. I haven&#x27;t gone back to using this gel at home, I will only use it in the tanning bed. It is much less messy at the salon as well. (turn the fan on in the bed, and it will dry up any &#x27;drool&#x27; immediately)&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again, I am very happy using this and keeping up the whitening by using a whitening mouthwash and toothpaste at home.</li>
    <li> Would recommend to anyone who would like to whiten teeth while tanning.  I only tan once a week, but can see a difference after using it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, either!</li>
    <li> I am still using this product. I have not noticed a huge difference yet. It does make your teeth spotty. Im hoping it will balance out.</li>
    <li> My tanning salon was promoting this and while I was skeptical,  as a smoker and a (former) soda junkie I&#x27;m pretty much always willing to try something to brighten my teeth.  I&#x27;ll admit,  I had some pretty bad staining. I&#x27;ve tried TONS of products.  From Crest white strips, to bleaches, to trays, home whitening lights, dentist whitening and even the expensive super smile system.  The only thing that even slightly worked without harsh sensitivity was the super smile (but is so gross it&#x27;s hard to keep using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said  -  THIS WORKS - WITHOUT SENSITIVITY !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only ever used it in a tanning bed and without the mouth guard.  I just smile ridiculously.  It doesn&#x27;t taste bad (a slight minty taste is all I pick up on).  I don&#x27;t tan that often  (2x a month or so)  but using it every time I go has made a WORLD of difference in the staining around my teeth.  I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s completely gone,  but every time it gets a little better.  I imagine if I went more often it would be even better.  The little tubes don&#x27;t last very long  (6 uses or so?) but Amazon&#x27;s price is far better than what my tanning salon charges.  My daughter and husband are using this as well now.  They don&#x27;t seem to have as drastic results, but their teeth weren&#x27;t as stained as mine were to start with.</li>
    <li> You have to use it allot to see results</li>
    <li> Product was as described. My lid had a little dent in it but honestly whatever that&#x27;s not even anything to freak about! Shipping was rather slow but that&#x27;s fine. I paid way less than what my salon wanted so I am happy :)</li>
    <li> Best value around!  Price at my local tanning salon was triple this cost.  I have used in three times and have noticed a considerable difference while using high pressure tanning beds with it instead of the light that it comes with.</li>
    <li> This stuff works good, much less expensive than at the tanning salon.</li>
    <li> The product I received is not the twilight teeth product</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, very pleased.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I noticed my teeth a couple shade whiter I use this almost everyday. Better than the creast strips is you ask me.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Whitens in a couple days!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product along with the mouth piece in my tanning bed and have seen noticeable results in a relatively short time. Would recommend to anyone who tans every so often to give your mouth a whiter smile.  Just make sure to get in between teeth so everything whitens at the same speed.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works perfectly. Glad I did the research before buying this product. Very pleased. A+</li>
    <li> This product works incredibly well. I have sensitive teeth to begin with (use sensodyne toothpaste) and experienced some sensitivity after using this, but not terrible.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work.. didn&#x27;t come with the piece that allows you to keep your mouth open.. waste of money</li>
