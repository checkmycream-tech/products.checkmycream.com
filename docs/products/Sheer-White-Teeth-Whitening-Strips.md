      <li>Even if it was fresh and worked great</li>

      <li>I love the convenience of these.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>I used the strips:&lt;br /&gt;- DAY 1 (1st application): I put the strips before going to bed (8 hours) with my retainer on top.</li>
      <li>I have used many products to whiten my teeth</li>
      <li>The taste is better than most and they don&#x27;t burn your gums.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that you have to use it more than once to get results.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>my teeth look great, and they&#x27;re much cheaper on line than from the dentist.  </li>
      <li>They do lighten up teeth, but don&#x27;t wear them more than 2 hours.</li>
      <li>I had to throw away most of them</li>
      <li>they were okay,</li>
      <li>apply to top and bottom teeth before you go to bed,</li>
      <li>and I was more vigilant about useing them because they were so easy to use and so inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have good instructions, but most people who have used whitening strips before can figure it out.</li>
      <li>Her assistant told me she had used them and they worked really well and best of all - were much easier than the trays.  </li>
      <li>This is much cheaper cost wise than what the dentists charge.</li>
      <li>Took about 7 treatments for an awesome white smile.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>The strips remove easily and the residue brushes off without a problem.  </li>
      <li>These strips were minty and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The product was delivered quickly!</li>
      <li>But i noticed a huge difference in My teeth color.</li>
      <li>We had ordered several boxes because of the great price.</li>
      <li>I use to be a smoker, coffee drinker and red wine and this product has worked great to remove the stains.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and now I keep them available at all times.</li>
      <li>I did a search on the internet and found that this was available for a lower price</li>
      <li>Comes with free tooth paste.</li>
      <li>I returned but based on the good reviews on Amazon I reordered two more kits hoping for a different result.</li>
      <li>Package looks good, however when I opened it, its not sticky and nor soft</li>
      <li>I found it much easier to navigate the top teeth vs. the bottoms, but I got better as the days went on.  </li>
      <li>I was excited bucause</li>
      <li>I find the strips very effective with less sensitivity than most products I have tried.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Here is a link from the manufacturers site with full instructions:  </li>
      <li>I have used these before and really loved them, but the ones I put on last night were just...</li>
      <li>so can only use on the bottom teeth, i used them for 5 nights and got good results.</li>
      <li>Works well and is lasting a good length of time.</li>
      <li>Good basic whitening strips.</li>
      <li>Teeth stay grayish-yellow, even though they look lighter after a full 5-day course.</li>
      <li>If i use them more often, i&#x27;m sure they will keep my teeth white.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and as advertised..</li>
      <li>They become very gummy and do not come off easily, however, brushing afterwards takes care of that.  </li>
      <li>These are easy to use and work very well.  </li>
      <li>My teeth were whiter after first use!</li>
      <li>Many of these types of products have made my teeth super sensitive, but not this one.</li>
      <li>the taste was fine and the strips are much easier to use than the drug store variety.</li>
      <li>Definitely need to use warm water rinse and brush after use to remove the sticky.</li>
      <li>I wore them longer than just a couple of hours to try to get the most out of them, but then my gums were really sensitive.  </li>
      <li>If you can stand the taste of these, they are worth it.</li>
      <li>The product is great, beware of non dental professional sellers because this is basically an Rx dental product and should ONLY be bought from the professionals.</li>
      <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth $60.</li>
      <li>These are great and can go twice the distance if they are cut in half horizontally!</li>
      <li>I only use them about once a week as the first ones after 5 days did an amazing job.  </li>
      <li>The strips were easy to use and comfortable enough to sleep in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> By the time I used my third set of strips my teeth whitened significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.  Got the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who works with dentists. Have tried other whitening systems on the market and heard this is the one dentists send home with clients for home use. This is much cheaper cost wise than what the dentists charge. I purchased 5 packs for all members of my family. The only complaint for some is sensitivity after 2 hours so we limited the use to 2 hours and even spaced use to every other day due to slight sensitivity for some. Will order this again when needed.</li>
    <li> I got sheer white stript originally from my dentist - Her assistant told me she had used them and they worked really well and best of all - were much easier than the trays.  I was excited bucause the trays always left a goopy residue in my mouth.  These strips were minty and easy to use.  They worked very well and I was more vigilant about useing them because they were so easy to use and so inexpensive.  I will continue to use them - but I still think the trays work a little better.  I will use these in between trays for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these before. I got my first ones through my dentist and thought I&#x27;d save some money if I bought them cheaper from Amazon than his office. Unfortunately, the ones I got were either expired or stored at a higher than recommended temperature, I don&#x27;t know. They looked frosty and wouldn&#x27;t stay on my teeth. Overall, they do cause less sensitivity than Crest Whitestrips, but I could never reach the effect I wanted with these. Teeth stay grayish-yellow, even though they look lighter after a full 5-day course. I don&#x27;t smoke and don&#x27;t drink coffee.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product through a dentist a while ago and I was happy with the results.  I did a search on the internet and found that this was available for a lower price so I figured I would place an order. My order was fulfilled by GreenDot sales.  The package had a 2015 expiration date, however, all the strips inside were completely dried out.  I tried one set on my teeth for a few hours but saw no results. I also noted that the box clearly says that these strips must be kept refrigerated, yet these strips showed up in a small, non-insulated box, sitting outside in 95F weather.  When I purchased these in the past from my dentist, the box was cold and I was informed to keep them in my refrigerator when I got home.</li>
    <li> I noticed results after the first night I used these. They also stick to your teeth better than other leading brands of whitening strips. I would definetly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I am a dental hygienist and I love these more than any other white strip out there! These actually stay in place and others slide off your teeth. The taste is better than most and they don&#x27;t burn your gums. The price is amazing and they are easy to use. HOWEVER, I would recommend getting them from a dentist! If you buy on the Internet you can get mad if they don&#x27;t work or if something is wrong. The product is great, beware of non dental professional sellers because this is basically an Rx dental product and should ONLY be bought from the professionals. I only gave it 4 stars because my first recommendation for whitening is the custom trays.</li>
    <li> These do work.  I used them before my wedding, and it did help make my teeth whiter.  I wore them longer than just a couple of hours to try to get the most out of them, but then my gums were really sensitive.  So I recommend following their recommendation of only keeping the strips on for about 2 hours.</li>
    <li> The strips make my teeth noticeably whiter and this is a bargain price compared to getting them from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I like these whitening strips, however please know that they make your teeth very sensitve after about the second day of using them. I think somewhere in the product description it says this product doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity, but yes it does. The product itself really does work at getting your teeth white though. I would order again, but I&#x27;d recommend using the strips every other night instead of every night.</li>
    <li> These are great and can go twice the distance if they are cut in half horizontally! Very noticeable difference in the color of my teeth (and no, I&#x27;m not a smoker!)</li>
    <li> I have used many products to whiten my teeth (I even had them &amp;#34;zoomed&amp;#34; 12 years ago) this product is great it really works! I first purchased it from my dentist for double this price. So when I saw it offered at this substantial savings I bought 2! I wear them at night for 5 days in a row. And I only have to repeat about every 6 mos. Don&#x27;t miss out on this deal.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I ordered Sheer White Strips...first time the white past was all in the middle of the strip and hard to apply. The second time the paste was clear, not sure why the difference...one may have been outdated?  I don&#x27;t think this is the best product out there- The product was delivered quickly!</li>
    <li> I have used these &amp;#34;Sheer white strips&amp;#34; from many other sellers and been quite happy with them in the past so I bought these from this seller.  When I received them, they were all dried up and shriveled.  I bought two boxes since I have a family of four and we use a box a night basically as a family ;)  we initially tried using the defective strips but couldn&#x27;t get them to attach to our teeth so we each (all four of us) opened up a second tray but those didn&#x27;t work either.  When I returned the left over the seller credited me for only one box.  What about the first box that was defective????&lt;br /&gt;I will never purchase anything from this seller again!!&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I&#x27;ve never returned anything from Amazon either so I&#x27;m not one of those crazy return and leave bad feedback kinda people.... I&#x27;m hoping the seller will make this right and credit my other box of Sheer White strips.</li>
    <li> Many of these types of products have made my teeth super sensitive, but not this one. Its great.</li>
    <li> Whiten my teeth a lot it&#x27;s kind of expensive but I only use it once a month. Comes with free tooth paste.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this to me when I asked her what product worked the best..it&#x27;s adheres to the teeth son much better than any white strip I have used and you can wear it overnight!</li>
    <li> These work really well. Professionally recommended</li>
    <li> Received quickly and as advertised..</li>
    <li> I purchased these strips from my dentist and so far, I&#x27;ve only used 2 strips, but I have not noticed any difference in my teeth whatsoever.  They did not work for me.  I thought I would at least see somewhat of a result, but nothing at all.  I will use the other 3 strips, but if I haven&#x27;t seen anything so far, I&#x27;m not really expecting to have any different results.  They are not difficult to put on, although taking them off is another story.  They become very gummy and do not come off easily, however, brushing afterwards takes care of that.  Will not buy these again and will try to find another alternative.</li>
    <li> Good basic whitening strips.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, and the product works really well! Noticed a difference about halfway through using all the strips. I left them on between 4 and 8 hours.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these to me and they did fairly well. They do lighten up teeth, but don&#x27;t wear them more than 2 hours. The instructions say 1-2 hours, but the box says 2-8 hours. I put the first two on for an hour each then took them off. On the third night I decided I would wear it for 4 hours. My teeth were really white, but I looked closer in the mirror and there are little white waves all over my front two teeth. It looks awful, but if you&#x27;re standing a normal distance away from people you can&#x27;t tell. I&#x27;m too afraid to use the last two. The reason I&#x27;m giving a higher score is because I think the product is only intended to be worn for 2 hours max.</li>
    <li> Works well and is lasting a good length of time. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> great price and value.  easy to use and very effective.</li>
    <li> Works well and MUCH cheaper than my dentist (who sells these for $50 a package!). However, these seem like they may have been a bit &#x27;old&#x27; or perhaps had been in a humid environment or something - one pair didn&#x27;t stick, and they were a bit uncomfortable on my gums. There seems to be less discomfort if I wait a night or two between applications rather than doing them 5 nights in a row.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed when I opened the product. They are all dried up and not useable. Expiration is Nov. 2015 and the strips in both boxes are hard and had to be thrown away. A big waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 66 year &amp;#34;Young&amp;#34; Woman who has tried &amp;#34;Every Whiteing Strip&amp;#34; available to the Public, as well as &amp;#34;All&amp;#34; of the so called &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34; Toothpastes, &amp; even all the &amp;#34;Mouth Washes&amp;#34; as well, but to &amp;#34;No Avail&amp;#34; what so ever !! I went to my Dentist to have a bit of work done, &amp; a good cleaning. While there the Dentist asked if I&#x27;d like to try these &amp;#34;Sheer White&amp;#34; Whiteing Strips, &amp; I thought what the heck.....&amp;#34;Holy Cow&amp;#34;, was I ever surprised &amp; Beyond Delighted when I saw a &amp;#34;Remarkable&amp;#34; change in the color of my Teeth in just the &amp;#34;First Two Hour Treatment&amp;#34; !! I&#x27;ve used these now for Four Days, with only one Day to go. (I got the 5 Day package) I &amp;#34;WILL&amp;#34; continue to use these for the rest of my life !! Finally, &amp;#34;A Product that does what it says it will do&amp;#34; !!  WOOOO-HOOOO !!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great whitening product. I used the strips a year ago and after 3 applications I noticed how much whiter they were.  I continued to use a couple of times a week and my teeth are so white.  I only use the whitening strips once or twice a month to maintain the whiteness.</li>
    <li> These are the best white strips that I have ever used. I tried them at my dentist first then bought some on here because they were chaeper.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended using these before I had a composite fixed on my front tooth. He charged $10 per individual pack!&lt;br /&gt;The product works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Please, save your money and don&#x27;t buy these strips.  The taste is that of Saccharin and the strips basically melt into a gooey mess and will take a l-o-n-g time to remove from your teeth.  The remainder of the box went into the trash.  I usually find some redeeming value in a product; but not this time.</li>
    <li> The whitener stripes seemed to have melted and stuck to the plastic strip rather than sitting in the plastic tray.  The whitener didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as the kit I had used previously.</li>
    <li> Definately made my teeth a few shades whitter after using this product for just 5 days! would recommend to anyone wanting to get their teeth a few shades brighter.</li>
    <li> The product did not whiten my teeth.  It caused a little bit of sensetivity, but not a lot.  I was disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, however, the two packages i ordered were defective.  They were dried out well before their expiration dates. I see by other reviews, I&#x27;m not the first to have this problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on second box and have achieved little whitening.  Not the level I expected.  Am hoping by completion of second box they will be noticablely whiter.</li>
    <li> Great product and very well priced.  However, I do agree with other reviews about the included instructions being unclear.  Here is a link from the manufacturers site with full instructions:  [...]</li>
    <li> Product has effectively whitened my teeth, but not as drastically as I was hoping. Maybe this is because I didn&#x27;t use it 5 days in a row. There&#x27;s no way I could have because it made my teeth so sensitive. I had to use it once a week to allow my teeth a few days to get back to normal. I have noticed a difference though, so I&#x27;ll probably purchase again. Good deal considering my dentist sells it for $40.</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same brand my dentist sells in his office for more than double the price! I got great results in the first use. My coworkers begged me to order them some too!</li>
    <li> Package looks good, however when I opened it, its not sticky and nor soft,  I know its an old inventory.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says. I leave it on about 3 hours. It may take 3 times to get the whitening that I want, but I see a difference after one application.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from my dentist for $50 before finding it on Amazon. I&#x27;m on my 2nd day of 5 days and while the strips work well I have to say, the taste is so overwhelmingly bad I can hardly keep them in for the recommended amount of time. On the first day I tried to sleep with them in but was kept awake super late and could only keep them in an hour due to the taste. However, I noticed a difference in the whiteness of my teeth over that one hour. Today, the 2nd day, I kept them in for two hours while awake, and notice they are even whiter. If you can stand the taste of these, they are worth it. But I felt as though I was being slowly poisoned.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and it works!  The price is very reasonable as well.  Need to use it 5 days in a row or every other day for the 5 applications.  I then use it once a month.  Brush your teeth, floss then apply to top and bottom teeth before you go to bed, when you wake up take them off, brush and they are whiter.  EL</li>
    <li> I ordered 5 boxes of the whitening strips and opened one of the boxes.  All three sets of the strips were completely dry.  I did not bother to open the other boxes, I just returned them.  I will just get the strips from my dentist at least I know they will be useable.  I bought these because they were much cheaper than the ones from my dentist.  But you know how the saying goes.  Good things no cheap and cheap things no good!!</li>
    <li> The strips were dry and bulky. They did not whiten teeth as much as the description implied. I should have used something else.</li>
    <li> This strips work great. My mother, her fiance and I buy these strips and they work awesome. The dentist that I go to sells them, but at a much higher price. My last order contained some strips that were dried up which was disappointing, but they refunded my account immediately when I notified them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my husband who naturally has yellow-ish teeth.  They definitely whitened his teeth at least 3 shades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 5 stars because they absolutely whiten your teeth. I applied these right before bed and after 3 days, my teeth were definitely whiter. The sensitivity was very minimal. I just purchased another pack for future use and touch ups. My teeth were terribly stained from coffee, tea, and smoking. I&#x27;ve tried the professional crest strips in the past and experienced more sensitivity and less whitening. I put Sheer white in the fridge because most reviews recommended it.</li>
    <li> My dentist gave me a sample of this product which I loved. I found it on Amazon for $13.99 vs. the $50 my dentist charges for the kit. I ordered two kits and they arrived defective, the strip had lots of white dots unlike the clear one I received from my dentist. Adhesive was poor and the pick tool to aid in applying was not included. I returned but based on the good reviews on Amazon I reordered two more kits hoping for a different result. Second shipment arrived as the first, defective in the same ways as previously mentioned. I am once again returning and will purchase the kit from my dentist. I guess this is one of those cases of \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. I am going to write the manufacturer to see if I can find out how these defective kits wind up in the hands of someone who can sell them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> The sheer white product worked great. My teeth were whiter after first use! Highly recommend and would buy again. Thanks for a positive experience.</li>
    <li> FYI about product. When I purchased these strips from my dentist they told me to keep them refrigerated. Maybe that&#x27;s why people are receiving ones dried up and defective. They must keep longer when cold.</li>
    <li> We bought 6 boxes and returned all  6.  Some of the strips were dreid out with an expiration date into 2015.  Will reorder again, can&#x27;t beat the price.  Hopefully they will be good.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE! The whitening strips we received from this seller were still within their expiration date, but they were dry, rough and had white/opague spots across the surface.  We had originally bought this brand of whitening strip from the dentist, which were clear and very sticky (hard to get your finger unstuck). It is clear that this seller is liquidating an inventory that was not maintained well. We had ordered several boxes because of the great price. None of them were usable. AVOID THIS SELLER!</li>
    <li> I have ordered these in the past without any issues. The last batch I received were awful quality wise. Most of the strips were dried up (even though they don&#x27;t expire until 2015) or had tiny white spots on the strips. I had to throw away most of them</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Bought first one from our dentist for $45 so price through Amazon was much less.  Product worked great and had an expiration date of January 2017.  Arrived on time and in great condition.  Will be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended these as an alternative to the tray and solution method, which I had yet to try.  The kit includes 5 pairs of peroxide strips, one pair per night to be used for 5 consecutive nights.  The instructions were not terrific, but manageable.  It was a little awkward at first since each strip is about 3.5\\&quot; long and you are trying to center it on your teeth without going too high on the gumline, and then tuck it under.  The strips are thicker than Crest strips and the like, and I had a little trouble with my fingers sticking to them.  Note that the peroxide is facing up on the strip when you remove it from the packaging.  I recommend aligning the front first before tucking it around to the back side of your teeth.  Once you have tucked the strip, it is very difficult to start over and correct any poor alignments.  I found it much easier to navigate the top teeth vs. the bottoms, but I got better as the days went on.  Once in position, the kit also includes a little pick so you can tuck the strip around the contours of each tooth.  Be careful as it is possible to poke holes in the strip if you use the sharp end of the pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no issue with these staying in place through the night.  The taste reminded me of a peroxide toothpaste but without the mint flavor.  The strips remove easily and the residue brushes off without a problem.  As for the results, I definitely noticed a difference after Night 1, and more subtle improvements as the week went on.  Overall, I am happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience periodic sensitivity, particularly to cold drinks, but no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist charged $50 for the kit but I see it is much less expensive here on Amazon.  I used these immediately after a formal cleaning at my dentist, and will likely order a kit on a yearly basis.</li>
    <li> I have ordered and used this product from Amazon. I find the strips very effective with less sensitivity than most products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,  I opened my the last kit I had, with an expiration date in 2015, only to find that all of the strips had bacterial growth which had eaten all the adhesive off the strips. The entire kit was useless. I had recommended this product to friends and family, but I quickly told them not to use them after my disappointing discovery.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00563C0DQ Sheer White Teeth Whitening Strips]]&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product one try and saw no change in my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Product has to be worn for 1 to 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;Plus you have to keep in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;Crest White Strips, Professional, are better.</li>
    <li> While the Sheer White strips provided some whitening I didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for. The strips were easy to use and comfortable enough to sleep in. For the price, compared to the dentist office, I&#x27;d probably use them again.</li>
    <li> It was the first time I used this product and it really works. My teeth were noticably whiter with 1 use and a big improvement after 3. It doesn&#x27;t really have good instructions, but most people who have used whitening strips before can figure it out. I will order this again.</li>
    <li> half the price of my dentists office. Took about 7 treatments for an awesome white smile. Great product and price.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of these.</li>
    <li> We all have different color teeth, as my dentist has told me, but I received this as a free promo from my dentist and I love it. I have used the crest strips but I cannot stand the taste and it constantly moves on my teeth, and I I&#x27;d not notice as much of a difference in color as I did with sheer white.  This product does stick very well to your teeth and you can sleep with it, which I did. However when your wake up it did take a while to get the taste out of my mouth. I am sensitive to smell and taste. But i noticed a huge difference in My teeth color. I do drink coffee and smoke, but see my dentist regularly.  I did notice some teeth sensitivity the first time I used it, but it did subside in a day or two. Overall for the price and time, I really like this product I ordered more for myself and as gifts!</li>
    <li> I have used 4 boxes and my teeth are white! I use to be a smoker, coffee drinker and red wine and this product has worked great to remove the stains.</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes in Sept. 2013, used the first right away they were okay, now July 2014 opened the second one and they were all dried out even though the expiration date on the box says Nov. 2015.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and work very well.  my teeth look great, and they&#x27;re much cheaper on line than from the dentist.  good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have used these for about a year, recommended by dentist. In the beginning, I used three times a week and backed off to where I now use only once a week for white teeth, and sometimes only every other week. I have kept in overnight (max 8 hrs) and for the minimum of 2 hours and the results are great. The difference is definitive, as I have caps in the lower back and the caps are at least five shades darker (maybe more). It can be a little sticky and you do need to be patient until you get used to them. Definitely need to use warm water rinse and brush after use to remove the sticky. First few weeks, I was not a fan but stuck with it and now I keep them available at all times. Love them.</li>
    <li> Not sure how many years this product sat on a shelf. Or perhaps the damage occured while sitting in 100 degree heat.  Regardless the product was completely dried out and worthless when it arrived.  I won&#x27;t be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I tried it, the result was not even and I ended up not getting much of a whitening result from it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product earlier when it was carried by our local dentist.  It is very easy to use and does leave my teeth visibly (although not dramatically) whiter.</li>
    <li> I have used the trays and other types of bleaching for several years - this is way easier, works as good or better, and definitely cheaper!  Works great and easy to use!</li>
    <li> The strips I got from my dentist worked very well.  These don&#x27;t seem to have anything (peroxide) on them.  I only use them about once a week as the first ones after 5 days did an amazing job.  If i use them more often, i&#x27;m sure they will keep my teeth white.</li>
    <li> I used the strips and saw improvement but not as much as I expected.</li>
    <li> Not totally pleased with the strips whitening effect.  Age may be a factor.  Still going to use all of them.</li>
    <li> the strips were recommended by the dentist as being a good product, they do seem to work. i have lots of dental work so can only use on the bottom teeth, i used them for 5 nights and got good results. the taste was fine and the strips are much easier to use than the drug store variety. however, i received my strips in late august and they have an expiration date of oct 2012.</li>
    <li> They are so easy to use and do a terrific job!  Love them!</li>
    <li> These work great. Does make your teeth a little sensitive for a short time. But not bad.&lt;br /&gt;Outcome looks great.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for me. Keep in mind that you have to use it more than once to get results. I am a daily coffee drinker and I buy these strips online and use them a few times a week until I get results I&#x27;m happy with and then I only use them when I notice my teeth seem discolored. I do not notice any sensitivity on my upper teeth but do when I use it on my lower. I tried Crest professional and my teeth were sensitive for days afterward.  My friend is an RDH and she said that they tell their patients to cut Sheer White strips in half and stretch them a little to make the pack last longer. Works great for me and I get compliments on my white teeth all the time!</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product! Only 4 stars because of the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It really did whiten my teeth after just 4 applications.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My teeth were REALLY sensitive for the next 24 hours after each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I used the strips:&lt;br /&gt;- DAY 1 (1st application): I put the strips before going to bed (8 hours) with my retainer on top. Woke up okay but them my teeth were sensitive all day.&lt;br /&gt;- I skipped day 2 but no more sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;- DAY 3 (2nd application): Wore them all night with my retainer on top - woke up in so much pain in the middle of the night (5 hours), had to take Advil or Tylenol during the day but the sensitivity was still there.&lt;br /&gt;- I skipped Day 4 but pain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;DAY 5 (3rd application). I decided to wear the strips just for a few hours. Put them on at 9pm with my retainer on top and took an Advil before going to bed. Woke at 1am (4hours) to take them off. Teeth were sensitive in the morning and all day.&lt;br /&gt;- Skipped Day 6 no more pain.&lt;br /&gt;- DAY 7 (4th application). Put them on at night with no retainer on this time and only wore them for 5 hours. Still sensitive in the morning but the pain was bearable this time.&lt;br /&gt;I think wearing the strips with my retainer made the sensitivity really really high but I also have very sensitive teeth. I haven&#x27;t done the 5th application yet. The pain is really too much even though I usually can handle pain really well. When I do the 5th application, it will be for 5 hours max and no retainer on top of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;Except for the sensitivity, I am REALLY REALLY happy with the results. My teeth were yellow before, especially the canines and I can really see the difference now. Will keep using this product and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used these before and really loved them, but the ones I put on last night were just...wrong. There were bubbles in the gel like they had oxidized somehow (or were expired). The expiration date says Sept 2015! I had them on for 2 hours (after I finally got them to stick, which usually isn&#x27;t a problem with these at all) and a piece broke off and peeled off my tooth! I normally wear these overnight but I had to remove them because of that. They did whiten my teeth in that 2 hours though and I will continue to use this product as it is a great product (Just better when it&#x27;s fresh). I hate to think I wasted money (as I don&#x27;t have much to begin with) but it&#x27;s still cheaper than what my dentist charged me for the same product. Even if it was fresh and worked great it wasn&#x27;t worth $60. Especially when I can get 2 boxes of the same product online for $30!!!!!</li>
    <li> Even though the box has a 2015 expiration date, the gel on the strips is very dried out. I bought 2 boxes &amp; have not yet tried the 2nd box. It&#x27;s especially disappointing since this product was recommended by my dentist &amp; I had really like the sample he gave me.</li>
