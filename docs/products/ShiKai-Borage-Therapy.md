      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great for kids with excema.  </li>
      <li>Not as good moisturizer as oatmeal.</li>
      <li>because there are a lot good lotion which has lower hazard level.</li>
      <li>It is a good product so hopefully Amazon will rectify problem.</li>
      <li>This lotion is great, but make sure it&#x27;s not a yellowish color.</li>
      <li>I love it too!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found it here for cheaper!  </li>
      <li>We love this loation!  </li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this incredible product, please don&#x27;t EVER take it off the market!</li>
      <li>There is actually a light, pleasant smell to it that goes away quickly, but even if it remained, it wouldn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
      <li>Oatmeal has more thickness and moisture and non greasy.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love the price and how well they work for me.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with it</li>
      <li>even my husband and I love it and use it all the time...</li>
      <li>My toddler has already healed, but her skin is much more moisturized using this as well.  </li>
      <li>This is much better.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but this is the best for regular maintenance (not treating flare ups).  </li>
      <li>I then ordered two more; these also being discolored and smelled yucky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying more lotion because Winter is coming</li>
      <li>She asked me, when I ordered more, to please get her a bottle too.</li>
      <li>My son and I have very sensitive skin and this lotions feels great.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easily absorb into my 2yrs old skin but it doesn&#x27;t have great grade at EWG website.&lt;br /&gt;well</li>
      <li>ShiKai borage lotion is a very good lotion and helpful for dry skin and also itchy skin.</li>
      <li>Great Product for LOW ODOR and light fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it on my daughter and nephew, and it helped both children to the point that they were eczema free, but please understand it doesn&#x27;t cure it.</li>
      <li>ShiKai Borage Therapy, Children&#x27;s Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8-Ounce]]</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
      <li>However, the ShiKai moisturization is far superior.  </li>
      <li>I actually like the adult lotion better because it is beige colored, but both have the same great, excellent lotion.</li>
      <li>The redness and dryness is completely gone!!!!!!</li>
      <li>rich and creamy lotion, not watery...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
      <li>It is so worth it!</li>
      <li>I originally tried to be fair and gave it 4 stars for its potential even though I had to return.</li>
      <li>I liked that it had all natural ingredients and a lot of them were organic too.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;ve had such good luck with the ShiKai</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion.</li>
      <li>It has no scent, absorbs quickly, and leaves no residue or oily feel</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s mild.</li>
      <li>My son has some mild atopic dermatitis (eczema).</li>
      <li>Our skin absorbs so quickly - and it goes right into the bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It broke the scratch cycle and she looks AMAZING after only 1 1/2 weeks!!</li>
      <li>It says that it&#x27;s fragrance-free but has a distinct odor to it.  </li>
      <li>He applies it right to his scalp.  </li>
      <li>Your skin looks so healthy and glowing.&amp;#34;  She could tell by just looking that the Borage oil products are really making my dry, aging, skin look better.</li>
      <li>I am 49 and love this as a facial moisturizer and for the body too.  </li>
      <li>After two days of using it, his skin is amazingly soft and smooth again.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>No need for a second cream to put on top to lock it in.</li>
      <li>and they go fast!</li>
      <li>Wish they had a bigger size and a better pump though.</li>
      <li>I love the ShiKai  Borage Lotion for Dry skin and the Borage Seed Oil.</li>
      <li>I also have had very chapped hands and their Advanced Formula hand cream has been the only thing that has healed them (they were cracked and bleeding!)  </li>
      <li>OH REALLY?  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really gentle.  </li>
      <li>Amazon has it for a good price, normally $14+ in stores (Whole Foods usually carries it.)  </li>
      <li>This lotion gives her fast relief from her eczema without steroids.  </li>
      <li>so I buy them at Whole Foods whenever it&#x27;s in stock</li>
      <li>No, it&#x27;s not a cure for eczema but her itching lessen very dramatically that even she notice it.</li>
      <li>Very healing for my baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
      <li>It really works for my son who has ezcema.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive to fragrance especially, and this is fragrance free which is a plus.</li>
      <li>but I wanted to find a natural alternative first, if I could.  </li>
      <li>and overall grade was moderate hazard 3 which is best grade in moderate hazard.(1-2 low hazard/3-6 moderate hazard/7-10</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other HIGH concerns:</li>
      <li>and we recommend it highly to anyone who has kids with problem skin.  </li>
      <li>high hazard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend this lotion</li>
      <li>The price is a little better at Amazon than I saw it elsewhere, so I get it on subscribe and save plan.</li>
      <li>This is a soothing lotion and has absolutely no smell which I really enjoy.</li>
      <li>Updated review for Amazon purchase of this lotion to caution new purchasers.</li>
      <li>If you purchase at local stores, the lotion is white and is free of odor.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lotion to parents looking for a natural solution for their children&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t have funny smell and product doesn&#x27;t make skin dry or too greasy but is this really safe?&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow is all I have to say!  </li>
      <li>My hubby scolded me for spending 15 bucks on a small bottle of lotion but just after 3 uses, he took back what he said and suggested we get more!  </li>
      <li>I told her I was only interested in natural products/remedies.  </li>
      <li>My littlest one (nearly 2) had occasional eczema the first 18 months of her life.  </li>
      <li>He&#x27;s 7 months old</li>
      <li>old and my daughter asked me, &amp;#34;Mother, what are you using on your face and neck?</li>
      <li>Her response, \\&quot;Never, never use natural products!\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I gave this lotion 5 star because it relieves my 4 years old daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
      <li>Anyone with sensitive skin, this is the location for you.  </li>
      <li>Within  a few days of using this lotion, the bumps subsided and now he is baby smooth again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We tried every lotion available for our toddler&#x27;s eczema behind his knees and on his arms.  I saw this in Kroger and took a chance.  My hubby scolded me for spending 15 bucks on a small bottle of lotion but just after 3 uses, he took back what he said and suggested we get more!  I&#x27;m just glad I found it here for cheaper!  It does wonders for my son&#x27;s skin.  The redness and dryness is completely gone!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very healing for my baby&#x27;s skin. We even use it on her face. I love it too!</li>
    <li> This does heal eczema prone skin. I&#x27;ve tried it on my daughter and nephew, and it helped both children to the point that they were eczema free, but please understand it doesn&#x27;t cure it. I&#x27;ve ordered a bottle because it&#x27;s been a few years since my daughter last out break of eczema and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores. Kudos to this seller for offering a lower price, it&#x27;s $14-15 in the stores and another seller on amazon is asking $40 plus $10 shipping, outrageous!!!! Buy this product it really is great and so is the price!</li>
    <li> Really helps sensitive, dry skin in the winter months!</li>
    <li> Great Product for LOW ODOR and light fragrance. Yes, this does have an odor. But it&#x27;s mild.</li>
    <li> I love the ShiKai  Borage Lotion for Dry skin and the Borage Seed Oil. I&#x27;m buying more lotion because Winter is coming and my skin will begin to get dry. I use it all over my  body. I don&#x27;t want to run out of the lotion or the oil because Borage works! It really works! I&#x27;m 73 yr. old and my daughter asked me, &amp;#34;Mother, what are you using on your face and neck? Your skin looks so healthy and glowing.&amp;#34;  She could tell by just looking that the Borage oil products are really making my dry, aging, skin look better. She asked me, when I ordered more, to please get her a bottle too. I&#x27;m sold on Borage oil and the ShiKai products that contain borage oil.</li>
    <li> this is a great product that truly moisturizes immediately on contact. It has no scent, absorbs quickly, and leaves no residue or oily feel</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff!!! Took my sons hands from red, itchy and burning mess to almost all redness down in less than 24 hours!</li>
    <li> Good product! It does the job! my only problem wit this product is not all the ingredients are &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have a toddler and an infant with eczema.  Our toddler had such a bad rash she had to go on an intermediate level of prescription steroids.  Once we cured that we started using Mustela Stelatopia and that seemed to help.  We also used that on our infant.  A few weeks later our toddler was fine, but our infant&#x27;s eczema was just getting worse.  We tried Aquaphor, Hydrolatum, Oatmeal baths, Stelatopia, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Hugo Naturals, and various combinations of the above.  Hydrolatum applied over Stelatopia was keeping it from getting worse, but it wasn&#x27;t helping it go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use ShiKai lotions on myself as I love what isn&#x27;t in them (bad stuff) and I love the price and how well they work for me.  I also have had very chapped hands and their Advanced Formula hand cream has been the only thing that has healed them (they were cracked and bleeding!)  Nightly dipping in Aquaphor and Hydrolatum wasn&#x27;t helping me.  Since I&#x27;ve had such good luck with the ShiKai I thought I&#x27;d try the Children&#x27;s Lotion on my daughters.  Wow is all I have to say!  My infant is healed!  No more dry patches!  And all I did was use this for 3 days in the am and pm!  My toddler has already healed, but her skin is much more moisturized using this as well.  And it&#x27;s not greasy!  No spots on clothes that you have to wash out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say we are a very happy family and we recommend it highly to anyone who has kids with problem skin.  Amazon has it for a good price, normally $14+ in stores (Whole Foods usually carries it.)  Stelatopia has been the only similar weight in lotion (as in density) and it isn&#x27;t quite as dense as this is, but both absorb into the skin at an equal rate.  However, the ShiKai moisturization is far superior.  No need for a second cream to put on top to lock it in.</li>
    <li> Great cream for my baby&#x27;s eczema! We&#x27;ve tried a lot of creamsAnd this is the  only product that has worked for us so far!</li>
    <li> My baby girl had a really bad eczema (red, itchy, dry skin on legs,belly and arms)I had her off dairy products thinking it was the cause of it. I found this lotion, started using it an within 2 days the redness and rash went away. I apply the lotion every day after I bathe her and problem solved. (I forgot to apply the lotion for two days and the eczema was coming back again)I HIGHLY recommend this lotion it is A++++++++++++++++</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this product to try as a face moisturizer because I have really sensitive skin. I liked that it had all natural ingredients and a lot of them were organic too. My skin is very sensitive to fragrance especially, and this is fragrance free which is a plus. It may seem weird to use a childrens lotion as face cream, but if you have sensitive skin it&#x27;s worth a try! also it&#x27;s a great deal if you order from vitacost.</li>
    <li> I actually like the adult lotion better because it is beige colored, but both have the same great, excellent lotion.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! My son has eczema. This product cleared his skin without the use of any steroids. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to develop this skin disease it will nip it in bud, in the matter of a couple of days you will see a difference!</li>
    <li> rich and creamy lotion, not watery...no smell at all.  there is some shea butter in here which some sensitive skins can&#x27;t handle, may want to check ingredients still before purchasing, we use it for my sons minor eczema.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best i have used!! It helps clear up eczema and if used daily will keep it gone. I like it myself as a treat for my skin. Its a bit expensive for a small bottle but its worth the $!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this lotion. The one I got was the blue bottle with the gold cap, not sure if they&#x27;re changing the packaging or not. I had tried organic coconut oil, grapeseed oil, pure aloe vera gel, epsom salt baths, oatmeal baths, goat&#x27;s milk soap, aveeno, a handful of other lotions, dietary changes (no dairy, wheat, soy, corn, etc.), cod liver oil, homeopathy, Benadryl, etc. and something told me to try this one. Within a few days, I literally could not believe the difference! My 20-month-old&#x27;s skin stayed soft and moist for the first time since she got eczema in late December (started this lotion beginning of June). It broke the scratch cycle and she looks AMAZING after only 1 1/2 weeks!! She has the tiniest spot left on the crease of her foot and that&#x27;s it. Thank you so much for this incredible product, please don&#x27;t EVER take it off the market! [[ASIN:B000FIJ2VK ShiKai Borage Therapy, Children&#x27;s Lotion, Fragrance Free, 8-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> this lotion is natural and seems to work well but it leaves a nasty after smell.  If it weren&#x27;t for that I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars</li>
    <li> This helps heal the dry skin of my entire family.  No greasy feel.  Clears up some extreme redness, itching and eczema.  Wish they had a bigger size and a better pump though.</li>
    <li> Great lotion! It really works for my son who has ezcema.</li>
    <li> Not as good moisturizer as oatmeal. Oatmeal has more thickness and moisture and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;this lotion is very thin so you will need more.</li>
    <li> We love this loation!  Anyone with sensitive skin, this is the location for you.  Price is a little expensive on Amazon so I buy them at Whole Foods whenever it&#x27;s in stock and they go fast!</li>
    <li> ShiKai borage lotion is a very good lotion and helpful for dry skin and also itchy skin. The price is a little better at Amazon than I saw it elsewhere, so I get it on subscribe and save plan.</li>
    <li> My baby has eczema and this lotion doesn&#x27;t help:(</li>
    <li> Updated review for Amazon purchase of this lotion to caution new purchasers. I reordered same item 3 different times hoping to get a bottle that pumped white lotion and was fragrance-free. This lotion is great, but make sure it&#x27;s not a yellowish color. I bought one that had a bad odor and the lotion itself came out of the pump a discolored yellow. Wrote Amazon to inform of bad batch and need for quality assurance, but no reply. If you&#x27;ve used this lotion before, you know it&#x27;s supposed to be white and has no fragrance. I originally tried to be fair and gave it 4 stars for its potential even though I had to return. I then ordered two more; these also being discolored and smelled yucky. After the inconvenience of returning more bottles that were bad, I decided to knock review to 1 star to warn customers. If you purchase at local stores, the lotion is white and is free of odor. It is a good product so hopefully Amazon will rectify problem.</li>
    <li> I use this at the end of the day, after changing out of my work clothes, on my armpits. Works great. No rash from reapplying stick deodorant.</li>
    <li> Although this is for children, adults will like it, too!  There is actually a light, pleasant smell to it that goes away quickly, but even if it remained, it wouldn&#x27;t bother me!</li>
    <li> I only give this lotion two stars because of the smell. My son and I have very sensitive skin and this lotions feels great. It hydrates the skin without being oily. But I am also very sensitive to smell and this lotion smells like eggs and had me vomiting due to it. So in this household this lotion is useless</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I purchased for my baby nephew that has eczema. He had tiny little red bumps all over his poor little cheeks and arms.  Within  a few days of using this lotion, the bumps subsided and now he is baby smooth again. This is now part of his daily regimine. I now subscribe to this product and have it delivered every two months. It is so worth it!</li>
    <li> Our teenage daughter has struggled with seasonal allergies showing up as a rash on her face, neck and arms.  The dermatologist wanted to put her on steroids.  Absolutely not.  I told her I was only interested in natural products/remedies.  Her response, \\&quot;Never, never use natural products!\\&quot;  Hmm....OH REALLY?  What do you know?!!  I was so frustrated after spending so much money trying to figure out what was causing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered what Dr. Mercola said -- \\&quot;Never put anything on your body that you wouldn&#x27;t eat.\\&quot;  Our skin absorbs so quickly - and it goes right into the bloodstream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I shopped and shopped until I found this lotion -- this was the ticket.  No perfumes, no dyes, nothing unnatural.  It soothed and healed these areas.  Now we use only this lotion for the entire family.  It has remedied my husband&#x27;s dandruff.  He applies it right to his scalp.  (He has a buzz cut.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best best stuff.</li>
    <li> Both of my children have eczema and this is the only lotion that works for them.  It says that it&#x27;s fragrance-free but has a distinct odor to it.  I&#x27;m okay with it and it helps with the kids&#x27; very dry skin and eczema so I just don&#x27;t mind the odor.</li>
    <li> Love it. I should have gotten it for my kids sooner. It softens skin without being greasy.</li>
    <li> My littlest one (nearly 2) had occasional eczema the first 18 months of her life.  Part of this is probably due to the fact we live in a very arid climate, but part of it is just sensitive skin.  I knew I could take her in and get a prescription for something but I wanted to find a natural alternative first, if I could.  I found this at my local natural foods store.  This lotion is the bomb.  When she&#x27;s having a little flare-up, I just slather it on immediately after a lukewarm bath, and then hit any dry patches every time I change a diaper.  Works like a charm.  I got a friend of mine a bottle for her little girl who was having eczema issues, and she swears by it, too.  Great product.  I buy it on amazon as a subscription and save myself money, too.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s easily absorb into my 2yrs old skin but it doesn&#x27;t have great grade at EWG website.&lt;br /&gt;well this is what i got from EWG. and overall grade was moderate hazard 3 which is best grade in moderate hazard.(1-2 low hazard/3-6 moderate hazard/7-10 high hazard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other HIGH concerns: Endocrine disruption&lt;br /&gt;Other MODERATE concerns: Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive), Contamination concerns, Biochemical or cellular level changes&lt;br /&gt;Other LOW concerns: Ecotoxicology, Data gaps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t have funny smell and product doesn&#x27;t make skin dry or too greasy but is this really safe?&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t answer that and i do not have intention to try another one.. because there are a lot good lotion which has lower hazard level.</li>
    <li> I have kids with itchy dry skin and Ive tried it all (from raw coconut oil, raw shea butter, even tried making my own lotions) but this is the best lotion I have come across to date...even my husband and I love it and use it all the time...just wish it came in larger size bottles!!</li>
    <li> This is a soothing lotion and has absolutely no smell which I really enjoy.</li>
    <li> Great for kids with excema.  It really helps that itchy dry skin.</li>
    <li> The smell is just plain nasty! Prefer any other natural lotion to this one!</li>
    <li> I am 49 and love this as a facial moisturizer and for the body too.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a fragrance, doesn&#x27;t cause itching or breakouts. It&#x27;s really gentle.  I decided to try this after using up my bottle of regular ShiKai lotion and wanting something a little more gentle, since the regular formula would occasionally sting my skin.  This is much better.</li>
    <li> My son has some mild atopic dermatitis (eczema). He&#x27;s 7 months old and this started a little before he was 4 months. We tried oils, oatmeal baths, Aveeno, petroleum jelly, Aquaphor, etc. All things seemed to help a little, but only temporarily. This stuff though? After two days of using it, his skin is amazingly soft and smooth again.</li>
    <li> I used this like 2 times and had to stop because i just don&#x27;t like the fragrance it have however it did give moisturize,i will try to mix with some thing to help with the scent.</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion 5 star because it relieves my 4 years old daughter&#x27;s eczema. No, it&#x27;s not a cure for eczema but her itching lessen very dramatically that even she notice it. After applying ShiKai to her skin twice a day for 2 days I saw big improvement to her skin. I highly recommend this lotion to parents looking for a natural solution for their children&#x27;s eczema.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion on my girls for several years. It has helped clear up minor skin irritations and keeps their skin from drying out during the winter months.</li>
    <li> We live in the desert where climate is pretty much dry and barely and humidity all year round so my son&#x27;s skin tends to get really dry. This lotion really keeps the moisture in the skin and helps reduce dry patches on the skin.</li>
    <li> We tried a lot of things but this is the best for regular maintenance (not treating flare ups).  We have been using it for 3 years for our daughter.</li>
    <li> The only non-prescription lotion that works on my daughter&#x27;s eczema - all the others we tried either offered no relief or, for a few, actually caused her to break out further!  This lotion gives her fast relief from her eczema without steroids.  Wonderful product.</li>
