      <li>This treatment Leaves my hair so soft and shiny that I&#x27;m planning to reorder.</li>
      <li>something that really repairs blonde damaged hair.</li>
      <li>It really should be used according to instructions but even if just used like regular conditioner and left on for 2-3 minutes, it still leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>

    <li> Keep your Hair strong.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry do to straightening process and this product has brought back to life. I highly recommend to anyone who is experiencing this.</li>
    <li> My hair is course, over colored and DRY, DRY, DRY with just enough natural wave to be agrivating.  My new hair dresser suggested Sebastian Masque to use instead of conditioner.  At first I towel dried my hair after washing, applied a handful then put a cap over it for 30 minuets.  Within a month my hair was healthy!  Now, I put 1/2 that amount on, no cap and leave it in about 10 minuets. It&#x27;s still healthy!</li>
    <li> The older version of penetraitt was much better.i think they changed the formula.    Denise ([...])</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair, soft , silky and shiny. I am very pleased with this product! One of the best conditioners i have tried, and trust me i have tried many of them!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hair stylist.  I have been meaning to put it on my hair with a shower cap and sit under a dryer, but haven&#x27;t gotten around to that.  Instead I use it in the shower where it only gets to sit for a few minutes.  Still, it is a wonderful product.  My hair is soft and silky but not weighed down.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the size specification, so when I received it and saw that it was twice the size of the picture I was really excited! Good product and smells really nice. I use it at least once a week and for better pentration of the Penetraitt Repair Masque I use it with the [[ASIN:B003TPTGDK Thermal Spa Professional Conditioning Heat Cap Model No. C27L]] , leave it on for about 30 minutes (meanwhile, I watch an episode or two of How I Met your Mother :D )and then at the end it&#x27;s better if you rinse it off with cold water. If you don&#x27;t like showering with cold water, (I know I don&#x27;t, specially when it&#x27;s cold out) what I do is that I rinse it off in the sink. And it leaves my hair soooo smooth and shiny, and smelling delishh!</li>
    <li> Great conditioner, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> It helps a lot to ypur hair, it is like magical....I like it souch, I recommend this for girl who has an aggressive hair</li>
    <li> This item complies with condicones Information. In terms of price and quality is acceptable. I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Sebastian Penetraitt is one of the best hair conditioners and hair repair products out there. It really should be used according to instructions but even if just used like regular conditioner and left on for 2-3 minutes, it still leaves hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Speedy shipping and great prices, thank you! I will be back :)</li>
    <li> something that really repairs blonde damaged hair. it really works , smells divine, I&#x27;m going to start using these products again, my hair is beginning to feel flimsy again... a must have</li>
    <li> My husband bought this product for me and it works really good. My hair is long, and curly and I do no use chemicals on it. When I apply this mascarilla in my hair, I roll dry and then I take off the waves of the rolls with the blower. The result of my hair is a shany, healthy looking hair. I am in love with the Sebastian products and I also own the shampoo and conditioner which also do a good job in my hair.</li>
    <li> This treatment Leaves my hair so soft and shiny that I&#x27;m planning to reorder. Good price for the size 😀</li>
    <li> i love this mask, make my hair super glossy , shine ,and straight, with no frizz or puffynes! just dont over put it on ur hair, just for 15-20 min, thats it! then take away. u dont need to brush ur hair after:)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.  After using this for 4 weeks I am confident I can give an honest review.  I have used this product both with and without heat.  I have long hair that has some split ends, as well as dryness due to styling.  I like to keep my hair long and try ways to keep it soft and conditioned to increase length, as well as to continue to grow my hair longer.  Unfortunately after using this product I felt no benefit.  I did not feel that it increased the manageability or softness, and it definitely did not help with detangling.  These are the  features of a deep conditioner that I look for.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have been using it as a conditioner every other day and I can not live without it.  It works well for extreemly curly and frezzy hair. I blow dry my hair after and it has been helping me to keep my hair healthy</li>
    <li> Works wonders, I am a regular highlighted blonde, and my hair gets thin and dry... this product works great, it really changes my hair. love it and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I received the wrong hair treatment, diferent to the one I ordered. I did not wanted this, but I made the mistake of openning it and I can&#x27;t return it anymore. NOT HAPPY!!!.... VERY DISAPOINTED!!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my wife. She has used it for a couple of years and says that it is the best conditioner that she has ever had,She recommends this for anyone that has dry hair, as it does allow for using a hair dryer, as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara, but I still prefer Kerastase.</li>
    <li> This honestly save dmy hair of 10 hrs of dying and processing in a salon! so i had to purchase it!! all the sebastion products not only smell amazing but are really good and show results quickly!! great wrapping and gr8 size!</li>
