      <li>love, maureen</li>
      <li>It was an okay wig cap.</li>
      <li>WHILE YOU WEAR YOUR FAVORITE WIG/ LACE FRONT WIG....</li>
      <li>Safely packaged and this will be a repurchase.</li>
      <li>took so many weeks</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t know for sure until I try and wear it with the wig to the Comic-con.</li>
      <li>I think it will be okay</li>
      <li>I DO have other products that kind of forcibly tames my hair, but this gives the best result.</li>
      <li>The cap stretched perfectly and covered my hair.</li>
      <li>While the wig cap&#x27;s quality is fine (though fitting a bit snug, I prefer that)</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t tear easily like I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Worked fine under costume wig</li>
      <li>but it was fine for what I purchased them for.  </li>
      <li>these will do just fine</li>
      <li>/&gt;They fit fine</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
      <li>This works great on my hair (mid shoulder blade).</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
      <li>I like the snug feeling because it feels secure</li>
      <li>I wish it had some clips or something to keep it secure on my head</li>
      <li>The cap did a remarkable job of holding my think mane in place for the entire 8 hours that I wore my wig.</li>
      <li>It is wonderful fits all kinds of short and long hair and lots and light and very comfortable at bedtime</li>
      <li>It was ok if you like a real snug fit.  </li>
      <li>It keeps your hair in place, doesn&#x27;t move the entire time it&#x27;s on your head and was incredibly durable for how much I tugged on it.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
      <li>i love what i got for a very reasonable price..i would love to buy more in the future xD</li>
      <li>I have hair, so no matter what I do, full wigs slip on my head.</li>
      <li>but if you want something really good quality, I don&#x27;t recommend this one unless you&#x27;re just wearing a simple wig, then go for it!</li>
      <li>It does a really nice job keeping all the natural hair in place &amp; out of the way for wig wearing.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it was great.</li>
      <li>The product got here quickly.</li>
      <li>Fit nice, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and lays my hair flat</li>
      <li>It caused my head to sweat more than normal.</li>
      <li>Works great in securing my haire down, and it looks like I just braided it when I take it off.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>it makes wearing my wigs much easier and helps with the fit :0)</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the $2 it cost.</li>
      <li>but I will make sure products I order are not coming directly from China..</li>
      <li>have pretty short hair, My shortest layers are an inch and my longest are about 3-4, so this wig wasn&#x27;t very tight at all, in fact, it was perfect!</li>
      <li>This was my first time wearing a wig of any sort.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the order had actually gone through.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware when I purchased them ..&lt;</li>
      <li>I finally got to pull mine out for my wig today and I will say it does hold my hair in place for the most part.</li>
      <li>I would buy them again in the future if I needed more.</li>
      <li>I gave it all the stars because the errors are most likely the users error.</li>
      <li>the material is pretty odly this feeling but the elasticity around the rim is</li>
      <li>they thought it was funny</li>
      <li>so I have a spare if I wear out the first one.</li>
      <li>a I am shiping for them hoping they enjoy a different look for fun.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I purchased wigs for Cosplay and I admittedly don&#x27;t know much about these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m wearing this for my cosplay, but if you have a large head or slightly large head</li>
      <li>too good and kinda hard to stay on my head.</li>
      <li>These really help keep all your hair up and out of the way.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much to say.</li>
      <li>Keeps your real hair out of the way well.</li>
      <li>but I manage very well with it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much complaints</li>
      <li>idk why maybe i have to much hair the reason i say</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It was ok if you like a real snug fit.  It was a little tight on my head.  I can imagine prolonged wear would give me a headache but it was fine for what I purchased them for.  I wanted my potential hat clients to put them on before trying on a hat.  So for that, it was great.  I tried sleeping in one, it was too tight and uncomfortable to me for that.</li>
    <li> I have crazy frizzy and fly-away hair. I ordered these for wig-wearing, but when that interest waned, I started using these for &amp;#34;taming&amp;#34; my hair. After showering before bedtime, I dry my hair a bit with COLD air, apply a little biosilk, and put this cap on. In the morning, I wake up with totally normal hair! I DO have other products that kind of forcibly tames my hair, but this gives the best result. Very soft and natural results.</li>
    <li> Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !</li>
    <li> Works great in securing my haire down, and it looks like I just braided it when I take it off.</li>
    <li> these would not hold my hair up idk why maybe i have to much hair the reason i say&lt;br /&gt;i liked it was cause my kids had a blast playing with it they thought it was funny but i wont be buying again</li>
    <li> Great fit have no problems with it at all stay&#x27;s in place! Thx&#x27;s</li>
    <li> wig cap holds nicely to head making it easy to apply wig I also use clips to help it stay in place</li>
    <li> I finally got to pull mine out for my wig today and I will say it does hold my hair in place for the most part. It&#x27;s possible maybe it&#x27;s a bit big or I just have a lot of hair but I manage very well with it. I&#x27;d recommend it for wig users.</li>
    <li> the material is pretty odly this feeling but the elasticity around the rim is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just need wig caps these will do just fine</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig cap to go with my Geisha wig that I bought here, too. It kept my hair out of the way as designed so all you saw was my Geisha wig. Don&#x27;t wear it for more than about 6-7 hours though as its a little snug after awhile-unless you are used to it. This was my first time wearing a wig of any sort. And I think I got two of them so I have a spare if I wear out the first one. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for wearing a wig, or even if you just want your hair out of the way for a bit.</li>
    <li> It ripped as soon as I took it out of the bag because it stuck to the tape on the packaging....totally wasn&#x27;t worth my time to purchase it...</li>
    <li> what can I say the wig cap works! they hold hair in place keep wig from slipping! The deliver was okay!</li>
    <li> The thing will not stay on the head. Not my adult head nor my 20 month old daughter&#x27;s head. I&#x27;ll just stick with the ones I buy from Sally Beauty store. I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> i have received these wig cap a lot earlier than i had thought..i tried them on and they fit on my head perfectly..plus they hold my hair well and i don&#x27;t have any complaints about them..i love what i got for a very reasonable price..i would love to buy more in the future xD</li>
    <li> Goes qirh the qifts for  the cancer patients they need a littlr pick  me up  withe wi c.f. a I am shiping for them hoping they enjoy a different look for fun.</li>
    <li> The order was on time.  I have been wearing wigs lately and these fit the bill.  My hair is shorter and this keeps it out of site when wearing the wigs.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I saw the shape and how tight it was at first, but after I wore it once it stretched to fit my head and is really nice. It didn&#x27;t look like the picture but, the quality is nice and I got 2 like it said. I like the snug feeling because it feels secure and I think it&#x27;s comfortable. It keeps my hair in like its suppose to and it doesn&#x27;t tear easily like I thought it would. I don&#x27;t have much complaints but if you want something really good quality, I don&#x27;t recommend this one unless you&#x27;re just wearing a simple wig, then go for it! I&#x27;m wearing this for my cosplay, but if you have a large head or slightly large head then I also don&#x27;t recommend this because its kind of small.</li>
    <li> I tried my wig on with this wig cap...and it kept slipping off...I plan on wearing it on new years....once I actually wear it...I will update this review.</li>
    <li> the wig cap is comfortable and not very itchy I rated it a 4 because they stay on and my hair doesn&#x27;t get in my face</li>
    <li> I had a hard time getting it to stay on my head so I sown it to my braids and it worked perfectly</li>
    <li> It does a really nice job keeping all the natural hair in place &amp; out of the way for wig wearing.</li>
    <li> This two pack that i got fits perfect on my wifes normal size head. I wouldn&#x27;t care to buy these again.</li>
    <li> I have hair, so no matter what I do, full wigs slip on my head. This is a nice cap and it fits snug and all, but wigs still slip off and it comes off with them.</li>
    <li> Just like any other wig cap. No holes in it! works well and puts all my hair away! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, and a very good seller. I bought a wig and this cap at the same for a cosplay, and this actually came in before the wig!&lt;br /&gt;I received it way before I expected to, which was really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty short hair, My shortest layers are an inch and my longest are about 3-4, so this wig wasn&#x27;t very tight at all, in fact, it was perfect! Keeps my hair in really nicely and I can tell it&#x27;s going to last me a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Very poor quality ripped when it came from package. I ordered two and the second one ripped when I  tried toput on. I do not have nails so that is not the reason. I would not recommend this product. I tried to wear them even ripped and they slid off my  head and bunched up under wig.</li>
    <li> I got all but one wig it says delivered but havent seen it .. One wig was red and white not pink and white so over all im not happy</li>
    <li> The fit was too loose.</li>
    <li> The wig caps worked great. Very nice and  good quality. I would buy them again in the future if I needed more.</li>
    <li> It was not at all what I ordered based on the description and picture!  Instead of receiving the wig caps that I ordered, I was sent du-rags with long ends that would have obviously stuck out from under a wig.  I needed these for a video taping session, and there was no time to send them back to get what I actually ordered.  Will not order from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> it is a very nice product</li>
    <li> It was an okay wig cap. works well.</li>
    <li> Once I receive my wig that I purchased this will be perfect to use. I just am so excited and anxious to get ready to use it.</li>
    <li> TO SMALL WITH HAIR UNDER IT</li>
    <li> This works great on my hair (mid shoulder blade). Keeps my hair out of the way for my wig. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> If you plan on buying a wig this wig cap is a must have. I have long hair so I tied my hair into a bun and wore the cap over my head under my wig. It kept my hair in place all day, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about embarrassing fly-aways. This cap is a MUST HAVE.</li>
    <li> Worked fine under costume wig</li>
    <li> Now that I have  been wearing this for a few months, it&#x27;s only just now starting to over stretch.  But no rips or anything. Only slight problem I had was it sort of curling up at the nap of my neck. Made it feel slightly tighter than it should.</li>
    <li> Keeps your real hair out of the way well.</li>
    <li> I wait a long time to get these I guess they had to ship from China I wasn&#x27;t aware when I purchased them ..&lt;br /&gt;They fit fine but I think I could have avoid spending on these.</li>
    <li> The cap stretched perfectly and covered my hair. It was a great addition to my costume. Even after two uses still held up and did not stretch out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend one of these things if you&#x27;re wearing any kind of wig.  It may make you sweat a bit but it&#x27;ll keep the itch away from the netting that plastic hair is glued to.  It keeps your hair in place, doesn&#x27;t move the entire time it&#x27;s on your head and was incredibly durable for how much I tugged on it.  Definitely worth the $2 it cost.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product, not for use as a wig cap, but as a night cap. This product worked incredibly well to keep my hair in place while I slept. My previous night caps would usually slip off at night but these did not. Seeing that these worked so well for my purpose, these would definitely work just as well as only wig caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely be re- ordering this product again and I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s so cheap and so i kinda expected the quality.&lt;br /&gt;not too good and kinda hard to stay on my head. probably because of my hair but honestly, this feels more like... socks.&lt;br /&gt;you can get it if you want to but i won&#x27;t recommend... if you need something with good quality.</li>
    <li> While the wig cap&#x27;s quality is fine (though fitting a bit snug, I prefer that) there&#x27;s only one cap, not two. Other than that, it was great.</li>
    <li> This was used for costume purposes for a Halloween costume and it fit the bill perfectly.  It was used under a wig.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Does what it should, holds hair so you can put a wig on easier, self explanatory really.&lt;br /&gt;For me it wasn&#x27;t too tight at all, it felt like it wasn&#x27;t even there. (But seems other people think it&#x27;s too tight? So guess you have a 50/50 chance with that being an issue~)</li>
    <li> Nice quality and Not thin which is great.Safely packaged and this will be a repurchase.Hopefully this also comes in a nude color too.</li>
    <li> This is very tight, which is either good or bad.  It&#x27;s up to your preference.  Does the job though and that&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> It is wonderful fits all kinds of short and long hair and lots and light and very comfortable at bedtime</li>
    <li> it met my expectations and I would purchase from seller again! it makes wearing my wigs much easier and helps with the fit :0)</li>
    <li> I found the cap to be a little tight and uncomfortable to wear.  It caused my head to sweat more than normal.</li>
    <li> These really help keep all your hair up and out of the way.  They are comfortable and easy to use, the band came down a little too far on my forehead so I had to do some adjusting.</li>
    <li> The cap did a remarkable job of holding my think mane in place for the entire 8 hours that I wore my wig.</li>
    <li> Love it..but I will make sure products I order are not coming directly from China..took so many weeks I wasn&#x27;t sure the order had actually gone through.But product is great!</li>
    <li> Good quality wig caps for the price. I have not complaints the wig caps protect my hair from breakage. Great</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pack of two wig caps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;exactly as described and effective for their purpose&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got butt-length, medium-thickness wavy hair and this wig cap can keep all the hair flat against my head for 10+ hours under a wig easily, with little need for adjustment during the day. It&#x27;s really just a normal wig cap. Nothing special about it. It just does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package I received arrived unopened with no flaws or surprises. The wig caps were exactly what I expected them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say.</li>
    <li> Received this and it looks just as advertised so no surprises.  Happy with my purchase and can just it over and over.</li>
    <li> Keeps your hair under your wig.</li>
    <li> Got this 2 pack of wig caps for my girls for halloween. They were Thing 1 and Thing 2 and these worked great and made it so much easier to put and keep the wigs on! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This is a basic item, I like the broad band because it doesn&#x27;t give me a head ache by obstructing the blood flow to my head.  Hopefully the day will come when I won&#x27;t need the wig---but I am so tired of my poor hair breaking and falling out--that I will indeed wear a wig so my hair can rest.  love, maureen</li>
    <li> The product got here quickly. I like this product. I&#x27;m not sure how to compare it because I&#x27;ve never used something like this before. It&#x27;s not hot and it fits,  nut it comes a little low on my forehead and it wants to slide off easily. I think it will be okay once I snap the wig on. I won&#x27;t know for sure until I try and wear it with the wig to the Comic-con. It&#x27;s like having pantyhose on my head. I wish it had some clips or something to keep it secure on my head and it would be nice if it didn&#x27;t naturally go past the wig hair line. When I push it even with the wig hairline that&#x27;s when it feels like it might come off, but it didn&#x27;t come off in the short time I tried on the wigs, so I think it&#x27;ll stay. It came with two in a pack and I was happy with the product quality. I gave it all the stars because the errors are most likely the users error. This is the first time I purchased wigs for Cosplay and I admittedly don&#x27;t know much about these products.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I&#x27;d buy again. Fit nice, does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and lays my hair flat so on days when I want to throw on a wig and keep it moving it leaves no bumpy head</li>
    <li> Good product, works well. It came in the mail in just two days. All in all I recommend to anyone needing a cap.</li>
    <li> I got my wig cap on time and it fits great. I am giving it 5 stars, very happy with my order.</li>
    <li> KEEP MY NATURAL HAIR IN PLACE ...AND I DONT HAVE SPLIT ENDS NO MORE...IT PROTECTS THE HAIR WHILE YOU WEAR YOUR FAVORITE WIG/ LACE FRONT WIG....IT KEEPS YOUR HAIR SAFE FROM DAMAGE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE.</li>
