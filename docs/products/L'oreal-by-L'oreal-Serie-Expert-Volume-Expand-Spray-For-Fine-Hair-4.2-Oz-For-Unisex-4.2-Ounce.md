      <li>I ordered this product to volumize my fine</li>

      <li>I wish it was available at US.</li>
      <li>They changed the product and not as good would like to try and find old inventory some one has would like to buy</li>

      <li>Everyone with fine or thinning hair knows you don&#x27;t want a heavy product.</li>
      <li>I have medium fine hair that tends to go flat within a few hours.  </li>
      <li>However, and this is why it is not 5 stars, it is pricey and it can cause major product build-up in your hair.  </li>
      <li>I have a lot of thick, but fine hair, and II&#x27;ve used this for several years.  </li>

<li> instead it weighed it down and even made it greasy-</li>
<li> I feel like it weighs my hair down.</li>
<li> this store is displaying a photo of LOREAL VOLUME EXPAND, yet they are sending you a product called \\&quot;Loreal Volume Extreme, which was discontinued in 2009!  </li>
<li> No strong scent that lasts.  </li>
<li> you will not be disappointed!</li>

    <li> After I was my hear, I apply, and then mousse.  Blow dry and style and hope that my hair holds.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this product and the service I received.    Thank you.</li>
    <li> this store is displaying a photo of LOREAL VOLUME EXPAND, yet they are sending you a product called \\&quot;Loreal Volume Extreme, which was discontinued in 2009!  They are not a licenced L&#x27;oreal store or reseller!</li>
    <li> This is a great volumizing spray.  It holds up well and works better than any other spray or mousse I&#x27;ve used.  No strong scent that lasts.  However, and this is why it is not 5 stars, it is pricey and it can cause major product build-up in your hair.  I had to get a clarifying shampoo to help with this.  When I am dressing up, I towel dry my hair, spray this in it, use hot rollers, and finally put finishing gloss/moroccan oil on my ends and my hair looks shiny, full, healthy and like Bridget Bardot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best volumizer I have ever used.  The volumizer does not leave a residue or stiffness in my hair, just an invisible serum product leaving my hair full and natural.  I dont even have to shampoo my hair the next day, something I always have to do with other products.</li>
    <li> I have very fine blonde hair and my hairdresser used this on me.  It REALLY works!  It does not make my hair darker either. This is a great product...you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> expected more of it, do not give me the volume I want but still gives you a good shine its not bad</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother in law and she loves this stuff. It&#x27;s all she uses . A good value ...</li>
    <li> They changed the product and not as good would like to try and find old inventory some one has would like to buy</li>
    <li> Everyone with fine or thinning hair knows you don&#x27;t want a heavy product. This just doesn&#x27;t do a thing. I feel like it weighs my hair down. On to the next product!</li>
    <li> this is a product that I have been using for some time and swear by- the opportunity to purchase 2 at a great price came my way. Great company- quick service-one happy camper.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to volumize my fine hair- instead it weighed it down and even made it greasy- despite the fact that I did not use too much. I would not order this again.</li>
    <li> when I purchased this product, it was working very good, however , it started to lose it&#x27;s magic.. maybe my hair has changed , overall it&#x27;s a very good product</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal Expert Volume Expand Spray for Fine Hair, for over a year.  I have fine hair and it holds for 3 or more days.</li>

    <li> Product make my fine hair more voluminous, not tacky or dulling.  I wish it was available at US. beauty product stores and not waiting for it to come from Poland!!  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of thick, but fine hair, and II&#x27;ve used this for several years.  I find that when I spray it on damp hair before styling, it gives me just the amount of body I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> great stuff - good price - hard to find in salons. only my second purchase but happy i found it</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve purchased - I really like it for my fine hair as it doesn&#x27;t leave it stiff and sticky like many other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have medium fine hair that tends to go flat within a few hours.  This spray doesn&#x27;t change the texture or give any lift at all after blow drying.</li>
    <li> needed something to thicken my hair and noticed a difference after first time using it and would certainly recommend it</li>
