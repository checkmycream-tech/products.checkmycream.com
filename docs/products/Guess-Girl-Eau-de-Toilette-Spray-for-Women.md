      <li>Highly pleased.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite perfumes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alluring and sexy and probably one of my favorite scents; however, it has zero staying power.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells.</li>
      <li>So light and sexy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light but still prominent.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend excellent product, I am satisfied with the same quality product.</li>
      <li>I am very fickle when it comes to perfume, but I love this!</li>
      <li>This perfume has a nice scent but it fades to fast</li>
      <li>This may be my new favorite perfume :)</li>
      <li>I love it smells exactly like my sisters.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light but subtly sensually floral, perfect for day-wear or a night on the town.</li>
      <li>Received quickly and product as decribed</li>
      <li>Finished it so quick</li>
      <li>I received t quickly and with no issues.</li>
      <li>Lovely and mature.</li>
      <li>Fiance loved this out of all other perfumes Ive tried.</li>
      <li>On the bright side, the price is low enough to where I can just use it more regularly and purchase more often.</li>
      <li>and it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Really pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft, girly and light.</li>
      <li>loooove this perfume so much!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more to the mature side but not too mature.</li>
      <li>light lovely smell, but it only last about 3-4 hours</li>
      <li>It smells very feminine, but not fruity.</li>
      <li>I wish the lotion was available individually.</li>
      <li>A wonderful item for pairing with a Victoria&#x27;s Secret ensemble!!</li>
      <li>This perfume is deep and rich.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, when it is on me for that first hour it does smell very nice.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very laid back and floral and sweet but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>I love the subtle smell of this perfume.</li>
      <li>I guess this is a little true, but I don&#x27;t like overpowering perfumes so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
      <li>Bought this to replace the one I went through, and I know prices on amazon change frequently, but this was a steel (for the larger size)!</li>
      <li>(tempted to buy it again even though I&#x27;m not out of the other bottle haha).  </li>
      <li>I have about 7 different perfumes that I use that are high quality, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>

    <li> excellent responsible</li>

    <li> product is alright but I loved the customer service super duper polite</li>
    <li> very good product recommended 100 %</li>
    <li> El aroma es DIVINO, el perfume llego intacto bien empacado.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. It&#x27;s soft, girly and light. I really liked perfumes with more essences. But anyway,  this was really nice.</li>
    <li> Love this smell it&#x27;s very laid back and floral and sweet but doesn&#x27;t last very long. I still like it smells really nice</li>
    <li> Without even smelling the perfume, i bought this on a whim. It is a very light, wonderful scent. I wish the lotion was available individually.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend excellent product, I am satisfied with the same quality product.</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells. It&#x27;s a light but subtly sensually floral, perfect for day-wear or a night on the town. It&#x27;s alluring and sexy and probably one of my favorite scents; however, it has zero staying power. Zip. Nada. I sprayed it all over my wrists and two hours later hardly a whiff remained. On the bright side, the price is low enough to where I can just use it more regularly and purchase more often.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Valentines Day.  Wow!  She loves it and so do I!  Use with care, friends.  A wonderful item for pairing with a Victoria&#x27;s Secret ensemble!!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. Lingers all day but not to heavy.</li>
    <li> i ordered a 3.4 Fl. Oz. and i recieved a 1.7 Fl. O.z I´m dissapointed,</li>
    <li> Originally loved the scent of this perfume. But when I bought it and started wearing it, I realized that the scent does not last long AT ALL. I have about 7 different perfumes that I use that are high quality, and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t last very long. After 1 hour I can&#x27;t even smell it on me anymore. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, when it is on me for that first hour it does smell very nice.</li>
    <li> loooove this perfume so much!  I saw it in the Guess store, but was NOT about to pay almost $60 for it.  I immediately took my phone out and looked it up on Amazon and bought it for almost half the price.  I actually see that it&#x27;s now even cheaper than it was when I bought it a year ago!  (tempted to buy it again even though I&#x27;m not out of the other bottle haha).  People complain on here about it not lasting.  I guess this is a little true, but I don&#x27;t like overpowering perfumes so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I can still smell it on my wrists throughout the day, but I&#x27;m sure my coworkers can&#x27;t smell me from across the room.  So I think it&#x27;s all about preference.  I like perfumes that aren&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> I sprayed this on at Walgreens, bcs I like pink... LOVED IT! Just a spritz on each wrist hours ago, and I still smell it. Not sure about the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; comments. Will purchase.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this product. It smells divine and the price/quantity is fantastic! I am very fickle when it comes to perfume, but I love this!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend. She really loved it.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and product as decribed</li>
    <li> I love this product. The smell is very nice and it isn&#x27;t too overpowering. Fiance loved this out of all other perfumes Ive tried.</li>
    <li> love this product would buy again</li>
    <li> very good product, hope to deal with you again. im very happy with it</li>
    <li> Love the smell!  Great price too.</li>
    <li> love it that&#x27;s what she said</li>
