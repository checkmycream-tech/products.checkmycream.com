      <li>Only comes off with very warm water!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful for busy moms that have to keep their make up regime quick.</li>
      <li>This is the most comfortable mascara I have found.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove when needed.  </li>
      <li>Usually, easy to remove makeup smudges and runs during the day, but the trade-off does no apply to this.</li>
      <li>Plus it stays on but truly is easy to remove.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have time to do full eye make up most days</li>
      <li>My mom likes it though, and she uses it just fine.</li>
      <li>All it takes to wash off, is some warm water in the shower, and a gentle rub</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this mascara for several years and it works great.  </li>
      <li>It comes off easily without scrubbing or special eye make up removers.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a repeat buyer and sometimes I use a free tube of something else, which only reminds me how wonderful and unique blinc really is.</li>
      <li>It &#x27;tubes&#x27; your lashes which makes them look great, goes on easy with minimal clumping, stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>

      <li>When I go to bed with this on, it still looks good the next day, until I shower, and wash it</li>
      <li>and I quickly remember why I buy Blinc Kiss Me.  </li>
      <li>This came quickly when I ordered it as well.</li>
      <li>I went through my first tube fast - mostly b</li>
      <li>It goes on so easily, doesn&#x27;t clump when applying it and defines really well.</li>
      <li>I went through my first tube fast - mostly b</li>
      <li>THIS ON FIRST!</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but I think worth every cent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara as far as look goes</li>
      <li>This mascara has a thin brush that makes it easy to apply with precision, goes on without clumps, has a very natural look and best of all, I don&#x27;t need makeup remover to get it off!</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best prices and I&#x27;ll usually stock up enough to get the free shipping.</li>
      <li>most of them either uncurls my lashes, irritates my eyes, flakes/clumps, raccoon eyes by mid afternoon, or just eh....</li>
      <li>The only thing I would change about it is I wished it provided more volume for the lashes.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge when the weather gets humid or hot.</li>
      <li>the first try, my lashes looked longer but not fuller...</li>
      <li>I have tried many different types of mascara.  </li>
      <li>It comes off exactly when I want it to and not a moment sooner.</li>
      <li>(I didn&#x27;t even own any until I tried out my new stuff and had massive raccoon eyes).</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I always end up with smudges under my eyes with any other brand (even the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; kind).</li>
      <li>Get my face warm and fully wet from the shower, and then just gently slide it off the lashes with my fingers.</li>
      <li>:) So easy and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Just warm water and a little pressure.</li>
      <li>Once I curl and apply this, my lashes become straight again.</li>
      <li>pump your mascara, gently twirl the wand, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with too much product and it&#x27;ll cause clumping on your lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using mascara for 4 days straight now, no irritation, no twitch, no nothing.</li>
      <li>Since that time, mascara brushes have really come along way . .</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t pump your mascara, gently twirl the wand, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with too much product and it&#x27;ll cause clumping on your lashes.   </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make up</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone on the fence, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
      <li>As long as you get your face thoroughly wet and warm they will slide off very easily... if your face isn&#x27;t warm enough or wet enough</li>
      <li>Also, it does not irritate my eyes, as do most other products.</li>
      <li>I was attracted to this product because the brush part looked different and cool.</li>
      <li>You just apply it and the easily remove the excess with a wet q-tip..</li>
      <li>The actual product really is super.</li>
      <li>But, it never smudges, and I don&#x27;t need to use an eye-makeup remover, something particularly convenient when I travel.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended by my esthetician, I tried it.</li>
      <li>I assumed the mascara was just some normal mascara.</li>
      <li>day - full long lashes&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried virtually every drugstore brand, as well as a few better ones (Dior, Sephora, etc.)</li>
      <li>However, it does give a very natural feel, as even layering</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
      <li>Purchased product in the past and love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this mascara. I&#x27;m a repeat buyer and sometimes I use a free tube of something else, which only reminds me how wonderful and unique blinc really is. It&#x27;s never once irritated my eyes, and I wear contacts and have seasonal allergies. Plus it stays on but truly is easy to remove. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, and particularly with my allergies and dry eye syndrome, eye makeup can be a disaster for me by mid-day.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Blinc mascara and eyeliner for more than 2 years and won&#x27;t wear anything else.  Every now and then I&#x27;ll try something different and I quickly remember why I buy Blinc Kiss Me.  No more straying for me!!</li>
    <li> The mascara is super wet when you put it on and it smudges and flakes like crazy. Once it dries it doesn&#x27;t come off. Not worth the price.  It&#x27;s also a pain to get off your skin.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  It &#x27;tubes&#x27; your lashes which makes them look great, goes on easy with minimal clumping, stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t flake.  It&#x27;s pricey, but I think worth every cent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of mascara....loreal, revlon, maybelline, lancome, estee lauder, clinique, bare escentuals, blah blah blah...most of them either uncurls my lashes, irritates my eyes, flakes/clumps, raccoon eyes by mid afternoon, or just eh....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A girlfriend of mine introduced me to this - she has LUSH long lashes...had to ask her...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first try, my lashes looked longer but not fuller...ugh...told my GF and she said that I had to try to reapply BEFORE the stuff gets dry (it gets dry fast)...&lt;br /&gt;2nd day - poked my eye (i&#x27;m not an avid cosmetics wearer) - was slightly irritated&lt;br /&gt;3rd day - full long lashes&lt;br /&gt;4th day - feel like a pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not curl my lashes BEFORE I apply the mascara. This is what I do: Apply the mascara, wait 10 seconds, apply again (repeat until I get the result I want). Wait till the mascara is dried, and curl (the instructions say not to, but I need it to keep my stick straight lashes from looking stick straight). I use my blow dryer to heat up my curler before curling my lashes. I&#x27;m Asian, with short lashes that want to stay straight so I can use all the extra help I can. Repeat this process to get the curl I want. I have a heated curler that I keep in my purse for touch ups during the day (so far not needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else do I love about this - NO RACCOON EYES, EVER!! All it takes to wash off, is some warm water in the shower, and a gentle rub and they will be gone. You get little strings/tubes (they&#x27;re not your lashes, just the mascara casing). When I go to bed with this on, it still looks good the next day, until I shower, and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO IRRITATION! Generally, I can&#x27;t wear mascara on back to back days or my eyes will be irritated. I give them a few days between - I&#x27;ve been using mascara for 4 days straight now, no irritation, no twitch, no nothing. Even when I wash it off, my eyes aren&#x27;t bloodshot or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other good info:&lt;br /&gt;PUT THIS ON FIRST! Before you lay on foundation or anything else. B/c if your lashes have anything on them, this will not hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;Be patient with this product, some people hate it, but if you stick it out for a few days, you&#x27;ll get the hang of this.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pump your mascara, gently twirl the wand, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with too much product and it&#x27;ll cause clumping on your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;If you find your lashes are sticking together, use the ends of a bobby pin to separate - or wait until it&#x27;s dried to use a lash comb.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT put more masacara on once it&#x27;s dried - that will cause clumping - invest in the heated eye lash curler, if you warm your lashes up, you can do add a thin coat, or curl again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months and I&#x27;ve been religiously (almost) using it every day since I received the product. I went through my first tube fast - mostly b/c I kept \\&quot;pumping\\&quot; my wand - out of habit, and it created clumping. I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes have grown!!! They&#x27;re longer and they&#x27;re thicker. Not sure if it&#x27;s using the product or just the daily stimulation of curling and using the product. This is the fullest I&#x27;ve ever seen my lashes. LOVING THIS PRODUCT more and more each day.ave anything on them, this will not hold as well.

This is the fullest I&#x27;ve ever seen my lashes. LOVING THIS PRODUCT more and more each day.</li>
    <li> I love this product. At first it took some getting use to as it is so wet going on but then I decided to brush off some of the mascara into the container before applying it. When you wash it off it doesn&#x27;t smudge instead it comes off like plugs of hair but it&#x27;s the mascara. I also noticed that my eye lashes seem longer and to be more tamed even when I am not wearing it.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara because it stays on no matter what!!!! It has coats the lashes with a tube and hold up well...</li>
    <li> Natural looking and stays in place. Only comes off with very warm water! Wonderful for sensitive eyes! This is the mascara I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast shipper, item as descriped.Purchased product in the past and love it. Would definately recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I dare say this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever purchased/used. It goes on so easily, doesn&#x27;t clump when applying it and defines really well. I sometimes use an eyelash comb if I want a little extra definition, as long as you use the comb after applying it before it dries it is easy to separate them. Once the mascara dries it doesn&#x27;t budge and lasts through everything. I&#x27;ve tested it the following conditions with no problems: long sweaty martial arts workouts, pouring rain, skiing all day, and even crying bouts too. I sleep in it as I&#x27;m a person who likes to take morning showers, and that&#x27;s about the only time I notice any issue, there&#x27;s a few tiny flakes in the morning on my face when I wake up. But still LOADS better than any regular mascara I&#x27;ve used in the past and slept in. Removal is very easy, I like to remove mine in the shower. Get my face warm and fully wet from the shower, and then just gently slide it off the lashes with my fingers. As long as you get your face thoroughly wet and warm they will slide off very easily... if your face isn&#x27;t warm enough or wet enough then you&#x27;ll be tugging, so if you find yourself tugging soak a bit more first. So long story short I highly recommend this to anyone on the fence, you won&#x27;t regret it! I&#x27;m a Blinc convert!</li>
    <li> I love Blinc mascara because it doesn&#x27;t leave you with raccoon eyes.  It&#x27;s easy to remove when needed.  The only thing I would change about it is I wished it provided more volume for the lashes.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by my esthetician, I tried it. I like it. Try it, you may also like, I guarantee you.</li>
    <li> I used it because mascara irritates my eyes as I have dry eye syndrome.  This is the most comfortable mascara I have found.  Only regret is that it does not provide fullness, but guess you can&#x27;t have everything!</li>
    <li> Once you go \\&quot;kiss me\\&quot; you&#x27;ll never want to use another mascara. It&#x27;s nice not having raccoon eyes anymore. Plus, I can go to the beach, swim and still have mascara on if I don&#x27;t pull it off. Great stuff. I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite mascara as far as look goes but when it comes to taking it off at night, it&#x27;s perfect. It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge when the weather gets humid or hot. When I hop into the shower, I simply get my finger wet and run it across my lashes and it comes off. No makeup remover needed or harsh scrubbing. It comes off exactly when I want it to and not a moment sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have tried many mascaras in my time of searching for the perfect product for me.  This mascara is no different than what you find at your local pharmacy for half the price.  Yes it will paint your lashes, but I found no fullness or length to this product whatsoever.  I even bought the primer.  Will use it up and keep searching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for several years and it works great.  it doesn&#x27;t smudge or get greasy after a few hours.  It comes off easily without scrubbing or special eye make up removers.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out in the tube either.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Blinc mascara is the BEST mascara I have ever used. All prior mascaras gave me raccoon eyes and by the end of the day I looked like I had 2 black eyes. No matter what I tried it was the same result. About 2 years ago I read about Blinc in a magazine &amp; I&#x27;ve used it ever since. No problems at all...this is the BEST!</li>
    <li> WE CHOSE THIS ITEM BECAUSE  IT IS THE BEST PRODUCT MY WIFE COULD FIND ON THE MARKET TODAY. SHE IS A COSMOTOLIGIST BY TRADE</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes and this is the perfect product for me. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year &amp; a half and recently purchased another mascara to replace it. I didn&#x27;t realize how good I had it! This mascara has a thin brush that makes it easy to apply with precision, goes on without clumps, has a very natural look and best of all, I don&#x27;t need makeup remover to get it off! (I didn&#x27;t even own any until I tried out my new stuff and had massive raccoon eyes). Sure, the little lash tubes can look creepy coming off, may stick to your cheeks or the sink a little, but it&#x27;s worth it to not have to rub my eyes with make up remover and have puffy red eyes after. It&#x27;s the only kind I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
    <li> terrible stuff because it takes your eyelashes off when you remove it.</li>
    <li> Edit: 1/16/2012  I&#x27;ve enjoyed this mascara for some time, but I find that it uncurls my lashes. I have very long, straight lashes that point downward. Once I curl and apply this, my lashes become straight again. Covergirl lash blast does not give me this problem.  *********************  I have the oiliest face so waterproof and smudge-proof mascara never worked for me. This is the only thing that works. No, it isn&#x27;t as bold as other mascaras, but it does lengthen and add a bit of volume for me. I&#x27;ve also had one or two tubes come off throughout the day, but I just got this mascara a week ago so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve perfected application yet. I was stuck with clear mascaras for years. I&#x27;m really glad this works!</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff... goodbye raccoon eyes for me. :) So easy and long lasting. Expensive, but worth it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this mascare about 5 years ago and won&#x27;t wear anything else. Otherwise, I always end up with smudges under my eyes with any other brand (even the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; kind). Amazon has the best prices and I&#x27;ll usually stock up enough to get the free shipping.</li>
    <li> I will never buy another mascara. Even when I&#x27;m rushed in the morning, I can use the heated curler and apply the mascara with ease.   Thank you blinc!!</li>
    <li> The mascara is ridiculously flaky. I used it for about a week before giving up on it. My mom likes it though, and she uses it just fine. But I couldn&#x27;t get past all of the black flakes that ended up on my skin.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe they&#x27;ve sold even ONE TUBE of this! It&#x27;s terrible !My lashes were so stiff from it, stiff and dry. I was attracted to this product because the brush part looked different and cool. I thought the brush part might lift and seperate my lashes. I assumed the mascara was just some normal mascara. but noo! This awful mascara turned my eyelashes into little, stiff sharp knives. If my eyelashes had accidently touched someone, I fear I could have left a gash on their cheek!  Outrageous that they sell this!</li>
    <li> I have very thin, short eyelashes so I always wear mascara. I&#x27;ve tried virtually every drugstore brand, as well as a few better ones (Dior, Sephora, etc.) and this may be the best one yet.  It goes on evenly with absolutely no clumping. I do find that it&#x27;s less dramatic than some other mascaras. I usually apply two coats because of this. However, it does give a very natural feel, as even layering it does not cause lashes to stick together. It lasts all day with no smudging or flaking.  I have contact lenses, and I find this to be very comfortable as well. Some other brands have irritated my eyes.  When you wash it off, you can see little tubes, which is weird. But it is so much easier to take off than other kinds! Just warm water and a little pressure. Usually, easy to remove makeup smudges and runs during the day, but the trade-off does no apply to this. Definitely consider this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does not lengthen or thicken lashes, like some other mascaras do. But, it never smudges, and I don&#x27;t need to use an eye-makeup remover, something particularly convenient when I travel. Also, it does not irritate my eyes, as do most other products. I&#x27;m hoping that this product stays on the market for a long, long time, for I&#x27;m &amp;#34;hooked.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make up but when I do, I love a quality mascara. I know we&#x27;ve all had the problem of smudging so we have those awful raccoon eyes at the end of the day, this is the solution. I&#x27;ve even fallen asleep with this stuff on and there are no grey shadows under my eyes. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the way it comes off. Really unhealthy for fine lashes. You can&#x27;t put an extra coat on because it drys to fast, especially in Arizona.</li>
    <li> It is so hard to apply its not worth it. It&#x27;s very messy and dries cracked and flakey looking.  I love the mascara but the eyeliner is nothing amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a replacement for the discontinued Bobbi Brown Perfectly Defined waterproof tube mascara. This is not it. The Blinc mascara does stay on all day - no raccoon eyes. But it clumps my lashes together as if they are wet. I have to use a brush to separate my lashes before applying a second coat. Even then, the lashes look stuck together. My lashes don&#x27;t look longer or fuller. I paid $24 for it at a beauty supply store so I am sorry to say that the Blinc is getting tossed into the back of the drawer and the search for mascara continues.</li>
    <li> The actual product really is super. It&#x27;s stays on without smudging, even through sport, then washes off without a fuss. The one bummer about the product is the brush. I started wearing Blinc 5 years ago. Since that time, mascara brushes have really come along way . . .except that is for Blinc. Lashes are longer but not fuller or separated.</li>
    <li> This has and will always be my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; mascara for three years now. It is wonderful for busy moms that have to keep their make up regime quick. I don&#x27;t have time to do full eye make up most days but this mascara gives me the perk up I need.. You just apply it and the easily remove the excess with a wet q-tip.. And the removal itself is such a breeze. Just a little soap and water and it is gone without any black residue that you are trying to scrub off.. This is one of my top fave make up items EVER! I cannot reiterate that enough!</li>
    <li> I have tried many different types of mascara.  Blinc is excellent.  It holds up all day long without smuges.  No more flaking!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It stays put and doesn&#x27;t flake at all! This came quickly when I ordered it as well.</li>
