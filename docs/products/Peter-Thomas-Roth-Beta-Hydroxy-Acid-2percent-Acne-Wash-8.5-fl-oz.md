      <li>So Im thinking that it must be pretty good.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and this cleanser is great.  </li>
      <li>I am continuing to purchase this product since not only is it effective and results are excellent, but also because this seller continues to have a great price, value for $ spent.</li>
      <li>I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.  </li>
      <li>Honestly my sensitive, prone to breakout skin has never looked better!!</li>

      <li>Great product overall.</li>

      <li>It has significantly improved my acne.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try if you have acne!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything special for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I have also recently purchased  a Clarisonic Aria and the combination of the two is amazing.</li>
      <li>So simple and effective.</li>
      <li>The product was too drying to use on it&#x27;s own, but using a toner or moisturizer with it left my face irritated.</li>
      <li>This cleared up my acne right away</li>
      <li>I just needed to find the right cleanser to use with it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just not the right product for my skin type.</li>
      <li>I live in a tropical climate that is lovely but during summer I reach for this cleanser because the summer weather causes my skin to get very sweaty and breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle but keeps blemishes away.  </li>
      <li>Actually found this on Birchbox, but wanted to try and find it at a better price.</li>
      <li>While the Rx helped, I still needed to promote healthy skin from the outside,</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because its expensive, although amazon does have it for the best price compared to anywhere else.</li>
      <li>I used to buy from another retailer at a much higher price.  </li>
      <li>Just keep away from around your eyes as it&#x27;s very drying!</li>
      <li>and it does the trick to keep my skin clear and clean.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem any better than some of the much cheaper facial washes.</li>
      <li>Thus far, I am very pleased with this product and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO</li>
      <li>My large pores seemed to tighten, and any pimples or acne</li>
      <li>I found it in my hotel and it was just a face bar, but during my stay my face really cleared up</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin clear and fresh.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much easier to dispense/use.</li>
      <li>I will use this and combine with facial scrub twice a week to keep my face acne free.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to help clear my acne and this product finally seems to be making a difference :))</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clean, fresh, soft and my acne is finally somewhat under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will continue to use as long as it is available.  </li>
      <li>I refuse to use it in it&#x27;s own packaging, and I instead transfer it to small silicone travel containers (called GoToobs) and</li>
      <li>I had prior to this,was quickly healing.</li>
      <li>It does not dry out my skin and its pretty gentle.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It was highly rated on the Birchbox website as well as Amazon.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far this stuff is horrible</li>
    <li> I love love love Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products.  This face wash is one of the best face wash I have ever used.  I have very sensitive skin.  My skin gets dry with oily T zone and I have acne problems.  I have tired so many facial products out there, this is the one that works the best for me.  I will use this and combine with facial scrub twice a week to keep my face acne free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost everything to help clear my acne and this product finally seems to be making a difference :))</li>
    <li> It was too harsh and strong for my face. It burned my face for a couple days.</li>
    <li> I love PTR products and was happy to find them on Amazon for better prices. The wash is one of my staple products and helps keep by oily, acne prone skin clear.</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; much better price vs. Sephora</li>
    <li> awesome product!! This cleared up my acne right away</li>
    <li> I use this with the buffing beads and it has helped smooth out my skin without being abrasive or cause irritation and redness. Definitely worth a try if you have acne!</li>
    <li> this gentle yet effective cleanser paired with the acne clearning gel and oil free moisturizer has literally changed my life! i have struggled with acne on my back, shoulders and chest for years..been on every prescription out there with little to no results. i am so beyond happy with this product and everything i have tried from the PTR line. thank you thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product, cleared my skintight away.  I use this every evening as part of my routine.  PTR products are excellent.</li>
    <li> This wash was incredibly drying. I was using it once a day, before using it every other day and it was leaving my oily skin far too irritated. The product was too drying to use on it&#x27;s own, but using a toner or moisturizer with it left my face irritated.</li>
    <li> Parabens are an anti-fungal chemical used to keep water in cosmetics, etc, from getting moldy and gross…yet, parabens are being found in biopsied tumors!  My esthetician recommended this product to me so I bought it, read the label, then returned it along with another PTR product that also contains parabens.  Beauty and clear skin is not worth cancerous tumors.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. Actually found this on Birchbox, but wanted to try and find it at a better price. It was highly rated on the Birchbox website as well as Amazon. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now. I have also recently purchased  a Clarisonic Aria and the combination of the two is amazing. Honestly my sensitive, prone to breakout skin has never looked better!! I definitely found a product I will order again.</li>
    <li> After I hit 40 I started noticing that my skin care system was not working as well as it used to . I started noticing breakouts \\&quot;  which eventually was turning into adult acne. I did some research on different products because I was tired of trying different products, spending money, and not having any results. This product had excellent overall reviews so I purchased it. I started using this cleanser and immediately saw a big improvement in my skin. I no longer had to use any acne spot cream since I was not breaking out. My large pores seemed to tighten, and any pimples or acne I had prior to this,was quickly healing. I am continuing to purchase this product since not only is it effective and results are excellent, but also because this seller continues to have a great price, value for $ spent. Thank You</li>
    <li> This cleanser is great. I have pretty good skin so I only need to use a TINY bit or else it completely drys out my skin. I follow it with a good moisturizer and I have noticed a huge change in my skin. No more breakouts!</li>
    <li> it dried my skin out no matter what I did.  and my blemishes got worse instead of better.  Do bother with it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for me. Not worth the cost to me.</li>
    <li> I feel like this cleanser is getting all of the deep down dirt and at the same time it is soothing and non-irritating.  I use it every morning and night.  Will continue to use as long as it is available.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive but acne prone/oily skin. This facewash is WAY too harsh for me. It made my skin feel really soft and clean the first few days then my skin completely dried up and I broke out like crazy. It&#x27;s just not the right product for my skin type.</li>
    <li> Great for acne! I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of acne washes and this one is so far is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years now and it continues to keep my acne under control.</li>
    <li> I live in a tropical climate that is lovely but during summer I reach for this cleanser because the summer weather causes my skin to get very sweaty and breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every morning only during the summer months. I also reach for Peter Thomas Roth mattifyer during this time as it keeps my t-zone from getting sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use in cooler months as my skin doesn&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne which is aggravated by exercise.  I wash my face with this twice a day followed by the acne clearing gel all over and the acne spot treatment as needed.  It has significantly improved my acne.  I love that it is fragrance free and that it doesn&#x27;t make my face peel or bleach my clothes like peroxide treatments.  You also get a lot of cleanser for your money.  This bottle is going to last me at least a couple months.</li>
    <li> So I dunno if it&#x27;s hormones or what the heck happened but I hit a certain age and BLAMMO my skin SUCKS. I have acne that would rival any teen boy. I have tried MULTIPLE other high end products and until I tried the Peter Thomas Roth line I was not getting relief. I like that the products have medicated and homeopathic aspects to support them. They don&#x27;t have strong odors, and don&#x27;t bleach my sheets. I will be a repeat customer - oh and a little goes a long way.....</li>
    <li> This is a new product that I started using to treat my adult acne. Thus far, I am very pleased with this product and it was exactly what I expected. I received a sample of the product from Sephora before I purchased the item.</li>
    <li> this thing is great. i use it everyday and haven&#x27;t had a break out yet. i highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It is effective to keep acne at bay and very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  I only use it once a day, and combine  with a gentler wash for when my skin isn&#x27;t very dirty (no makeup, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I knocked off a star is because I hate the packaging.  Why would it come in a tall (tip over) type bottle with no give (squeeziness?) to it.  I refuse to use it in it&#x27;s own packaging, and I instead transfer it to small silicone travel containers (called GoToobs) and it&#x27;s much easier to dispense/use.</li>
    <li> Best acne wash I have ever used. My skin is clear and youthful. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for acne on face and anywhere and even shaving burn! Great product overall. Just keep away from around your eyes as it&#x27;s very drying!</li>
    <li> I love this brand but wasn&#x27;t overly impressed with this cleanser. Dried out my skin and didn&#x27;t clear it up.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth is a genius and I personally want to thank him for this product! Wherever you are  - Thank you! This is about week two hopefully it continues to be this amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using these for many years now and love it.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I began struggling with mild to moderate adult acne.  You can read some of my other reviews to get an idea of all the different lotions &amp; potions I&#x27;ve tried to rid myself of it, if you so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use a dermatologist, but the prescribed cleansers dried out and irritated my skin. I ended up taking Doxycycline, a prescription antibiotic.  While the Rx helped, I still needed to promote healthy skin from the outside, obviously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a Clarisonic Mia 2, [[ASIN:B002XURD32 Clarisonic Mia(TM) Skin Cleansing System - Pink]] which ended up significantly helping my acne.  I just needed to find the right cleanser to use with it.  Somehow I stumbled across PTR BHA wash on Sephora.com and even though the price made me raise an eyebrow, I decided to try based on the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the PTR cleanser, my Clarisonic, and the antibiotics, my skin started to look excellent! It&#x27;s clean, fresh, soft and my acne is finally somewhat under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to keep in mind with the price is, one bottle lasted me probably 4 months.  You only need a dime-sized amount; especially if using w/ the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally did run out of the PTR BHA wash, I thought I&#x27;d try a different cleanser in a moment of frugality.  I tried the Clinique foam wash and was horribly disappointed by it; especially when my acne started rearing its ugly head. I returned the Clinique as soon as I realized the mistake I&#x27;d made and went running back to PTR.  And wouln&#x27;t you know, the acne started to clear.</li>
    <li> Bought this wash as a gift. I have never used it before but my partner swears by it! So Im thinking that it must be pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash and can tell when I don&#x27;t use it with the corresponding Buffing Beads. Def makes my skin smoother and feel better. Glad I discovered this.</li>
    <li> I recently turned 40 and started getting acne. Before this product, I tried dozens of others, including Proactive. Nothing seemed to work. I bought a sample kit and within a week, started noticing a different. In a month, no more acne. I also used the dark spot remover and the laser-free resurfacing kit and all the old blemishes have also disappeared. I am a Peter Thomas Roth fan for life!</li>
    <li> This is very good stuff.  It has helped clear up my 13 year old grandson&#x27;s facial acne. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> This product has help to get rid of my sunspots. Applied a dab every night for 2 weeks, the spots would scab up and fall off revealing the new skin. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  I&#x27;ve been using for 6 months now and it does the trick, but unfortunately my skin still is flaky after use.</li>
    <li> Best acne cleanser I have ever tried! It does not dry out my skin and its pretty gentle. I gave it 4 stars because its expensive, although amazon does have it for the best price compared to anywhere else.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. I found it in my hotel and it was just a face bar, but during my stay my face really cleared up so I decided to buy it. My face has been very clear since using this product. Unfortunately I can only use it about 3 times a week because my face was getting dried out even then though my face has been clear</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s very gentle but keeps blemishes away.  My skin is very sensitive and this cleanser is great.  I used to buy from another retailer at a much higher price.  I love that I can get the same great product at such a great price.  Also love that it comes within a week after I order it.</li>
    <li> This was the first wash I found that had the best results.... And I&#x27;ve tried everything!  It worked better than anything my Dermotoligist prescribed.  However, I am seeing a new Dermotoligist and she told me to stop using it.  I am going to give her an opportunity but would definitely recommend this to anyone with adult acne.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth acne products have made my already bad acne take on the severity of a tragically puberty-stricken pizza-faced preteen (I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s). Maybe not HUGE yellow pussy bombs daily, but there is barely an inch of my face free of a pimple. Even the acne treatment system I gave up on after being a long-time diehard user because it quit on me was better than THIS junk. I tried the whole kit, and by the way there is NO difference between the sulfur kit and the other besides a tiny little container of sulfur masque. I kept thinking if I added more PTR products they&#x27;d all work together better and finally there&#x27;d be improvement-am I STUPID or what. I&#x27;m even getting pimples where I never have before, like around my mouth/lips. It&#x27;s awful! WASTED MONEY.</li>
    <li> This product has been geat for my skin. I have very sensitive skin, so I can&#x27;t use alot of product without breaking out. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin,but I only use it once a day. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from Acne.</li>
    <li> Finally a very effective product. Noticeably smaller pours.</li>
    <li> Its a great product but it seems to dry my skin after just 1 use.</li>
    <li> Best ance product I have ever tried and I have sifted through everyone! I have recommend this product to friends and family they all live it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Got rid of most of my acne and I also have fewer break outs. A bit drying though but I pair it with ole henricksons vitamin plus moisturizer and I&#x27;m good to go. Oh and I also use it with my clairosonic.</li>
    <li> I am a 40+ male who has battled very oily skin since my teen years and still have be proactive to prevent breakouts. After years of using Anthony Logistics, Kiehl&#x27;s and prescription face wash products, I decided to give PTR a try. For me, I have had the best results with this wash. I like the non-fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry out my skin. I use it morning and night and it does the trick to keep my skin clear and clean. It is a tad pricy, but one bottle does last a long time, so in the long run, it&#x27;s worth it. I also use the AHA/BHA skin clearing gel and oil-free moisturizer. Order the PTR acne sample kit and give the products a try.</li>
    <li> I have tried every AHA/BHA wash on the market...I&#x27;m serious! This is absolutely the best out there. The only other product that came close was Neutrogena&#x27;s Acne Stress Cream Cleanser. The first week I used it, my face was red AND I have always used a 2% AHA/BHA wash. I kept it up and soon I noticed that my beard came in with less ingrown hairs, my forehead and chin area cleared-up really well, and my blackheads shrunk! It also has a great, clean, smell! I use a dime sized amount, wash my face, then rub it on my shoulders and back. It is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used everything Clinique, Murad, ProActive, Philosophy, things for doctors, you name it I&#x27;ve tried it and the Peter Thomas Roth Acne line is the only thing that has helped keep my face clear.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem any better than some of the much cheaper facial washes. I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything special for my skin.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> This face wash changed my life. I have been using it every single day for 3 or 4 years now.</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like this product. It hasn&#x27;t totally cleared up my skin, but I&#x27;m noticing less breakouts. I have been using it for about a month now.  It does dry out my skin just a little too much but moisturizer fixes that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tried every acne product out there like I have, I recommend giving this product a try. It&#x27;s the best I have tried.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite PRT products. I use it every morning as part of my skin care regimen. It helps keep my skin clear and fresh. Just an all around great BHA product! Will definitely buy another bottle when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for 3 years now, and I&#x27;m obsessed!!!! I tried everything for my deep cystic acne that randomly appeared (and had no intention of going away) at 24 years old. I pair this with the Cerave PM moisturizer. So simple and effective.</li>
