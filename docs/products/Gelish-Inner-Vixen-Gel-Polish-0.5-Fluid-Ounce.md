      <li>Love this color!  </li>
      <li>This polish is amazing.</li>
      <li>While the color of the is absolutely amazing curing the polish is a problem.</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own gelish at home for over 6 months and something about the shadows collection and curing issues seem to go hand in hand.</li>
      <li>I really liked the vendor...</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own gel polish for around 2 years now</li>
      <li>Super rich color - it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
      <li>I have many Gelish polishes, I own a LED lamp and didn&#x27;t change my polishing habits</li>
      <li>This one is easy!</li>
      <li>my wife loves this product and i love what it gets me</li>
      <li>I have a friend who just fell in love with this &amp;#34;vampire red&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>REALLY LOVE</li>
      <li>I love Gelish products.  </li>
      <li>Some Gelish polishes are slightly more tricky.  </li>
      <li>I love the Gellish brand and have never had any problems before.</li>
      <li>I love this color, but it won&#x27;t cure.</li>
      <li>Love Love the color ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite.  </li>
      <li>was extremely careful with the application, and cured it for the maximum cure time - 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that I had zero shrinkage this time (2 coats for perfect opacity), and the color looks splendid.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice for fall colors - very burgundy wine color.  </li>
      <li>Applies great- only 1-2 coats needed for opacity.</li>
      <li>Applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>The wording makes it sound like you are getting the shadows collection</li>
      <li>Love the color, and love Gelish in general.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t really matte like shown more shine to it.</li>
      <li>This last order I bought \\&quot;Inner Vixen\\&quot; and \\&quot;The Perfect</li>
      <li>But the color is very pretty</li>
      <li>GREAT COLOR TO MATCH  DARK HAIR COMPLEXION.I</li>
      <li>Got it here very fast!</li>
      <li>I have bought several bottles of Gelish polish on Amazon and I have always received good quality polishes - I may not have always loved the color (because it&#x27;s sometimes hard to tell true colors on a computer screen)</li>
      <li>It wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t cure right.  </li>
      <li>super fast shipping, nothing against them.</li>
      <li>It also feels kind of soft like it isnt fully set, although I kept each coat in for more than two minutes because of how dark it</li>
      <li>Go very VERY thin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the seller provided fast shipping!</li>
      <li>First I want to state</li>
      <li>I have to put glitter coats on top to bring out the red and hide the darkness.  </li>
      <li>The color is super dark and bubbled up after I put a very light coat on .  </li>
      <li>The color is a little different than shown but still beautiful.</li>
      <li>I really wanted the color in the picture.</li>
      <li>originally I was using this with the smaller Gelish lamp - the Pro45, that you can do 4 fingers, and then thumbs separately.</li>
      <li>IT.I MIGHT GET ADVENTUROUS AND ERY SOME OF THE OTHER COLORS.</li>
      <li>Make sure to put on very thin coats and even if it still shrivels once you apply Top it</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m thinking that this may simply need the more powerful of lamps to cure properly, or perhaps, needs double curing under a smaller, lower wattage lamp?</li>
      <li>The color that it shows on the description is FAR from the color that it is.  </li>
      <li>it really a dark brown with just a touch of red you can see in outdoor light.  </li>
      <li>I used the thinnest layer possible and cured it for 5 times as long as it suggests, and it&#x27;s still no dryer than when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a super dark red color with a somewhat blackish shine, then this is your color.  </li>
      <li>Both colors are amazing, quite possibly my favorites but the polish is such poor quality.</li>
      <li>Weird consistency that you sometimes get with gelish polishes, didn&#x27;t go on nicely and rippled.</li>
      <li>Super dark, appears almost black in most indoor (poorly lit) spaces and a super dark burgundy with subtle sparkle outside or in better lit spaces.</li>
      <li>Lots of dark red sparkles make it so pretty.</li>
      <li>Basically dark chocolate with dark red shimmer in the light up close.</li>

<li> I re-did it super thin and it still wrinkled.  </li>
<li> But Inner Vixen is portrayed as a deep dark red but</li>
<li> Lasts long and is shiny.</li>
<li> It bubbles and cracks and doesn&#x27;t fully set right, no matter how thin I ensure</li>
<li> From a far looks dark brown or black.</li>
<li> like the grey and purple but this red (vixen) is so nearly black</li>
<li> Not sure if it&#x27;s old or tampered with</li>
<li> so I cured each color coat twice as long as every other polish</li>
<li> Very dark, nearly black sort of red.</li>
<li> In poor lighting it looks almost black, but in the sunlight it&#x27;s dark mahogany with a deep red shimmer.</li>
<li> But this color is really hard to use properly.</li>
<li> :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;Gelish is a great product usually though, so I wont let this one bottle spoil my view of them.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s useless, though, because it simply will not dry!</li>
<li> do like the color, which is a brownish black, but its NOTHING like the picture.  </li>
<li> I thought maybe I needed a new base, so I bought a brand new bottle -</li>
<li> VERY DARK with a little sparkle.  </li>
<li> It is very dark, but she said in the sun it looks a bit brighter.</li>
<li> The entire shadows collection needs to be applied THIN!</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this one!</li>
<li> It seems to always shrink, regardless of how carefully i apply it, no matter how thin I apply the coats.</li>
<li> First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in about 20 of this brand&#x27;s bottles.</li>
<li> This is so hard to apply to your nails.  </li>
<li> An enigmatic color, to be sure--I cannot decide what the base color is--black, brown or burgundy.</li>
<li> but I was not happy with it.</li>
<li> So disappointed my favorite colors are the worst bottles of polish - can&#x27;t even wear them.</li>
<li> Disappointed in the Gelish brand, when it comes to dark colors.</li>
<li> I have even applied it very thin and cured for 5 minutes each layer!</li>
<li> but I have never been disappointed in the quality of the polish itself.</li>
<li> Very disappointing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So disappointing!!</li>
<li> This polish however is horrible.</li>

    <li> Ordered this for a friend who loves it! It is very dark, but she said in the sun it looks a bit brighter.</li>
    <li> Basically dark chocolate with dark red shimmer in the light up close. From a far looks dark brown or black. Very cute!!</li>
    <li> First I want to state I love Gelish products.  But Inner Vixen is portrayed as a deep dark red but it really a dark brown with just a touch of red you can see in outdoor light.  In addition, the nail polish shrivels up while curing.  Make sure to put on very thin coats and even if it still shrivels once you apply Top it Off it will fill it in.</li>
    <li> Love Love the color .. It&#x27;s my favorite.  This polish however is horrible. It bubbled and peeled off my nails.  I love the Gellish brand and have never had any problems before. Not sure if it&#x27;s old or tampered with but I was not happy with it.</li>
    <li> The color is super dark and bubbled up after I put a very light coat on .  If you&#x27;re looking for a super dark red color with a somewhat blackish shine, then this is your color.  The color that it shows on the description is FAR from the color that it is.  I really liked the vendor...super fast shipping, nothing against them.</li>
    <li> Love this color!  Upon reading the reviews about application problems (wrinkling etc.)  I didn&#x27;t have any. The color is a beautiful fall color (oxblood on pinterest) color! I have many Gelish polishes, I own a LED lamp and didn&#x27;t change my polishing habits (I put on semi-thick coats).  My nails turned out beautifully...beautiful oxblood fall color with a coppery shimmer.  I would definitely purchase again! And the seller provided fast shipping!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this product and i love what it gets me</li>
    <li> Love the color, and love Gelish in general. But this color is really hard to use properly. I have had no luck curing it, no matter what I do. It seems to always shrink, regardless of how carefully i apply it, no matter how thin I apply the coats. Very disappointing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited review:&lt;br /&gt;So originally I was using this with the smaller Gelish lamp - the Pro45, that you can do 4 fingers, and then thumbs separately. I recently purchased the Gelish 18G LED lamp, and decided to try Inner Vixen again.&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely careful with the application, and cured it for the maximum cure time - 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to report that I had zero shrinkage this time (2 coats for perfect opacity), and the color looks splendid.&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m thinking that this may simply need the more powerful of lamps to cure properly, or perhaps, needs double curing under a smaller, lower wattage lamp?</li>
    <li> The color of this polish is gorgeous. In poor lighting it looks almost black, but in the sunlight it&#x27;s dark mahogany with a deep red shimmer. It&#x27;s useless, though, because it simply will not dry! I used the thinnest layer possible and cured it for 5 times as long as it suggests, and it&#x27;s still no dryer than when I first put it on. I can wipe it all off with one swipe of a paper towel. So disappointing!!</li>
    <li> An enigmatic color, to be sure--I cannot decide what the base color is--black, brown or burgundy. Lots of dark red sparkles make it so pretty.</li>
    <li> Very dark, nearly black sort of red. I have a friend who just fell in love with this &amp;#34;vampire red&amp;#34; color. Applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> The color is a little different than shown but still beautiful. It isn&#x27;t really matte like shown more shine to it. Recommend on color and from this company.  Got it here very fast!</li>
    <li> Great stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> I have bought several bottles of Gelish polish on Amazon and I have always received good quality polishes - I may not have always loved the color (because it&#x27;s sometimes hard to tell true colors on a computer screen) but I have never been disappointed in the quality of the polish itself. This last order I bought \\&quot;Inner Vixen\\&quot; and \\&quot;The Perfect Silhouette\\&quot;. Both colors are amazing, quite possibly my favorites but the polish is such poor quality. It bubbles and cracks and doesn&#x27;t fully set right, no matter how thin I ensure my layers are. I thought maybe I needed a new base, so I bought a brand new bottle - didn&#x27;t help. Thought maybe it needed to cure longer under the lamp so I cured each color coat twice as long as every other polish, that didn&#x27;t help either - nothing makes a difference. So disappointed my favorite colors are the worst bottles of polish - can&#x27;t even wear them.</li>
    <li> I have been doing my own gel polish for around 2 years now and I have always been able to do beautiful manicures, but this color  wrinkles like when you put a polish on too this.  I re-did it super thin and it still wrinkled.  It also feels kind of soft like it isnt fully set, although I kept each coat in for more than two minutes because of how dark it is.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the color, which is a brownish black, but its NOTHING like the picture.  I really wanted the color in the picture. :&#x27;(&lt;br /&gt;Gelish is a great product usually though, so I wont let this one bottle spoil my view of them.  First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in about 20 of this brand&#x27;s bottles.</li>
    <li> The entire shadows collection needs to be applied THIN! It wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t cure right.  Go very VERY thin!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the grey and purple but this red (vixen) is so nearly black I have to put glitter coats on top to bring out the red and hide the darkness.  Opaque in 2 coats.</li>
    <li> The wording makes it sound like you are getting the shadows collection and it was not until I went back and reviewed the wording that I realized I was only getting one.  But the color is very pretty</li>
    <li> This polish is amazing. Super dark, appears almost black in most indoor (poorly lit) spaces and a super dark burgundy with subtle sparkle outside or in better lit spaces. Applies great- only 1-2 coats needed for opacity. Super rich color - it&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
