      <li>worth the money</li>
      <li>Great Christmas present for teens and early twenty&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>kinda fun to play with though.</li>
      <li>I have bought much cheaper versions that are constructed far better.</li>
      <li>Many different shaped tools that can be used separately.</li>
      <li>Could be bette rifthey were more solid.</li>
      <li>I works better than pinching the heck out of my face and such.</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll go with the better kit.</li>
      <li>First use gouged my forehead and now have a scar.</li>
      <li>This product works pretty well for the price, and I could not pass it up.</li>
      <li>Not to be gross, but I&#x27;ve had better results with fingers than with this kit, so like, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
      <li>things first, this thing sucks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3UMOVLCGFEB0L]]First let me start off by stating the reviews (the positive ones anyways) are all fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>for all kind of pempils and black heads.</li>
      <li>But by reading the reviews you&#x27;d believe they were pure gold.</li>
      <li>Nice small bag, if you store it in that bag and not throwing around the place I am sure it will last over a life time.</li>
      <li>Though I was able to get the job done, my appendix scar has never really healed up as I&#x27;d like.</li>
      <li>and it worked very well.  </li>
      <li>The lancets and edges of presses worked, but you have to be very controlled and not overdo it.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you are careful and always sterilize your instruments.</li>
      <li>He really likes it.</li>
      <li>My wife loves to pick any and all blemishes on me and this is really helping her on that front.</li>
      <li>Bought this as an upgrade to the standard extraction tool available at Walmart and didn&#x27;t want to spring for the $45 kit.  </li>
      <li>Once open the inside pouch appeared to be in good condition , but upon further review, the pouch was worn around all the edges, this product was clearly .USED</li>
      <li>My husband gets a lot of ingrown hairs and other skin/pore issues and this kit has a lot of good, sturdy different tips to help with them</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t bother spending more money on other tool kits, this is all you need.  </li>
      <li>These are high quality stainless steal, no rust.  </li>
      <li>i thought surely this would at least be worth the (fairly reasonable) price i paid for it.  </li>
      <li>essential zip popping tools, love this kit as it contains everything you could possibly want for ridding your face of a pimple.</li>
      <li>Some of the ends don&#x27;t fit (too loose) into the handle, but will get the job done.  </li>
      <li>High quality product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am able to get little pimples that otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t even know had anything in them.</li>
      <li>Unlike others, I didn&#x27;t think the tools were of poor quality - they&#x27;re good.  </li>
      <li>Tips aren&#x27;t bend but when passed by your skin you can feel the sharp ends of the tips, i am going to have to sand some of the tips to be smooth.</li>
      <li>Much easier to help clear up skin problems and not mess up surrounding tissue.</li>
      <li>These simple tools work a lot better, but be careful!</li>
      <li>We use it for professional use and it held up.</li>
      <li>The handle is machined in such a fashion that, no matter how much puss, blood or sebum you get on your hands, it wont slip.</li>
      <li>These tools work a lot better than the electric suckers.</li>
      <li>Low quality attachments with very visible molding seams.</li>
      <li>Stop squeezing your nose, get this item and you will feel professional approach to the problem you have with your skin.</li>
      <li>The pieces screw together solidly (way better than the single piece, single package tools sold.)  </li>
      <li>not having threads isn&#x27;t bad enough, some of the attachment slide right into the opening (with no way to secure them since they can&#x27;t screw in) and some attachments just don&#x27;t fit in the hole</li>
      <li>All the spoons are sharp and jagged, not worth more then $1.</li>
      <li>these are exactly what I expected with exception of the things I did not expect.</li>
      <li>On the right track just not worth purchasing at this time.</li>
      <li>but I am using in general only one item only from this small bag, although there is many of them I don&#x27;t got that far yet to use all of them.</li>
      <li>The instruments are so sharp that you can really take care of your blackheads, whiteheads..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works pretty well for the price, and I could not pass it up. Everything screws on and off pretty easy. A good buy, if you know how to use the product.</li>
    <li> Useful, when you need something to take care of special skin problems.</li>
    <li> Some of the heads do not screw into either end of the handle as they are supposed to. This tool cannot be used as a double-sided tool as a result.</li>
    <li> Tools are well made and sturdy, case is also very nice.  Used it as soon as I got it and it worked very well.  Great product and great price.</li>
    <li> Gift.  Recipient loved it.</li>
    <li> I stuck this kit in my teen&#x27;s stocking for Christmas.    These are high quality stainless steal, no rust.  The instruments are so sharp that you can really take care of your blackheads, whiteheads.. all that nasty stuff, without damaging the skin around the blemish.    My kid uses it all the time.  He really likes it.</li>
    <li> second one I bought from this company, lost the first kid traveling, works great no issue with this item at all,</li>
    <li> My wife loves to pick any and all blemishes on me and this is really helping her on that front. She doesn&#x27;t use all of the heads but the ones she does use work great.</li>
    <li> ZERO stars. It&#x27;s every bit as bad as everyone says. I didn&#x27;t believe the reviews...didn&#x27;t believe Amazon would Prime something that mutilates you. First use gouged my forehead and now have a scar. The tool wasn&#x27;t machined correctly, deburr, and polished. Burr on the inside of the hole wasn&#x27;t visible on cursory inspection and went ahead and used the tool. After digging a trough through my forehead I got out my eye-loupe and could see how nasty the tool really was.  Just a terrible product.</li>
    <li> Though I was able to get the job done, my appendix scar has never really healed up as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> essential zip popping tools, love this kit as it contains everything you could possibly want for ridding your face of a pimple.</li>
    <li> Not a bad kit I guess, but the quality of the craftsmanship is a bit lacking. I haven&#x27;t managed to get these to work yet, but that may well be due to my lack of skill.</li>
    <li> The price is worth 4 stars.  The tools are strong and appear well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few tools which are designed to be sharp, but are not.  That&#x27;s the reason for the missing star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, you get what you expect.</li>
    <li> This kit is great, I recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Had one already and my son wanted one for his self....he loves it.  Great Christmas present for teens and early twenty&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> the spade attachment is too fat and uncurved.</li>
    <li> I received this little set as a gift. It will come in very handy. I hate face and body acne.  I hope this will help get rid of it faster when it pops up!</li>
    <li> i wish there were more detail in the instructions on how to use these. i suppose they are more for professionals. either way, the quality seems pretty good. nothing fancy</li>
    <li> The quality of the tools is really poor to the point were I feel like they could break on me. Some of the items are misshapen.   But by reading the reviews you&#x27;d believe they were pure gold. I have a feeling the reviews were fake.</li>
    <li> I wanted to use this for extractions but it doesn&#x27;t work. I steamed my face beforehand, but trying to remove blackheads on my nose doesn&#x27;t work, the pressure of the instrument just made my nose all red. For other blemishes, the tools also just don&#x27;t work, I know you&#x27;re not supposed to use your fingers but they work better. The tools push on your skin but don&#x27;t push anything out. Waste of money. :(</li>
    <li> I have bought much cheaper versions that are constructed far better. The choice of multiple accessories is a great idea but the just don&#x27;t attach well. Causes the entire tool to be loose and difficult to use. If not for the shoddy connections I would have rated a four or even five. The kit can be saved and become a great success if a knew or sturdier  method for connecting them is implemented. On the right track just not worth purchasing at this time.</li>
    <li> I like this products every thing what I need in a case, and so easy to carry in my purse</li>
    <li> Great quality and works really well. I am able to get little pimples that otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t even know had anything in them.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging for the product. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This set is everything you need, all in one. Very handy, and very east to use. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good set of tools to work with. Anyone looking to take better care of their skin should have this in a drawer in their bathroom.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and I believe I have used it more than she has. All sorts of tools for getting at the things you can&#x27;t reach. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a rounded lasso.</li>
    <li> works well even got one for my dad</li>
    <li> My husband gets a lot of ingrown hairs and other skin/pore issues and this kit has a lot of good, sturdy different tips to help with them</li>
    <li> this is a great produch it work great i used it every week i love it thank you so much</li>
    <li> Good quality, right price.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3UMOVLCGFEB0L]]First let me start off by stating the reviews (the positive ones anyways) are all fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first, this thing sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center post which is used to connect all of the attachments to has NO THREADS. I repeat, no threads so you cannot screw anything into either side. They&#x27;re as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Either someone forgot to do it or these products just suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are NOT high quality at all, They feel like they&#x27;d bend under the slightest amount of pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not having threads isn&#x27;t bad enough, some of the attachment slide right into the opening (with no way to secure them since they can&#x27;t screw in) and some attachments just don&#x27;t fit in the hole period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this as a gift but I&#x27;ll be having my girlfriend return this item as defective.</li>
    <li> These tools work a lot better than the electric suckers. I got an electric one with mist and tried everything but it was too gimmicky. These simple tools work a lot better, but be careful! When the instructions say they can damage the skin, they mean it. Just follow the directions and don&#x27;t over do it. Do it lightly one day on just a few spots, then see how your skin looks the next day and decide if you need to do it harder or not.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool everyone should own one.</li>
    <li> this is easy to use and very easy to clean. for people that have acne i would reconmend this. worth the money</li>
    <li> Bought this as an upgrade to the standard extraction tool available at Walmart and didn&#x27;t want to spring for the $45 kit.  Some of the ends don&#x27;t fit (too loose) into the handle, but will get the job done.  Next time I&#x27;ll go with the better kit.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend cause the edges of mines came unfinished and I can&#x27;t use cause it&#x27;s very sharp and may cut my clients</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother spending more money on other tool kits, this is all you need.  The pieces screw together solidly (way better than the single piece, single package tools sold.)  Just make sure you are careful and always sterilize your instruments.</li>
    <li> It is a great set. It haws all the things in it one requires when using a skin care kit</li>
    <li> finally something that won&#x27;t scar my face.</li>
    <li> I already had a blackhead extractor, both ends being loops with different sizes.  I wanted a lance and different extractors so I bought this set.  Quality of the extractors is bad.  The tips screw are not aligned nor the metal tube.  Tips aren&#x27;t bend but when passed by your skin you can feel the sharp ends of the tips, i am going to have to sand some of the tips to be smooth. I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Low quality attachments with very visible molding seams. Very cheap feeling.  Do not recommend.</li>
    <li> i thought surely this would at least be worth the (fairly reasonable) price i paid for it.  honestly, it&#x27;s not.  the lancets are dull, and the tips on some are even bent!  the extractors are not made well, and the uneven spots could seriously damage delicate facial skin.  this is absolutely not worth buying.  look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Like others, I found the instruments bulky for very delicate pimple care, maybe it&#x27;s better for larger skin issues. The lancets and edges of presses worked, but you have to be very controlled and not overdo it.  Try just a little at a time and be careful and patient with blackhead and tough whitehead removal.  Keep the instruments disinfected with alcohol.  I did find other uses for some of the instruments, e.g., cleaning ears (long loop item), removing staples (lancets), etc.  I will use this moderately for skin care and also other uses.</li>
    <li> I find myself going to this every time I need to pick! I dont use all of the tools but there are a few that are A+ in this set. The detachable ends untwist and become loose and make the tool extra long and awkward to hold but other than that its a great set for the price!</li>
    <li> these are exactly what I expected with exception of the things I did not expect. Overall, these are great and the travel case is nice, though I don&#x27;t see myself traveling with this item. Usually we take care of the wifes blackheads at home, before we travel and after a hot shower for her pores to open up. The tools work great and the gnarled handle helps me keep a grip while I am working on my wifes gnarled back. The handle is machined in such a fashion that, no matter how much puss, blood or sebum you get on your hands, it wont slip. Also, a great tool to inflict pain while she thinks you are trying to help that big ole gorrilla girl.</li>
    <li> Great price and nicely made tools. (Keep away and out of reach from children of any age and pets)</li>
    <li> This is great if you know how to use them but if you don&#x27;t don&#x27;t get it you could be causing more harm then good.</li>
    <li> This product, was not what I expected! The box was damaged and very dirty as if  someone handled the box after eating sticky food.I was afraid to touch it. Once open the inside pouch appeared to be in good condition , but upon further review, the pouch was worn around all the edges, this product was clearly .USED. I open the blue pouch to  inspect the attachments, they were not in their proper places,  tool was worn, and appeared to have tobacco or some type of  crumbs stuck in one end, the other end was a build up of what appeared to be soap our some other nastiness. The attachments had wear around the screw part and several of them were discolored black not silver. Needless to say,I won&#x27;t be using this disgustingly dirty product. A complete waste of money</li>
    <li> I works better than pinching the heck out of my face and such. I would suggest this to my friends</li>
    <li> I had the same experience of other reviewers, that the tools do not apply the correct pressure to extra anything.  Unlike others, I didn&#x27;t think the tools were of poor quality - they&#x27;re good.  Not to be gross, but I&#x27;ve had better results with fingers than with this kit, so like, what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> kinda cheap. they don&#x27;t really hold very tight to the metal body.Could be bette rifthey were more solid. too bad</li>
    <li> I get boils from food allergies, these are great fir getting them popped to stop the pain and are easy to sterilize.</li>
    <li> It is a nice product for someone who has constant problems with a skin on their face. I bought it for myself but I am using in general only one item only from this small bag, although there is many of them I don&#x27;t got that far yet to use all of them. Nice small bag, if you store it in that bag and not throwing around the place I am sure it will last over a life time. High quality product. Highly recommend. Stop squeezing your nose, get this item and you will feel professional approach to the problem you have with your skin.</li>
    <li> All the spoons are sharp and jagged, not worth more then $1.</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t screw together.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great product.. Just having hardtime using i..</li>
    <li> would be happier if instructions were more detailed and included in the package having to research how to use tools.</li>
    <li> One of the best thing I got through Amazon, it is an every house must have kit.&lt;br /&gt;Good for all kind of pempils and black heads.</li>
    <li> Great product for an even greater price. Much easier to help clear up skin problems and not mess up surrounding tissue.</li>
    <li> This is a  great product, at an excellent price point. It arrived promptly and just as described. We use it for professional use and it held up.</li>
    <li> Everything you&#x27;ll ever need to deal with skin problems that also comes in an \\&quot;easy to store\\&quot; case.  Many different shaped tools that can be used separately.</li>
    <li> so it&#x27;s a product ment to help pop pimples, but you could do the same with your fingers and it would be quicker and easier. kinda fun to play with though.</li>
