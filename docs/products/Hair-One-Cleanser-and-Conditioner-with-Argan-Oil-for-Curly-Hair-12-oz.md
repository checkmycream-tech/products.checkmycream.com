<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This broke off my hair</li>
    <li> This makes my curly hair very happy!  It doesn&#x27;t lather up at all, so you just have to get used to that.  My hair is left shinig and curling.  No need for conditioning.</li>
    <li> I used a whole bottle before I decided to leave a review. It left my hair so tangly and frizzy I could barely take a brush or comb through it. When paired with a leave in, it at least dries well. However, my curls looked great when styled. Just a little frizzier than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a packet of the normal hair one, and it didn&#x27;t do the same tangly thing. It was more like the real Wen. But I&#x27;m going back to the real Wen, hoping it make my hair manageable and not dry again.</li>
    <li> Excellent, brings out the curls!!!</li>
    <li> I like this vrry much...will re order</li>
    <li> This is the answer to frizz.  Finally!  I have tried Wen Fig cleansing conditioner, also (which is supposed to be the best for frizzy hair) and this is actually better.  One small complaint, but not enough to bring it down to a 4, is that it takes a while, longer than I am used to, to rinse it out.  This can be frustrating because there is no such thing as a &amp;#34;quick shower&amp;#34; anymore.  I am forced to take my time.  It can be a little tedious at first, because it takes more than a typical shampoo would, but it is so, so worth it and you get used to the extra time.  It is like magic when it comes to how my hair looks and feels ... my tangly, coarse, thick, wavy hair becomes bouncy and smooth. I am so glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used both!  In fact, there&#x27;s what&#x27;s left a gallon jug of Wen in my shower.  I have used the Olive Oil and the Jojoba formulas of Hair One before and liked them okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair One&#x27;s new Argan formula blows everything away, even Wen.  At least it does for me and my hair. I purchased a bottle a couple of weeks ago at Sally&#x27;s and love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I haven&#x27;t put shampoo in my hair since the middle of 2008. It&#x27;s been Wen or Hair One only, but I have used super cheap conditioners to clean out the henna I use in my hair once a month.  I don&#x27;t even use shampoo then.  My hair is just as clean as it was with shampoo, except it&#x27;s not dried out and frizzy.  I am of mixed ethnicity, primarily black, but with the rest of the world (my ancestors were a randy bunch!) mixed in. My hair is curly, thick, and usually unmanageable.  I stopped relaxing my hair in 2010, and because I&#x27;m only using the cleanser conditioners, the results are better than what I had hoped.  My hair is very soft and air-dries into curls, not frizz, and that is easy to flatiron when needed.  The most significant thing is that I have no split ends. When I stopped using shampoo I stopped getting split ends. Even when I was still relaxing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair One is in my opinion, equal to Wen. It doesn&#x27;t *feel* equal when you pump it into your hand. Wen definitely has a more luxe feel in the hand and in the hair.  You have to use lots in order to get your hair clean and conditioned, and you have to let it stay in your hair for a period of time.  I think that most of the negative reviews on this are due to people using these products incorrectly. You must let it sit after massaging it through. Just finish the rest of your shower, and it should be fine. My hair gets very clean, there&#x27;s no buildup, there&#x27;s  no breakage, and my hair is healthier than it was when I started using them. I&#x27;m 59 years of age at the time of this writing, and my hair is just as thick, soft, and shiny as anyone in their 20s or 30s. And three years ago I was beginning to see my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Argan formula is perfect for my wild hair. It does a better job of cleaning than the Wen (which is saying a lot!) and I love the fragrance so much more. It&#x27;s better as a leave-in than the Wen is, and seems to do a good job of protecting my hair when I decide to blow-dry and flatiron it. Air-drying after using this is a dream.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair and I love the way it leaves my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I can highly recommend this, BUT you have to use it correctly in order to get the best results. Like so many others who have used these products successfully, I can say that I will never use shampoo in my hair again. Which reminds me ... you know how after you use a brand of shampoo for a while that it stops working as well as it did in the beginning? You will find that if you use these products, that won&#x27;t happen. I can&#x27;t explain it - I used to change shampoos every three-four months because they became ineffective after a while.  I&#x27;ve gone as long as eight months with nothing but one brand/style of cleansing conditioner and never had that problem.e years ago I was beginning to see my scalp!

    <li> Bought it to try instead of the more expensive Wen. It was terrible and left too much residue in my hair. I have now gone back to Wen. Oh well, the price was worth a try!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I decide to comment on this product. I mainly use this as a leave n condish and I must say it works well on my hair it really help with the frizz and it keep my hair real curly that I don&#x27;t have to use other products and you can use it daily and it don&#x27;t make your hair sticky like a lot of other products I have use on my hair it&#x27;s the best thing for my hair a must try and it smells great too a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Better and cheaper than Wen!</li>
    <li> I got a bottle of this for Christmas, and I love it! It makes my hair feel nice and soft, and seems to make it more manageable. But most importantly (to me), I love the way my hair feels when I use it! The menthol feels nice on my scalp, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t great (especially if you don&#x27;t like the smell of menthol), though, and once I got to the bottom of the bottle (maybe a solid inch left?) it was ridiculously difficult to get the rest of it out. Its efficacy as a cleanser is greatly affected by how oily/greasy my hair is (sometimes, I have to use a little shampoo as a \\&quot;degreaser\\&quot;, though that may be my fault for going too long in between washes), and it does NOT have the same \\&quot;stripping\\&quot; effect as regular shampoo; a pro for me, since my hair is thick/frizzy and I don&#x27;t like having too much oil stripped from my hair. This could be a con for other hair types, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this and will be buying another bottle!</li>
    <li> Right after using this product, I was happy with how soft my hair was.  The next day, my scalp was sore to touch.  I also had a few places that were very irritated.  I must be allergic to something in the product as I&#x27;ve never had anything like this happen before. I put the product in my hair and rinsed it out.  I&#x27;ll pass the product along to a friend and tell her my experience and to use it sparingly the first time to make sure she isn&#x27;t allergic as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this because Wen is so expensive. It works about the same although last night I used it and my hair isn&#x27;t as nice as usual. Maybe using cheap shampoo first really did hurt the hair! Anyway, I purchased it because of the ARgan oil which I love only to realize it was for curly hair. Luckily I have curly hair and while mine is very long it did bring back some of the curls. IT smells nice and it works in the same fashion as Wen. I was able to get it in 2 days too with Prime which was nice. Good product for you hair. It does lather a bit too but no sulfates!</li>
    <li> Best stuff for my curly / unruly hair, leaves it shiny, curly and manageable. I use a lot less than it says in the directions and find it well worth the $$.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for about a year and loved it. It&#x27;s just very expensive. I tried this product due to reviews that it was just as good. It is not. Not even close. It&#x27;s not a bad product,  just can&#x27;t be compared to Wen.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  My hair feels so clean after I use it.  The only negative is the pump is a little thin....&lt;br /&gt;I think if they improved the pump this would be a five star.</li>
    <li> A lot of work for not much benefit.  I used it for about two weeks and then got tired of all the work.</li>
    <li> Was using the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method on my hair, and decided to try this! Wow! My curls came back, and my hair seem to be growing even faster. I am older, so my hair was beginning to be thin and lank, but no more! Thank you, Hair One!</li>
    <li> After years of smoothing my hair, I decided to go more natural. My curly hair has a tendency to get frizzy, so when I stumbled on this product, I decided to give it a try.  It far exceeded any expectations.  After one use, my hair, which tends to be dry, is very soft with defined curl and NO frizz!  I followed the directions but did not use as much as directed, which seemed excessive.  I suppose if you have very thick hair, using the amount directed might be necessary, but for my shoulder-length, fine hair I used about the same amount as I would any other shampoo/conditioner and got excellent results.</li>
    <li> Great product, really helps my frizzy curly hair. I do think it makes my hair a little more tangled than most conditioners, but does a great job otherwise.</li>
    <li> Love this! I am Caucasian with curly hair type 2c and my hair is very very thick. It&#x27;s about shoulder length and it gets tangled pretty easy by the end of the day, I&#x27;ve used this product twice and love how soft and manageable my hair has been, was afraid it would be greasy because it basicly like co-washing but it works great! Hair feels clean soft and curls better. Smells great and I would defiantly buy again the price is fantastic for the product.</li>
    <li> I used this according to the directions on the bottle and per the reviewers. This stuff is just plain nasty! My hair stinks like it is dirty and feels the same way. I would NEVER recommend this to anyone unless you want dirty stinky hair! My curls are now all frizzed out from it! I&#x27;m going back to my Suave and moroccanoil curl cream. That stuff is great!</li>
    <li> I love this! My hair feels healthy, soft and clean after using it. For me, it worked better than Wen at a fraction of the price</li>
    <li> After reading another users review, I ran out and bought two bottles at Sally Beauty Supply.  I was scared at first because I didn&#x27;t like the smell...it reminded me of a spice cabinet...and I was afraid I was going to smell like that all day.  I tried it this morning and I have to say that my hair does feel more moisturized than it did when I used the olive oil, and I DON&#x27;T smell like a spice cabinet.  I am a Wen girl all the way, but there are times I just don&#x27;t feel like waiting for it ship from the company, nor do I feel like shelling out $40.00 for a bottle (this includes shipping and handling).  Hair One is definitely my back-up during those times.    One thing I like to mention to those who try Wen and Hair One:  I purchased a water softening shower head ($20.00 at most hardware stores) to maximize the performance of these products.  I find that they last longer when I do.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this. The bottle proclaims to be anti frizz and add shine. Well my hair has never been so frizzy as the few times I have used this cleanser. Directions say to leave product in hair longer for best results. The longer I left it on before rinsing, the frizzier my hair got once it had dried. Can not recommend this. My hair does better with trader joes tea tree oil shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> The stench of bad perfume is so overwhelming it hardly matters whether the stuff works on my curly hair.  Feel like it needs to be disposed of with toxic waste.  I should have listened to others&#x27; warnings.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a shot.  I&#x27;m not totally disappointed, but I will keep using Wen products.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product that I hope to never be without.  My 2 daughters and I have bery long, very curly ethnic hair and this product is the best for detangling hair and making it soft without being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can only have one product to use in my hair, this would be it because you can cleanse, condition, and detangle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I buy it in the liter size.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no substitute for Wen.  It left my hair feeling and looking heavy and it didn&#x27;t really cleanse very well.  I&#x27;m also not a fan of the fragrance.  I used it a couple of times and then threw the rest out.  I bought it at Sally Beauty Supply and the sales associate assured me it was an exact dupe of Wen.  It isn&#x27;t even close!!  I&#x27;m going back to my beloved Wen, which leaves my hair light and shiny and very healthy looking.  I&#x27;m sorry I wasted money on this do nothing product.  I should have stuck with what worked but I was trying to save some money.  Of course, this experience has convinced me that there&#x27;s simply no substitute for the original.  I strongly suggest you try Wen, even though it&#x27;s more expensive.  You&#x27;ll love your hair.  And if you have several hair issues like I do (dryness, frizz, color treated) you&#x27;ll be happy to know that Wen works for every single one.  There&#x27;s simply nothing like it!  I definitely don&#x27;t recommend Hair One.</li>
    <li> Wow, I just love the One Hair products. While in Florida, I was introduced to the one for colored hair by a friend. I started using it right away. Then I found out they had one for Curly Hair. I tried it and loved it too. When I went back to Canada I bought of bottle of each, thinking when I get back home in the snow the products will not do the same... welllll.. it did. But now I&#x60;m running out and everywhere I&#x60;ve inquired, they can&#x60;t seem to ship in Canada. If any of you know where I can get the product please , please let me know.</li>
    <li> like everyone else with insomnia, I&#x27;d seen the Wen infomercial and wanted to try it badly.  So after a few years of sitting on the fence, I dipped my toe in and bought one travel packet last week for a trial run.  I usually use 4 products (shampoo/conditioner included) for my wash and treat, but for my experiment, I went with just using the Wen.  Even without the hydrating mask I was cloud 9 happy.  I never realized how much gunk was weighing my hair down until last week- every strand seemed light, bouncy, super shiny, super soft, and it stayed like that for days! Even though this seemed to be the hair solution I had been waiting for, I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on hair products.  So I started looking for alternatives, which leads me here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short- Hair One with Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t even come close to Wen.  In fact, it pretty much undid everything Wen did, and brought my hair full circle to exactly how it was when I used shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner and argan oil treatment. The difference between what my hair looked like before I washed it with hair one, and now is shocking.  And I had been rocking the Wen wash for 5 days when I washed with Hair one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I hate how my hair is right now, it is only because I&#x27;m directly comparing it with Wen.  On it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal with marginal results, and it did give me the exact same results I had been used to while using the 4 products listed above- hence the 3 stars.  But if you&#x27;re hoping to get Wen-like results, think again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Yes, I used the product as instructed by the manufacturer, exactly the same way I used Wen.  I&#x27;m used to washing with SLS free products, so I do know how long it takes to rinse out.  I also only used the recommended dime size amount as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I have medium-long hair, medium thickness, 3a/b hair (for the CG&#x27;s out there)</li>
    <li> This is the best way I&#x27;ve found to clean my fine curly hair that dries out when I use regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I tried this before Wen, and to be honest, I like it better for my fine, curly hair.  I&#x27;ve tried the sweet almond Wen and the One Argan Oil seems to make my hair happier.  Trick in using these products is you need to really massage it on all of the scalp so you don&#x27;t feel like you have dirty hair.  This is essentially &amp;#34;co-washing.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s been a nice switch but still figuring it out.  My hair still looks like my hair, just a little better. (co-washing for over a month now)</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it several times and its awesome.</li>
    <li> Honestly this didn&#x27;t work as well for me as for some people.  I have very curly and dry hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased the hair one for my mother and myself. My hair felt so soft and manageable wished I&#x27;d purchased a larger bottle. Love it!</li>
    <li> BEST SHAMPOO IN THE WORLD, WOULDN&#x27;T USE ANYTHING ELSE. MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> Amazing product. I can&#x27;t afford Wen, but i hear this is similar and I&#x27;ve got no complaints:) my hair feels great!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s &amp; have never had dandruff in my life. After using this product for 2 weeks, I have been suffering with severe dandruff  for 2 weeks now. I will never use this product in again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wen sweet almond mint in the past and loved it, but I was searching for a less pricey alternative. This works just as good as Wen, but without the outrageous price tag! With just one use, I noticed how defined and moisturized my curls were. It also adds body, shine and most importantly, manageability! Every time I used hair one it felt as if my hair has been to the spa! I was actually able to run my fingers through my curls! Also, my little secret?....It makes a great facial cleanser as well! My skin was so soft and supple after using this on my face. Of course, this is my personal experience. I would recommend this to anyone with curly, thick, and natural hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a less expensive alternative to Wen products (which I had tried in a small sample packet size... but I didn&#x27;t like Wen because it was too mint-y; too much scalp stimulation). I&#x27;ve been using this Hair One product for about 3 weeks and it is making my hair stronger and less frizzy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Hair One for about two years and absolutely love the product.  Nothing has worked on my very (very) curly hair the way this product works.  But, the packaging.  Horrible!  By the time I&#x27;m two-thirds done with what&#x27;s in the bottle, the pump won&#x27;t work.  The last third always has to be beaten out, scooped out, or thinned with water to get it out of the bottle.  I&#x27;d prefer this stuff in a jar like coconut co-wash.</li>
    <li> The directions for this product are the same instructions you get in the \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; style of hair care for curly hair: massage it into your scalp until your arms get tired, rinse a bit, apply more product all through the hair, leave it on until you&#x27;re done showering, rinse if you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing is, the \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; method is done with conditioner, but Hair One is listed as a cleanser and conditioner.  So what makes Hair One a cleanser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the ingredients are conditioner ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the pH is adjusted.  I can&#x27;t tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, this is just a conditioner.  I get the same results with this as I do with Aussie conditioner, which is approximately half the price for twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it isn&#x27;t that there&#x27;s anything wrong with this Hair One product; it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s pretty much a waste of space, or money, or maybe both.</li>
    <li> I like this a lot, but i do not find it cleans my hair well enough. I use &amp;#34;as i am&amp;#34; cleanser then fginish with this. It makes my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I feel lead to write this review because there are people reviewing this product inaccurately because they don’t know Wen or Hair One very well and how they work.  I’ve been using Wen for 3 years and it completely transformed my hair from breaking constantly to elastic and healthy.  However, I found myself trying Hair One when I ran out of Wen while waiting for the annual, 1 gallon, QVC special in June and the results were HORRIBLE.  I was astonished at the cheap price but soon discovered the reasoning behind its price point.  First, the consistency of Hair One is like whipped cream, it’s frothy and easily collapses!!  You have to use TONS of product to get enough on the hair to make it work with water.  Due to this light, poor consistency, you have to use double the amount of product which inevitably costs the same as Wen and you’re paying for a far INFERIOR product to boot.  Wen’s consistency is thick, dense and creamy so it doesn’t collapse and goes a long, long way.  Second, after washing my hair with Hair One, it was dry and wirey.  NOTHING like Wen!!  After washing with Wen, your hair is smooth and silky.  After using Hair One, I was actually afraid to brush my hair because it was so dry and stripped.  Trust me there are much harsher cleansers in this product ladies, NO QUESTION!!  It is not the equivalent to Wen by a LONG SHOT!!  I’m just a regular woman from Frederick, Maryland and have nothing to gain from writing this review other than helping another woman from wasting her money on this cheap knock off product.  Sally Beauty, if you want to make a product comparable to Wen, you need to go back to the drawing board and use just as good ingredients as found Wen because Hair One is as harsh as Suave.  I know the Hair One label “claims” to have the same ingredients but trust me, they are MUCH cheaper, low grade, replica ingredients.  So ladies, suck it up and stick with Wen.  You aren’t saving a dime with this product whatsoever because you are using double the amount of product to cover your hair and you’re drying it out in the process.  To date, I haven’t found anything comparable to Wen and if I do, I’m sure the price point will be comparable to Wen.  Quality products cost money ladies and if you seriously care about repairing and keeping your hair strong, you are going to have to invest wisely and buy Wen.  I’m just your average housewife and not wealthy by any means so I have to budget to buy Wen.  However, it’s worth the sacrifice to keep my hair healthy and strong.  You would be wise to do the same!!</li>
    <li> I am mixed and I had 3a hair but this product turns it into a longer, calmer 2c, which I love! This is the only thing that has ever worked for my hair.. I&#x27;m 20 and I&#x27;m finally finding a great product!</li>
    <li> I read reviews of the product &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34;, and saw that it was expensive.  Reviewers recommended Hair ONE as an alternative, being just as effective and less costly.  I have not tried Wen, but am very satisfied with the results from Hair ONE.  I have &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; fine, curly hair.  It tends to get frizzled ends.  This product helps my hair to feel very soft, and with more control.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to take a few more minutes with the product and leave it on.  I start by wetting my hair, applying the product, and putting on a cheap plastic shower-cap for a few miunutes while I do other things.  Then I get into the shower and continue with the routine.  I have short hair, and use less than the directions suggest.  But I am hoping to be able to let my hair grow a bit longer by using this product and not feeling the need to get my hair trimmed as often as before.  You do NOT need a separate shampoo and conditioner, so the price is OK.</li>
    <li> Gritty did not like it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this just once, but my curls seriously look fantastic today! I was a little skeptical on how much of the product you have to use, but the results don&#x27;t lie. Wish I could upload a picture. My hair is long, loose ringlet curls.</li>
    <li> I used WEN for about a year. I liked it, but was having some trouble with the company and my auto ship.... Long story short, I decided to look for a comparable product. I love this shampoo! I have some WEN still left in my shower, but always grab this bottle instead. It works the exact same way. No suds when washing, no build up, and leaves my curls very soft. I&#x27;m so happy I took a chance on this product!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell in order to use the product. Perfumes, colognes or any flowery type aroma leaves me with migraines. If your sensitive to smells pass this by. Good news is the seller was very gracious allowing me to return it.</li>
    <li> I had a friend rave about this product, but I find leaves my hair too greasy, even when I rinse it out. I&#x27;ve got thick, curly hair and want a good hydration product, but this is just grease.</li>
    <li> I love the Hair One Products.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean at all it just builds up day after day and my hair looks greasier every time i use it. I just use it as a conditioner on my ends only and it&#x27;s much better that way. Nice and thick, stays on my hair, smells nice, and tingles!</li>
    <li> I used to use the Olive Oil Hair One pump when I still had straight hair from flat iron and it was cool. Now that I&#x27;m natural and curly wurly Lol I use the Argan Oil pump for a co-wash. It definitely helps define the curls and it moisturizes. I recommend for a co-wash most definitely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 years. Good-by dry hair! I have mixed hair so its really curly and gets really frizzy, this product has helped maintain frizz free curls while keeping my hair soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> I was expecting more on this product.  I didn&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> I have fairly short, medium texture, very wavy hair. I always struggle with dryness and split ends from my dry climate, coloring and heat appliances. I started using Wen Lavender for a few months and did see some improvement, but nothing very special. After becoming disabled I just could not afford Wen anymore. I have tried other formulas of Hair One in the past, but not this formula. The first time I used it I noticed how glossy my hair was. It took several times to figure out just how much to use. I can&#x27;t use it as a leave in at all. I also use the mask which is outstanding as well as a pea size drop of the curling cream. My hair stylist raved at the health of my hair at my last trim. The other day I looked under a high powered mirror and could not find a single split end! My hair went from hair horror to pretty much wash and go. I have soft, glossy, healthy hair now with fantastic curl definition. The shipping was lightning fast and it qualified for super saver shipping. I have already ordered two more bottles! File of thumb here is to allow you hair enough time to figure out how much works for you. Your hair will reward you for your efforts!!</li>
    <li> I have been using HAIR ONE for about 2 years now. I like it very much. It cleanses very well and leaves the hair nice and soft. Sometimes I do need a leave in conditioner or oil.</li>
    <li> Would not buy this kind did not like maybe other wen products are good but this one not good just dii with this one my try another kind</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now...was hoping for an alternative to Wen to use along with it to help save $.  I read reviews and I thought I would try for myself, but this is not moisturizing at all, I think it&#x27;s actually somewhat drying on my medium length natural curls.  I use the DevaCare No Poo and use Wen once a week and this is not comparable to either for me.  I am very disapointed and may send it back...if I can.  The DevaCare is much more moisturizing and when I order the 32 oz bottle it;s actually cheaper than this stuff.  Sorry....i wanted to like this, but it&#x27;s just not moisturizing at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product overall, but it leaves a film on my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and decided to buy this because i read that it is comparable to Wen which I loooove. Unfortunately, Wen is pricey and doesn&#x27;t accept the professional hairstylist discount unless I want to start selling them retail so I thought I&#x27;d try this way cheaper alternative because some of the first few ingredients are similar to Wen.  I read this product is cheaper at Sally&#x27;s so I went and bought it there (also thought I could return it easily if I don&#x27;t like it).  Found out it&#x27;s actually a couple $ cheaper on Amazon vs Sally&#x27;s.  I have curly, frizzy hair, not super thick but a good head of hair and I have used every professional curling product so I would say I&#x27;m pretty knowledgeable with what brands work well for my hair type and which don&#x27;t. Wen is the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down, I do use a conditioner after I shampoo with it just to give me extra moisture but it&#x27;s not necessary.  My hair is so shiny and soft when I use it.  I had high hopes for this product thinking it would work as well, and it definitely is a good alternative to most shampoos, but doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as Wen in my opinion.  I&#x27;m still going to use the rest of the bottle because like I said its a still a decent product for the price, I would recommend to people using this over using a regular shampoo that lathers any day.  But I say if you have the extra money to spend on Wen, it really is superior.  One more thing, I usually like any scents in products and am not picky in that department, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell of this.  It smells like a hormonal teenage boy to me haha.  It&#x27;s a cheap cologne smell that&#x27;s a little off. Not ideal.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, hair feels thicker after I use it and it speeds up my shower time since you don&#x27;t have to cream rinse</li>
    <li> Great stuff... so glad i had the guts to give it a shot...  These are better than any of the MANY shampoos i&#x27;ve tried...</li>
    <li> Great for a change from my regular routine.</li>
    <li> It took me a bit of time to get use this product. I find it&#x27;s very dependent on the right amount being put in your hair and being distributed equally around. Too little and it doesn&#x27;t work, too much and you get greasy hair, the right amount and you can&#x27;t go wrong. With that being said I didn&#x27;t use as much as the bottle told me to. My hair is medium length, thick but better described as \\&quot;a lot\\&quot; of thin/fine hair. I use 3 pumps for the back of my head and hair, working it through the hair using water as needed. Then I use 2 additional pumps on the rest of my scalp/top of head. Work it through my hair, then comb it through... if I run into tats I add a bit more water. Then I leave it on for the remainder of my shower. I make sure I rinse my hair well, then while it is still soaking wet I flip my head upside down and put in one more leave in pump and scrunch it all through my hair roots to tips then lightly towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use half the product I had to use before with shampoo and conditioner. I use to use gel in my hair and I&#x27;d go through a $11/bottle every 2 weeks. Now I use a little spray in gel, sprayed into my hands and scrunched into the ends and a light spray of hair spray here and there through out the day to keep things looking together. This product changed the texture of my hair and has added volume and shine. It seems to keep my hair better together at the roots which makes the rest of my hair stay together better through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this product is worth a try if you&#x27;ve been thinking about it. I have to tell you that I didn&#x27;t fall in love right away with it but I gave it a fair chance, I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and looking to order more. I haven&#x27;t tried the other kinds yet and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to since this one works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One down side to this product I&#x27;ve found is that second day hair style is pretty much not happening... maybe in a pony tail... where with my other products I could sometime revive my curls on the 2nd day... a worth while trade though in my books, as I quite enjoy my daily shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using 6 pumps a day, the 12oz lasted my 3 weeks... there was still conditioner in the bottom of the bottle but the pump would no longer grab it.. so once my second bottle is down a bit I&#x27;ll be draining the one into the other and hopefully get a few extra days out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also a pain to get shipped to Canada \\&quot;Beauty Online\\&quot; was who I purchased mine from. Pumps were included (watch out for that until you have purchased once to get the pumps, because as I said, you NEED to find the right amount for your hair or you won&#x27;t like this product) and bottles were plastic which I was thankful of since mine looked like it had been drop kicked more then a couple times by the postal services, but nothing was broken... the pumps were extra protected. Good packing job to Beauty Online!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Play with this product a bit before you give up on it... I had a love / hate relationship with my first bottle, until I found the right mix for my hair, now I LOVE IT and despite the shipping to Canada costing the same as 2 bottles of this product, I&#x27;m reordering... I&#x27;m just going to order more then 2 bottles this time. Besides... with the money I&#x27;m saving on product I&#x27;m still coming out on top.</li>
    <li> I love Hair One. I was very interested in trying Wen so I did a little research here on Amazon by looking up reviews for Wen and found in some of the reviews that there was a cheaper alternative to Wen called Hair One, and that Sally Beauty carried this product. I looked up reviews for this as well and saw some pretty good results in the reviews, so I thought that the next time I was able to get over to Sally Beauty, that I would look into buying some. I bought the single packet that Sally Beauty has as like a \\&quot;trial\\&quot; pouch, (it cost very little money) and I also purchased a bottle. I loved this product even after the first use. There was not enough cleanser in the pouch, but I used the cleanser from the bottle the next time I washed my hair and I love Hair One so much. Yes, you do have to get the right one for your hair type and follow the instructions, although, I find myself not needing as much of it as it says I would need for the length of my hair. Even though my hair is almost to the bottom of my back in length, it is kind of thinning so I do not need to use as much of the cleanser because if I use the minimum it says to use for my length of hair, most of the cleanser comes out when I comb my hair, which is supposed to distribute the cleanser evenly into the hair. I really love the way Hair One makes my hair feel after my hair is dry. I do have naturally curly hair and like I said before, my hair is thinning a bit. Normally, after I would wash my hair, my scalp and the roots of my hair would be oily, but the rest of my hair would be dry and frizzy, especially the ends. I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore with Hair One. My hair feels so soft and looks much healthier after only a few uses. I also find myself not feeling like I have to wash my hair every day or every other day like I used to. When I brush my hair while it&#x27;s dry, I don&#x27;t get a ton of frizz either. I just smooth my hair with my hand as I brush and it&#x27;s okay. I also don&#x27;t get really bad knots after sleeping with my hair down either like I used to. I have even recommended Hair One to a few friends and family members. I will keep recommending it to others as well. I will never go back to normal shampoo again. At least that&#x27;s my current opinion.</li>
    <li> Love the hair one products</li>
    <li> well i purchased this today, tonight i followed the instructions step by step and it did not make my hair feel greesyor weigh it down. my curls do have some nice definition. better then what i get with the usual shampoo cond. combo. it did tingle my scalp after a few minutes and  my forhead was a little red where the hair one was on it but it was fine it dident bother me to much. i think ill keep using it and see if it improves overall quality of my hair.</li>
    <li> I had frizzy curly hair and always felt like my curls were weighed down with other shampoos and conditioners. This product  is WAY cheaper than the other shampoo that rhymes with \\&quot;hen.\\&quot; I do an initial wetting/ scrub then let it sit in my hair while I shower. Later, i scrub my long hair between my flat hands with barely a sprinkle of water, I can then twist it above my head to allow the product back to my scalp and then I let it fall to the ends again to scrub them. I can do this up to three times using that first bit of product. Then I comb through, rinse and get a bit more to leave in for my trouble frizzy spots. Easy care hair! No more straightening to get rid of frizzies.</li>
    <li> I love the product. Has been doing wonders for ny hair. Ibwill definitely be buying more.  Also has great price when I purchased it compared to stores.</li>
    <li> I was so excited after reading other reviews for this product, but was so disappointed after first use. The product smells awful. Like rancid-food scraps-coated-in-perfumed-bathroom-spray awful. If you prefer hair products that have pleasant, subtle or sweet aromas, look for another brand.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my curls feel so healthy and have less frizz. I use it as a leave in condition too. Enhances my natural curls and waves. I love it. Wish I could get it a little cheaper, with how fast I go threw a bottle.</li>
    <li> I tried this cleansing conditioner mainly because of the price...This is the product I use for co-washing my natural hair!! The texture is smooth and creamy and it leaves my hair soo soft....It will bulid up on your scalp so make sure you clarify every month!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>
    <li> The product does give off a mint smell I&#x27;m going to attribute to the tingling sensation when you use the product. With all the rules and instructions on the bottle you would think is would be for salon use only. I draw the line a shampoo bottle barking out how many pumps i need but, that&#x27;s just me I guess. My hair did feel squeaky clean and fresh kind of like your mouth does when you brush your teeth then take a peppermint. I order this to use as a co wash but after using it I think I will just use it as a deep cleanse when I need it. This review is after my first use. Will update if something weird happens like the pump police questions me about how many pumps of product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Used to use Wen and have switched, this stuff is awesome...but please don&#x27;t raise the pricing. This is the first affordable Wen like shampoo I&#x27;ve found. Thank you for being there.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. This, I think is a given if I am buying this product. I have been searching for something that will show off my curl without weight it down or letting it frizz. This is that product. Granted, I use it a little differently than the instructions, I think this is an amazing product and would recommend it to you whole-heartedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method is to use two pumps for washing, getting into the scalp really well not so much worrying about the hair itself.&lt;br /&gt;(full disclosure, my hair is about 6&amp;#34; long and I wash it every day)&lt;br /&gt;I do not rinse until I am almost out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;After it is rinsed, I shake out excess water and use 1-2 pumps as a leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I wrap my head to absorb the majority of the water.&lt;br /&gt;Scrunch in a little of my favorite hair gel and voila! perfect curls.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week, I use a dandruff control shampoo instead, and the results are exactly what I want.</li>
    <li> I like this product more as a conditioner a little goes a long way. I would also use a clarifing shampoo and then this.</li>
    <li> my girl&#x27;s hair is sooo shiny!!! I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s perfect for us.</li>
    <li> It takes SO much product to get any result at all. I also tried using it as a leave in (per instructions), and it felt like I had put clay in my hair.</li>
    <li> I have corse hair and this just made it worse!  Could not comb my hair due to the heaviness of it!!!</li>
    <li> smells and works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 19-year old male, so I think I offer a different perspective on this product, as most consumers are likely female.  I used Wen for a few months but was never completely satisfied, maybe because of the high price, but mostly because it didn&#x27;t hydrate my hair very well.  Hair One with Argan Oil is much more suited for those of us with curly hair. Both Hair One and Wen cleanse well without drying out my hair, but I feel as though this product conditions better than Wen.  And for the large difference in price, Hair One is a much better choice.  (By the way, this shipped in 2 days!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But just like Wen, you have to use this product correctly.  I was previously accustomed to leaving some conditioner in my hair to keep it moisturized, rather than rinsing it all out in the shower.  But you do NOT want to do that with this product.  I made this mistake and it left a nasty residue/build-up in my hair.  This doesn&#x27;t use sulfates or detergents, so you have to thoroughly lather it in and rinse it out.  Also, just like Wen, you have to use a lot of the product for it to work correctly.  I made the mistake of just using the same amount as I would for normal shampoo/conditioner, and this left my hair dry.  As a rule of thumb, use more than you think you have to; you seriously can&#x27;t use too much.  With no sulfates, the product doesn&#x27;t distribute through your hair as easily, so you have to really work it into a lather, using a splash of water and a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, this may all sound like a lot to handle, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  It may add a few minutes to your shower routine, but for healthy, moisturized, clean, balanced, hair, it&#x27;s worth the money and the effort.  Personally, I was sick of having dry, frizzy curls and using leave-in conditioners, gels, and the like, which just caused buildup and more dryness.  With Hair One, you won&#x27;t need any other products, so this could essentially SAVE you money.  If you&#x27;re a Wen user, definitely give this a try; itworks just as well, if not better, and is A LOT cheaper.  But just as a warning, if you don&#x27;t think you can put in the extra effort, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product, because it won&#x27;t work if you don&#x27;t use it correctly.  But in the words of Andrew Carnegie, \\&quot;Anything in life worth having is worth working for.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the Cucumber Aloe version of Hair One because it was cheaper.  I did NOT work for my hair.  I used it just the same as the Argan Oil version, but it left my hair oily and with a lot of buildup.  Hair One with Argan Oil seems to have the highest ratings anyway, so even if you don&#x27;t have curly hair, I would recommend this one over the others.</li>
    <li> I used Wen for a long time and was looking for something less expensive. This product dried my hair out and smells awful, very musty like cheap mens cologne.</li>
    <li> Only used it once but it seemed to work very well for me. It curled my hair😄</li>
    <li> My scalp has gotten so dry that I thought I needed to try something besides the typical shampoos.  I love this stuff.  I does not dry my scalp and my hair feel clean.</li>
    <li> I still like Wen Fig cleansing conditioner better. BUT, this is a good alternative. Buy it from your local Sally&#x27;s beauty supply. It&#x27;s cheaper and you don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping. It works ok. I bought this before I bought Wen. I liked it so much that I went with the original and better Wen. Wen has better quality ingredients, botanical oils and extracts. I think REN (available on here or Rite Aid) is even better than this.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. It&#x27;s not wen but it cost a ton less but I think the outcome is the same as wen for no where near the price.</li>
    <li> I picked this up thinking that it would be healthier for my hair that what I had previously been using.  I usually put coconut oil in my hair after washing it, but this time I did not because I wanted to see what the product was like on it&#x27;s own.  My hair came out dry and frizzy.  It looked terrible.  It had never been frizzier.  Now I use Coconut Cowash by As I Am and it works wonders.  Also, putting coconut oil in your curly hair after showering really smooths it out and helps keeps it healthy.  I use plain old coconut oil people cook with and I buy it from Trader Joe&#x27;s.  Its cheap.  I&#x27;ve also used jojoba oil, but I like coconut oil much better.  Check out As I Am Coconut Cowash.  Its a much better product than this.</li>
    <li> Shampoos very well but difficult to get out of the bottle with the pump and even harder without the pump..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, but this bottle was delivered broken</li>
    <li> It is not the same as the WEN shampoo but it does do a semi good job.  Wen is better!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty comparable to Wen and it smells great.</li>
    <li> I do have WEN as well...and I would love to say that this is just as good (so I can save myself a ton of money) but it&#x27;s alright - pretty good - compared to the WEN.  The WEN is a thicker consistency and has more slip to it and I just find that that it&#x27;s easier to do my hair when using the WEN.  But really...not too much of a difference over all between the two.  I just do find that I prefer the WEN vs. Hair One.  BUT...I would definitely alternate w/ this to save some money! ;)</li>
    <li> I was hoping it was comparable to the Wen line of products.  True, it has not sulfates and does not lather, and it did feel like it had a little menthol in it, but I had to use more of the product to cover my hair and even after applying much more after rinsing, I could not even get the wide tooth comb through my soaking wet hair.  I pulled a lot of hair out.  Had to put some Wen in just to comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t try this one again.  Maybe their other products work better, but the one for curly hair did not.</li>
    <li> This is not even close to Wen. Splurge and buy the real thing! It is definitely not a good alternative to Wen. It made my hair feel dry and it got tangles a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Wen. And found this for cheaper it works ok it&#x27;s just got a stronger smell than I prefer. Like a men&#x27;s scent. If there was something unscented or lighter would try it again.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It still leaves my hair alittle frizzy but so do other shampoos.It washes well and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I must first say the pump never worked.  I had to squeeze the bottle so hard because so thick and it wouldn&#x27;t come out easily.  It is not Wen.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel no difference, it was like using a Dollar bottle of shampoo and not even a conditioner feel.  With Wen my hair felt wonderful. You get what you pay for.  Was trying to save money but wasted time, effort and money because it don&#x27;t work.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am in love! I have dry, course, curly hair. It usually is frizzy and feels like straw. But not anymore! This stuff really works! i bought a bottle for my mom and she loves it too. My hair did not have any oily adjustment period either; I&#x27;ve been using this almost daily for about a month. I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo!</li>
    <li> I thought that maybe people were being overly sensitive to the smell of it. They aren&#x27;t. My husband is an over the road trucker. He smelled my pillow and asked who I had in our bed. I had to run and grab this stuff to show him it was my stinky cleansing conditioner. It was so strong it gave me a headache. It is also really hard to clean out. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is the third month I have been using the Hair One for curly hair.  I found it when I was reading Amazon reviews for Wen products and I must say a big THANK YOU to the Amazon reviewers once again!  I read all the reviews, good and bad, and decided to give it a try since the price is right.  I am 44, white, with thin and curly color-treated, shoulder-length hair.  I have had \\&quot;bad hair\\&quot; my whole entire life. Frizzy and mostly disagreeable no matter how many or what type of product I have used.  I have tried cheap to expensive, nothing works for long if at all.    The first use of this was actually kind of traumatic.  I felt like it took forever and a LOT of hair seemed to come out in the shower, much more than normal and normally there is quite a bit.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel like straw exactly, but didn&#x27;t feel like I thought it would.  Not horrible, just not \\&quot;right\\&quot;.  I continued using it, trying to get the amount right for my hair (the biggest recurring theme I found in the reviews).  That took about a week and I found that too much or using it as a leave in conditioner at ALL was too much for me and left my hair greasy feeling and flat.    All that said, once I got the amount right (five pumps x 3, far more than some other reviewers who have more hair so I do think it is very person specific) and the routine down I began to notice a huge difference. After about ten days of using it every day, I noticed amazing definition to my curls that I never had before and I had to use much less gel to keep the frizz parade from showing up.  Plus, amazingly, my hair was so soft and tangle free, for the first time ever I could and still can run my fingers through it without running into a tangle.    I have found the \\&quot;down\\&quot; sides to be: learning a new shower routine, I have to spend about 3-5 more minutes in the shower total (which costs $ in water/hot water), my hair now takes quite a long time (like 2 hours) to air dry, which I will worry about when winter comes and every weekor so I feel like there is a little build up (I live on a farm so my hair gets dirtier than most) but I use just a teensy bit of regular shampoo to put in real quick and wash out right away and that is fixed.  The down sides are completely mitigated by these: I spend way less time and money on any and all products except Hair One (just a tiny bit of gel for the bangs styling and soft hairspray-just a smidge), the pile of hair in my shower and hair pick is now down to maybe a dozen hairs a day (seriously and that first day hair bomb never happened again, I still don&#x27;t know what happened there), I spend zero time ever anymore cursing my hair or lamenting over how crappy it looks, I don&#x27;t have to put in a headache-inducing elastic to hide my frizz in a bun by 11 am, and best of all even STRANGERS now tell me I have pretty hair.  No lie! And you know what? They are right.  For the first time in my life, I have hair other people want.    The best part of this is the lack of split ends and breakage.  The older I&#x27;ve gotten the harder it has been to grow my hair long and keep it long.  It just keeps breaking off. Until now.  Now I think I might be able to go longer between trims and actually have some hair grow.  It is definitely fuller because there is most definitely little to no breakage.  Oh! lastly, a couple of days ago my hair got caught in my necklace and I pulled it out and one piece got really caught.  In the past it would have broken right off.  This time it actually stretched, if you can believe that, and made a \\&quot;pooooinggg\\&quot; sound when it finally broke. Holy wow my hair is finally healthy!    Buy it, use it for at least two weeks.  It has made a huge difference to me and I will be using this as long as it keeps doing this marvelous thing to my hair.    UPDATE: two and a half years later...Still using this amazing product. I now only use about two pumps and often skip a day completely and just rinse my hair in the shower. I did find a product called \\&quot;Beautiful Curls\\&quot;, which is sold primarily at health food stores, that make great finishing products. I don&#x27;t use their shampoos, only the gel and toner and oil, but these really complement the Hair One. All of the hair on my head now only has Hair One on it, all the old stuff has obviously grown out by now. It is amazingly healthy. Strong and springy and shiny and soft. Literally everything hair should be, but mine was not. I now only use cider vinegar for \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; when we have a dirty day at the farm. I still recommend this product every chance I get and every person who has tried it, loves it. Only downside remains getting used to how much you need and making sure you rinse well. BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I bought  a sample of this at Sally&#x27;s and tried it. I like the texture and feel of my hair after but the scent is very overpowering and musky. I&#x27;m having an allergic reaction. I really wish people that make skin and hair care products would take into consideration that some of us can&#x27;t use heavily scented or any type of scented products. My eyes are itchy and I&#x27;m getting a headache. This is so strong it stays in my hair long after cleansing- totally unnecessary. I will go back to using my own cleanser I made with soapwurt and chamomile. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing but there is no overpowering scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my fine, wavy/curly hair which tends to frizz. I guess I will just have to make my own products similar to this to get away from sulfate shampoos.</li>
    <li> Its really just okay, i love hair one but I didn&#x27;t like this smell at all, there was something very off about it.  There are other hair ones with better smells.</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for about 6 months and have dreaded buying bottle after bottle, granted it lasts a long time. So I was in search of a cheaper alternative but still have the same quality I am used to. I picked this one because I have curly hair and want my curls to be defined but soft at the same time. This product does that. I still use styling products but I have noticed that my ringlets stay formed longer. I only wash with Hair One once a week and my hair feels great the whole time. I do condition and use smoothing oils throughout the week, along with styling products. I can even wet my entire head without washing and the curls bounce right back to life.</li>
    <li> The smell is to masculine, it did not compaire to WEN at all, left my daughters curly mixed hair feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I really like how my hair feels after using this product. My hair feels very soft and it gave me great curls. I also like the slight minty smell. It did not leave my hair oily or greasy at all. I recommend this product to any one with curly hair.</li>
    <li> I tried using Wen and loved it but did not love the \\&quot;trickery\\&quot; used by the company, ie... make your first purchase and you are unknowingly signed up via your credit card for automatic renewals to the tune of $90 each. I then began looking for a similar product and found Hair One Cleansing Conditioner and loved it.  It works as well as Wen at half the cost and I think it smells better than theirs.  Thanks Hair One!! Sincerely Maga Ma</li>
    <li> I choose to try this product at the recommendation of another Amazon reviewer, after reading reviews of [[ASIN:B0048O2R1E WEN® Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner 16oz]] and finding myself wincing at the price.  I found it at the local Sally Beauty Supply for the same price as Amazon, and was told I could return it if it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I chose the curly hair version with Argan Oil, but there were about 6 versions of this product to choose from dependent upon hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I read, and re-read the instructions prior to use.  I used a total of 10 pumps on my mid-back length hair and noticed a definite softening to the texture of my hair, with less frizz.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel dirty, but it did feel conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second use I used a bit less 8 pumps total, and then used 1 pump as a leave-in conditioner.  That left my hair too greasy feeling, so I decided a lighter spray to heat-protect my hair would work better than a conditioner. Still soft hair and silky when straightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third use I used the 8 pumps again, applying the first 4 on the top of my head and working it in, and then 4 more pumps from the nape of my neck up the back of my head.  I rub it all in, working it from scalp to hair ends and leave it on while I shower.  About 4-5 minutes total. I didn&#x27;t use it as a leave-in conditioner. The results on day 3 sold me.  My hair felt soft, had a nice sheen (my hair is full of gray and color treated, but you&#x27;d never know using this stuff).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fourth day I decided to try my regular shampoo.  I found my hair fuzzy more coarse, even with conditioning and leave-in spray conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product takes some getting used to, but if you can afford it, it&#x27;s worth a try.  The scent is pleasant, and I get a slight tingle on my scalp, but no burning. Your hair feels clean, but rinsing it properly and making sure you scrub your scalp while you are working it into your hair are very important to successful use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does for my hair is remarkable, but not magic.  It&#x27;s moisurizing hair cuticles and giving you more manageable, softer, moisurized hair, but without leaving it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions and you should find this product to be a great asset to your hair&#x27;s health and beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 9/4/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of this product and went back to traditional shampoo.  A mistake for me.  My hair became frizzier, less manageable and overall, just looked rough, even after I&#x27;d just had it professionally cut and styled.  My stylist doesn&#x27;t like this product, or Wen, however she did say my hair was healthier when I was using it.  For me, that&#x27;s a good enough reason to buy more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is smoother to the touch, has shine, curls bounce and no fuzzy-frizzies taking over in all kinds of weather.  It takes getting used to, but for the price and the wonderful results, I&#x27;ll keep recommending Hair One.o successful use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does for my hair is remarkable, but not magic.

    <li> I was a Wen girl for several years, but it is so expensive. Found this product decided to give it a try. It works awesome! Leaves my hair soft and full of defined curls. This does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have very thin fine brittle hair and it usually dries frizzy when I don&#x27;t use any product in it. With this Hair one I can let my hair air dry with no gunk in it.</li>
    <li> I had been using wen but I bought this to be a cheapskate. My hair is paying for it. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft as with wen. It also falls out like I&#x27;m using regular shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have used the Wen products but wanted to find something similar at less cost.  This is okay but it is hard to fully rinse out of your hair.  I often have clumps where my hair appears greasy because the product did not rinse completely out. It&#x27;s not as good as Wen, but is an okay substitute if you have a long time to rinse.</li>
    <li> My review is based on my use of Hair One Cleansing Conditioner with Argan Oil for Curly Hair.  I have never even sampled a Wen product, so I have no basis for comparison with that brand.  I have tried many other \\&quot;sulfate-free\\&quot; cleansers,(no sodium laureth sulfate or ammonium laureth sulfate), but nothing came close to Hair One.  I LOVE this product because it works as a cleanser, a rinse-out, a leave-in, and even a deep treatment conditioner.  The Argan oil formula seems to add life to my curly hair, leaving it soft, shiny, springy, and bouncy.  I don&#x27;t cleanse my hair every day, but sometimes I use this as a refresher rinse nearly every day, and I always use it as a leave-in \\&quot;curl cream\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any build-up or oil. It gives me the definition of a curl cream without stickiness, crunch, or weight.  It smells fantastic...earthy and cool, and it&#x27;s extremely soothing to my scalp, yet it&#x27;s also invigorating.  Occasionally my hair gets very, very dry, due to living in a desert,and/or hair coloring, and when this happens I&#x27;ll substitute the Argan Oil formula with the Olive Oil formula for a wash cycle. My hair&#x27;s body and shine is restored right away, and I&#x27;m back to an easy wash&amp;go hairstyle.  If I need to battle sudden frizz during the day, I find the Hair One Leave-in Spray is wonderful, and the Hair One products seem to enhance my hair in a synergistic way.  If only products like Hair One had come into being sooner, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent years and years thinking I had awful hair!</li>
    <li> I had ordered Wen awhile back and I loved loved loved it... it did everything the commercial said it would... but the price is just WAY to much to be spending on shampoo.  I did a little research and found this brand, and the other reviews said it was just like wen so I was excited!  But it wasn&#x27;t.. it left my hair oily and it wasn&#x27;t bouncy at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
    <li> I was taken by all the good reviews about this product so I bought it to try and see if I get the same results. I was so wrong my hair started falling out and it hasn&#x27;t stopped falling. I read some reviews saying that at first your hair will fall out a little bit then it will get stronger which is a total lie. I stopped using it now I&#x27;m searching for a shampoo that will save my hair.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and texture of the product. It is very similar to WEN (less expensive). I recommend this product if you have curly hair. My hair type is 3C/4A.</li>
    <li> Hair type: thin and curly&lt;br /&gt;Length: Short/pixie&lt;br /&gt;Abuse: high. (lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;.  I typically use it 5x a week--with the other two days being real shampoo days.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand for well over a year now and have been very very satisfied.  Be sure to transition yourself from shampoo to this no-poo.  It does take time.  I use less than the recommended amounts, but I have a boy cut.  It leaves my hair feeling soft, clean, and fragrant!  It even holds up to 10-mile-run hair and gets me squeaky clean.  Can&#x27;t be happier.  This particular smell is very authentic.  It has a very mature, nature-ish smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The bottle&#x27;s pump sometimes gives out towards the end of the life of the product.  Sucks.  That&#x27;s the reason for the 4-star.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give 3 1/2 because I like Hair One but not as much as other products I have tried. What I do like is that it is thinner and easier to spread in your hair in the shower and rinse out but I feel as if my hair is limper and straighter than with other products I have used and for a product for curly hair this is not what I want. I also seem to have static in my hair which is unusual for me even if I add a small amount in as a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 3 star is because it does make my hair shiny, well as shiny as curly hair can be) and it does make my hair feel light and soft BUT since using this now 4x I can say more hair is in the drain at the end, a lot more, and that it concerns me. My hair no longer smells nice, its completely frizzy and at the end of the day it has absolutely no bounce to it. By the next morning its an awful frizzy mess. I also have come to the conclusion that the bottle, and all other cleansing conditioning products, say the more you use the better, better for what? Their profits? Because when followed with their suggested guidelines I will need to replace the bottle I&#x27;ve used 4x in another 12 uses. My hair is almost down to my waist and when I use what they say its so thick with product, seems like a huge waste so they can get you to buy more faster. I&#x27;ve decided to go back to just a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. Maybe I have not given it enough time but with the amount of hair loss I&#x27;m not willing to give it another week.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for us curly girls. I have fine mostly 3b hair with patches of 3a.  For those that don&#x27;t don&#x27;t what that means google it. The number and letter describes how loose or tight your curls are.  Hair One leaves my hair very moisturized.  I use silicon products (my hair loves them) and I wash my hair with regular shampoo one day per week (to wash out the silicons) the same day I deep condition (to reintroduce moisure and or protein).  I use Hair One 2-3 other times during the week and it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have too much build up on my strands or scalp. This method works for me might not work for everyone.  I work out 6 days a week so I have to wash to keep the sweat from my scalp and hair. I&#x27;ve used As I Am Coconut Co-wash, they are similar except Hair One makes your scalp tingle. Some people like that because they feel the scalp is being stimulated for faster hair growth. Research is still not definitive on this. Laser hair stimulation is different than peppermint or other ingredient stimulation.</li>
    <li> This product will not make your hair.  It is ideal is you have very dry hair and can&#x27;t wash it too often.  With this conditioning cleanser, I can wash my hair every day and my hair still feels nourished.</li>
    <li> I ran out of Wen. Tried this and I am happy with the choice. Cleans without having to use conditioner.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my curly, dry hair.  Love that I can use one product instead of 4 or 5 that I used to have to use.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awful...makes your hair feel as dry as straw! I will stick to conditioning my hair with olive oil. Very disappointed...I read all these great reviews people posted. Always do before I purchase something. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff. Total disappointment. :(</li>
    <li> I have long curly colored hair.  I use this as a leave-in conditioner, especially on the ends to soften them.  It is not heavy or sticky, just smooth.  Has a nice clean smell.</li>
    <li> After basically shaving my head due to frustration with my unmanageable hair and the stress of high school, I decided to switch to a gentler, more organic shampoo. Going through Sally&#x27;s Beauty with my mom, we found the Hair One line. We bought the argan oil cleanser for curly hair (I have frizzy, medium-sized ringlets) as well as Hask&#x27;s Henna n Placenta deep conditioner, and finally Hask&#x27;s Placenta plus olive oil leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My now super-short hair still wasn&#x27;t healthy hair, so I started a regimen: washing my hair with the cleanser on Sunday and Wednesday, using the leave in conditioner after the wash as a styler, and deep conditioning once a month. After the first week (this included a deep conditioning) I FELT the difference. My hair was so soft and had so much more volume and thickness even though it was only an inch or two long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, I use only the Hair One Cleanser (not that the Hask products stopped working, I just stopped needing them). I still only wash on Sunday and Wednesday (not that I think you should do that; everyone&#x27;s hair oils are different). My hair, which is ALMOST to my shoulders, is still just as luscious, even more so, actually! I never realized how much the Hair One cleanser had done for my hair until I went on college tours. We were going to be staying in a hotel and I didn&#x27;t bother bringing any shampoo because, hey, hotels already give you shampoo! An hour after I got out of the shower, letting my hair air-dry while I sat on one of the hotel beds and tried to figure out what the TV channels were, I realized my mistake. My hair was frizzy, dry, kinked, limp. It was pathetic. I vowed then and there to NEVER go back to using peasant&#x27;s shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two washes with the Hair One cleanser, my hair was back to it&#x27;s new normal. Soft a full, with wonderfully defined curls! I could not praise this product enough.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to this product. I like it, but I have to use a huge amount of it each time I wash  my hair. At this rate, one bottle will only last a couple of weeks! I guess it is a break even, if I don&#x27;t have to buy other hair products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t feel like it was quite enough conditioner.</li>
    <li> With how many pumps I have to use for my hair, the bottle does not last long enough.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! It&#x27;s as good as WEN! I&#x27;ve used this product for years.</li>
    <li> We use Wen (mostly for my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s VERY curly hair) and I was looking for a more affordable alternative. This product seems to work similar to Wen, although not as well. I could deal with that, but the smell is just awful IMO. Although most Wen scents are slightly medicinal, this reminds me of a cheap cologne or something...and it&#x27;s strong! It&#x27;s all I could smell on my daughter and myself all day after we used it. I&#x27;d rather pay a little bit more since Wen works and smells better. I was hoping that this would work out for us though.</li>
    <li> I had really big, frizzy, curly wavy hair.  I decided to stop shampooing and switched to this, along with straight argan oil on the ends of my hair.  IT MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE.  My hair is silky and rarely gets frizzy, even two days after not washing it.  I also use this product after I get out of the shower as a leave in conditioner.  I hope amazon never stops selling this!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used on my hair.  I love this stuff.  I have tried everything trying to get my hair healthy, but nothing worked.  I have already bought more of this.  Every once and awhile I have to do a good conditioning treatment, but that is mainly because my hair was severly damaged prior to using this cleansing conditioner. This is worth every penny.  You do have to get the right Cleanser and Conditioner for whatever hair type you have in order for it to wirork.  I have natural curly hair, but it was severly damaged and dry.  I brought the right treatment, but it wasn&#x27;t until I used the hydrating mask that I started seeing a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This works well for my fine, wavy, color-treated hair-- makes it soft and takes away the frizz. And my hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key thing for me is to LEAVE IT IN FOR AT LEAST 3-4 minutes before rinsing.  It doesn&#x27;t do nearly as much if you just wash it out right away.</li>
    <li> I used this for 3 weeks and didnt notice any difference! I would have expected a little more for the money. I have curly hair and purchased the correct formula - used as directed - did nothing for my hair or my scalp - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
    <li> I bought hair one after seeing the commercials for Wen hair products. I am usually skeptical to try expensive new things, so I thought I&#x27;d give hair one a try first. It does take some adjustment to find the right amount for you. I have very long thick wavy/ curly hair. The first time I used it, I followed the directions precisely. I didn&#x27;t use my normal shampoo or mouse to style it. It was horrible. Frizzy in some places and flat and greasy in others. I kept using it thinking it was my management of it that caused the bad hair day. I started using it just like a regular conditioner. I used my normal shampoo, then used about a large grape size amount, maybe two of the hair one for conditioner. I use my normal mouse. I have found that my hair over the last several weeks is fuller (not frizzer), the curls are more defined, and it is not as dry as it was at all. This says a lot because I swim at the gym several times a week, and my hair was turning to straw. I have had several compliments on my hair from people I&#x27;ve known 10 years that they notice a difference. My husband is mixed ethnicity too, and his long course curls have been transformed too. He used to only wash his hair once weekly before hair one because it would get so dry. Now he can wash it daily or every other day with hair one. He uses about 15 pumps to coat all of his hair. Needless to say we are ordering several more bottles today.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. You can wash, condition,rinse and add to hair as a leave on condition to go. It leaves your hair with curls that you can comb. This is just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t define my curls as well. My hair felt greasy after using this product. I love the Tea Tree one though.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any difference between this, its far more expensive competitors, or a good shampoo and conditioner, as separate items.</li>
    <li> So expensive. And it takes so much......I think there is better stuff out there for the price.</li>
    <li> THIS SHAMPOO DID NOT WORK FOR MY HAIR .i WAS LOOKING FOR A SHAMPOO THAT WOULD GIVE ME MANAGEABLE HAIR AND DEFINE MY CURLS. IT MADE MY HAIR FLY AWAY AND FRIZZY,THIS SHAMPOO IS NOT FOR ME!I WASTED MY MONEY I HOPE YOU DON&#x27;T WASTE YOURS.</li>
    <li> I have tried a million differrent Sally&#x27;s products and no shampo or conditioner has stuck with me. I have loose curly frizzy and damaged hair and I use this as my shampo believe it or not.&lt;br /&gt; I have naturally really dry skin so my curly hair has no natural oils it in to keep it healthy. So every time I would wash my hair with regular sulfate shampo, my hair was left brittle and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;This on the other hand has literally saved my curls and I will never be switchinf back to regular shampoo again ! I love how the peppermint tingles every time I use it and I have noticed a big changes in my shine, frizz, and just hair damage.if you are reading this and have similar hair to me it is so worth it !&lt;br /&gt;I FINALLY have healthy curls !!</li>
    <li> hated the smell but it worked like any other conditioning cleanser...I will try the regular one and not for curly hair next time</li>
    <li> does not clean hair very well</li>
    <li> I purchased Wen a few months ago and was pleased with the &#x27;cleansing conditioner&#x27; effect. My hair is super long and naturally curly with occasional frizz but now it isnt frizzy and dry looking. Well I decided to give hair one argon oil cleansing conditioner and I must say, I am quite pleased with it. And now after finding out Sally&#x27;s carries it at a much cheaper price, I plan to purchase there from now on. All in all, I am pleased with the product and will continue to use. Thanks to all the positive reviews which enabled me to decide to try this lovely product!</li>
    <li> I like that my young son, who has mixed hair with medium tight curls, but likes to imitate me with my straight fine hair when washing and grooming can use this product every day without frizzing his hair. Even if he does not wash it all out well, its okay because it does not have anything that is drying or irritating to leave in. He can even use a dab of it with wet hands in the morning to pick out and shine his curls. We do our hair  together so I can make sure he learns a good routine. The product also smells nice and makes my hands soft too. I am a big fan.</li>
    <li> If I was rating this just as a shampoo substitute I would give it 4 stars, but since it claims to both cleanse and condition I am only giving it 3 (I would give it 3.5 but Amazon doesn&#x27;t have half stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is important to explain my hair type, since that makes a big difference in what people are looking for in a hair product. My hair is naturally curly and very fine, so it is prone to frizz. I have always liked a really heavy conditioner to sort of weigh down the curls a bit and keep them calm, which is NOT desirable for many hair types. If you like a light conditioner then this product might be just right for you. In my case, while I love it as a shampoo replacement, it is not the \\&quot;all in one miracle\\&quot; I was hoping for, and I must follow it up with a deep conditioner. So it loses one star for not living up to that \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second star (or half star) is deducted simply because I don&#x27;t care much for the fragrance, which again is a matter of preference. It reminds me of tea tree oil, and judging by the cool tingling of my scalp may contain something similar, so if you like the smell of tea tree you will like this. I personally don&#x27;t like it and think it clashes with my other daily fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note to first time users... give it a chance and learn to use it properly. My first few uses looked awful because I did not use enough product, didn&#x27;t massage it enough, and didn&#x27;t rinse it fully. These three things are key! You need a LOT more of this than you normally use of either shampoo or conditioner. You need to massage more to get good cleaning because it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals of shampoo. And you need to rinse thoroughly to get out all the soil that the massaging released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a cleanser this was much gentler than shampoo, and I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of hair I lose each day. This is the main selling point for me! I suffer from a genetic disorder that causes many health issues, one of which is massive hair loss. Since using this product my hair loss has been cut in half! I will definitely be buying this product again, simply in a different scent. My next bottle I am going to try the almond variety instead of the argan oil to see if it smells better.ny health issues, one of which is massive hair loss.

    <li> I know this is hyped to be like Wen but it&#x27;s nowhere near as moisturizing and detangling as Wen.  I know it&#x27;s cheaper but you get what you pay for.  This dried out my hair and made it feel rough and hard to comb through.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;m an AA male and I have short curly hair (up to an inch sometime )... ive seen those Wen commercials n the middle of the night and my mom gave me her Wen cause she wasnt impressed. So i tried it, and thought it was decent but i wasnt going to pay Wen prices. I went to my local Sallys and asked them (jokingly) if they had some Wen, and they pointed me to this Hair One... i looked it over and said &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;... and bought a bottle. I had used it for a few days but didnt really pay it any attention cause I&#x27;d use it in a hurry, rushing out the door going to work.  One evening I took a long shower, lathered my hair up with Hair One, and kept it in throughout my shower.... when i got out the shower and looked up in the mirror and literally said &amp;#34;Dayum... my hair looks f&#x27;ing GREAT&amp;#34;  it was so shiney and curly... i just kept playing with it..my hair is naturally curly but wirey and frizzy, and Hair 1 made it much softer and silky..my best friend has been complimenting me on my hair since.. of course i ran out of the stuff cause u need to use 20-30 pumps or some rediculous amount... and went back to using that wen moms gave me and im much more impressed with Hair One. ... its hard to spend $9-11 dollars for a single bottle of hair cleaner when u can get a good shampoo and conditioner for $7.00 but those dang Wen commercials got me thinking maybe this  non-lathering stuff is better.. im actually impressed with the Hair 1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a caucasian with very frizzy, thin hair, so I was very excited when I found Hair One Cleanser. The reviews are wonderful, so I was looking forward to using this product. It&#x27;s been two months since I&#x27;m using it, and I still don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair condition. I still have lots of frizz right after washing my hair, even though I normally let my hair air dry, as I know that using hair dryer is harmful for them. So far, I&#x27;m quite disappointed with Hair One Cleanser, but if it&#x27;ll work eventually, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> First, let me say I have nothing negative to say about the seller.  My issue is with the product. I have fine, colored, curly hair. This stuff turned my hair into a giant ball of frizz that i couldn&#x27;t get a comb through. Not good!</li>
    <li> I tried the sample size of Wen and really liked it but we got pregnant and couldn&#x27;t afford the $80/bottle.  This is an EXCELLENT option to use instead.  I&#x27;ve tried some others (like Ren at the grocery store) and this is much better.  I have pretty fine hair but I have a TON of it.  It&#x27;s naturally tangly, long, colored and I have really rough cutical (owing partly to my natural wave) and I really like how it works.  It was also a life saver when I developed tyroid issues (turns your hair to straw).  I didn&#x27;t have any issue with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: like other cleaning conditioners or &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34;, you do not want to use oil products with this.  It&#x27;s made to leave your natural oils intact so it doesn&#x27;t was out those like a shampoo would.</li>
