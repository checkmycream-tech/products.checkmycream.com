<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchase this cream regularly and am happy with its quality.  This time, however, the jar was damaged in shipping and half of the cream had oozed out.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of sending it back, so I unhappily have half a container of the cream.  I am a frequent Amazon shopper, and this is the first time I have ever had a shipping issue.</li>
    <li> I have horrible acne scarring and within a few weeks I noticed a big difference.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream on my doctor&#x27;s recommendation and I am very happy. I believe I am seeing visibly smoother skin although I have just been using it for a few weeks. I will reorder soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture-</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love! My skin has looked so amazing since I started using this. Lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past over moisturized some parts too much and others not enough and it felt like it stayed on the surface. This actually feels like my skin is absorbing it. Yes it burns a little at first so try not to exfoliate before putting this on. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This cream is so great.  It gently exfoliates your face and helps keep the black heads at bay.  My screen is so much softer and the fine lines less obvious.  You do need to add a moisturizer to your regimen as the glycolic cream does not add moisture.  It really just exfoliates and helps with keeping your skin tone even.</li>
    <li> Good, reliable skin care that seems to be working wonders--I am 65 and look like 40!  (Or so my husband says!)</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream for years. Even now I only need to use it 3 or four times a week and my skin is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This product works great on dry elbows.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I put it on in the morning before my makeup.  It gives me smooth flawless skin!!  Buy lots!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this cream</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face cream for years because my dermatologist recommended it.  At the time, I had adult acne which since menopause has subsided (thank goodness).  It has a mild way of removing dead skin cells so that I think it helps my skin seem much younger.  I was unable to find it at any local drugstore, though the doctor seemed to think it was available locally.  Amazon.com came through for me and this was a repeat order.</li>
    <li> I started using the product about 2 weeks ago and so far I am happy with the results.  Typically I only use it once a day but it has helped with the oiliness of my skin and my skin also looks and feels healthier.  The only downfall is that I could not find anywhere on the packaging what percentage of glycolic acid this has in it.  Most other products state somewhere but this one did not.  Overall though it still works good.  So I only gave it four stars because there is no percentage listed on the package.</li>
    <li> Great face cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Leaves face feeling soft and healthy</li>
    <li> This face cream is pretty great. It seems to have helped clear up my skin, but I can only use it every other night, as it dries my face out, leaving patches of flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product in the stores for some time. I used it years ago and was very happy with it. Just found it on line. Seller sent out this product as promised. I love this cream, makes my skin brighter.  Nice feel when applied. After in \\&quot;sinks in\\&quot; has a non-greasy feel.  I am happy with both the product and seller.  CJR</li>
    <li> I heard a couple of people tell me about this product as a recommendation from their dermotologist, but didn&#x27;t think I had a need for it.  Then my mother mentioned how hard it was for her to find and how much she was having to spend, so I started searching for a better deal.  Amazon offers this product at half the price and on automatic shipping.  One month, I decided to try it and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I use it every night on my face and neck.  Happy that Amazon carries this!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I also battled adult acne for years and tried everything, including dermatologist prescribed creams, pills, etc.  When I finally discovered this face cream, I couldn&#x27;t believe the results.  I have been using it for 4 years now and a few months ago tried an Oprah recommended face cream only to have my face break out terribly.  So I went back to my Aqua Glycolic and in a few weeks, my face was all clear again.  I will never switch again and now I am also adding the face cleanser and toner to my daily routine!</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and love this product.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful as a hand cream, but as a face cream, I&#x27;m not impressed. It does moisturize nicely, but I haven&#x27;t seen evidence it&#x27;s doing anything else. I&#x27;ll be using this for my hands and switching back to Alpha-Hydrox from here on out.</li>
    <li> Greatest ever. I used to use MDForte but line has been discontinued (can buy scragglers for hundreds of $$$ on Amazon). Anyway, I have ... wrinkles, rosacea, pimples, dry and sensitive skin, and this product and the cleanser cleans it all up. Love it!  And reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. My dermatologist recommended daily use years ago. I am 72 years old and have very nice skin. I also use a perscription cream at night</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly  Have ordered before.  Great product</li>
    <li> Greatly reduced wrinkles and produced a smoother texture as well as improved moisture content.  Have used this product for years.</li>
    <li> Using this for years and it&#x27;s my go to cream Can definitely tell when I run out</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use Aqua Glycolic Face Cream as my daily moisturizer when I asked him about a prescription remedy to lighten some dark spots that had appeared on my cheek.  I have been using it twice daily since mid-October and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I am in my 60&#x27;s; my skin was becoming quite dry.  I am not sure that the spots are being lightened but my complexion seems brighter  and I have no more dry, flaky areas.  Just be sure to use sunscreen daily since this product does not contain one.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is amazing. It was prescribed first by skin doctor. I get many complements on my skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this product at night only, on 6-30-15. So far, I have not had any redness, itching or swelling. My hyper pigmentation seems to be fading some. But, a word of caution. Do not use this product, after exfoliating your face, with a facial scrub. It burns. I speak from experience. Also, I would prefer that I got more product for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered both the cleanser and the cream and quickly found that it was to strong a combination for twice a day so I adjusted and stopped using the cream in the evening</li>
    <li> The service was pretty good and the cream is gentle.  It&#x27;s frangrance free, which is not my prefrence for a facial cream but it works fine as a body cream for acne-prone areas.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist told me to use Aqua Glycolic Face cream daily under my moisterizer cream. It helps keep my skin looking younger by getting rid of the dead skin on my face. People tell me I look 50 and I am 68. I bought Aqua Glycolic for my 4 daughter to use.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this many years ago and it has kept my skin looking very good at the age of 66 I have very few lines in my face.[[ASIN:B000T7P0KO Aqua Glycolic Face Cream, 2-Ounces]]</li>
    <li> Made me really break out and stung like crazy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this moisturizer for many years and I just love it. I tend to break out easily but have never had a problem with this cream. And there&#x27;s no doubt the glycolic acid works to smooth skin damage from age and the sun. I&#x27;ve had many people comment over the years about how smooth and youthful my skin is. Now, at 50, I&#x27;m getting REALLY grateful for that!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff. It transformed my face along with Dr. Song benzoyl peroxide 2.5%.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product for him because he has rough spots on his skin. It has helped to smooth out his skin in a short time.</li>
    <li> The most effective face cream for my drying aging skin. I have to remind myself to wear spf moisturizer to protect nice fresh skin.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin with red undertones that makes any blemishes very visible because of my skin type. In college, a dermatologist recommended the wash, toner and cream for my occasional breakouts and to even tone and as a bonus it was affordable on my budget. Now a couple years later, I had switched to other products over time because I got lazy and my skin had been acting up again. Ordered the trio and in two weeks have seen dramatic differences--though I layer a regular moisturizer over the face cream as it can be slightly drying. If salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide only makes your skin way worse before better like my, try the alpha hydroxy acids. In a pinch, the wash doubles as a shave cream! I am a lifetime customer.</li>
    <li> I have using AQUA GLYOLIC for 20 years. I have  a lot less wrinkles than my friends. I&#x27;ve always been asked whats my secret. This is a must have face cream to use.  The best ever. Get it use it and keep looking young. A must have and keep using. Its a facial skin exfoliater.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.  I used to be a Make-up Artist and sold  popular cosmetics from famous companies, but  wouldn&#x27;t use any other  face cream but Aqua Glycolic!  I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> There are no ingredients listed on the jar, and it came without any packaging , so of course no way to see ingredients there either. There is definitely no glycolic acid in it when it was advertised as saying it had 20 % !! What a joke !! I have tried it and it does nothing. I have had other creams before with glycolic acid in them-- 15 % and the sloughing off of dead skin is great .. Needless to say, I am not happy..You should not be allowed on Amazon !! I should be given my money back.....</li>
    <li> Love the product, price is fair. Delivered on time</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any major results.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000T7P0KO Aqua Glycolic Face Cream, 2-Ounces]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened my jar, there was an air bubble that displaced at least half of the cream, so the jar was half-full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Merz Pharmaceuticals, their rep, \\&quot;Jessica Handshoe\\&quot; informed me that I could return the jar but did not offer to send me a new one or even refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironically, I like the cream as well as the facial cleanser, but not if Merz is going to cheat me out of half the product.</li>
    <li> I really like this facial cream.  I am now using the hand and body on my face as well.  The hand and body has a higher concentration of AHA&#x27;s.  I reccomend starting with the facial cream, then move to the hand and body lotion after your skin gets used to the concentration of AHA&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cream. It gently exfoliates and moisturizes without being greasy. I received my order from Amazon amazingly quickly and the price was below what I could buy it for retail. A good savings. Amazon Verified Purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am in my mid-fifties and I take excellent care of my skin.  This product is affordable and does a great job keeping my skin radiant.  Be sure and moisturize over it if you are older.  Acne prone skin will love this too because it clears off the dead skin cells!</li>
    <li> Love this face cream &amp; have used it for many years. It&#x27;s not at all greasy &amp; never gives a greasy feel, but gives enough moisture to make make-up go on easily after using it. Wouldn&#x27;t change!</li>
    <li> When I was receiving a facial several years ago, the esthetician suggested I try this line of products. (And she wasn&#x27;t trying to sell it to me because they didn&#x27;t stock this). I tended to have issues with Adult Acne - annoying large cysts along my jawline and they seemed to last forever.  Within a short time of using this line of products, they stopped appearing and I just won&#x27;t go back to using anything else. I have been using Aqua Glycolic for at least 3 years now and my skin looks and feels so much better! And the nice side effect is that I don&#x27;t tend to use as much concealer or base makeup because I don&#x27;t need to cover much up. For anyone with Adult Acne issues, I recommend trying these products. Hope you are as happy with the results!</li>
    <li> I had bad melasma and this skin care line has almost cleared it all up. It has been a life saver!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this face cream.  It was prescribed by my dermetologist, but you don&#x27;t need a prescription to buy it.</li>
    <li> I have a medical problem that causes sever dry skin.  My face had started being effected.  This was recommended to me and I love it.  Best facial cream I have every used.  I use it once a day and have no more dry skin on my face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great moisturized for your face, etc. I use it daily after my shower. I also use it on my chest as my chest is prone to sun burn and this helps keep the skin soft and smooth. I am just about ready to order my next shipment.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful glycolic face cream at a reasonable price. Especially for 40+ sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I have used dermatologist brands many times, and like this one just as much and it cost 1/4 the price! Has no smell really and last a long time. I buy it once a year and use it daily.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders! Skin looks so much more vibrant and youthful.</li>
    <li> This cream didn&#x27;t break me out, but it didn&#x27;t clear my acne either. It didn&#x27;t make my skin spectacularly smooth, but it didn&#x27;t rough it up either. It didn&#x27;t clear up any of my old spots, so I&#x27;m not blown away by this product, considering the price.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer I have ever been able to use that has not caused breakouts.  I put it on before going to bed, and it has improved the condition of my skin.  I am so glad a friend recommended it and I tried it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference at all :( seemed as though the only thing it did for me was dry myface out</li>
    <li> Been using the Aqua Glycolic cream for a couple months with the cleanser. It help with my acne but my face is not clear yet. I take vitamins for my hormonal acne and try to watch what I eat.</li>
    <li> This product does not work for me. I used this according to the directions in conjunction with Aqua Glycolic&#x27;s Face Wash and both have not worked for me. My face seems to be flaring up with the use of these products. I am looking for something better that will acutally work for my face.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a couple of months ago and have been very pleased with the results.  My skin is much smoother and the texture seems more even when I don&#x27;t have any makeup on.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I was hoping it would help alleviate some dark areas on my skin from pregnancy but I have not noticed a major change in that area.  Overall, a great price for a glycolic product.</li>
    <li> Use this morning and night as part of my cleansingregime and it has made a big difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a complement to the cleanser and toner of the same brand. I figured they would all work together.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and a fair complexion. The dermatologist recommended this to me as a means to help my skin maintain moisture.  I was impressed that this does not require a prescription and can be used safely. For me, this product has made all the difference in skin maintenance.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! No smell &amp; it&#x27;s thick but not too heavy!</li>
    <li> Have been using Aqua Glycolic Face Cream nightly for about 3-4 weeks. The most notable changes are \\&quot;less bumpy\\&quot; and softer skin. Since I did not expect miraculous changes, I am more than satisfied with the product to date.</li>
    <li> I am 39 years old, I have been getting facials for 20 years, used every product to mankind from AHAs, retinol, vit c, etc.  I begad glycolic acid peels in my late 20s, being a nurse, I am very well informed about different great products. I began botoxing my forehead in my late 20s and have done doctor chemical peels for 10 years...  I got tired of spending soooo much money of glycolic creams that were a fortune with far less glycolic content than this cream.  I LOVE this cream!!! I bought 3 months ago and use daily.  Here is what I love...Glycolic acid to me is still the only formula that rejuvenates skin to look dewey and fresh and YOUNG...People say I look 30, and I think it is because I have been using glycolic acid on my face like a religion, nothing peels and resurfces skin better with removing dead cells than glycolic.  I am not a doctor, but just my EXPERIENCE...REtinol is great for age spots but so is glycolic and retinol is terrible if you even have the littlest bit of sun on your face you look like a tomato.  This product, within days made the surface of my skin look great and QUARTER OF THE COST! After years of facials, I began doing all this stuff at home when I just copied what they were doing at the doctors office and at the spa.  Glycolic acid 10% is sooo hard to find in a product.  I did use a daily 15% but it is much more money and I dont see much of a difference.  If you HAVE NEVER USED glycolic acid on your face, I would recomend using it sparingly until you get used to the tingling, my skin doesnt even budge because I give myself a 3 minute glycolic acid peel weekly at 70% straight glycolic acid (DONT RECOOMEND AT HOME UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND HAVE WORKED UP TO THAT STRENGTH)  But for daily needs for great RESURFACING this is the BEST BANG for your BUCK! Many other creams at stores cost $50 and up for less content.  Truly you are paying for brand and the box.  I have tried Murad, La Prarie, blah blah, every brand..you wont be disappointed if you love glycolic products.  However, you will still need a SPF with this cream, so I get my SPF with my fondation I wear.  I am glad no SPF with this cream bc I think it would lower the aacid content.  Enjoy and buy it, I dont think anyone will be disappointed!pointed if you love glycolic products.  However, you will still need a SPF with this cream, so I get my SPF with my fondation I wear.  I am glad no SPF with this cream bc I think it would lower the aacid content.  Enjoy and buy it, I dont think anyone will be disappointed!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this stuff for me and it works as well as I expected.  It doesn&#x27;t tingle or burn (smells ok, not great) bit my skin started feeling smoother within the first week.  Superfine creases are gone, helps with the bigger ones.</li>
    <li> This is a good face cream with a small amount of alphaglycolic acid in it which is a mild form of a chemiclas that used as a \\&quot;face peel\\&quot;. The amount in the cream is small. It is ok as a lubricating face cream. Overpriced.</li>
    <li> I use this product alternating every other day with Retin-A for clear smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I have a minor skin condition where skin cells clump together making my skin somewhat bumpy.  My aesthetician recommended that I use a glycolic cream to help between treatments.  This one has worked quite well and doesn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend it years ago and I am still using it.</li>
    <li> I have used Aqua Glycolic Face Cream for about 20 years and find it very satisfortary for my mature skin. Amazon&#x27;s customer service was easy, quick, and satisfatory.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  It helps clear up some of my adult acne, as well as keeping my face smooth and soft.  It came on its expected delivery date without any product issues.</li>
    <li> I just ordered this Thursday night and got it Saturday early afternoon. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this package until at least the 26th! Have tried the cleanser, too early to tell but so far so good. No irritation and my face feels great!</li>
    <li> I am diligent in my facial regime, but can hardly justify spending more the 50$ for cream (tho I have) so if you want to even stretch the use of a higher end cream alternate this every other or every third night .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the AG facial cleanser so I got the cream to go along with it.  Big mistake.  I have combination skin and it&#x27;s not overly oily unless I&#x27;ve been sweating profusely in the summer nor do I have acne; I just get the occasional clogged pore and pimple.  I only applied this at night in very small amounts but this cream never sunk into my skin, always remained feeling heavy and greasy, and broke me out.  Some people love it though so YMMV depending on your skin type.  On the plus side, I used up the rest of the cream on my arms/legs and rather enjoyed it - the glycolic acid helped slightly with my KP and now I just might try their actual body lotion - so if you find it doesn&#x27;t work for your face either, at least you don&#x27;t have to throw it away/waste it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist for close to 10 years.  People cannot believe that I am 67 years old.  I use it twice a day....it is very easy, quick and comfortable to apply, and there is no greasy residue when using it.  I apply it under my make-up. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This product is very good and the ordering was quick and easy.  I would recommend it to everyone and will be ordering it again.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than six months and haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my complexion. When I received the cream, I noticed the sticker was crooked. Because I ordered from the actual company, I didn&#x27;t think much of it. I ordered the alpha glycolic toner, cleanser, and cream set for my mother and noticed a difference in the smell of the cream. I obviously can&#x27;t say for certain it&#x27;s not the same product, and I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s just poor packaging, but can&#x27;t account for the above difference. I may try ordering from another site and seeing if there is any discrepancy in product, as it was both recommended and has favorable reviews on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream. It works great. I use it twice a day. Does not feel greasy. Absorbs into skin. My face looks smooth and healthy. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DOCTOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AM VERY PLEASED WITH IT.</li>
    <li> I like this cream better than I thought I would&amp;#62; I had 5 frown lines between my eyebrows and 2 across my forehead. I just a matter of a few weeks I am down to 2 frown lines between my eyebrows and 1 across my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this with a collagen and elastin cream because I am over 50 and I need it. But the wrinkles I know are less from this because I have been using these type of products for over 20 years. For the last few years I have using 20 to 25% and it was not working as well as this does. i believe the combination of acids this product has in it, makes it  perfect and I will now be  loyal user, from now on. I am 53.5 years old that was starting to look it and I can see myself starting to look 40 again, yeah. :)</li>
    <li> I can no longer purchase at my favorite drug store so I was really glad when it came fast.  I&#x27;ve been using these products for many years and is the only thing that seems to control my adult acne and dark spots.</li>
    <li> Excellent for making my face smooth!  It exfoliates your skin naturally.  It may burn a little until your skin gets used to it.</li>
    <li> This is a very moderately priced cream that was highly recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in combination with a Retin A cream right now but have used it as a night cream also.</li>
    <li> It is creamy and feels good on my face.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles.  The brown patches on my cheeks are less visible.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream every night for several years.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I never write any reviews. I like to read but I dont like to write. I coudlnt help myself but I had to write review here... this cream is FANTASTIC !!! I tried everything !!!! alpha hydrox, lancome, biotherm, etc... and nothing worked !! I bought this cream because of reviews and I cant believe it. Skin is smoother, brighter and NO PIMPLES or ZITS !!!!!!!!! MIRACLE !!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the Aqua Glycolic products before.  I am still very pleased with the results that the face cream gives.  My skin does look brighter even after just using it for a week and a half.  Does not burn my skin at all and many things do but not this one.  Good price for the amount of cream you get.</li>
    <li> My mother who is 87 and looks like 67 uses it and loves it!  I use her beauty secret and look younger also!</li>
    <li> Love, love this Aqua Glycolic Face Cream.  It was recomended by my dermotologist and I have used it everyday for over a year and it does make my skin soft and glowing.  Even  my doctor noticed the change.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Hoping this will help me not look my age!  So far I really like the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Use this all the time.  Has been part of my skin regimen for many years now.  My dermatologist recommended it, and I am most happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My dermatogolist recommended this.  It has been out for years.  Less expensive than all the wrinkle creams out there.  They also have body lotion that is higher glycolic acid content (14%).  Dr recommended trying the lower dose first to make sure you dont get &amp;#34;red skin&amp;#34;.  I am now going to the body lotion for my face with the higher acid content.</li>
    <li> This is the only face cream I can use without getting break-outs. This is a very high quality exfoliating cream, keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> I found that this product also broke me out as I see it did for other users as well. It felt greasy on my face and over the next few days I had lots of small pimples around my chin area. I now use it for my hands at night to make use of the stuff and it is fine for that but too pricey for hand cream for me. It does sting on any broken skin as I found over paper cut in my palm</li>
    <li> I ordered this face cream and the body lotion at the same time and I love them both! My skin is more clear and smooth looking than it has ever been before. It does cause a bit of itching but it&#x27;s minor and well worth the results in my opinion. I use it with my retin-A cream and it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin!</li>
    <li> Item arrived damaged n not usable.  Product is excellent.  Have been using if for years and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This cream is easy to apply and seems to freshen my complexion. I also use a battery operated facial rotating cleansing brush and an olive oil face cream all together I lookk pretty good. Can&#x27;t really determine which does what nor why.</li>
    <li> I called my dermatologist to hear his advise on the best daily face cream for me. I am in my sixties and have tried the range of face products costing a range of prices. The expensive product that I had been using for four years became even more expensive, so I sought an alternative. After using Aqua Glycolic for two weeks, I could see and feel a positive difference from the creams I previously had used. This product is light, non greasy, and costs less than half of the cost of other products. It spreads over a wider area than other products and I do not feel that I have to use it sparingly because of costs. Highly recommended by this veteran face cream user.</li>
    <li> Really nice. It&#x27;s a good progression from the 6% glycolic i started with. use it on my hands and forearms and neck and chest. Very effective.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aqua Glycolic face cream for years and it&#x27;s kept my face smooth and soft.  Wish it was a little less expensive.</li>
    <li> I have mildly sensitive skin with some sun damage. My dermatologist (who is also a friend) recommended this for daily use as an exfoliator. It is easy to apply and since I use about a quarter size amount a day, it easily lasts six months until my next Subscribe and Save order arrives. Avoid use close to the eyes and start by applying every other day to prevent over-&lt;br /&gt;dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this cream, especially in the winter on my sensitive combination skin.  It is the only cream that does not break my skin out and keeps it clear.  I do find that it is a little to thick for me in the warmer months and makes my face too oily, so I stop using it in the summer.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for twenty years and love it.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so hydrated after using this.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product and I do believe it works; however, the package I got smells like it is stale and old.</li>
    <li> have used for years and find it a great product even for sensitive skin. one of the highest concentrations of glycolic in over the counter products.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me. I am a 54 year old with sun spots on my face. I love the way it makes my face feel. I use it with the facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Have been using this cream on my face for 20 years.  Everyone tells me I look young for my age.  Don&#x27;t know if it is the cream or good genes, but I don&#x27;t plan to stop using this anytime soon.  The jar lasts a long time and I love being able to order it online through Amazon.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist and did the trick.... Kept my skin moist and reduced the redness. I use it twice daily.</li>
    <li> I love..love this product! I bought this product along with the glycolic facial cleanser and I can feel the difference the first time i put this on my face! It is so moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy. I have tried many moisturizers and i keep on changing products because i couldn&#x27;t find one that I like. It&#x27;s either the product is too greasy or not moisturizing enough. Plus it&#x27;s got 10% AHA so it&#x27;s a double plus! I just wish they have a higher percentage of AHA.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using for years. Repairs damaged skin. Evens out skin tone. Love it!</li>
    <li> Have not been using this long enough to rate it.  Used it many years ago and loved it.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this cream.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite some time. It burns your face a bit, but that tells me that the amount of glycolic acid is likely quite high.</li>
    <li> Been using for 2 months now, haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in skin but affordable moisturizer that was recommended.  Not sure if I will buy again.....</li>
    <li> This is a great basic glycolic acid cream.  Because I use acne medications and have sensitive skin I appreciate the basic ingredients.  It will make a noticable difference in skin tone and texture.  I use it every other night and some of my sun spots and acne marks have already faded.  It can cause deep imbedded acne to come to the surface however so you may have an initial break out but afterward skin is smooth and pores appear smaller.  I even use this under my eyes and have noticed the fine lines becoming less pronounced.  I have oily, aging, acne prone, sensitive, skin and this does not bother my skin at all.  I am used to using a 6% glycolic acid toner however so you may need to start slowly if you have not used a strong exfoliator before.  If you need more moisture than this cream provides you can also layer a hydrating moisturizer over it as I&#x27;ve had no problems doing that as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for several years now and I like how it keeps my skin moist overnight.  I was introduced to it by my boss, and I really like it.</li>
    <li> This seems to make me break out ...maybe I have to use it longer but I tire of the zits so I quit using it for now.</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think this cream did anything at all, but I read a review saying just give it a couple of weeks...and wow, it&#x27;s true! Now I have it delivered ever 2 months with Subscribe &amp; Save. Whenever my skin seems a little dull or I feel like I&#x27;m looking tired or old, I use this for a couple of nights, and the difference by day 3 is really noticeable. Glowy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I get really dry, ITCHY elbows, and this cream works like a charm (no other product helps for more than an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: Don&#x27;t use it under your eyes -- in the morning they&#x27;ll be super puffy, with deep creases between the swollen parts (at least, that what happens to me).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for more than ten years. My dermatologist originally told me about it, and I LOOOOVE it.  It is really worth the money.  I use Aqua Glycolic body lotion, too. I&#x27;ve tried other, less expensive lotions and creams, but this really does work.</li>
    <li> This is the best kept secret.  Instead of making outrageous claims like so many products often do....this perfectly balanced, well formulated and reasonably priced aha just gets the job done.</li>
    <li> i purchased this face cream because i have dark spots and acne scars on my face. I have tried so many other products that claim to fade dark spots and reduce appearance of wrinkles but nothing i have tried has worked, so when i saw this product and read about it on the internet and then read the reviews which stated that this product was so wonderful, even better than going out and paying for facial treatments, i was convinced i had finally found the answer. Unfortunately, this face cream was the worst product i have ever used on my face, it did not do one thing that it claimed to do, i have been using it faithfully twice a day for about 2 months and there has not been any change in my skin, no improvement, in fact, i believe that my skin is actually darker than it was before i started using this product. i bought this based on product claims, and reviews posted by other customers, i believe that they were false reviews posted simply to get people to order this product, It is worthless and i will make sure to tell people not to order it.</li>
    <li> i give this product a high rating like most glycolic acid products since it works very well for a wide variety of skin ailments and keeps your skin moist and healthy, has antibacterial properties, and heals inflamed lesions. Try it</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and dark spots and have tried many acne products. My dermatologist suggested Agua Glycolic. I have only been using this for a couple months and this has really cleared up my acne and maybe helping the dark spots. I can tell it gently peels off a little layer of skin at a time . Not enough to really notice until I wash my face and then I see the dead skin rolling off. Gross, but exactly what needs to happen.  I live this product .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years with the other Aqua Glycolic products to keep my skin cancer at bay.  Non-greasy, makes your skin feel soft and supple, soaks into your skin immediately. You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on. Easy to put makeup or sunscreen on since it absorbs so quickly.  You MUST use sunscreen (which you should anyway) if you are going to use this product as it makes you skin hyper-sensitive to the sun.</li>
    <li> LOVE Aqua Glycolic!  I have used many, many, MANY facial products.  This one is my absolute favorite.  I use it every night before bed.  It keeps my skin smooth and soft and clear.  Can&#x27;t be without this one!</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have sensitive skin and have had problems with most moisturizers but not this one. This leaves your skin feeling smooth an fresh!  Not oily and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I won&#x27;t even try anything else!  Recommended buy!  I even have my friends using it!</li>
    <li> Who knows if it works and improves my skin. ?? I have spent a lot of money over the years on skin care products and this one works as well as any of the others I have tried.</li>
    <li> I use this product for my daily wrinkle cream. My dermatologist recommended it several years ago. I have noticed a remarkable difference in less appearance of fine lines on my face. I also have no allergic reactions to this cream because it is very gentle. Great product for much less than the cost of other wrinkle creams...and it actually works!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended to keep blemishes at bay and hydrate the skin. Use the face cream following the use of Aqua Glycolic Facial Cleanser.</li>
    <li> My wife is on a ardent quest to discover a moisturizing cream for her face, one that doesn&#x27;t generating more acne. Sorry to say, Aqua Glycolic Face Cream isn&#x27;t the one... the search continues. She applied it for a few days, and her face increasingly raged with red spots from infected pores and an increase in white puss pockets. Once she ceased, her face regained composure. The Glytone Exfoliating Body Wash, 6.7-Ounce works well independently, but adding ANY cream is a bad choice. We went back to refill prescription Differin Cream, 0.1% (adapalene) which is specifically created for people who need a formulation that&#x27;s easier on their skin. It is a topical prescription products derived from vitamin A. Tretinoin (Avita, Retin-A, Renova) is more powerful, but Differin is milder and works for her when nothing else seems to triumph over her acne!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, ever since my dermatologist recommended it. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, now that I am 77 and have had pretty amazing results, including good genes.</li>
    <li> I put this on as my night time face cream. I am very impressed! My eye wrinkles are less and my skin looks more smooth.  No breakouts and looking younger. The reviews really helped with my decision and I am grateful I bought it.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I realized I&#x27;ve been using these Aqua Glycolic products (body lotion, face cream) for probably 15 years or more and never reviewed them.  I have mild ichthyosis (dry thickening of the skin that makes it not turn to dust and shed correctly, left unattended can crack).  My dermatologist a long time ago carried other products by this manufacturer.  I found these and have been using ever since.  I need the alpha hydroxy to help the skin break up like it&#x27;s supposed to, but everything else I&#x27;ve tried including prescription lac hydrin leaves me feeling wet and clammy.  These don&#x27;t.  As with any of these lotions containing an acid, it can sting for a few seconds (especially the face cream as my face gets a little raw sometimes from scrubbing), and you need to be more diligent in using sunscreen as you will burn quicker.  And my dermatologist said it helps with wrinkles over the long run, a nice side effect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 3 - 4 weeks and have noticed firming to my skin. I originally got it because I have a few brown sun spots I&#x27;d like to fade, but so far not much difference. Tingling feeling means it&#x27;s working!! I will continue to use it and see if the sun spots get better.</li>
    <li> This cream is &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; anti-wrinkle  product available without a prescription. Several years ago a plastic surgeon who practiced at the hospital where I worked  brought various samples for the nurses to try. We all preferred Aqua Glycolic. I have been using it for years &amp; a friend calls it our &amp;#34;miracle cream!&amp;#34;  It makes a great gift for friends too.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Better than the more expensive brand I used for years</li>
    <li> Also a real winner.  Smooths and clarifies skin and improves color and tone.  I can also mix it with other creams to achieve just the right effect for any day.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily on my neck to reduce the visual affects of wrinkles. Makes for a softer and smoother look.</li>
    <li> been using for years, helps prevent wrinkles and lines  can feel it working</li>
    <li> Really helps dry skin problems, especially on the face. Priced very well. Work better than many more expensive creams I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, and this stuff is pretty good. Her skin feels firmer after using it. I don&#x27;t like the chemical smell that it exudes though, and feel I&#x27;d probably look something more natural. At least me personally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent value.  Good for young or old skin:  clears and brightens.  Better to spend the money on this product that actually works.  Recommend starting with one application per day at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Works great... I could tell a difference in my skin in just 2 weeks. Great product for scaring and age spots .</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s ok, but not as strong as another doctor sold in their office. Probably good for sensitive skin as it is not too harsh. Nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a long time...helps reduce the appearance of small bumps (milia) on my face.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommends this product for nightly use so I comply. Can&#x27;t say I know it&#x27;s working but I figure I should cover all my bases;)</li>
    <li> Great item at a sensational price !!</li>
    <li> updated review: Due to the formula change that accompanied the rebranding, I no longer recommend this product.  The previous formula delivered results; I was a faithful user for over 10years.  While I would have preferred the manufacturer retain the original formula, the new version is cheaper to produce, so I recognize their priorities.  Fortunately, there are many options for face creams containing glycolic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;original review: At this time, I&#x27;ve been using Aqua Glycolic nightly for 6 weeks at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  Within a few weeks I noticed more even skin tone, and slight improvement on forehead wrinkles.  This product immediately creates soft supple skin at an affordable price.  In my experience, Aqua Glycolic works far better than any of the high end face lotions I have tried over the last ten years.  A word of caution: do not get this product close to your eyes as it will cause a slight burning and watering of the eyes.</li>
    <li> I did lilke this, but found that on acne.org I can get a glycolic face cream for less, and it comes in a tube, which is easier for me to apply with.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a game changer. I have been using a glycolic face wash for a few years with great results so finding a facial cream was the next logical step. I found Aqua Glycolic here on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It is not meant for around the eyes and does tingle a little when you first put it on but WOW my skin looks AMAZING the next morning when I wake up I cant believe it!! My skin is clear and some old acne spots are fading the fine lines around my eyes GONE!. My skin has never looked this good. I added this to subscribe and save to make it even cheaper. I will use this as long as they keep making it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aqua Glycolic for about 20 years, and have been very pleased with the effects on my skin. The price on this site is less expensive thn I&#x27;ve found anywhere, but I have noticed that every tub I&#x27;ve ordered from here is not &#x27;full to the top&#x27; - probably at least a Tablespoon short of what I was accustomed to seeing in the tubs purchased at retail stores and at Costco. Still, this site is very convenient and the product is always available.</li>
    <li> I used this while I was on accutane and it helped get rid of scarring. Not a miracle but and overall good product!</li>
    <li> Ok, granted I&#x27;ve. Only been using this for 4 days but my experience with other products containing glycolic anything, always gave my skin some sort of tingle or feeling. Nothing with this product. Actually, mine smells like mayonnaise when I apply it. I hope I didn&#x27;t pay for one thing, but got an expired product or the switch-a-roo.  Usually products come with a protective seal. Nothing protective came on this container. Oh well, guess Amazon isn&#x27;t. Good for everything. Should have drove to the nearest CVS Pharmacy.  Lesson learner.</li>
    <li> I had declared 42 the age of the wrinkle, and then my dermatologist told me about this product - she was using it herself.  11 years later, my skin is so much healthier, clearer, and practically wrinkle-free.  I absolutely recommend Aqua Glycolic Face Cream to anyone interested in turning back the clock and improving your skin health.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist - great for my skin, which is combination normal / dry, large pores and I still have &amp;#34;teenage skin&amp;#34; prone to pimples and whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Purchased because of facial dryness resulting in a reddish forehead.  This stuff works great in keeping face moisturized, thus clearing up the skin of any redness.</li>
    <li> Using this for years. Love the non-greasiness. Recommended by a dermatologist colleague. No muss, no fuss. Who has time for 10 step skin care?</li>
    <li> The key to finding a good skin product is matching the product to your own skin type.  What is great for one person is not great for another, so I will start by telling you about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 40, female, and I have struggled with cystic acne since I was a teenager.  I usually have 3 or 4 large cystic lesions that come with my menstrual cycle and they are not quite healed by the time the next month comes and I get another breakout.  My skin tends to be mildly oily except during breakouts...then it is very oily.  I have used so many acne products and most of the time, they are ineffective or they make me break out worse.  Since I am getting older, I also have deep lines around my mouth and between my eyes and some smaller wrinkles here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is awesome for my skin.  The very cool thing is that it moisturizes and soothes but it also removes dead skin cells at the same time.  When I first applied it, it just felt very mild.  Then I put it on one of my open sores...ouch.  It stung a lot.  That told me that this was definitely more than just a gentle cream.  I had a few new lesions around my nose when I started aqua glycolic and I almost stopped using it but I decided to give it another chance.  My skin has NEVER been this clear in my life!  Honestly.  I do think that aqua glycolic has played a big role, but I don&#x27;t think it is working alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my regimen 2 times  day:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash with purpose bar soap and use a washcloth for at least a minute&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry and use 2.5% benzoyl peroxide from acne.org. (I have used many kinds of BP and this stuff is great)&lt;br /&gt;3. When BP is completely dry, apply aqua glycolic on entire face&lt;br /&gt;**One key to all of this is to make sure to exfoliate very well so that these medications can get down into the pores.  the aqua glycolic seems to help remove that dead layer and expose the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  My skin has never looked so good. My acne is almost completelygone after years of trying other products that failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have cystic acne...please try this!</li>
    <li> Love this works just as well as the super pricey creams! Great buy for the price excellent anti aging secret.</li>
    <li> Awesome face cream. I&#x27;d recommend to a friend. Thank so much. :)</li>
    <li> Having used this cream for a number of years, I still like it over others face creams.  It provides moisture without a feeling of greeziness.</li>
    <li> Not that great. No visible improvements to face. More of a moisturizer. Don&#x27;t use after you shave.</li>
    <li> Good stuff!  This is a repeat purchase :)</li>
    <li> I have seen an improvement over the last couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel more softer..</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for years. It relieves dry skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. It costs more in the drugstores.</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic face cream is the only product I have used consistently for the last 20 years.  I receive compliments about my skin when wearing only a tinted lotion as my makeup.  At 74 years old I notice I have less wrinkles than most of my friends of that age.  Since I can never find it on a shelf, I have to order it on the Internet.</li>
    <li> I use it twice daily, am &amp; pm. It leaves my skin very soft &amp; satiny. Non greasy also. Wonderful</li>
    <li> Fades dark spots, smooths skin, and feels great! I use it at night for now, but may start using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Aqua Glycolic is still number 1 for &amp;#34;naked-eye&amp;#34;  visible &amp; affordable results. This product has proven more effective for me over medically prescribed, otc &amp;  cosmeceutical product treatments I&#x27;ve tried throughout my 50+ years. I love that I don&#x27;t need a special high-powered magnifying lens to see my facial results of smoother skin, less noticeable lines &amp; wrinkles, increased firmness, fading of scars and overall even skin pigmentation improvement. My melasma/sun-damaged skin along my entire upper jaw line has softened so much, a light coat of foundation actually cover it without break-thru in 1 hour. Use sunscreen when using this product. Use sunscreen all the time &amp; everyday of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customized use has been key to my successful results with this product. For me, using it as part of my night-time treatment skin care regime allows this product to work as it should without redness,  burning, or a reaction to my sensitive skin. There are nights (in all seasons) I switch back &amp; forth with a moisture only night-time cream. Adjust (customize) your use depending what you need or don&#x27;t that particular night. Dependable, gentle, effective, affordable &amp; I never noticed a fragrance. A value based,  results driven, buy; all for pre sales tax of $20 U.S. dollars or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my honest opinion,  there isn&#x27;t a beauty product, skin care regime, or cosmeceutical that will turn back a lifetime of living with my face &amp; skin to when I was 25. Aqua Glycolic does the best job in slowing it down so much I&#x27;m given time to recognize &amp; accept my older (but oh so much &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; self).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I didn&#x27;t get paid in any form by anyone for this review.  I just really love this product, the results &amp; affordability.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a few years after reading about this product specifically in In-Style Magazine.  In a week, three nights Retin A, three nights Aqua Glycolic (switching each night to the other) and then at least one night a week working in a great, creamy moisturizer. This routine has worked wonders for my skin and the Aqua Glycolic product has been a vital step.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aqua Glycolic face cream for a few years and I love it. Great for all over face.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product daily.  Really helps, she looks at least 10 years younger than her age.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and helps to exfoliate in order to smooth the skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is elimination of age spots on the top of your hands....put some on when you do your face and a few weeks later, the spots are gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very effective product.  And I love the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I use this almost everyday, but do occasionally use cetaphil moisturizer, which I also love.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly, and my friend who asked for the order loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> I started using this about 4 weeks ago and now i love this cream!! I have very dry sensitive skin, eczema, and acne prone skin. Since starting this cream 4 weeks ago, (along with Benzoyl peroxide 5%), i have not gotten one single new pimple!! I am super happy. I never had acne as a teen, i started breaking out a few years ago at age 22 and finally figured out how to keep the breakouts under control. My skin looks clearer, smoother and more even-toned every day. I use this twice a day, following my facial cleansing routine. I mainly apply it to my cheeks, nose, chin and forehead where i usually would get pimples. I avoid using it above my mouth, around my eyes and eyebrows,  and underneath the bottom corners of my lips down to the sides of my chin, where my skin usually gets very dry. Instead i use a thick eucerin cream in those areas. This does sting slightly and tingle for a bit but I can tell my skin is adjusting to it. (I think since my skin is super sensitive). After applying in the morning, i alow it to absorb and then apply another moisturizer with spf. overall, great skin cream.</li>
    <li> Outstanding. This keeps my skin clear for a fraction of the price of the products I had been using. Products marketed for clearing your skin never work for me - I&#x27;ve found that glycolic acid is the answer for my skin. I found this moisturizing, a little goes a long way, and I will repurchase again and again.</li>
    <li> I use this at night as a follow up to the facial cleanser. These two products together are a miracle!</li>
    <li> This cream clears my skin and it looks much brighter in the morning. I can see the difference in just one or two applications. It is a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years (my father, a dermatologist introduced me to it). I mix it with a small amount of retinae. It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This lotion clears my facial bumps - or call it adult acne - everyday. I&#x27;ve always had little bumps on my face that I try to keep in check. I thought it was normal. I didn&#x27;t realize It had to do with what I was using on my face until I used this cream at night and woke up (for the first time since my teen years and I&#x27;m 42) with a smooth face. Just like that! Overnight! One use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, since instructions on the cream recommends that you use a sunscreen, In the mornings, I use a different moisturizer (srivectin) that has sunscreen, which brings back the bumps by evening. And I can&#x27;t wait to use Aqua Glycolic at night, which clears the bumps again by morning. So I have this repair, reverse thing going on. I haven&#x27;t seen any Aqua Glycolic product that has sunscreen - has anyone else experienced something similar? What do you recommend I do?</li>
    <li> It is working well to exfoliate my dry skin and the wrinkes are showing less. So far so good I am sure the results will even be better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and there is nothing I like better, I have tried many products.</li>
    <li> I have used this product on my face for several years as a night cream to help slough off dead skin cells. It is not harsh and really seems to keep my facial skin in good condition.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face cream for over 30 years and would not use&lt;br /&gt;anything else on my face, none of my friends can believe I am over 60.</li>
    <li> I used  this product for about two weeks. The first week I noticed a very small change in my skin. It seemed a little brighter. By the second week I had itchy red bumps all over. I kept thinking they&#x27;d go away so i continued the product. By the 13th day it was obvious my skin was going down hill. They weren&#x27;t noticeable, but they were very uncomfortable. I would not use this product again.</li>
    <li> My skin has been very dry lately, and I tried many expensive ointments to eliminate the dryness. I was getting upset because nothing really seemed to be curing it. When my friend told me to try this one, I was sort of hesitant. I had tried so many similar items and all the results had been disappointing, why should this work?? Now I am so happy that I tried it, though. It literally changed the texture of my skin!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist got me started on this product, it works great for that smooth look and reduces wrinkles,, gives your face a nice glow</li>
    <li> I have been bothered with adult acne and have tried many acne products that dry up my skin and leave the acne. Someone suggested I try this cream instead so I figured I had nothing to lose. I have only been using this for a week and this has really cleared up my skin! I am amazed at the change and have already ordered more.</li>
    <li> I tried using to get rid of milia on my eye lids but t just dried out my skin and turned it red. Although this did not work for me, it seems like it would be a great exfoliant for other parts of the face.</li>
    <li> I really like this system of cleanser/toner/moisturizer, especially that it&#x27;s PH balanced and contains glycolic acid for exfoliation.  I think the moisturizer is a little heavy for my oily skin though, as I started getting clogged pores.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  It is good for \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; skin but you will definitely have to go up in strength once your skin adapts.  I stopped using mine after I read that the cream isn&#x27;t the best for people with oily skin (that&#x27;s me) and that it&#x27;s better for such people to use glycolic gel instead of cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have normal or dry skin, this is the stuff for you.  But if you&#x27;re oily, go with a gel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Aqua Glycolic for years because I like how my skin looks and feels.  Simple as that.  I look younger than my years.  It may or may not be because of Aqua Glycolic.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a good AHA moisturizer to replace my dwindling supply that I brought to the US from abroad.  I have been using the same blend for 7 years, sold from my dermatologist that is a stronger 12% AHA.  I considered other brands before ordering the Aqua Glycolic face cream, specially since I learned that this particular brand was only a 10% AHA blend.  I bought AHA soufle 12% and found that while it had a higher concentration of AHA it was slightly more harsher than what I was normally used to.  It probably had something to do with the formulation and as soon I was done with the pack I ordered the Aqua Glycolic Face Cream.  I am happy I switched.  It is milder, creamier and richer.  I use this in the  morning under sunblock and it is great even when I am under intense heat out on my runs.  It does not sting or hurt when I put it on and give my skin a nice moisture and glow.  This is a great product for those looking to start an AHA regimen.  It is mild enough for sensitive skin and strong enough to give results.</li>
    <li> dermatogist recommended this to me many years ago.  removes dark spots, minimizes wrinkles, and makes your face feel softer.  cant imagine not using it under my makeup as a regular regime. a must have!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin but like to exfoliate with glycolic acid.  This cream has a good amount of glycolic acid and is non-irritating and non-drying.  No annoying smell either.  I use it a few nights a week, and it makes my skin look clear and smooth.  I receive it from Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save program which is a great way to get a good price and free shipping. I use Subscribe &amp; Save for other items, too. The notification emails make it very user friendly with no surprises or unwanted shipments.  I highly recommend Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> The Glycolic acid is not very strong. My skin felt a little softer but no real change was noticeable. Its not my favourite glycolic and i wont repurchase</li>
    <li> I feel that this product makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t overdo it. Once a day. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this face cream! I have been using this for a few months, and my skin definitely feels hydrated after using it. Upon application, it might feel a bit heavy, but I have noticed that my skin feels more radiant and supple after using it. This face cream does not irritate my skin at all and I have very acne-prone skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a number of years and like it very much.</li>
    <li> This irritated my skin. I bought it for fading acne red marks and it only made them more red. It didn&#x27;t absorb well either</li>
    <li> I began using this facial cream at the recommendation of my dermatologist and have continued for over 7 years with great results. It lightly exfoliates and moisturizes at the same time. If you are prone to small skin tags and bumps it helps reduce and eliminate them over time plus reduces their occurrence as it exfoliates with every use.  I started ordering from Amazon years ago as subscribe and save so I always had a supply and to save money.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this product and swears by it. this was by far the best deal we could find on it.</li>
    <li> This is a very successful cream for my face: forehead and side burn area. I&#x27;m 83 and all of the discoloration has been successfully removed. By the way, the shipping address is to be in Visalia, not Paso Robles. thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Chet  &amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this, and I really like how well it moisturizes and smooths out my face each morning. I just wish it came in a container larger than 2 oz...</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for crows feet around my eyes.  There was no change after using this product.  It did moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for more than ten years.  The ladies at work can&#x27;t believe how great my skin looks--wrinkle free at 60.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This stuff balled up all over my face and did not seem to affect the dryness of my skin at all. I returned it, which was a project in itself.</li>
    <li> Good for maintaining sensitive skin especially in dry climate</li>
    <li> I use this product at night on my face and it makes a big difference with wrinkles and fresher looking skin</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this.You are going to loose me giving you feedback when so much explanation is required.Iyt must take a lot of staff to read all of this.</li>
    <li> This is the only thing I&#x27;ve found to have any affect on razor bumps. It does reduce the bumps and ingrown hairs better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It also does have quite a sting, and actually draws blood from any nicks or cuts. I shave at night, and by the next morning everything has calmed down, but when first putting it on it stings and doesn&#x27;t look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it all over the rest of my face where it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn at all and it does reduce outbreaks noticeably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it smelled better, it has no added scent that I can discern, so it smells a little bit clinical/medical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a very good cream, and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This cream is worthless. I feel nothing after putting it on and it claims to have the &amp;#34;highest levels of glycolic acid available with out a prescription.&amp;#34; I was using the Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream and Love it but wanted something a little stronger that I could use during the day. I know you are not supposed to put acids on if you will be in the sun but I am indoors often with my baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this cream has done nothing for me wish I could return it. If you want a noticeable change in your skin try the Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream. It is wayyy stronger but not crazy strong where it burns you. And after putting it on I can see/ feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I am 65 years old and I like this cream.  I use it starting in fall to help my face after a long summer in the sun.  I think it makes my complexion better.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use the toner &amp; the face cleaner, &amp; love it.</li>
    <li> this is not as strong as I am use to...but it is half the cost and works great</li>
    <li> Love it! Have used it before,I worked in Dermatology for 12 years and my doctors recommended it.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer, though not cheap.</li>
    <li> This is the secret I use for my neck and back of hands.  It was originally the only skin care line for wrinkles that my dermatologist recommends. This cream makes your skin nice and soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Its awesome i use to help control razor bumps and helps a lot. thanks</li>
    <li> After seeing all the great reviews and recommendations I decided to finally buy this cream. I got it today in the mail. Well, I am not sure if I actually got the real thing, because it came without any packaging. Like, just the container itself was put in the amazon shipping box. Then, when I put this on my face, it smelled really gross and it went on thick and looks oily on my face. Is this how this product is? I&#x27;ve only used it for only day and I already dislike it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used this cream for 3 weeks before I had to stop. I&#x27;m still young, but I wanted to start using an anti-wrinkle cream now to prevent wrinkles in the future. I have acne prone skin and I read some reviews that said this cream also helped to get rid of acne. Well it did the opposite for me. My acne got so bad and I only used a small amount each night. I thought my skin was \\&quot;purging\\&quot;, so I kept using the cream thinking that my acne would subside and eventually get better, but like I said, it got so bad I just had to stop using it. Recovering from the outbreak that this cream caused also took forever too. I&#x27;m really disappointed and I really wanted to like this item, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Now I only use a small amount on my neck from time to time since I don&#x27;t get any acne on my neck.</li>
    <li> My skin didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> when used regularly, it makes skin smooth and clear, but results takes about 12&lt;br /&gt;weeks to show..great packaging and easy buy!</li>
    <li> *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an absolutely outstanding product.  In fact, I just now placed my fourth order, and I realized it deserves public kudos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s true that I have an unusual purpose for the product, which is to keep smooth and creamy yet taut and firm the nose leather of my now seven-year-old Flat-Coated Retriever, named PheyeG&#x27;hdeaux, who just happens to be the best dog in the whole world, as you can see from the photo I&#x27;ve added to the Amazon description page for this product.  (Notice the perfect nose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you too have a seven-year-old retriever of any model, not just a Flat-Coated, and if you want his or her nose leather to be in perfect condition come rain or snow or shine, then do buy some Aqua Glycolic.  I order a five-gallon pail at a time, but you can order less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****</li>
    <li> Not much I can use, really, since a lot of these face creams have at least one ingredient which makes Rosacea worse. Derm told me to stick to Rx which I&#x27;ve used for years, but it dries out my skin. I keep trying new stuff to moisturize and maybe rejuvenate. But this new stuff is not good for my skin, which always was delicate to begin with.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  Recommended from a friend who&#x27;s dermatologist had asked her to use it.  I think it works really well.</li>
    <li> My 25 year old daughter introduced a group of us, ages 25-55, to this product.  We all tried it each day while we were together.  All of us noticed how smooth it makes our skin feel.  We all went out and bought it, and none of us have been disappointed!  I love this product.  It makes my face feel so smooth, and I also notice less wrinkles!  People often mistake me for my daughters&#x27; sister!  My husband also likes how soft my skin feels!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I prefer Reviva Labs 5% Glycolic Acid Cream. I won&#x27;t buy this one again.</li>
    <li> So far so good put it on at night in the morning skin is so smooth</li>
    <li> I like this product. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it drying out my skin. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I was advised that this product reduces wrinkles and blends out freckles and spots.  It went on smoothly, however, although I used sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;I had several blotches appear on the side of my face as a result of using this cream.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for anything.  Two women told me&lt;br /&gt;they used it for years, however, they must have had laser sport removal because their skin tones were very white and blotchless.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe  the skin cream did it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my skin. This product was however recommended by my Dr.</li>
    <li> I live in Seattle Wa and my skin tends to dry a lot during the cold months. I have try a lot of EXPENSIVE products and they kind of work but not to my fully satisfaction. I order this recently and the first day I put it on, I immediately notice the difference in my skin! It&#x27;s back producing its natural oils!!! I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it to people out there who have a dry skin and want it to go back to look hydrated and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;For the results it provides I think is not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> Its hard to find but Amazon has it.  It helps my skin recover after close shaves.  Since I shave every day, I need it.</li>
    <li> I have always like Aqua Glycolic but have recently noticed it is packed full of parabens!  Because of this I will probably not order again unless they redo their ingredients.  :-(</li>
    <li> Been using it for years  I&#x27;ve got a few wrinkles, but not many&lt;br /&gt;compared to other women my 68 year-old age!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this product.  It is kind of &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;.  I like a lighter product on my face.  I&#x27;ll just use the Hand &amp; Body Lotion when this product is gone.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I used it years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  I like anything with the glycolic acid that helps keeps rejuvenating my skin.</li>
</ol>
