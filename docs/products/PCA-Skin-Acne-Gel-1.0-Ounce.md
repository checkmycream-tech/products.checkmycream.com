<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was very excited about PCA Skin Acne Gel as I really liked other PCA Skin products (acne cream and Clearskin). However, I found that it was too strong for me. Even with moisturizing, it was drying and caused red patches. I gave it a fair chance of five weeks, thinking I had to grow accustomed to it, but it didn&#x27;t work out. My face calmed down soon after I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Extremely effective whether you have adult acne or teenage acne, male or female. Doesn&#x27;t bleach your clothes or towels. This is my teenage son&#x27;s secret weapon, and he&#x27;s so thankful that I found it!</li>
    <li> the best acne treatment around. i&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now and it has done wonders controlling my outbreaks and expediting healing when a pimple does pop up. usually, when i use an acne product, it works in the beginning but then stops working. this one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a great product</li>
    <li> I use this gel whenever I get a pimple to start, works great in keeping it down and not coming to a head.</li>
    <li> I paid $40 for this product at my surgeon&#x27;s office, so I&#x27;m very happy with the price.  My daughter used it when she visited and within two days her skin was beautifully clear.  I have found it to be a very effective product and relatively gentle.  We are both very pleased - with the product and with the prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I can see how this product might be too strong for some skin types. However, if your skin is not super-sensitive (mine is not), it could be a godsend. I have yet to find a product that even begins to clear up the breakouts I get on my neck as well as this stuff does.</li>
    <li> I love this product - really helps for spot treatments of breakouts. To me, it is worth EVERY single penny!!</li>
    <li> PCA Skin Can Gel works well and does&#x27;t overly dry out your skin.  I have used this product for over 8 years ... originally bought it from a beauty salon until I realized I was being charged almost $20 more opposed to buying it online!!</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly!! Happy w/the purchase😊</li>
    <li> its a thin gel product I used it twice a day</li>
    <li> Work great for clearing up and preventing troubled areas. Only drawback is that it peels off if you apply too much.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I had good experience with other PCA products.  Did not work at all, does not dry the zit and the pimple continued to last for weeks before it went away.  I have use Neutrogena and Clean &amp; Clear spot treatment, and they work way quicker.  Based on my personal experience of 6 months, I do not recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> I love PCA skin but one thing I was nervous about was if these deeply discounted items were real as according to the PCA site- items sold on Amazon are :fake or grossly expired.:  NEITHER was the case for this acne gel from this seller- I have purchased PCA from my medispa before so I compared the box packing as well as the containers- and it was identical- fonts, densities, color, imprint, box quality etc sealed similarly etc- the product was also good until 10/15  and I will surely run out before end of 2014. I think this product is authentically PCA- I find it hard to believe someone would go to all this trouble and use the quality materials to so closely reproduce packaging for what I consider a pretty obscure brand (while while PCA is well known impostors would probably go for big box brands)- I find it to be authentic- the only problem is going to be breaking it to my aesthetician as she will no longer be making those huge profits off me! (***I purchased about 10 PCA products so you will see similar reviews from me on other products from various sellers as far as authenticity- so far NONE have turned out to be fake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never bought this particular PCA product before now- but I like it so far- I use this as a spot treat and overall step before moisturizer. It has a serum/slightly tacky feel- don&#x27;t use a lot I don&#x27;t think you need to. Those who have complained about PCA pumps- I have not had a problem and can do half pumps to just get a little product- just press lightly. Those who say it is harsh may have delicate skin- I had a chemical peel last week and while I only used a little my skin left and looked fine the next day using this- I could see maybe everyday use being too much- I think I will use it mainly to spot treat troubled areas- or cheeks, chin (my worst areas) around times where i get breakouts. Love PCA overall- my skin has totally changed since using their regimen.</li>
    <li> Talk about effective! This stuff is a god send. I tried everything from Clinique to proactive to drug store clean and clear, neautrogeba, BP, etc. finally went to an estetician who recommended this along with PCA clear skin. Holy smokes, my skin is so clear and happy now. Hands down - best product I spent money on.</li>
    <li> The best acne gel out there! I don&#x27;t have bad skin but sometimes I get a breakout. I use this and it takes care of it so fast. The best part it does not dry your skin out! Also you need such a small amount it last forever.</li>
    <li> Love product but buyer beware...I got 4 - 1/2 ounce samples not this standard PCA bottle</li>
    <li> Keeps my acne rosacea under control.</li>
    <li> I  use as a spot treatment on an occasional pimple.  Love!</li>
