      <li>The color is excellent, but</li>
      <li>I use the Estee Lauder Ivory Beige foundation and this product matches the color beautifully.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this blush. Cannot find in the stores.</li>
    <li> just what I expected and fast delivery, too</li>
    <li> This is a great cream blush.  I particularly like this color, Berry Flirtatious.  The pop out mirror is a big plus.  (This picture shows a brush which is NOT included?)  Anyway, the price for 2 of these was super.</li>
    <li> I use the Estee Lauder Ivory Beige foundation and this product matches the color beautifully. I am complimented on my skin at least once a month usually by strangers. This never happened until I began wearing this combination several years ago. I am 62 with light skin tone.  Everything else is too orange, dusky or purple.  It was great to find this product online and I am stocking up.</li>
    <li> My absolutely favorite cream blush.  When I could no longer find it in stores, I tried other brands, but most didn’t give enough color or faded during the day.  I believe this shade would suit most people.  A small amount gives just the right amount of color and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This particular color &amp; product has been discontinued by Revlon. I can only get it on Amazon. So glad&lt;br /&gt;you had it to sell to me!</li>
    <li> I love this blush and I have not been able to find it in any stores.  So glad I thought to search online to find it.&lt;br /&gt;came right away and is great Revlon quality.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this color after not being able to purchase it at Walgreens or CVS.  The color is good on my fair complexion, and it goes on smoothly.  I prefer cream blush over powder blush because my skin has a tendency to be dry.  Also, a cream blush lasts longer.  It never fades.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blush.  I was more than delighted with the very fast delivery of it to my front door.</li>
    <li> I like this product and have been using it for years and cannot get it locally so I had to order it. I am glad it is available through you.  Thank you.  Pat</li>
    <li> I love this blush.  The color is excellent, but more than that, I have found through trial and error that nobody beats Revlon for the perfect amount of creamy consistency in their product for the flawless application of cream blush.  It looks and feels terrific!</li>
    <li> Best blush out there! Applies like a light cream. Looks and feels completely natural--glowing and radiant. I&#x27;m so sad they stopped making this.</li>
    <li> This blush is wonderful - since it blends into your skin and does not leave a blush &amp;#34;on the top&amp;#34; of your skin it looks very natural.  It is small and fits easily in your purse or  briefcase.</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dry or oily so this product works beautifully for me. Powder blush falls off my face but thankfully this lasts for a few hours. I am very happy with it and hopefully Revlon won&#x27;t discontinue it until I am gone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years &amp; now they&#x27;re no longer making it. I&#x27;ve gone on-line &amp; bought up anyone who had a few left.  So disappointed with Revlon.</li>
    <li> For a product that was no longer made the price was ridiculously high, it&#x27;s not.like this stuff is antique art or jewelry</li>
    <li> Very becoming shade .  Goes on easily.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. 2nd order from them</li>
    <li> I was using Revlon cream blush for some years now and I really liked it but I could never find any in my area. I did find it once in Ashland Oregon, but I don&#x27;t live near Ashland so it would e difficult to travel there and get it. Thank goodness I found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I use it everyday, so easy to apply and is so natural.  Packaged nicely.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I could not find any in the stores anymore and went online.  Was pleased to order this and grateful to get it.  I have sensitive skin and this product has always proved to be the best to use for me.</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t understand why companies mess around with a winning product.  I loved this blush and now they have taken it off the market.  Several of my friends also used this product so we are very sad to see it go.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and has all day wear but can also be used for touch-up.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Hopefully, Revlon will bring out something to replace it.  This gives blush gives one a natural, radiant glow.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - too bad Revlon discontinued it.</li>
