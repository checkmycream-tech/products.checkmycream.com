      <li>I&#x27;m very easy going and don&#x27;t expect a wig that&#x27;s amazing</li>

      <li>if you&#x27;re a hairdresser and good with scissors, you could probably do some trimming and clean up the cut a bit.</li>
      <li>this wig was great for the price&lt;br /&gt;things to be aware of before you order it:&lt;br /&gt;this item ships from china-</li>

      <li>IT WAS STYLISH WHILE IT LASTED</li>
      <li>and I managed it just ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>and I love it for the most part.</li>
      <li>This wig is nice but tangles quickly</li>
      <li>I knew it was a cheap wig, but thought that the quality would be better than Halloween costume.&lt;br</li>
      <li>overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this wig!</li>
      <li>I got this wig quickly!</li>
      <li>you for the fantastic wig and quick shipping !</li>
      <li>Love this super fun wig !</li>
      <li>Cheaply put together.</li>
      <li>Given the cheap price I paid for this it came as a WOUNDER, my 14yr old niece loved it</li>
      <li>all i can say its , i m totally satisfied  with the quality, its  exactly how u see it in the picture:)&lt;br /&gt;soft</li>
      <li>when i opened the package i was immediately excited.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t expect it to look so bright red underneath.</li>
      <li>but otherwise, it feels real :)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad wig</li>
      <li>But other than that it looks great</li>
      <li>, the length is perfect, material is really soft (silicone) and other than the excess of shine</li>
      <li>It knots easily and falls out too much.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty, and unique.</li>
      <li>but the whole bottom layer is bright red, and under the bangs..</li>
      <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice quality wig.it doesn&#x27;t get itchy, it fits nice, but the only problem I had was all the red underneath.</li>
      <li>BUT AS YOU CAN EXPECT IT TANGLES PRETTY QUICKLY...</li>
      <li>I also purchased this through my amazon prime account which shipped super fast!</li>
      <li>Also, seen other wigs and this one is really good quality for the price (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty realistic and easy to put</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty wig..</li>
      <li>My first experience wearing wig</li>
      <li>There is more red than pictured, but that&#x27;s what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>People thought it was my real hair!  </li>
      <li>and the bangs are a bit uneven, but again, nothing but a little alteration cant fix to have a super awesome wig!</li>
      <li>, the peek-a-boo red is gorgeous, just would have liked the red to have been a wee bit less super BRIGHT almost neon pink red, BUT...</li>
      <li>I love the vibrant red color and the softness of the wig...</li>
      <li>and i will certainly be ordering again from this company.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a nice slightly deeper red, and not super bright red like most cosplay wigs.</li>
      <li>I like this wig it looks and feels real.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very disappointedm</li>
      <li>I really like the style of the wig</li>
      <li>and the smell makes u want to vomit,&lt;br /&gt;nicely rapped, and was fast shipped.</li>
      <li>Not to mention it is really materially inferior to anything else I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
      <li>The pictures really doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
      <li>it also came here really</li>
      <li>and the delivery  was  fast</li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t really have any complaints about this wig…</li>
      <li>I will be wearing it again very soon.</li>
      <li>this is my first tengs wig, sixth wig in my collection so far.</li>
      <li>Not exactly like the photo, more vivid bright red than anything and a couple of black streaks.</li>
      <li>that actually there&#x27;s more red.</li>
      <li>it is also decently thick.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it came somewhat as pictured (a lot more red than black) and was very natural-looking in colour, texture and cut (very nicki minaj-esque); thankfully not overly shiny</li>
      <li>Also, the red is much brighter in real life.</li>
      <li>the strands are very soft though, they dont feel plastic at all.</li>
      <li>fitting has not been an issue for me, although I do have a smaller head circumference due to being on the petite size.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Warning, this is not an everyday accessory nor washable since it drops strands of hair easily.</li>
      <li>but if you have black hair like me, most people will just assume you added red extensions and highlights.</li>
      <li>the bottom red layer is about six inches longer than the top black layer so depending on how you&#x27;re looking at it</li>
      <li>The red is very vibrant.</li>
      <li>Theres a little more red on the bangs than I&#x27;d care for</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;re really getting cherry red.</li>

<ol>
    <li> all i can say its , i m totally satisfied  with the quality, its  exactly how u see it in the picture:)&lt;br /&gt;soft natural looking  hair:) and the delivery  was  fast</li>
    <li> I love this wig!!! Great quality for the price and it totally made my Halloween costume!</li>
    <li> So Great! Shape was excellent and it stayed on all night, it is synthetic so can&#x27;t move it around or it tangles but still oved it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty wig.. just a bit smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Amazing wig! I can not believe how great the quality was for the price. Beats any Halloween store wig.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the color in the picture. Tbin hair. Cheaply put together. I recommend not buying this product. Waste of money an I&#x27;m very disappointedm</li>
    <li> I really like the style of the wig, the peek-a-boo red is gorgeous, just would have liked the red to have been a wee bit less super BRIGHT almost neon pink red, BUT...with that said, the black covers it nicely and it doesn&#x27;t look crazy to wear.  I would buy this one again.  it&#x27;s pretty, and unique.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very cute. I like it a lot. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the same as it is in the picture. The red is very vibrant. It&#x27;s shorter than this. And it&#x27;s not very good quality. It knots easily and falls out too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig in advance for a Halloween party, however, the hair is so natural looking that I wore for a photo shoot and it got rave reviews for such a inexpensive wig.  I love the vibrant red color and the softness of the wig...fitting has not been an issue for me, although I do have a smaller head circumference due to being on the petite size.  Love this wig!</li>
    <li> The wig is not like the picture. The red is way brighter and the bang is really long. Although I liked the way the wig itself fit.i don&#x27;t wear it at all</li>
    <li> LOVED THIS HAIR IT WAS STYLISH WHILE IT LASTED BUT AS YOU CAN EXPECT IT TANGLES PRETTY QUICKLY...BUT AN WEAVE BRUSH AND PINK LOTION WILL DO WONDERS LASTED ABOUT 2 TO 3 WEEKS</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful. There is more red than pictured, but that&#x27;s what I was hoping for. There is about 6 inches of red at the ends! It&#x27;s also a nice slightly deeper red, and not super bright red like most cosplay wigs. The pictures on here do not do this wig justice! I have posted a picture so you may see what it actually looks like. I had to cut around an inch off of the bangs because they are a bit too long for me, but I would much rather have too long than too short. I also purchased this through my amazon prime account which shipped super fast! Very happy I bought this wig.</li>
    <li> It looked cute for like 2 days. It tangles almost instantly.</li>
    <li> This wig is nice but tangles quickly and the bangs are kind of funny/picky. It&#x27;s not a bad wig but I&#x27;ll definitely hardly ever wear it... bummer too cuz the pictures looked awesome. Also, the red is much brighter in real life. I thought I was getting deep red but you&#x27;re really getting cherry red. Oh well....whatever...</li>
    <li> Tends to shed a lot. Not exactly like the photo, more vivid bright red than anything and a couple of black streaks. But other than that it looks great and I love it for the most part. It took forever to get here but it was worth the wait. I also like that it comes with a wig cap. I over look flaws and I love this cute wig</li>
    <li> Given the cheap price I paid for this it came as a WOUNDER, my 14yr old niece loved it, the length is perfect, material is really soft (silicone) and other than the excess of shine it&#x27;s pretty realistic and easy to put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, this is not an everyday accessory nor washable since it drops strands of hair easily.</li>
    <li> this is my first tengs wig, sixth wig in my collection so far. based on the other reviews i figured this would be a decent wig and it is for just $20. when i opened the package i was immediately excited. it came somewhat as pictured (a lot more red than black) and was very natural-looking in colour, texture and cut (very nicki minaj-esque); thankfully not overly shiny but i still used a little bit of baby powder anyway. i don&#x27;t really have any complaints about this wig… though if you&#x27;re considering purchasing this there are a couple of things you should keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the one thing i find slightly annoying are the &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34;. the bottom red layer is about six inches longer than the top black layer so depending on how you&#x27;re looking at it it could look like a rather odd haircut. but if you have black hair like me, most people will just assume you added red extensions and highlights. ;) there is also another awkward layer that i assume was meant to &amp;#34;frame&amp;#34; your face. it&#x27;s on both sides of the face that reach chin level and dramatically curl under, with the left side being red and right side being black. the black layer is hardly noticeable because it blends in with the rest of the black and can be tucked away, however the red layer tends to come out from under the black and &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; my face. my guess is with caution and very low heat it can be slightly straightened out so that it doesn&#x27;t stick out so much. if you&#x27;re a hairdresser and good with scissors, you could probably do some trimming and clean up the cut a bit. I would if I could but I&#x27;m not good at cutting hair! :P also, the wig base is a little bigger/looser than my other wigs so for someone with a larger head and/or are prone to wig headaches (such as myself) this would be a great buy. overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this wig!</li>
    <li> This wig came on time as expected. When I recieved it I was a bit scared because I figured it wouldn&#x27;t be what I expected but was I wrong. The bang is a bit too long to wear as a flat bang so I swept it to the side and also the hair was not compeletly straight as seen in the picture (maybe because it came folded in a tiny bag) so I used a warm iron and straightened out and it looked FAB! ... i wore it to a party and it was gorgeous ... I will be wearing it again very soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice quality wig.it doesn&#x27;t get itchy, it fits nice, but the only problem I had was all the red underneath. I thought it was just going to be red at the tips but the whole bottom layer is bright red, and under the bangs..</li>
    <li> I liked the two day shipping but I didn&#x27;t expect it to look so bright red underneath. The hair is great feel but it also sheds a lot. It isn&#x27;t a wig you can throw on but rather a wig for halloween but I would wear it any where else.</li>
    <li> good wig for price - look out Cher!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews ever but I think you should be warned. I&#x27;m very easy going and don&#x27;t expect a wig that&#x27;s amazing but it&#x27;s nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s wavy not straight and it tangles up weird. Don&#x27;t get it. I was extremely saddened ;( sorry owner!!</li>
    <li> This wig is simply wonderful! it is really soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. it also came here really fast!&lt;br /&gt;to future buyers: it is rather glossy, but it&#x27;s a good natural gloss, but it&#x27;s still a great buy (and powder can fix shininess)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great wig for the price and i will certainly be ordering again from this company.</li>
    <li> beautiful wig  it fit great and it was full.only issue I have is that it sheds and it tangles alot..</li>
    <li> It took a while to get to me, but it was even prettier than the picture (much more red showing through the black, though not as long and thick looking, and with a bit more wave to it). I love it.</li>
    <li> The little bit of red really makes this wig! It is a nice wig for the price! I love it!  People thought it was my real hair!  Go figure!  It is nice!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it because when I got mine it looked like some one owned it before me and hacked it up its also too small and looks nothing like the picture if give it less than one star.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason I do not know but I must have had a lapse in awareness and did not get a wig that was high heat resistant as i intemded and ended up with no more than a cosplay kids costume.  Not to mention it is really materially inferior to anything else I&#x27;ve seen on the market.</li>
    <li> I like this wig it looks and feels real. Would order a wig like this again.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture in the ad when I received it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really long. Looks super fake. Too shiny. The red is too red. Don&#x27;t like it at all. Put it on once and never worn again. Looks like Halloween wig.</li>
    <li> Not the same as pictures in the ad.  I was sad, the red is everywhere and way too bright for what is shown.</li>
    <li> a nicki minaj look but in reality its just a regular wig.&lt;br /&gt;the bangs arent straight down like that tho, their extra long.&lt;br /&gt;but the wig doesnt stink thank God!!! because i have ordered some&lt;br /&gt;wigs from places online and the smell makes u want to vomit,&lt;br /&gt;nicely rapped, and was fast shipped. so a biggggg thank you to you guys!!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig based on previous reviews and customer photos. I knew it was a cheap wig, but thought that the quality would be better than Halloween costume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig was wadded up in a hairnet and plastic bag. The red in the wig is actually closer to orange. Horrible to untangle and full of static electricity even when damp.</li>
    <li> This wig looks amazing.</li>
    <li> My first experience wearing wig and I managed it just ok. Also, seen other wigs and this one is really good quality for the price (IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference from picture that I can pin it that actually there&#x27;s more red.</li>
    <li> Love this super fun wig ! The black length on my wig is a little shorter than in the photo, but still looks like the photo.&lt;br /&gt;This wig has a very soft, yet sturdy base, and the hair has a soft high quality feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the fantastic wig and quick shipping !</li>
    <li> I got this wig quickly! Theres a little more red on the bangs than I&#x27;d care for but otherwise, it feels real :)</li>
    <li> this wig was great for the price&lt;br /&gt;things to be aware of before you order it:&lt;br /&gt;this item ships from china- hence why the shipping can take up to a month, however mine was shipped promptly and arrived in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;its a bit more fake looking in person- it has that artificial shiny look to it, but nothing that i cant fix with some baby powder or even a water and vinegar soak. the strands are very soft though, they dont feel plastic at all. it is also decently thick.&lt;br /&gt;it is very very long and it wasnt in the picture, but there is weird small sections at the chin level cut to, i believe, frame the chin. one side is black and the other is red, but theyre cut on a bottom layer and can be sort of annoying to get them to sit properly, i may just cut them off, since the wig is thick enough it wont really affect it.&lt;br /&gt;another thing to be aware of the red layer on the bottom is about 6 inches longer than the black, which it doesnt look that way in the photo, i may have to trim it because of how awkward it appears. and the bangs are a bit uneven, but again, nothing but a little alteration cant fix to have a super awesome wig!</li>
    <li> The pictures really doesn&#x27;t do it justice. In truth the black and red hair are different in length and the red curls a bit at the ends which makes it look better. Thought .it&#x27;s slightly ly different from the picture it&#x27;s very lovely and Well made.it has clips on try he inside try o adjust size too.you also get a cute sticker from the company  with a hand written sig. On the back .I&#x27;m Happy wother it and it only took 10 days to get to me.</li>
