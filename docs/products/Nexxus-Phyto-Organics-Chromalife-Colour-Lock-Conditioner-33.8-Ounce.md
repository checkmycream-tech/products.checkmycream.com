      <li>The Nexxus Phyto Organics Chromolife Colour Locks Conditioner is wonderful and works great on my thin hair.  </li>
      <li>it has an overly strong,  perfume-y  aroma and liners on my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product was recommended by my hair stylist for my color and keratin treated hair because it is sulfite free and reduces sun fading damage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love what this does for my curly hair and love that I can buy such a big size at a great price.</li>
      <li>also use the same shampoo and believe that the price point was the best possible.  </li>
      <li>Love this conditioner, especially when I can buy it at a reduced price and shipping is free; can&#x27;t get this kind of deal at the local beauty store.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product for awhile and because of that also purchased some of their other phyto organics products.  </li>
      <li>This particular product does not have the SLS in it, so I&#x27;ll continue to enjoy the year&#x27;s supply I just purchased.  </li>
      <li>(pure)</li>
      <li>Such a great everyday shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.  </li>

      <li>Overall it doesn&#x27;t compare to my old color love.</li>
      <li>Phyto Organics is why I loved nexxus before they changed the other products to meet a larger market.  </li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with this conditioner; it lasts a long time, and works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I have not found a salon in the area I live that carries</li>

<li> After seeing that another phyto organics product has sodium laryl sulfate (sls) in it (not good), that makes me distrust the whole phyto organics brand of Nexxus.  </li>
<li> This is one of the few conditioners that does not weigh down my hair and make it flat.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s actually washed out.</li>
<li> It has botanicals, does not weigh hair down at all.  </li>
<li> I think the companies should realize that a little bit of regulation in the cosmetic industry would help guide them and not hurt thier bottom line.  </li>
<li> I usually end up using it along with another conditioner so that it balances itself out.</li>
<li> I saved at least $10 + tax by buying from Amazon.</li>
<li> Not real impressed.</li>
<li> Btw, my hair is thin and I color it quite a bit.</li>
<li> I was looking for a replacement for the very expensive purple container hair conditioner</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.  I have naturally curly hair and it seemed to make my hair brittle.  I guess I need something with more of a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have used this conditioner for 4 years, and it is the best I have ever used.  Does not strip the color.</li>
    <li> This product is a bit greasy. Btw, my hair is thin and I color it quite a bit. I usually end up using it along with another conditioner so that it balances itself out. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product for awhile and because of that also purchased some of their other phyto organics products.  After seeing that another phyto organics product has sodium laryl sulfate (sls) in it (not good), that makes me distrust the whole phyto organics brand of Nexxus.

This particular product does not have the SLS in it, so I&#x27;ll continue to enjoy the year&#x27;s supply I just purchased.  But the seed of distrust in the product has been planted in my mind.</li>
    <li> Phyto Organics is why I loved nexxus before they changed the other products to meet a larger market.  Such a great everyday shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few conditioners that does not weigh down my hair and make it flat.  The saloon where I use to buy this conditioner no longer carries it so I was happy to find it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see where it has kept my color longer than before.</li>
    <li> I love this product it is a great moisturizing conditioner for colored hair. Light weight and smells great it is a natural product. I great buy. This is one best light weigh conditioner for colored hair on the market.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this conditioner; it lasts a long time, and works as well as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist for my color and keratin treated hair because it is sulfite free and reduces sun fading damage.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the same shampoo and believe that the price point was the best possible.  I have not found a salon in the area I live that carries&lt;br /&gt;the liter size so ordering from this site was efficient and expedient!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: The photo showing is not the 33.8 oz, which comes in a big pump container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent conditioner that my hair stylist recommends. I have a lot of highlights, and this and the matching shampoo keep my hair getting me compliments. I saved at least $10 + tax by buying from Amazon. And I know my stylist was already giving me a good deal on a size she had to special order for me. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I  am not a fan of the smell.  it has an overly strong,  perfume-y  aroma and liners on my hair.  gives me a headache. I stopped  using it so I  can&#x27;t speak to how well the color saving formula works.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  It great for my color-treated hair.  You do not have to use alot.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, especially when I can buy it at a reduced price and shipping is free; can&#x27;t get this kind of deal at the local beauty store.</li>
    <li> What can I say? Some hair conditioners don&#x27;t work, but this one does the job! It has botanicals, does not weigh hair down at all.  I was looking for a replacement for the very expensive purple container hair conditioner (pure) I do believe this is the one!</li>
    <li> Love what this does for my curly hair and love that I can buy such a big size at a great price.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I was expecting. My hair feels soft but the texture of the conditioner itself feels waxy when you&#x27;re using it. It&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s actually washed out. Overall it doesn&#x27;t compare to my old color love. Just wanted to find something different and switch it up. Not real impressed. Really want to try something else.</li>
    <li> Nice hair product just expensive</li>
    <li> Great service.... Perfect Price.  The Nexxus Phyto Organics Chromolife Colour Locks Conditioner is wonderful and works great on my thin hair.  I will definitely order again. Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
