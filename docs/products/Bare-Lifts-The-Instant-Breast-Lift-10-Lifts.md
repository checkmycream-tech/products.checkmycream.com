### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s an awesome concept, it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>When I used it to keep it from falling out the sides, it works great!!</li>
      <li>I already have awesome cleavage and perky boobs</li>
      <li>Not as good as the ones in CVS!</li>
      <li>;D lol</li>
      <li>ok the people who wrote reviews and said that this product is awesome, they obviously have no chest.</li>
      <li>i love this product to use in the summer with strapless dresses.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I am a d-cup, so there was a bit more to hold.  </li>
      <li>I am sure these tapes work well on any breast sizes C and below</li>
      <li>i order them far too often lol.</li>
      <li>It would be good to use with a bra if the bra is not giving enough lift by itself, but I would not say that it helps with nice looking cleavage or anything.</li>
      <li>have Fs and it certainly didn&#x27;t give me the lift I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!!</li>
      <li>quite well given that they are only good for one use.</li>
      <li>I will say the adhesive is pretty strong unless you move it.  </li>
      <li>These did not work as well as I would have liked they weren&#x27;t very sticky and didn&#x27;t give much of a lift or support</li>
      <li>These are handy for those dressed with low backs, or for costumes, or for tank tops when you don&#x27;t want the bra strap to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have very large breasts</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel they would work well on very large breasts.</li>
      <li>I have B cup sized breasts and these give them lift and support (as long as I don&#x27;t sweat) and DO look cute.</li>
      <li>My boobs look great in it, it&#x27;s just that the sides would try to escape out near my armpit and when I would push them back in, they would try to pop out the middle.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really like this product.</li>
      <li>I even tried to use rubbing alcohol on my skin before applying them to see if they would stay, but it didn&#x27;t make much difference.</li>
      <li>I really like theses because I don&#x27;t have to always find a bra to wear in order to keep things in order.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>Did not hold very well, and made breast look deformed.</li>
      <li>Thanks for the help.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t stick to me very well</li>
      <li>(they are extremely sticky, but once you put it on, you better hope that it is where you want it.</li>
      <li>Again, they do offer a little lift, but beware, they will leave a crease in the top of the breast.</li>
      <li>And once you pull them off twice you have to use a new one.</li>
      <li>lifts your breasts and makes you look younger and perky ;-)</li>
      <li>It does say it can work for large chests that is the only reason I tried it.</li>
      <li>They did lift, but they left a crease in the breast and did not make them very shapely in that respect.</li>
      <li>does not lay flat they wrinkle up on the skin so you may see that through certain materials</li>
      <li>the reason I gave this item 1 star is because it came super early other than that they do not hold my D cups!</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t magically have your chest looking as if it&#x27;s in a Victoria&#x27;s Secret bra.</li>
      <li>This product is really cool, I have DDD breast and helps with overall perkiness, but it is difficult to stick on seamlessly and its really sticky so it frequently gets stuck on to it</li>

<li> so I guess theres not much to lift.</li>

<li> but they are not appropriate for anyone above a C.</li>
<li> But I have a hard time getting them positioned correctly and getting my girls going the same direction.</li>

<li> These were a total failure.</li>
<li> Made them a really odd shape.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know how reliable they are when things get a little sweaty...</li>
<li> They&#x27;re a waste of money.</li>
<li> but my boobies are too heavy</li>
<li> So just buy knowing unless you are a small B or less, this won&#x27;t be a substitute for a bra.</li>
<li> I have relatively large (and very heavy) breasts, so I&#x27;m usually disappointed with these kinds of products from the jump.</li>
<li> But it wasn&#x27;t worthless either.</li>
<li> These are terrible.</li>
<li> They were just like scotch tape but worst.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really like this product. It made my boobs look smaller.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t quite work for me.  I am a d-cup, so there was a bit more to hold.  I will say the adhesive is pretty strong unless you move it.  I wasted two sets learning how to apply it because the instructions are 100% clear.  I do like the idea of going out without a bra.  May just need surgey to accomplish that, though.</li>
    <li> I am sure these tapes work well on any breast sizes C and below but they are not appropriate for anyone above a C.</li>
    <li> worked, but gave me a weird dip in the middle of my boos on the top. Made them a really odd shape. SO I use it to pick up the sides of my breasts. I needed them for a prom dress with a collar and a slit in the chest. My boobs look great in it, it&#x27;s just that the sides would try to escape out near my armpit and when I would push them back in, they would try to pop out the middle. When I used it to keep it from falling out the sides, it works great!! I already have awesome cleavage and perky boobs ;D lol</li>
    <li> ok the people who wrote reviews and said that this product is awesome, they obviously have no chest. the reason I gave this item 1 star is because it came super early other than that they do not hold my D cups! do not get it, we gotta find a different way to hold up our chest because this is not it!!!</li>
    <li> They were alright. They did lift, but they left a crease in the breast and did not make them very shapely in that respect. It would be good to use with a bra if the bra is not giving enough lift by itself, but I would not say that it helps with nice looking cleavage or anything. Again, they do offer a little lift, but beware, they will leave a crease in the top of the breast. (they are extremely sticky, but once you put it on, you better hope that it is where you want it. If you try adjusting it, it will loose all of its stickiness.)</li>
    <li> These are terrible. They&#x27;re not very sticky at all. I would not recommend buying them. They&#x27;re a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i love this product to use in the summer with strapless dresses.&lt;br /&gt;It lifts your breasts and makes you look younger and perky ;-)</li>
    <li> I give one star.. it doesn&#x27;t lift your breast like it claims to.</li>
    <li> May work for cup size A&amp;B but anything bigger than that is a waist of money.the lifts does not lay flat they wrinkle up on the skin so you may see that through certain materials</li>
    <li> Did not hold very well, and made breast look deformed.</li>
    <li> These did not work as well as I would have liked they weren&#x27;t very sticky and didn&#x27;t give much of a lift or support</li>
    <li> although it was used without any lotion on my breast.... It didn&#x27;t stick to me very well</li>
    <li> Not as good as the ones in CVS! They don&#x27;t stick like the other ones, but they will work for a night out!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work.. Don&#x27;t stick well at all</li>
    <li> Did not like, didn&#x27;t work, Made for women with Lil breast would not recommend to women with large breast not good</li>
    <li> Not for DD&#x27;s, I wanted them to wear with my bikini but therenot sticky enough. Wont hold up, the plastic wont grip on big boobs.</li>
    <li> Work quite well given that they are only good for one use. I don&#x27;t feel they would work well on very large breasts.</li>
    <li> Thanks for the help. I really like theses because I don&#x27;t have to always find a bra to wear in order to keep things in order. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> These things actually work! I only tried them in in my room. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to wear them outside yet, so I don&#x27;t know how reliable they are when things get a little sweaty... I am a little nervous to find out, but they definitely lift! I have relatively large (and very heavy) breasts, so I&#x27;m usually disappointed with these kinds of products from the jump. This product was different though. It lifted without any overhang on the sides. I&#x27;m going to work up the nerve to wear these outside, then I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> I like them, my cup is 34B so I guess theres not much to lift.</li>
    <li> Does not work does not lift</li>
    <li> I gave two stars because they probably work for someone and i can see how they would work but my boobies are too heavy and they just won&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> These work sooooo well!!! i order them far too often lol. definitely recommend</li>
    <li> Not for big boobs! Couldn&#x27;t support the weight of my DD&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The stickers work as well as you can hope. You won&#x27;t magically have your chest looking as if it&#x27;s in a Victoria&#x27;s Secret bra. This isn&#x27;t for that. These are handy for those dressed with low backs, or for costumes, or for tank tops when you don&#x27;t want the bra strap to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Fs and it certainly didn&#x27;t give me the lift I would&#x27;ve liked. But it wasn&#x27;t worthless either. So just buy knowing unless you are a small B or less, this won&#x27;t be a substitute for a bra.</li>
    <li> This product is really cool, I have DDD breast and helps with overall perkiness, but it is difficult to stick on seamlessly and its really sticky so it frequently gets stuck on to it self when placing.</li>
    <li> These may work on someone who doesn&#x27;t have a chest, but I am a 32DD and It did nothing for me. It does say it can work for large chests that is the only reason I tried it.</li>
    <li> They work if you can ever get them positioned correctly. I have B cup sized breasts and these give them lift and support (as long as I don&#x27;t sweat) and DO look cute. But I have a hard time getting them positioned correctly and getting my girls going the same direction. And once you pull them off twice you have to use a new one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an awesome concept, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. You can&#x27;t move around in these at all because they start to slip off almost immediately. I&#x27;m not even that big. I&#x27;m a 32DD, 34C, or 36B and I&#x27;ve tried them out multiple times to see if I was making a mistake in application. I even tried to use rubbing alcohol on my skin before applying them to see if they would stay, but it didn&#x27;t make much difference. I also tried to trim them and that didn&#x27;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see this possibly working with some body adhesive or on really tiny boobs but why would you need lift on tiny boobs?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 38d and I had to put 3 on just to hold. Do not recommend this product to women with big breast</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t like the heavier plastic ones.  like the sheer ones that don&#x27;t wrinkle when trying to apply.</li>
    <li> I have very large breasts and I bought this for a dress that required me to wear no bra. I just wanted a bit of a lift.These were a total failure. They didn&#x27;t even stick. They were just like scotch tape but worst.  38G</li>
