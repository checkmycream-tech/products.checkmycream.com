<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my favorite eye cream. It absorbs quickly without that thick residue feel and has by far the best scent of any face cream I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
    <li> Very well packaged. Light to the skin. Thanks</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream, it goes on smoothly and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the puffiness under my eyes after just a few days! The packaging is very attractive also.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream for my daughter and she loves it. This cream has all the right ingredients. All natural, nothing artificial. It has Jajoba oil, apricot kernel oil, Hyaluronic acid and squalane among other natural ingredients. She has been using it for a few weeks and feel it has made a difference. The eyes look more open and bright. The under eye skin is lighter and smooth. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it. A little goes a long way and although it has a cream consistency it absorbs fast.She is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for approx. 1 week. I apply to mostly my eyes but in the process rub it all around on my face and It really makes my skin super soft and I can feel it doing something to my skin. So far no complaints and I will continue using this and look forward to a future purchase. If my thoughts change I will certainly update my review.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this eye cream. When you put it on you notice a cooling effect that feels really nice and the smell is light and fresh.  It is very hydrating and not greasy.</li>
    <li> Great cream. Gentle on the eyes. Noticed less puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream, you will not be disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> Like product, seen to lighten under eye area. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This cream comes in a very pretty, high end type of container. It&#x27;s a very thick cream but absorbs quickly and smells great! Can&#x27;t attest to any long term benefits because I&#x27;ve only used it three nights now, but I&#x27;m loving it so far. Looks like it should last quite a while too!</li>
    <li> I love his eye cream! I have shopped around and used a million different products, but this one is my new fave. It goes on beautifully and then melts away. And it seems to make my concealer not settle in my lines. It even smells good...it has a faint floral scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. I have sensitive skin around my eyes and many eye creams sting, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
    <li> In the few short days I&#x27;ve had the Eye Cream, I&#x27;ve noticed a small change. My eyes have had really bad dark circles (almost looks like black eyes) and puffiness round them (from my allergies mainly) for as long as I can remember. (I know the insomnia doesn&#x27;t help the circles and all either.) Not to mention what I did NOT know. For example, daily stress, UV from the sun, and fluid retention to name a couple also play a part in dark circles and puffiness. Since I started using this cream a mere 2 days ago (twice daily), I&#x27;ve noticed the black circles and puffiness are becoming less prominent. It&#x27;s made of natural botanical extracts so you know you&#x27;re not putting tons of chemicals around your eyes. Simply dab a small amount on your finger, lightly trace under your eye (I personally also dab around the top lid being very careful to not get it in my eye), and simply dab round (to help create better circulation which is what helps rid your dark circles and puffiness) until the cream is dry. Not only does this cream work, it works quickly. As an additional bonus, shortly after you place your order, they send to your email a FREE eBook with lots of beauty tips along with detailed information about the cream itself. If you&#x27;ve had issues with dark circles and puffy eyes, I would DEFINITELY recommend this for you!! (I received this product at a discount but this review is solely my opinion and the information provided is based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> I loved the way it made my skin feel.  I use it as a mosturizer all over my face.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye creme for about a month and half and I am very pleased with this cream. I unfortunately have always been blessed with dark circles under my eyes. I have tried numerous products and none has helped as much as this one. I do notice a difference and my skin does not look as dark under my eyes. The creme is yellow in color and a little goes a very long way. You only need a little dab for each eye. The creme has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it has helped to diminish my dark circles. I would happily purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I left a review for this product a while ago but for some reason it does not show up now. I was coming back to say that after a longer period of time I am still very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> only used for a week now, do not see a difference yet but I do like that it is creamy and in a large pretty container, a lot better than thin tubes. Never did get a beauty pamphlet as I thought came with it. Update 5/26/15. I have not noticed a difference in the puffiness or dark circles and use it daily. Follow up July 17th, no difference noticed in the puffiness under my eyes. Hoping on finding a better product</li>
    <li> This cream is works well at dark circles for me. And it smells so good, makes me feel  relax after use.  It&#x27;s a big size eyes cream. Very worth for the price!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Eye Cream for a while and I can already see my dark circles disappearing. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these. they are high quality too.</li>
    <li> Most people use this eye cream to help alleviate the signs of aging. As I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, the closer people got to their 40s, the more that they felt the need to use a product like this, but I can tell you, you don&#x27;t have to be aged to use and benefit from this cream. I&#x27;m 26 and although the appearance of my skin is youthful, the feel is not so much. My insomnia combined with the terribly harsh winter weather and my eczema leaves me with red, puffy eyes and skin that feels tighter and older than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened this box I smiled. Just look at the packaging, pretty pinks and purples with dainty flowers - if you can describe smell over the Internet that is it.  I opened the jar and found a light yellow colored cream that had a light, pretty floral scent and applied just a little underneath my eyes. It felt cool to the touch, tingly and soothing. I don&#x27;t expect this cream to cure my eczema because that isn&#x27;t its purpose, but it does help the appearance of aging skin and it relieves the feel of tired, dry skin, which is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people don&#x27;t pay attention to labels, but I do. I find the ingredients list, whether a company tests on animals and whether or not they test on animals important to know. I want to know that the places I spend my money are providing good contributions to society. I was happy to read that Cheeva does not test on animals and has a request on the back of the jar to &amp;#34;please recycle.&amp;#34; There is one ingredient that stood out to me: soybeans. I love the natural ingredients used and I thank this company for not using harsh chemicals because those usually exacerbate my problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen no results yet I use it day and nite nothing</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ~ ~&lt;br /&gt;Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves this mask. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, really reduces puffiness and dark circles. I have a very demanding job and need all the help I can get to not look exhausted, this stuff does just that:)</li>
    <li> Great Product and service!!!</li>
    <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
    <li> When I used this cream, the bags around my lower eyes were definitely less noticeable. My upper lids also looker fuller. The cream went on very smoothly, didn&#x27;t burn at all, and a little went a long way. I recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s eyes seem to be aging.</li>
    <li> Really great eye cream! Helped diminish the dark circles under my eyes! Its really smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy. It smells great! I am glad to recieve this product to review! I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream and great customer service!</li>
    <li> Love the is product.  The results are amazing and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to noticed them.  I use this at night on a clean face and let it sit all night. Then rinse in the morning.</li>
    <li> This item is very good quality.</li>
    <li> I am always a little wary of eye creams, but this one really does work.  I work in a 911 communications center, so I have long hours and short turn arounds.  Sleep is not always something I can have regularly.  I started using this product about a week and half ago and really have noticed a lessening in the dark circles and the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> My wife has used many of the more expensive brands on the market. She wanted to find a quality product at a better value. She initially was a little reluctant to try something purchased online, but she had heard good things about the Cheeva Brand products and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for about a week she saw dramatic results. She tells me she applies less Cheeva eye cream than the more expensive brands she was using and gets better results. I have to agree with her about the results. We have had some sleepless nights with a new born baby in the house. We both had circles under our eyes ! My wife looks like she hasn&#x27;t lost any sleep since she began using Cheeva eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;I may have to use some myself :-)</li>
    <li> Great product! I am super impressed with the eye cream from Cheeva Beauty products and I use it daily. The smell is so lovely and the cream is very gentle and smooth. OMG! This stuff actually works and it removed the dark circles from under my eyes. For those who are looking for eye cream; you will love this product. This is the best cream I have ever used and I love it.</li>
    <li> Works well if you don&#x27;t skip a day</li>
    <li> I put this on immediately after receiving this. Not only did it make my eyes feel so much better, the cream is so soft feeling, gliding on very smoothly but the smell is great! I have tried and tested multiple eye creams and serums, with this being the best by far. I love the small flat jar as well, giving more room on my bathroom counter instead of the smaller bottles that continuly tip over and spill here and there. This is worth a 5 star rating. Thank You!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. Dark circles still there no lighter..it makes my skin smooth around my eyes but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I just received this cream today. It is very moisturizing and freshly scented. The packaging was very pretty and sealed in plastic which is always a good idea. The jar itself is bigger on the outside than the filled portion inside. Maybe that&#x27;s ok as long as you only need to use a very tiny amount.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is really hydrating.  Perfect for dry, winter weather.  I find myself using it more than any other product because my skin is so dry and I can really see a difference around my eyes when I use this cream.</li>
    <li> I love this! it works great.</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see the maximum benefits, I am very pleased with my purchase! I love the way this eye cream leaves my skin feeling soft and the is improved suppleness as well. I can&#x27;t say enough about the texture of my skin. I also don&#x27;t have to worry about putting too many chemicals on my face just to get the results I want. I will definitely be repurchasing after the jar is empty. (Its a generous amount for how little is needed)</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference. I also really like the smell of the product, it makes me happy to put it on every time!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks. I do have puffy eyes but I don&#x27;t tend to have dark Circles. I started using it as soon as I received it. When I first put it on the cream is so soft feeling&amp;#62; I easily massaged it under my eyes. It tightens tones and firmed my eyes. It felt great. After a week I started to see an improvement. My eyes were not puffy. My eyes definitely looked brighter. The cream has a slight floral scent. Perfect not to strong. For those who are looking for eye cream; you will love this product. !!!!</li>
    <li> I really love the Cheeva eye cream.  It absorbs very quickly and it very silky feeling.  I have seen an improvement in my dark circles and fine lines.</li>
    <li> Really good eye cream! I got this for m y mom &amp; she is really enjoying it. Says it has already helped the bags under her eyes a little.&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s no telling what time will do soon enough..</li>
    <li> It does not get rid of dark circles, and actually has caused the skin under my eyes to become dry causing more wrinkles to become visible.</li>
    <li> So far, my wife likes this cream and plans to order more.</li>
    <li> not realy works on my</li>
    <li> Sighhh I must admit that I am at the age where I start obsessing about fine lines and wrinkles and all of those scary words! Therefore, a good eye cream is a must! I decided that I should try out Cheeva Beauty&#x27;s Nourishing Eye Repair Cream. The directions were simple enough. Just tap a small amount around the eye area until it absorbs. I like simple. It also has very pretty packaging! I love creams that come in cute little pots. They look so much better on my vanity. The eye cream itself has a scent that reminds me a bit of Dove conditioner. Nothing overwhelming either. It didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation as a result of use and left my eyes feeling hydrated. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m including a list of ingredients for reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified water, jojoba seed oil, apricot kernel oil, squalane, hyaluronic acid, phytonadiona, arnica Montana extract, oxido reductades, soybean protein, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexlglycerin, eriobotrya japonica extract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
    <li> No more dark circles, no more looking tired all day!</li>
    <li> This cream is definitely a moisturizing cream, a little bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t put too much on at once. But, I have been using this cream for a couple weeks now, and have not really noticed a difference in my under eye circles. The wrinkles are still the same, and it hasn&#x27;t removed any of the shadow. So, it&#x27;s moisturizing, but won&#x27;t do much for your dark circles.</li>
    <li> Works almost instantly,helps with dark circles and bags.Smells good and not to greasy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for a little over a week, and I can already see a difference.  I am usually kind of sceptical about anti aging products, but I love this one, and will definitely by again!  Very happy with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Cheeva for a few weeks now and I can already tell a difference and I think my wait is over. My life long dark circles are actually lightening up and I don&#x27;t look so tired. I will be ordering again. I love this product and it feels so nice on my skin too. Glad I took a chance.</li>
    <li> I have some fancy stuff from a department store that I love.  So, I&#x27;m weird and have been putting 1 cream under one eye and this cream under the other - I just want to see if there&#x27;s a difference.  I actually like this better!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this would make a difference and... I was wrong this actually works. Even my hubby noticed.</li>
    <li> https://youtu.be/5oo2aDj8qRw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and I repurchased Cheeva Beauty - Eyes of Beauty Eye Repair Cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients List&lt;br /&gt;Purified water, jojoba seed oil, apricot kernel oil, squalane, hyaluronic acid, phytonadione, arnica Montana extract, oxido reductades, soybean protein, rice bran protein, laureth 7, c13-14 isoparafin, polyacrylamide, phenoxyethanol, ethylhexlglycerin, eriobotrya japonica extract.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye cream for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my undereye circles and wrinkles.  On the plus side, the cream is pleasant smelling and does not cause me to break out.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.  Hopefully by the time the jar is empty I&#x27;ll notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Within 2 days, my dark circles started to lighten.  Now they are almost gone. I love this eye cream. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I would call it a miracle cream. I love it.</li>
