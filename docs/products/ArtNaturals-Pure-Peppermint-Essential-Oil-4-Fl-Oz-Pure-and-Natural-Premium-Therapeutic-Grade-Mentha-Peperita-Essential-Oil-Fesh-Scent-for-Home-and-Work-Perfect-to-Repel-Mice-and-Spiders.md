<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ok so here I am being honest.......I was so excited to receive this oil and put it to good use. Needless to say I am very disappointed. Usually peppermint oil needs to be diluted with a carrier oil if it is any good because it will burn your skin. I put this on my fingers to rub on my hubs neck and it never even burned. There is nothing as good as popping the cap on a true peppermint oil and taking a huge sniff. If it is good you can feel it burn the back of your throat and you instantly feel refreshed. This oil almost smells like it was chemically made with a synthetic peppermint. It has a weird smell and doesn&#x27;t smell clean. I doubt that it will even work that well for colds, diffusers, or making salves. I would def think of trying a different brand like young living, or doterra. I know they are more expensive but they are far superior and once again you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;*I received compensation for writing this review all opinions are honest and my own thoughts about the product.</li>
    <li> The smell of the peppermint oil was very strong and smell good  because the bottle broke open in the mail. The post office was not happy.  I did get this for free to review.</li>
    <li> This is god for so may things looked it up n line and wil be using for all sorts of home remedy&amp;#34;s.&lt;br /&gt;Received this for a review.</li>
    <li> Peppermint oil is a product that we always have at home. I love how it smells and there&#x27;s many be benefits of using peppermint oil. At our house we always have a bottle for emergencies. This oil from Art naturals comes in a 4 oz bottle that will last you a long time. Also brings a dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many benefits of using peppermint oil. Some that I use are for my migranes I suffer from migranes almost every month. The smell of the peppermint makes me feel better and relaxing I enjoy smelling the oil along with some peppermint tea. I recommend you try it. It&#x27;s a really nice relief for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use is for my humidifier. When my children are congested and have a cough. I add some drops and relaxed them and helps them breath better.&lt;br /&gt;They love how it smells and it reminds them of Christmas. There&#x27;s many other ways to use this product. Give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Peppermint is probably my favorite oil!  I carry a small rollerball to help with headaches at work instead of medication .  I also use it on car rides to help with motion sickness!  My other oils are smaller and more expensive and I was thrilled it was  purchased  at a reduced price. It is just as effective as the more expensive EO&#x27;s.  I have also used it in my diffuser to help with a stuffy nose. Please use with a carrier oil because it may cause skin irritation used neat!  This is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Summer colds are the worst and my child, as well as myself, had a cold recently. We usually use those menthol inserts yo plug into the wall outlet to help us breath at night but I wanted to try something better. Peppermint oil will help clear you up so you can breathe so I decided to give it a try with ArtNaturals Peppermint Oil. I put a few drops in my essential oil diffuser before bed and it worked great. I was able to sleep and not be annoyed that I couldn&#x27;t breath through my nose. My son was able to breathe also and not have to be propped up in order to breathe. This will definitely be a household staple this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item. The discount did not, in any way, shape, or form influence my review. My opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently in a situation where I can&#x27;t take antihistamines, but my sinuses aren&#x27;t cooperating. I&#x27;d heard wonderful things about peppermint oil, so I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added it to my diffuser first, and it really worked to open up my nasal passages. I had read on the product page that it was also a mosquito deterrent, so I took it outside to test it. I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet and normally get eaten alive when I go outside, and was only bitten once, on the ankle that was furthest away from the diffuser. I call that a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I used it for headache relief, and that was perfect. I mixed it with a carrier oil and rubbed it into my temples and neck, and it worked right away. I&#x27;ll be keeping ArtNaturals Peppermint Oil nearby for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a product for review purposes. My opinions and massive relief are my own.</li>
    <li> I love it! Smells great and is very powerful. All three of my kids have had a stomach virus and I put this in our diffuser to help ease some of their symptoms. It works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom.  She  needed peppermint oil for its many uses!  She is very excited to use this for beauty, health and around the home.  Great price.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a 100% Natural ingredients ,vegan certified, paraben free and cruelty free this is your oil. ArtNaturals Peppermint is 100% pure and smells just like if you are in candy land .  I have try two different brands and this one is by far the best. Peppermint oil could be used for many different things. Good for headaches just out few drops and you will be better at no time. I like mixing it with my favorite carrier oil &amp;#34; Coconut&amp;#34; I rub it on my joints  for the pain . I put some drops in my diffuser and my house smells beautiful . Please do some research of many ways that you could use this amazing peppermint oil. I highly recommend this brand .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  received this product at discounted price for an honest feedback</li>
    <li> Good Product.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a few items from the artnaturals company and have loved everyone of them. The peppermint oil is no different ! It is 100 % all natural and comes in a nice size 4 oz bottle.  You can use this in many ways like your hair and scalp along with your skin and body . You can also use this around the house and garden too. This have a very nice smell and can be used also in a diffuser or humidifier! This is a great product that has so many different ideas and uses so I def recommend this to anyone .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> I honestly was hesitant to purchase because this is a big bottle for such a low price.  Glad I did!  The smell is a pleasant, strong peppermint without being sweet (which is how it should smell).  Now for the skin test....extremely cooling and the coolness lingers a long time!  Way longer than the previous brand I purchased.  Powerful, minty and a little goes a long way. Yep, I really like it!  I am a licensed MT and this is my new favorite brand to put on the back of my clients&#x27; necks.  Just in case you want to know, the bottle says the oil is from India as I don&#x27;t remember if the description stated that.  Personally, I would NOT ingest this particular brand.</li>
    <li> I love the peppermint smell and put a few drop of this peppermint oil on cotton ball and put it shoe closet to make it smell nice and fresh.  The bottle comes with a dropper so it is easy to use. Peppermint oil is also good for headaches and I hope to use it future if needed.  Overall it is very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a large bottle and will last for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received at discounted rate in exchange of honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Just start to use it. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I use peppermint oil for an array of situations. I like how strong the peppermint aroma is in this brand.  I also like that this particular bottle is 4oz, and that a little goes a long way.  Since I live ina  southern state, I get a lot of ants, and critters.  I like to soak cotton balls in this Oil, and place around exterior windows, and the back patios to deter the ants.  It works for me.  The moment I see an ant,  that&#x27;s when I know I need to place more Peppermint.  I also appreciate that this brand is therapedic grade, and I have always enjoyed Peppermint Oil..  I do like how strong this oil is.  I received product at discount for my opinion.</li>
    <li> Overly Obsessed with this oil...I USE IT FOR EVERYTHING...Leaves a great scent in my hair and a nice tingle when Im deep conditioning..I mix this oil with Jojoba and coconut oil. .and leave it in my hair  up to a day if I have have nothing to do..The folliwing day I rinse out my hair and it smelks feels and looks amazing..Myscalp feels so refreshed..I also use this oil along with cinnamon sticks and alittle bit of water in a pot onthe stove ..let it simmer and it leaves the house smelling delicious ....Honest review for a great price...Will definately buy again! THE SIZE IS AWESOME</li>
    <li> Not an essential/aromatherapy oils connoisseur, this was just an impulse buy. Like 5 drops of this bombed my whole room with peppermint. On the skin it feels like Icy Hot. DO NOT PUT ON FACE THOUGH. Seriously, this stuff is a skin irritant. It&#x27;s fine to put on your arms, but the face is too sensitive, my eye is still irritated an hour later, and I didn&#x27;t even put the oil near my eye.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:7ffd0b0102ba3fd3d27be233aa66f076]]Another great product by Art Naturals,.. I love the generous size. I love the convenient dropper so I can use a lot or a little.  I just love the peppermint smell. The smell just makes me HAPPY. This product gives me so many options- Not to mention I love the tingly feel it gives me when added to my shampoo! My first initial intention was for our honey bees to aid in the over all health but after testing and reading about other possible uses, I was impressed. I&#x27;m a hater of spiders so I did mix a few drops with water and sprayed the corners in the house... And in doing so it freshened up the house and made it smell so lovely!. Not to mention it helped my sinuses (during this god awful allergy season) So with my one intent to- keep spiders away -I got 3 results in one. Not to shabby to say about a product. So I can honestly say, I really like this peppermint essential oil form Art Naturals.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #LL</li>
