      <li>I enjoy it very much.</li>
      <li>I love my new tuning fork.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not convinced this was worth the price.</li>
      <li>This item is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun for the kids.</li>
      <li>The fork has a beautiful, clear tone that lasts a very long time (hold it up to your ear</li>
      <li>SUPER HIGH QUALITY!</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know anything about this DNA repair stuff, but I do enjoy having this out on those special party nights and swirling it around my third eye.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what it said it was.</li>
      <li>They can instantly assist me in feeling better and clearing energy.</li>
      <li>this helps in many ways, using it on a regular basis to uplift my hearts frequency...also helps with migraine headches.</li>

      <li>I bought this for grounding and good health, but really do not use it enough to know if the claims are true.  </li>
      <li>I have been interested in sound therapy, especially using tuning forks, for years.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a definite must have for those who are on their ascension journey and looking to fine tune their inner body without medicines.</li>
      <li>When struck against something hard, it produces a strong sound that lasts much longer than I expected (although gradually it gets quieter).</li>
      <li>My 99 year old father is exibiting an improvement as well.</li>
      <li>think I&#x27;ve ordered  3 so far.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this limit on words is ridiculous: it is why i dont review so many items</li>
      <li>It is a wonder tool to have with me so that I can calm down and energetically charge my water drank from glass!</li>
      <li>Naturally, I came back and bought a second one.</li>

    <li> Great seller, no issues with shipment. Arrived quickly. Don&#x27;t know anything about this DNA repair stuff, but I do enjoy having this out on those special party nights and swirling it around my third eye. Feels good man.</li>
    <li> Love it! Everyone should have a DnA Repair 528 Hz. Tuning Fork! Arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> wish I had ordered a holder/striker combined to go with this.  I enjoy listening to the sound-can&#x27;t hear when used on my back.</li>
    <li> Great service and product. Delivered on time. Thanks, it sounds great!</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a stand  i need the stand to hold it up</li>
    <li> I have been interested in sound therapy, especially using tuning forks, for years. Finally, I decided to get one and give it a try. Since I had read a lot of interesting things about the 528 Hz I chose to get this fork. I have to admit that price was the deciding factor when it came to why I chose this particular one to buy but I was extremely pleased when it arrived. The fork has a beautiful, clear tone that lasts a very long time (hold it up to your ear and you will hear it humming away even after it seems to have died down). I absolutely love to listen to the tone and thought it would be wonderful to have two so I could have a stereo effect going. Naturally, I came back and bought a second one. I&#x27;ve shared the beautiful sound of these forks with many of my friends and a lot of them have bought them, too.</li>
    <li> I use it to structure water and for any disharmony may be in mu body</li>
    <li> Good!  I purchased it as &amp;#34;maybe a little help&amp;#34; to heal my sickness.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working, though.  But its sound is soothing and great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a matter of belief.  Certain vibrations have an effect on one&#x27;s moods and well being. Tuning is real.</li>
    <li> This is the second tuning fork I have purchased, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it with. However, I love it!  The sound is amazing. I recommend the tuning fork mallet to get it ringing. It seems to have a clearing and uplifting effect.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Has great sound.  Holds tone for a long time.  It is exactly what it said it was. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> The fork looks as pictured, and it arrived in a lavender carrying pouch along with a small pamphlet of instructions. When struck against something hard, it produces a strong sound that lasts much longer than I expected (although gradually it gets quieter). The pamphlet suggests striking below the knee or on carpet. I strike on something harder. Otherwise I can&#x27;t hear or feel it beyond my ears. Really, it doesn&#x27;t vibrate much. Use is more for the sound.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems good quality, but I&#x27;m not convinced this does much repair or healing. I&#x27;m not convinced this was worth the price.</li>
    <li> this helps in many ways, using it on a regular basis to uplift my hearts frequency...also helps with migraine headches.</li>
    <li> I have other forks that have a clearer longer tone</li>
    <li> works wonders&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> I love that I can place the point exactly where I need to.  It&#x27;s a definite must have for those who are on their ascension journey and looking to fine tune their inner body without medicines.</li>
    <li> Excellent - use it for spiritual healing, when I have finished the leg work, and&lt;br /&gt;then encase the person with a healing sound.  Value for money</li>
    <li> I wish it was louder, or worked like a musical tuning fork, where you can place the bottom end on a guitar or in front of your ear and amplify the sound. Other than that, it&#x27;s great quality at great value! Comes with a handy pouch.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful sound. I enjoy it very much. Though I think a 528 hz singing bowl would allow for a sustained tone, this is a nice tool that is compact and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE This Item!  I was searching for Some HEALING Energy That WAS Grounded And with Immediate effects!!!!  This 528 tuning fork Has BEEN Awesome !!!!!  Totally Works For US!  Been playing around with it for A Few Moonths Now!  I Only Wish I Had bought the Mallet To go with it, I will purchase A mallet one of these Days.......</li>
    <li> I will order more as gifts because I love the  528 hz forks. They can instantly assist me in feeling better and clearing energy. I recommend these tuning forks. They are simple to use and handle too.&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve ordered  3 so far.</li>
    <li> Ahhhhh yes. . .after some confusion in their shipping department, I have received the 2nd of two DNA Repair 528 Hz Tuning Forks which I had ordered.  The error was immediately rectified and I am completely happy with my purchase.  Would I recommend this company and it&#x27;s products. . .yes, definitely.  The Tuning Forks are amazing and I have had very good results using them.</li>
    <li> This tuning fork is great, I used the Android app gStrings to test it&#x27;s accuracy, and yep, it&#x27;s 528Hz alright! Sounds amazing and creates healing Solfeggio frequencies in your space! Can&#x27;t wait to use it more!</li>
    <li> This Tuning Fork frequency of 528 is one of the Solfeggio healing tones from ancient civilizations around the world. It works wonders, its tone is penetrating and so soothing! Play it in each ear and you get that full benefit of repair. I&#x27;ve felt this, and I absolutely love it. I use it daily, and it has been attuning me into living more in touch with life and its miracles. Its a blessing to have such a healing tool!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. To play it, gently knock it with the bend of your index finger.</li>
    <li> Use it on myself and family.</li>
    <li> I feel better and calmer when listening to this. It is a wonder tool to have with me so that I can calm down and energetically charge my water drank from glass!</li>
    <li> This item is well worth the price. I appreciate the longer handle. I have really noticed improved clarity in concentration. My 99 year old father is exibiting an improvement as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for grounding and good health, but really do not use it enough to know if the claims are true.  It&#x27;s fun for the kids.</li>
