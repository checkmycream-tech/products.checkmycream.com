      <li>/&gt;Thirdly, I love how ACV was able to get rid of the warts I&#x27;ve had on the back of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all.</li>
      <li>it fresh after I use ut..with a paper towel..also drink in morning with my vitamin shake.  </li>
      <li>All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip) in the ACV, place that on top of the wart, and secure it snugly with a band-aid.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, with plenty of water, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time.</li>

      <li>this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I&#x27;ve heard about from so many other people.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However it can be purchased so much cheaper from Vitamin Shop.</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>U CAN GET THIS MUCH CHEAPER,,LIKE 4 TO 5 DOLLARS</li>
      <li>It stops any further symptoms, right in their tracks!</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly for my parents, both of whom have issues with diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have that “mother&amp;#34; in it.</li>

      <li>Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours.</li>
      <li>this stuff, as a facial toner, has improved my skin soooo much.</li>
      <li>it was a hot day and the bottle came slightly opened and leaked, but it was packaged real well..  </li>
      <li>But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure.</li>
      <li>But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure.</li>
      <li>Always fresh and has that milky dark color that the store bought brands don&#x27;t seem to have.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend but beware that they, Bragg&#x27;s, state on their website that they are running low on organic ACV and you are only allowed to purchase two per customer.  </li>

    <li> Happy with this purchase.  I will buy again!!</li>
    <li> MY SON LOVES IT FOR HIS FACE</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a little over a month and have noticed a few benefits such as less bloating and cravings.  I take 1 tablespoon with a glass of water before lunch and dinner.  The real reason why I&#x27;m writing this review is this price!  $15 for a 32oz bottle is so overpriced.  The regular price at my local grocery store for the same size is $6.</li>
    <li> Best stuff!  My kids and I drink a tablespoon in a half a cup of water each day.  We also drink it when we have an upset stomach, especially if we have eaten gluten!  Great natural food enzyme.</li>
    <li> With this product, you won&#x27;t have gallbladder (or kidney) sludge and stones: evidence from my father.</li>
    <li> So many uses...hair rinse...I cleaned out drum of my front loader to keep,it fresh after I use ut..with a paper towel..also drink in morning with my vitamin shake.  Keeps body not too and not too little acidic.</li>
    <li> Always liked this brand.. it was a hot day and the bottle came slightly opened and leaked, but it was packaged real well..  The delivery man left it  outside...</li>
    <li> Love the product.  However it can be purchased so much cheaper from Vitamin Shop.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bragg&#x27;s for years and I love it.  I mostly use it for a toner on my face.  I do 50 ACV/50 purified water.  Works great.  I tried drinking a small amount mixed in my water, etc. but it was too strong for my stomach and threw my PH level out of whack and caused yeast infections!  I also used it recently on my dog because he had mites and his skin became irritated and the mites hate ACV.  Highly recommend but beware that they, Bragg&#x27;s, state on their website that they are running low on organic ACV and you are only allowed to purchase two per customer.  Not sure why or what&#x27;s happening?  About a year ago I ordered some and it was really light in color and everyone was complaining about it.  I contacted them directly and gave me a lame excuse of why their ACV looks watered down and they tried to say it was a different type of apple.  Not only was it watered down but there was no mother floating around either.  I did not believe them.  This bottle I purchased was fine but I&#x27;ve been noticing that there has been less mother floating around.  Be careful.  It should be the color that is shown in the picture and there should be quite a bit of mother floating around.  If they are getting low, then I am glad that they are limiting the customer to two because I do not want them watering it down with no mother, otherwise it&#x27;s useless.</li>
    <li> I like this bragg apple cider vinegar but the lid was cracked when I opened the plastic that was wrapped around the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love Braggs but it was the last time I ordered it online as it can be bought from Wholefoods for 4.99 $</li>
    <li> WIFE LOVED IT....PLANS TO PURCHASE MANY MORE...AAAAA+++</li>
    <li> This stuff works great</li>
    <li> WAY TO EXPENSIVE..U CAN GET THIS MUCH CHEAPER,,LIKE 4 TO 5 DOLLARS</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s great for PH balancing, weight loss and lowering blood pressure. This is really hard to find in stores, when I do find it I grab a couple of bottles. A 32oz bottle cost around $5.98 at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for my parents, both of whom have issues with diabetes.&lt;br /&gt;My mom says it makes a huge difference for her. She feels an increase in energy and is even sleeping better. She&#x27;s also losing weight and her pre-diabetes is perfectly under control.&lt;br /&gt;My dad has also noticed a huge difference. He checks his blood sugar first thing in the morning and it&#x27;s usually around 180. Now, after starting ACV, it&#x27;s routinely in around 100 and his doctor is talking about taking him off of some of his diabetes medication. It really works. Try it!</li>
    <li> great product,everyone should keep this in their home.</li>
    <li> this stuff, as a facial toner, has improved my skin soooo much. I will always have this product in my house for every. This large glass bottle was packaged nicely also, thank you to the seller.</li>
    <li> Braggs is by far the best Apple Cider Vinegar on the market.  Always fresh and has that milky dark color that the store bought brands don&#x27;t seem to have.</li>
    <li> Great product, will buy more.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item and will recommend to friends and family</li>
    <li> I could not recommend Apple Cider Vinegar any higher, and Bragg&#x27;s is the original!! It has changed my life like nothing else. Re-reading my previous apple cider reviews today, it makes me want to get back to taking the stuff regularly, every day. In truth, I haven&#x27;t been doing that. However, it has been displayed on my kitchen counter, next to the coffee pot, for five years without exception. I take it about half as often as I would like to, but I still take it several times a week. I ALWAYS remember it, first thing, when my allergies start to creep up, or if there is a nasty virus making the rounds at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first sign of a sore throat, I begin to gargle with ACV (2 teaspoons in a 1/2 cup of water), and it goes away, within hours. It stops any further symptoms, right in their tracks! The key is to hit this bottle right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, If I start to sniffle or sneeze a bit, I get back to having 2 tablespoons per day, with plenty of water, and I feel perfectly healthy again in no time. If I could remember to do it every single day, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever get that sniffle to begin with! So for immunity and allergies... this stuff has positively changed my life, just as I&#x27;ve heard about from so many other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it still tastes and smells pretty bad, but you are done with all of that in less than 20 seconds. Are you really such a wimp that you can&#x27;t handle something uncomfortable for as little as 20 seconds, when the results are so obvious?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, I love how ACV was able to get rid of the warts I&#x27;ve had on the back of my hands and fingers for years, permanently, in no time at all. All I did was scratch the wart up a bit with a clean sewing needle, then soak a small piece of cotton (perhaps torn from a q-tip) in the ACV, place that on top of the wart, and secure it snugly with a band-aid. Then, for two days, I would re-soak that piece of cotton, replace the band-aid if necessary, and the wart would almost certainly be gone within 48 hours. But me being me, I usually continue to do it for an extra day just to be sure. From my experience, and from a few others whom I&#x27;ve convinced to try this, it works every time. Sometimes a second go is necessary, and I just scratch a little deeper with the pin this time, and that does the trick. This doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! You are simply scratching the wart&#x27;s thick outer layer so that the ACV can seep down into the root. Then it dies- good riddance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I love and swear by the ACV still. A little research online will turn up dozens and dozens of other useful tricks to try apple cider vinegar on. But just for the three uses I listed alone, I will always keep a bottle on hand. One tip is that everyone says to only buy it if it includes the “mother.” This just means it is unfiltered. In comparison, ACV with the mother will look cloudier, and will need to be shaken before use. Supposedly, this means it is chock full of more nutrients and potency. I don&#x27;t know if that is true or not, but I&#x27;ve always opted for it just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of my old apple cider vinegar reviews, a commenter accused me of saying all this just to sell bottles of Apple Cider Vinegar, but I am certainly not! This stuff is cheap! There are MANY brands that are just fine, so long as they are raw and have that “mother&amp;#34; in it. I have used 5 different brands over the past 2 years and have noticed no difference one way or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what do you have to lose? My attendance at work has never been better in my entire life. I am now using my sick days for “personal” days off instead, or else I get a check at the end of the year because I simply didn&#x27;t need to use them. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!
