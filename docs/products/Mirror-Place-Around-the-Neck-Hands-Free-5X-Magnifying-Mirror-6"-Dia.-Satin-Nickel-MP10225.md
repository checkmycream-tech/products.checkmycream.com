<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The mirror part is way too heavy and keeps falling. I had to send it back and pay for shipping again!</li>
    <li> Good quality and size.  Easy to use. Makes hair styling so much easier and better.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a mirror to replace one like it my mother had, however the weight of this is too much for a mirror to go around the neck. I am also concerned that the lever that tightens it will wear soon. A little extra pressure is needed to keep the mirror from falling down. I will still give it a four star because it is very convenient to have one to see the back of your head.</li>
    <li> Perfect!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using these for years; my last one broke.  This was exactly what I needed.  I don&#x27;t know why most people don&#x27;t know about them.  How can they do the back of their hair without one?</li>
    <li> works well but a little heavy</li>
    <li> BOught for my mom and she loves it.  High quality product.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to the fact that I started bleaching my roots and needed something to help me see the back of my hair. This fit the bill but it is a little heavy so I have to keep readjusting it. I now have my daughter helping me. lol. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve ever used it for so I can&#x27;t say as to whether or not it&#x27;s good for applying makeup but it does have the 5X side for seeing your face magnified and I would think this would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Great size and quality.  You can use as a hand mirror as well as a standing mirror.  I expect it will last for many years.</li>
    <li> It is what I was looking for.  It is a bit hard to get it to stay in place when using.  It wants to tilt to the side.&lt;br /&gt;One of the comments I read before purchase indicated the same problem.  Placing a towel under the metal chest piece.&lt;br /&gt;I will try that and make it work.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Very uncomfortable. I think the cheaper plastic ones would be better</li>
    <li> &#x27;Mirror Place Around the Neck Hands Free 5X Magnifying Mirror, 6&amp;#34; Dia., Satin...&#x27; meet your expectations? &#x27; meet your expectations</li>
    <li> Great looking, heavy duty and well made. This is a great neck mirror. Easily adjustable with clean looks. While the price is higher than some the quality makes it worth it.</li>
    <li> Mirror was much too heavy and too hard to keep steady on my neck. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product works well. I can now use both of my hands to comb and style my hair on the back of my head.  I look forward to using it to trim my own hair when it needs it.  I would have liked a larger mirror but overall I am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> It was to heavy around the neck and hard to see the back of my hair.  I was very disappointed and I would not recommend this product.  It was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured. Person I bought it for is thrilled. Just what she wanted replaced her broken one she had had for years</li>
    <li> Only complaint is that the screw used for tightening and loosening it does not hold firmly.  Otherwise is very useful.</li>
    <li> The mirror works perfectly for fixing the back of your head, hands free.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downfall is the weight.  Although I was able to get used to it, I would prefer something that weighs less. The mirror gives a perfectly clear image.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these for 15 years and this is my second one. I love the way it allows for me to see all angles of my hair to cut, color and style it. I have recommended it to others and will again. This brand had great service and great quality of mirror. Great seller that you can trust.</li>
    <li> Had an inexpensive &amp;#34;around the neck&amp;#34; mirror that finally broke and I&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  I reviewed all of the mirrors online and&lt;br /&gt;this one seemed so well made that I decided on it.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;It is beautifully made and can be angled easily.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy but I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;gotten used to it and I&#x27;m a senior.  If it&#x27;s too heavy on your chest you can&lt;br /&gt;place a hand towel under it and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Mirror is very well balanced and very stable when in use.!</li>
    <li> This is great for traveling</li>
    <li> Way too, heavy to put around my neck</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would work to see the back of my hair so I could have two hands free; but it is  a little heavy and hard to adjust just to see the back.  In theory, it&#x27;s a great idea and I guess a little practice is called for in using it effectively.  I am not sorry I ordered it because it does help and with a little practice, surely I will get better at adjusting it!</li>
    <li> A very helpful mirror. It is so much better made that the one I use to have years ago.</li>
    <li> I can see all around the back of my head from around my neck.  Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> This mirror is exactly what I needed! Easy on the neck and big enough to see well.</li>
    <li> Now my cowlick is always in check! Might even be able to trim up my own hair from time to time.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and hard to control , and it shows my scalp.  I can see to fix it better.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks, Wanda Clinton</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROW IS TOO HEAVY AND IS STARTING TO NOT STAY IN PLACE WISH I HAD BOUGHT THE CHEAPER ONE-PROBABLY WOULDN&#x27;T HAVE BEEN AS HEAVY AS THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> I have used this type for the price of mirror for years to fix my hair. It&#x27;s hard to find this type any more. It appeared to be the most sturdy. After receiving it, it proved to be what we expected. I expect to use it for many years. I might just buy another because this type  was so hard to find. The company selling it through Amazon was great shipping quickly and customer service. Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy this.</li>
    <li> I have looked in several stores, beauty supply, etc.  Wasn&#x27;t able to find one anywhere.  The one I had was worn out and I was very happy to have found another one!!</li>
    <li> I do my own color &amp; perms.  I&#x27;ve had another neck mirror for many years.  I tried to replace it many times but got junk.this one is great!</li>
    <li> This mirror is wonderful.  I am now able to see the back of my head while using the hair dryer and the brush for styling.  The frame is sturdy and stays at the angle you set it at.  The mirror clarity is excellent as well.  I had bought a cheaper version with a plastic frame, and it broke the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality. Fast shipping! dt</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to see the back of my hair. I can do my hair hands free of holding a mirror. This is good quality and works great.</li>
    <li> I took off one star because there is no way to tighten up the connection between the mirror itself and the rod that it stands up on.  Although the ball joint has not completely failed, it is getting fairly loose after a couple of months of use. Also, I wish one side of the mirror was 10x, but I fixed that by putting a small 10x mirror with suction cups on it and that solves that problem.  It does make the mirror heavier with the added 10x mirror, though.</li>
    <li> THE ONE THING THAT IS BAD ABOUT THIS MIRROR IT IS TO HEAVY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WISH THEY MADE IT A LITTLE LIGHTER.  IF I COULD FINE THE SAME SIZE I WOULD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET IT IF IT WAS NOT AS HEAVY.</li>
    <li> Really does the trick, it tilts to whatever angle you need, makes it easy to work on the back of head.</li>
    <li> Its great.  My mother used one like this and I also have for years.  Been through a few of them.  This is one of the better ones.  My husband was getting tired of fixing my old one.  Think I will order one for my daughter and grand daughter.  My last one only magnified 3X.  Five X seemed like a lot but I like it.</li>
    <li> Had to use around the neck, too heavy</li>
    <li> this is a great mirror - easily goes around your neck and is easy to adjust - it is a bit pricey but it works</li>
    <li> I have used a plastic mirror like this one for years. Saw this one and decided to take the plunge and spend the money for a sturdier one. I am really glad I did. I can see the back of my head easier, the mirror rotates as well as moving up and down and I don&#x27;t feel like I am going to break it.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim the back of my hair and it works great. I have recommended this to a friend</li>
    <li> Mirror did not meet expectations.  It was too heavy, handle was too long and it does not stand well.  I bought mirror to provide hands free view when grooming the back of my hair.  It was not helpful because of weight and length of handle.  I had a light plastic one before that worked really well.  Ones advertised on this sight had mirror too small.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other customer reviews.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just me but I found that the tightening screw did not stay tight and the thing flopped down upon my chest rendering it useless for viewing the back of my head.  Back into the box it went and most likely will stay.</li>
    <li> as if it was something grand but is just ok, not overly exciting as I coulda got one elsewhere for less, price was way too much for such a mirror,,,</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  I have had a mirror very similar to this one for many years and use it on a daily basis. It&#x27;s perfect for styling &amp; trimming the back of my hair since it truly leaves both hands available for getting the job done.  I needed a second one for travel and have been looking for years, to no avail, until I found this one on Amazon.  It is a very good quality and priced very well compared to what I paid for my original mirror at least 15-20 years ago.  The only slight negative is the weight which is the result of the mirror being approximately ¾ inch larger in diameter than my original.  The mirror size is convenient but, personally, I would sacrifice the size to reduce the weight a bit.  Having said that, I am still thrilled to have finally found this mirror, I purchased two so that I would have a spare.</li>
    <li> I need a mirror for use with coloring hair.  This mirror is the first one I have found that really works for me.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror!  It is an engineering masterpiece.  I use it daily to check the back of my hair.  It works perfectly for hanging around my neck and cutting the back of my hair.  It will last a lifetime...very heavy duty.</li>
    <li> I like this mirror but the neck piece is very stiff and difficult to lower and raise.</li>
    <li> Mirror is well constructed, and it is easy to use hands free.  I plan on ordering one for my daughter.  I do plan on using a small 10x mirror that will give more magnification,  and it will easily stick to the 5x side.</li>
    <li> The idea is GREAT and years ago I had one that worked.  This one tips to one side, still not allowing me to see the back of my head and what I am doing with my hair.  There needs to be some type of bar attached to keep it from tipping from side to side.  I would have sent it back but recycled the original packaging!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the mirror.  I have used this type of mirror for 50 plus years and I have been looking for a replacement for my old one, so this one worked out fine.</li>
    <li> Very substantial. The mirror angle is adjustable and stays where you put it. Worth the extra cost.</li>
    <li> Works fine, just a little heavy.</li>
    <li> This mirror is by far the best there is.  My first one lasted nearly 20 years.  Ones with plastic around the neck are worthless.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with mirror.  It is larger than the one I had.  I do wish it would slant more to the sides.  But thank you.  My hands tremor so I need to have it around the neck for stability.</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and the mirror broke off the handle.  It was a different brand.  I love these mirrors because it gives you the availability of using both of your hands.  I would definitely buy one again.</li>
    <li> The mirror was just what we were looking for.</li>
    <li> Person it was purchased for, loved it!</li>
    <li> I like this size mirror better. Bought a smaller one made of plastic. Didn&#x27;t like it . Thecmirrorcwas too small. The round the neck piece kept getting  lose and the mirror would slip. This one is metal and stays in place.</li>
    <li> I am planning to return them for credit.</li>
    <li> Works fairly good.....made well.</li>
    <li> My mother has used one of these style mirrors for styling her hair for as long as I can remember.  The most recent was at the end of it&#x27;s life and I found the perfect replacement at Amazon.  This mirror is sturdy and well built, not too heavy, but heavy enough to hold up for daily usage.  She&#x27;s delighted to have found a new mirror and I was most pleased with the sellers quick delivery and packaging.</li>
    <li> excellect..just as pictured, holds the position good, doesn&#x27;t move around on the neck, good weight, magnifier is great, would order again</li>
    <li> Great ,just like the old one.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with mirror but doesn&#x27;t work near as well  or as easily as I had hoped. I wouldn&#x27;t buy one again!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews on this and had been looking for a hands free mirror.  Mainly to use when I am using my flat iron.  I think its a bit tricky to use as it doesn&#x27;t have much flexibility from side to side.  Sometimes it seems to work great and other times I just get frustrated with it.  It is well made.</li>
    <li> Actual mirror surface is generous size.  Length from base to mirror allows for full view of back of head with very little adjustment.  Price was right.  Delivery swift.</li>
    <li> This mirror is just what I needed. It seems to be built to last. I received it much quicker than it was promised.</li>
    <li> Wife ordered for morning make-up applications and hair cutting.  She says it is precisely what was desired and very useful.</li>
    <li> I have used this mirror before, but the beauty supply shop I frequent no lonmger carries it.  Glad to have located it.</li>
    <li> After fighting plastic neck mirrors and replacing them every six month because they broke, I love this mirror.  It is way more sturdy and has a miuch larger viewing surface.</li>
    <li> We travel a lot and my wife has a terrible time with the mirror arrangements in hotels because she can&#x27;t see the back of her head when doing her hair. She has had several of this type mirror over the years but this one is so much better built and folds absolutely flat to ship in her suitcase. Every one of her prior ones have broken, bent or rusted to the point of being unusable but this one is far better built and completely made of stainless steel. It is Easily worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing product. Overpriced and heavy. Fit poorly around the neck. I returned the product the day after I received it</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my Mother to replace one that had finally worn out after twenty years of use. While $40, seemed a bit pricey, it certainly is made better than all the others I looked at, and seems the nickel construction could potentially last for another twenty years. The 5x magnification and adjustability was superior to other options. My only concern is the weight of the mirror at 17 ounces (per other reviewer) - if worn too long may cause discomfort to neck. Otherwise, very pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m having surgery on my shoulder in a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m trying to get organized with the things I know I&#x27;ll be needing.  I do know that I won&#x27;t be able to &#x27;hold&#x27; a mirror with one hand and a comb with the other while combing the back of my hair.  I&#x27;ve been practicing with using the neck mirror and it will be like my right arm.</li>
    <li> This mirror was bought solely for the convenience of doing the back of my hair. Once positioned, because the support bar has such a short base, it wobbles. A slight design change of having a flat longer base that rests against the chest would alleviate the wobble, and reduce the weight pressure on the chest by the weight being distributed over a larger area. Presently to reduce the hard weight on the chest, I fold a wash cloth, and prop it under the bar.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Mom, who had a similar one for many years that finally broke, and said she was unable to find another one. She was thrilled! It&#x27;s held up nicely since I bought it.</li>
    <li> And this was a big help. Saving money too. Helpful in carefully arranging the back of my hair as well. So a big thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect, except for a couple of things. The mirror head swivels a little too freely so that it shifts every time it gets moved in the slightest. And there is a bit of distortion in the regular mirror side that takes some getting used to. But overall, a very good product that should last for years.</li>
    <li> Stays in the right place while I put of makeup, pluck my eyebrows or whatever. Boo likes to use it too.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.  This is a replacement of one I had worn out.  It is a bit heavy so could have used the 5&amp;#34; but am very happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Wanting to return because it is VERY heavy and cumbersome but seller after being contacted would not pay for return postage. I already paid to get product. It is heavy around the neck and not stable. The front breast piece is small and does not stay in place well.Using a hand held mirror and putting it down after finding place on back of head I want to blow dry works just as well and only a bit slower.</li>
    <li> they are working very well she had just broke her last mirror and that was the only place we found them</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair, so a mirror to hang around my neck is essential. This is a nicely made mirror with true reflection. It arrived w/i the specified time frame and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I chose this mirror for the recommendations by Amazon. I&#x27;ve been looking for sometime to replace the one I had, which was falling apart and it was several years old.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this product and it should last much longer than the previous one.&lt;br /&gt;It enables me to see what I&#x27;m doing when drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even it was higher than other mirrors on the site it is made very well,. I highly recommend this mirror.</li>
    <li> I really, really love it.  Had one before like it.  Highly recommend it to anyone.  It&#x27;s like an extra hand.</li>
    <li> After a disappointing trial of the plastic version of this mirror, I ordered this one.  I love it!  It is fairly rugged and is exactly what I needed.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;v used this type of neck mirror for over 50 years to do my hair and see what the back looks like. when I was a little girl I saw my mother used this mirror. she died at 92 yrs. can&#x27;t speak highly enough of it</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. All the other ones I have had have been plastic and they break quite easily. this one is comfortable around the neck and the mirror is very clear to look into...Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This mirror is high quality. You do need to be aware that it is rather heavy, and it helps to put a soft face towel, etc, around your neck, and/or where the mirror connect to the handle. If you&#x27;ve ever used a mirror like this, you expect that. The weight of the mirror does pull it down after a few minutes. If you want a light weight one that doesn&#x27;t do that , then this is not the one for you.... but those don&#x27;t usually swivel, so you can&#x27;t get it all, folks.</li>
    <li> mirror  seems to be a good quality, and the neck frame is a nice quality. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; it came quickly</li>
    <li> Good quality product.  Cost a little more but worth it.</li>
    <li> The only problem I have with this mirror is that you can&#x27;t tighten the crank by hand tight enough to keep the mirror in one position.  I would be working on my hair and the next think I know the mirror would fall back and then go flat against my stomach.  It was very annoying and I had to do it repeatedly.  It bad enough that I don&#x27;t want to use the mirror anymore.  I guess I should return it.</li>
    <li> You met a great need for me with this product.  I had shopped all over and wasn&#x27;t able to find this type of mirror for hands free use until going on your web site.  As usual, you came through again in over the top style.</li>
    <li> great mirror , good quality, love it.  A necessity for doing the back of my hair.</li>
    <li> Mirror to heavy! Will not stay in place.  I may as well use a hand mirror, which is a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> I had an issue with the first mirror not working properly so I had to pay shipping to return it.  Mirrow Place promptly sent me another one that does work but the mirror for the normal or regular side is distorted and is hard to see my hair at a distance.  Not going to send back and pay more shipping charges!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never used one before, and I haven&#x27;t used it much to date, so my review is as a newbie to this product.  The neck ring feels a bit ill-fitting, as does the part resting on your chest.  My first thought was that the chest &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; part should be a larger plate to steady it.  Otherwise, I think it is very sturdy and well made.  I only decided to pay the price for this item after reading other reviews stating cheaper models were inadequate.  So, I definitely think that practice with the mirror is needed if your are new to it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  I previously ordered a plastic one that fell apart the next week!  This one is very sturdy and easy to manipulate.</li>
    <li> The mirror and frame are so heavy, you can&#x27;t keep it one place. Also it doesn&#x27;t keep the mirror in one place, because you can&#x27;t tighten it tight to keep the mirror from going down towards your feet.</li>
    <li> I am 83yrs. young......and this mirror is not to heavy for me......The mirror it&#x27;self moves  back and forth in four direction.......the last one I ordered did not do this.......I think it is wonderful.......Lorraine.....</li>
    <li> Takes some playing around to get it so you can see the back of your hair</li>
    <li> Can I tell you how long I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these types of mirrors....years!  I&#x27;ve not ever seen them in any retail stores and when I&#x27;ve described to a clerk what I was looking for, I got nothing back but strange looks.  So I figured I was out of luck. Then one day I happened to search for an &amp;#34;around the neck mirror&amp;#34; and bam! I struck gold. So happy to have found what I&#x27;ve been looking for. This fits my needs perfectly, great product and, received it quickly and unbroken.</li>
    <li> comes undone too easily. comfort and use are fine.</li>
    <li> Very well built mirror. Serves its purpose but is a little heavy, which is why I did not give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great for hands-free plucking.</li>
    <li> Good quality mirror, works well ... when I tire of looking at my face, seeing the back of my head is easy to do ... now, if I could simply control the scissors better and improve my haircutting skills!!!</li>
    <li> Product size is exactly as stated and function is exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> Hevy for hanging around neck and the screw to tighten needs to be a wing nut, with more thighening than this one.  Over all, work to see what you wnat - back of your head/hair.</li>
    <li> Hard to keep in place. Wish I would have sent it back. Definitely not worth the money!!</li>
    <li> It is meeting my wife&#x27;s needs.</li>
    <li> Was a gift, she loved it!!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed!!</li>
    <li> NECK HANDS FREE 5X MAGNIFYING MIRROR. 6&amp;#34; DIA.&lt;br /&gt;THE MIRROR IS TOO HEAVY FOR MY WIFE; OTHERWISE IT IS OKAY.  IF I ORDER ANOTHER ONE, IT WILL NEED TO BE LIGHTER WEIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;  BILL J. COOK</li>
    <li> Very hard to find&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day to put on makeup and do hair</li>
</ol>
