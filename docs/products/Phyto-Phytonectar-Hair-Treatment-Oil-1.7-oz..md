      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems shampooing it out, but I wasn&#x27;t really that impressed with the results.  </li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it leaves my fine hair with AMAZING body, shine, everything!  </li>
      <li>This goes on like an oil, you leave it a while, shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s top ingredient is corn oil, and the ingredients really aren&#x27;t that impressive to me.  </li>

      <li>This oil treatment is fragrant, easy to apply, and revitalizes the hair noticeably after one use.  </li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t do anything good to my hair.</li>
      <li>The Phyto oil treatment arrived quickly and I was glad of that as the sample had been used up.</li>
      <li>The package was delivered in fantastic condition too.</li>
      <li>It is a fabulous hydrating product for my color enhanced hair.  </li>
      <li>Just started using but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>This oil is nothing special.</li>
      <li>The invesment is so worth it, as they say \\&quot;You should never be cheap</li>
      <li>I had tried a sample of this product before ordering a full supply.  </li>
      <li>It still worked fine, just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as manageable and weightless as the first time I purchased.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;most women get highlights way too often\\&quot;, says Wallace, Who sends new clients who have overprocessed hair home with Phyto Phytonectar Oil.  </li>
      <li>and it keeps my ends very moisturized, looking healthy and very shiny!</li>
      <li>Works pretty well, but could have arrived a bit faster!</li>
      <li>This product seems to be one of the best out there for restoring dry hair back to</li>
      <li>but it is worth it.</li>
      <li>It is worth the $30.</li>
      <li>It has helped my FRIED ends look normal, healthy and pure shine</li>
      <li>and I was spending more money buying cheap products that never had the same results and never lasted as much!</li>
      <li>My hair was left shiny and it felt hydrated, but I&#x27;ve had more success with argan oil AFTER it was washed.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for the last few months and it is absolutely amazing!!!</li>
      <li>This is ok, but it didn&#x27;t have any particular wow factor for me.</li>
      <li>It smells wonderful on the hair and just a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>about 3 days after I used this product for the first time and even my hair stylist noticed the difference.</li>
      <li>The result was amazingly soft tangle free hair.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>I have tried hot oil treatments, leaving conditioner over night, high end salon products &amp; so on.....  </li>
      <li>this precious little jewel has made me fall in love in such a way,,,I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years, excellent treatment with out being too heavy.</li>
      <li>THANKS DAUGHTER</li>
      <li>One time use made my hair very shinning.</li>
      <li>However, since this is very pricey, I cut it with olive oil 1:1.</li>
      <li>are much, much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have very think fine hair that I have to use flat iron &amp; curling irons to style.  </li>
      <li>Smells nice but not a strong smell.</li>
      <li>I can really tell a difference in my long, fine hair after using this.</li>
      <li>I was a little apprehensive about its authenticity, and now I am even more unsure because it made my hair look even more dry and frizzy.</li>
      <li>I wanted to see if my hair was going to be soft for days first.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to love this product, but I give this product 2 thumbs down.</li>
      <li>It really keeps it soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend - period.</li>
      <li>A very small amount left in hair is great.</li>
      <li>Unlike other oil treatment , it is easy to wash it away .   </li>
      <li>This amazing nectar, is derived from 12% egg yolk oil, therefore the essence of the vitamin-filled yolk is fed into the famished/malnourished hair...resulting in unbelievably baby soft, glassy shiny locks.</li>
      <li>This product did not do what it claimed to do, and I normally like Phyto products.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal state.</li>
      <li>I ONLY WISH THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT OUR LOCAL STORES.  </li>
      <li>This product is no less than a miracle!  </li>
      <li>It left my hair very shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>No oiliness, not a hint of grease just soft luminous hair..</li>
      <li>After just 1 use, I have received unexpected results.</li>
      <li>I have long rough hair that tangle easily.</li>
      <li>I get high lights &amp; sometimes low.</li>
      <li>and it really helps with the &#x27;dry&#x27; hair syndrome from coloring and chemical processing,</li>
      <li>My hair was soft the entire vacation.</li>
      <li>I find that any natural oil, jojoba, castor, grapeseed, extra virgin olive oil, vitamin e oil, etc.  </li>
      <li>Several reviewers claim cheaper essential oils have by far outdone this, they say try olive oil, grapeseed oil, but from personal experience I can claim that can&#x27;t be further from the truth.</li>
      <li>My hair is dark blonde, with crown only highlights, wavy-curly, always frizzy (mostly from the very few times</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t typically write reviews (very time</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works pretty well, but could have arrived a bit faster! No complaints on the product just the shipping!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this by the salon on a Princess Cruise last year and have been using it ever since.  I use it once ever two - three weeks and it really helps with the &#x27;dry&#x27; hair syndrome from coloring and chemical processing,</li>
    <li> My hair is in a terrible condition , dry and dull . I used it once in a week , my hair got better . Unlike other oil treatment , it is easy to wash it away .   I recommend it as a routine to keep your hair shiny and healthy .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for the last few months and it is absolutely amazing!!!.. It leaves my hair super soft. It is worth the $30.</li>
    <li> From the April issue of Elle (page 200-Adrian Wallace section):   \\&quot;most women get highlights way too often\\&quot;, says Wallace, Who sends new clients who have overprocessed hair home with Phyto Phytonectar Oil.  \\&quot;I tell them to use it overnight for a few weeks.  By the time they come in, you can see and feel the difference.\\&quot;    Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> So I waited to use this at least a couple times before writing my review. I have used it 4 times total, and last night I even slept in it overnight. This product did not do what it claimed to do, and I normally like Phyto products. I was a little apprehensive about its authenticity, and now I am even more unsure because it made my hair look even more dry and frizzy. I wanted to love this product, but I give this product 2 thumbs down. Will not purchase ever again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! It has helped my FRIED ends look normal, healthy and pure shine and it takes its 20 minutes</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my pre showers. However, since this is very pricey, I cut it with olive oil 1:1. Still works well to moisturize my dry hair, but lasts longer.</li>
    <li> For a Hair Treatment, it can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve used for years and love it.  The local beauty store went out of business and that is where I used to buy this product.  Found on Amazon and it cost less.  I highly recommend - period.</li>
    <li> Use it one and I am in love.  My hair was so well conditioned after shampooing that I now cannot imagine my hair care routine without this.  Buying a backup tonight.  The package was delivered in fantastic condition too.</li>
    <li> Have dyed hair and always dry looking and unmanagable.  Used half hour before my shampoo and saw difference immediately. Daughter suggested product to me.  THANKS DAUGHTER</li>
    <li> LOVE ALL PHYTO PRODUCTS I ONLY WISH THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT OUR LOCAL STORES.  THIS OIL IS VERY REACH AND THICK. IT IS WONDERFUL FOR DRY HAIR TREATMENTS.  NOT LIGHT VERY THICK STICKY.  I AM HOOKED ON USING PHYTO PRODUCTS THE VERY BEST FOR ME AND MY DAUGHTER.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Can use 10 en 1 conditioner and get same if not better results as a pre conditioner . Plus it less expensive</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have long hair, a little wavy and my ends are quite healthy. I use it once every month and it keeps my ends very moisturized, looking healthy and very shiny! Love it! I have been buying Phyto products for the past 4 years and I will continue to buy them. They are expensive but they last a long time and I was spending more money buying cheap products that never had the same results and never lasted as much!</li>
    <li> I have long rough hair that tangle easily. I applied it from roots to tips, left it overnight with shower cap on, and washed my hair in the morning. The result was amazingly soft tangle free hair. No oiliness, not a hint of grease just soft luminous hair..I will continue applying it once a week. I wish I found this long ago..</li>
    <li> im sorry I didn&#x27;t like it,  it leave my hair so hard that I couldn&#x27;t even comb it</li>
    <li> I had tried a sample of this product before ordering a full supply.  This oil treatment is fragrant, easy to apply, and revitalizes the hair noticeably after one use.  It is now part of my regular hair care routine. The Phyto oil treatment arrived quickly and I was glad of that as the sample had been used up.</li>
    <li> I can really tell a difference in my long, fine hair after using this. It really keeps it soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my type of hair, but I&#x27;m not impressed. My hair is dark blonde, with crown only highlights, wavy-curly, always frizzy (mostly from the very few times I had a blowout) and although my strands aren&#x27;t thick, I have allot of individual strands giving me allot of hair. I just didn&#x27;t see my hair any more conditioned or frizz-free than the Hair One cleansing shampoo-conditioner I&#x27;ve always used. Now I use it as a dry hair oil on my ends only for 2nd and 3rd day hair. It works ok to keep the ends from frizzing. Smells nice but not a strong smell. Frankly, my olive oil in winter &amp; coconut oil in summer work  better.</li>
    <li> One of the two bottles, on both of the last two orders, contained very poor substance, and I should&#x27;ve complained to the supplier.  I think this product has been discontinued except online.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and this product had helped with winter dryness. I use it in combination the Universal Elixir about once a week.</li>
    <li> I went to get my regular haircut about 3 days after I used this product for the first time and even my hair stylist noticed the difference. It left my hair very shinny and soft. I try to use it once a week, leave it about 20 min while I do some work out and then shower. It is obvioulsy oily so you have to wash your hair at least twice to remove it all but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I was on vaction with family on cruise. I have blonde long natural curly hair. I get high lights &amp; sometimes low. My hair felt like straw. I took some time on vacation to try this tratment they had for dry hair. It was great! My hair was soft the entire vacation. I have tried hot oil treatments, leaving conditioner over night, high end salon products &amp; so on.....  Im back to order some for my self. The cruise wanted to sell it to me. I did not buy it. I wanted to see if my hair was going to be soft for days first.  It was also $30.00. It worked &amp; now I want my bottle.</li>
    <li> This goes on like an oil, you leave it a while, shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s top ingredient is corn oil, and the ingredients really aren&#x27;t that impressive to me.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems shampooing it out, but I wasn&#x27;t really that impressed with the results.  My hair was left shiny and it felt hydrated, but I&#x27;ve had more success with argan oil AFTER it was washed.  After the 2nd night I used it, my hair looked a bit oily after it dried.  It seemed to drag some of the wave out of my hair, though I let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with argan oil after shampoo.  This is ok, but it didn&#x27;t have any particular wow factor for me.</li>
    <li> This amazing nectar, is derived from 12% egg yolk oil, therefore the essence of the vitamin-filled yolk is fed into the famished/malnourished hair...resulting in unbelievably baby soft, glassy shiny locks. I don&#x27;t typically write reviews (very time consuming)but this precious little jewel has made me fall in love in such a way,,,I just had to let the world know about it&#x27;s awesomeness!! After just 1 use, I have received unexpected results. Several reviewers claim cheaper essential oils have by far outdone this, they say try olive oil, grapeseed oil, but from personal experience I can claim that can&#x27;t be further from the truth. They possibly used a fake product, and/or didn&#x27;t use it properly. It&#x27;s advisable to use this nectar oil with other phyto products, incl. Phytonectar shampoo. The invesment is so worth it, as they say \\&quot;You should never be cheap w/your hair\\&quot;. The hair is the most important aspect on a woman, 1st thing people notice!Try this jem, you won&#x27;t be sorry...:)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it didn&#x27;t do anything good to my hair. As a matter of fact, my hair felt worse after using this. It was difficult to wash out of my hair &amp; I regret even trying it.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap drug store products work better than this.</li>
    <li> This product seems to be one of the best out there for restoring dry hair back to it&#x27;s normal state. I will say, though, that I have purchased phyto oil on Amazon twice and the last time it seemed as though the formula/ consistency was a little different than the previous bottle I had bought. It still worked fine, just didn&#x27;t leave my hair as manageable and weightless as the first time I purchased. Great product though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this product for a few years, excellent treatment with out being too heavy. A very small amount left in hair is great.</li>
    <li> This oil is nothing special. It lubricates the hair and workds as an oil conditioner.  I find that any natural oil, jojoba, castor, grapeseed, extra virgin olive oil, vitamin e oil, etc.  witll temporairly condition the hair.  All of the oils  I have mentioned  are much, much cheaper.</li>
    <li> Phytonectar is the best for severely damaged hair....but use as intended.  It is a preshampoo oil that is best left on overnight.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in years past, but could no longer find it where I live.  It is a fabulous hydrating product for my color enhanced hair.  Give great shine..</li>
    <li> I have very think fine hair that I have to use flat iron &amp; curling irons to style.  This product has given my hair body and repaired the damaged ends.  I love it</li>
    <li> I love this wonderfully moisturizing pre-shampoo treatment. The smell wasn&#x27;t pungent, but I wouldn&#x27;t go out partying with the scent in my hair. It angers me that it has been discontinued!</li>
    <li> I rely heavily on Amazon reviews and this product had terrific feedback so I thought I&#x27;d try it, as a cheaper alternative to salon conditioning treatments.  LET ME TELL YOU!!!! This product is no less than a miracle!  I thoroughly saturate my hair and then sleep in it overnight, then wash the next day.  Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it leaves my fine hair with AMAZING body, shine, everything!  I will be using this product as long as they make it!</li>
    <li> Nice stuff! It smells wonderful on the hair and just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Just started using but so far so good.  One time use made my hair very shinning.</li>
    <li> It hasn&#x27;t lived up to my expectations. Not worth the price. I can get cheaper products that do a better job.</li>
    <li> this is a great product to use on your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
</ol>
