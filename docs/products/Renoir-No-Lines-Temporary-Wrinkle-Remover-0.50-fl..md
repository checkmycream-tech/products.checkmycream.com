### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>as recommended &#x27;for best results&#x27;..</li>
      <li>This worked wonderfully well as a temporary fix, and&lt;br /&gt;did perform as advertised.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product when skin is correctly prepped (see my review on Aminogenesis).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does the best job of minimizing eye bags.  </li>
      <li>Renoir No Lines is the BEST product I have found that temporarily hides the puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It is a wonderful product and will be buying it again and again.  </li>
      <li>It shrinks them up and takes a good 10 years off!  </li>
      <li>Works great just as the title implies..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s wonderful...</li>
      <li>I have more consistently successful applications with Aminogenesis, although the Renior product lasts longer as the day wears on.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
      <li>Would love a product that you can mix with makeup!</li>
      <li>Works well after you work with  it for a while and learn your own application technique.</li>
      <li>Gave one bottle to my hairdresser who liked the results I was getting.</li>
      <li>When I take it of, it kind of scratches the skin a bit.</li>
      <li>It stays effective until you wash it off at the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, which is good.  </li>
      <li>Best product so far.  </li>
      <li>I like this product when used without makeup - it does smooth forehead lines temporarily, but doesn&#x27;t look good when makeup is applied.  </li>
      <li>I find it works best on bare skin( no foundation etc.)</li>
      <li>I always make sure I order 3 or 4</li>
      <li>I use this all the time and am so glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Much better prices than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>It works better than you think</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would temporarily decrease my wrinkles for a wedding, but I didn&#x27;t really think it would be that great for $10.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this .  </li>
      <li>I was able to salvage some of it to try it out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a temporary way to enhance your complexion to look more relaxed.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not terrible.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my palm and my palm lines disappear love it.</li>
      <li>The instructions clearly say NOT to apply on top of moisturizer before foundation, so for best results, apply on clean face or after applying foundation.  </li>
      <li>The first time i used it, i used it AFTER a good face wash, used it sparingly and evenly covered a semi-large area, (and with a Q-Tip)..</li>
      <li>Less is more with this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>So take it easy</li>
      <li>I have fine lines on my forehead and</li>
      <li>less is best</li>
      <li>It works best on clean skin rather than applying it over other skin care products.  </li>
      <li>Spoke to the rep at CSI who made the original product,\\&quot;My Lines Are Concealed\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Its ok it doesn&#x27;t work miracle but work really good on fine lines not so much for the deep ones</li>
      <li>Your face WILL look like that if you apply to the whole face but you won&#x27;t be able to move anything.</li>
      <li>Quick ship</li>
      <li>&gt; Dries quickly by itself,  </li>
      <li>more wrinklier and older.  </li>
      <li>I love this one it really works good, unlike the other i tried, so women please try this, no line temp wrinkle.....</li>
      <li>Overall, both products are very good and affordable to use on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>However, occasionally a lot number is not as effective as it should be.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if the bottle was larger.</li>
      <li>It last only 6-8hrs, but it is great  for those special</li>
      <li>Getting it on just right takes practice.  </li>
      <li>I must say I like Aminogenesis better because it produces fewer application mistakes -- the Renoir product is very sensitive to using too much, and then I have to remove and reapply.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove wrinkles, but it gives the complexion a more smooth, relax look for several hours.</li>
      <li>I am  a regular user and  get compliments on how great I look,  They do not know that for several hours I am helped by Renoir/</li>
      <li>Tried many similar products and none of them worked as well!</li>
      <li>I already ordered several more bottles of the product to have on hand.</li>
      <li>I first bought two faced  wrinkle injection and it did nothing..</li>
      <li>It was from a company in Harlem, MT.and worked the way most of these products only CLAIM to.  </li>
      <li>However, first, you can see where you applied it because the texture of your skin changes from the rest of your face.</li>
      <li>first off the person before said u can&#x27;t put it under makeup...</li>
      <li>I would not be able to go out in public.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Makes me look 10 years older!</li>
      <li>..seller u should remove that it&#x27;s very tasteless&lt;br</li>
      <li>So, no way you can use on your whole face like that picture of the woman on the ad depicts.</li>
      <li>Really works.</li>
      <li>, i don&#x27;t really recommend this, ..</li>
      <li>Just use lightly and pat it in and it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
      <li>But this is still better than any other product Ive tried for my eyebags and festoons...</li>
      <li>I use it every day and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of puffiness under</li>
      <li>It flakes  and makes new wrinkles!</li>
      <li>Third, the texture of this product is very rough, kind of like sand.</li>
      <li>I use the product everyday to make the bags under my eyes not so prominent.  </li>
      <li>Next i looked in the mirror, smile turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it smooths some of the gritty feeling and seems to dry more uniformly.</li>
      <li>product dries with white residue extremely easily and after 2 weeks of daily use</li>
      <li>and she said since the company had been sold the new formula had changed.  </li>
      <li>If u do to much u will get the white film I used to much under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This product performs very much like Aminogenesis Gone in Sixty Seconds, although the Renoir product has no applicator (just an open bottle that you dab on your finger).  </li>
      <li>It does work rather well for a few hours...............especially for a special occasion!  </li>
      <li>(i put it under my eyes and a bit lower and farther out to the sides and lower) ... smiled as it started to dry, felt it working and rather tightly.</li>
      <li>If you apply too much, it dries white.  </li>
      <li>This product really does reduce the appearance of line and even deep wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t use too much (otherwise it will turn white and you have to start over)</li>
      <li>But if you have under eye bags, and want to look younger, you can really fool everyone with this product.  </li>
      <li>If you use too much you will get a white residue.  </li>
      <li>Even after shaking for a full minute, i don&#x27;t know why it comes out of the bottle feeling like it has a few molecules of sand in it, per dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(i still need to lick/dab a little to get rid of some minor white areas but overall it works ok for me this way).</li>
      <li>Be careful not to use too much as it will be ashy looking</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product a few times and it&#x27;s worth</li>
      <li>I realize I am wasting some product, but by dabbing &amp; smoothing into skin the effect eliminates the dry white flaky patches, result smooth firm skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first bought two faced  wrinkle injection and it did nothing..I was extremely iffy about buying this it took me a month .ok first off the person before said u can&#x27;t put it under makeup...it goes over the makeup it does tighten it up so u have to use sparingly they tell u that on the bottle. I&#x27;m 35 I have fine lines on my forehead and boy did they go away after 2 mins. If u do to much u will get the white film I used to much under my eyes. So take it easy I&#x27;m going to order another bottle. Do not hesitate&lt;br /&gt; Order order order....a only thing I didn&#x27;t like is they left a 7.99 price tag on the bottle ..seller u should remove that it&#x27;s very tasteless&lt;br /&gt;. Other then that order!</li>
    <li> I love this .  It works better than you think</li>
    <li> This product really does reduce the appearance of line and even deep wrinkles.  The instructions clearly say NOT to apply on top of moisturizer before foundation, so for best results, apply on clean face or after applying foundation.  It stays effective until you wash it off at the end of the day.  I already ordered several more bottles of the product to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does the best job of minimizing eye bags.  However, occasionally a lot number is not as effective as it should be.  The company DID replace them. Tried many similar products and none of them worked as well! It would be nice if the bottle was larger.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.  Tried it several times, and it just made my face dryad the lines were still there.</li>
    <li> This product is a joke...feels like elmers glue and dries like it too.  Says not to apply foundation over it...  what a waste of money</li>
    <li> It flakes  and makes new wrinkles! It&#x27;s AWEFUL! Makes me look 10 years older! Never will I recommend it to ANYONE! I got what I paid for!</li>
    <li> gave as a  gift, response was not positive.</li>
    <li> Best product so far.  I look 10 years younger!!</li>
    <li> This worked wonderfully well as a temporary fix, and&lt;br /&gt;did perform as advertised.</li>
    <li> I like this product when used without makeup - it does smooth forehead lines temporarily, but doesn&#x27;t look good when makeup is applied.  Would love a product that you can mix with makeup!</li>
    <li> Works well after you work with  it for a while and learn your own application technique.</li>
    <li> I use the product everyday to make the bags under my eyes not so prominent.  Gave one bottle to my hairdresser who liked the results I was getting.</li>
    <li> It does work rather well for a few hours...............especially for a special occasion!  I just purchased my third bottle of Renoir.</li>
    <li> Its ok it doesn&#x27;t work miracle but work really good on fine lines not so much for the deep ones</li>
    <li> Renoir No Lines is the BEST product I have found that temporarily hides the puffiness under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if this product became unavailable.  I would not be able to go out in public.</li>
    <li> It does tighten skin and helps disappear wrinkles...but leaves a crinkly white film ...and I&#x27;m not sure how to cover this issue with eye concealer...  But this is still better than any other product Ive tried for my eyebags and festoons...</li>
    <li> For some crazy reason, I have yet to try this product.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s wonderful...IF...I can apply makeup over the lotion.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I saw no difference in my lines and it caked up my face.  Another claim that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I use it every day and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of puffiness under&lt;br /&gt;their eyes.  It is a wonderful product and will be buying it again and again.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I wasted my money on this product.  It makes your skin look&lt;br /&gt;even more wrinklier and older.  The residue was horrible no matter how little you put on or&lt;br /&gt;if you put on more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible!! I wonder what the FDA would think??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and am so glad to have found it on Amazon.  Much better prices than I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle in a bottle with sagging skin and wrinkle lines</li>
    <li> This product performs very much like Aminogenesis Gone in Sixty Seconds, although the Renoir product has no applicator (just an open bottle that you dab on your finger).  This is an excellent product when skin is correctly prepped (see my review on Aminogenesis).  I must say I like Aminogenesis better because it produces fewer application mistakes -- the Renoir product is very sensitive to using too much, and then I have to remove and reapply.  I have more consistently successful applications with Aminogenesis, although the Renior product lasts longer as the day wears on.  Overall, both products are very good and affordable to use on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> I am  a regular user and  get compliments on how great I look,  They do not know that for several hours I am helped by Renoir/no lines wrinkle facelift!  It is a boost  to my self confidence!</li>
    <li> Bottom line:  It&#x27;s cheap, which is good.  It doesn&#x27;t work, which is very bad.  For years I used a temporary wrinkle remover that removed lines and under eye puffiness.all day. It was from a company in Harlem, MT.and worked the way most of these products only CLAIM to.  I moved, lost their address,, and can&#x27;t find anything on the web for them.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t use too much (otherwise it will turn white and you have to start over) it&#x27;s not terrible.  Just use lightly and pat it in and it lasts a pretty long time.</li>
    <li> I use it on my palm and my palm lines disappear love it. I bought for my mom</li>
    <li> It stretches out the wrinkles so that they become less visible. However, first, you can see where you applied it because the texture of your skin changes from the rest of your face. Second, it leaves white residue that I can&#x27;t get rid of. It says in the directions to just blot it out with wet finger or cotton swab. As soon as dries, it goes back to the white residue. Third, the texture of this product is very rough, kind of like sand. When I take it of, it kind of scratches the skin a bit. Fourth, you cannot move the area where you put, think of it as a clay mask, you move it, it cracks. So, no way you can use on your whole face like that picture of the woman on the ad depicts. Your face WILL look like that if you apply to the whole face but you won&#x27;t be able to move anything. Fifth, you can&#x27;t use with makeup.</li>
    <li> I have Mediterranean dark skin.. I&#x27;ve used Genie for a long time at 3x the price and was trying to save some money with this for 10 bucks.  The first time i used it, i used it AFTER a good face wash, used it sparingly and evenly covered a semi-large area, (and with a Q-Tip).. as recommended &#x27;for best results&#x27;.. (i put it under my eyes and a bit lower and farther out to the sides and lower) ... smiled as it started to dry, felt it working and rather tightly. Next i looked in the mirror, smile turned upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product dries with white residue extremely easily and after 2 weeks of daily use, i&#x27;ve found it very difficult to use any amount of it without it being obvious. Also it has a gritty feel, as other reviewers have mentioned. Even after shaking for a full minute, i don&#x27;t know why it comes out of the bottle feeling like it has a few molecules of sand in it, per dab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, i don&#x27;t really recommend this, .. it does work ... however, it&#x27;s gritty, and makes your skin look tight and white, like the lady in the product image, at least that is an accurate picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary.. the only way i can use this successfully is to put some in my palm, add a few drops of water, mix, then apply very thin with a finger and let air dry.. it smooths some of the gritty feeling and seems to dry more uniformly. (i still need to lick/dab a little to get rid of some minor white areas but overall it works ok for me this way).</li>
    <li> Really works. Quick ship..use sparingly..less is best</li>
    <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since\\&quot; My Lines Are Concealed, sold its company and the new product is worthless. Spoke to the rep at CSI who made the original product,\\&quot;My Lines Are Concealed\\&quot; and she said since the company had been sold the new formula had changed.  I found this out after ordering 4 bottles on Amazon.  The new product was useless.She recommended Renoir, No lines Wrinkle, Facelift in a Bottle. It works if you follow the directions. You only need a tiny bit for it to do its job. I have bags under my eyes and I use a tiny brush( actually the ones that come with Latisse) and I look 10 years younger. If you use too much you will get a white residue.  Less is more with this wonderful product.I always make sure I order 3 or 4 so I don&#x27;t run out.I find it works best on bare skin( no foundation etc.)</li>
    <li> The bottle was shattered when I opened the package.  I was able to salvage some of it to try it out.  It made my skin feel as if there was glue on it, but it didn&#x27;t look any different.  I was hoping it would temporarily decrease my wrinkles for a wedding, but I didn&#x27;t really think it would be that great for $10.</li>
    <li> Works great just as the title implies.. It last only 6-8hrs, but it is great  for those special occasions.&lt;br /&gt; Dries quickly by itself,  but if you are in a hurry you can fan it for faster results&lt;br /&gt; Just a little goes a long ways for spot areas. Be careful not to use too much as it will be ashy looking</li>
    <li> I use this product for under eye bags.  It shrinks them up and takes a good 10 years off!  Getting it on just right takes practice.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years, so I&#x27;m a pro.  Even with that, I have to remove it and start over from time to time.  It works best on clean skin rather than applying it over other skin care products.  And I don&#x27;t put makeup or concealer on over it - that just takes the tight effect away.  It&#x27;s not a treatment product, it&#x27;s an immediate fix only, and it lasts for several hours. If you apply too much, it dries white.  But if you have under eye bags, and want to look younger, you can really fool everyone with this product.  It&#x27;s a miracle worker in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I love this one it really works good, unlike the other i tried, so women please try this, no line temp wrinkle.....</li>
    <li> Love this product. I apply with a makeup wedge. I realize I am wasting some product, but by dabbing &amp; smoothing into skin the effect eliminates the dry white flaky patches, result smooth firm skin. I recommend dry makeup, applied with a brush</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product a few times and it&#x27;s worth the purchase price.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a temporary way to enhance your complexion to look more relaxed.  Doesn&#x27;t really remove wrinkles, but it gives the complexion a more smooth, relax look for several hours.</li>
