### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works best if you dip into a cup.</li>
      <li>Worked great!</li>
      <li>and this is a great deal.</li>
      <li>Great price and a great product.</li>
      <li>I liked this fact as they would be easier to read the results.</li>
      <li>;) also they are a great price.</li>
      <li>Its what you pay for.. cheap!</li>
      <li>I had so many &amp;#34;faint</li>
      <li>I took an ept test after ordering these and it was positive, but I have heard really good things about them.</li>
      <li>It will give you a more accurate result.</li>
      <li>These work fine, but I got some evaps on them.</li>
      <li>In fact, my bottled water appears to be pregnant!</li>
      <li>Just go to the dollar store or Wal-Mart to get a cheap test.</li>
      <li>Quick deliver and easy to use</li>
      <li>I should have known better and bought a First Response to begin with.</li>
      <li>love these test stripes, they give you clear accurate results!  </li>
      <li>The HCG test stripe was correct and after a blood test I was confirmed pregnant.</li>
      <li>The Babi ovulation test strips by Blue Cross however are great!</li>
      <li>Showed up quickly also.</li>
      <li>Takes 5 minutes to fully develop, but I think pretty accurate.</li>
      <li>Works really well and sooo cheap.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I havent used them personally.</li>
      <li>I got my first bfp on surepredict (also available on amazon) at 10 dpo, followed by first response, and finally a positive digi at 12 dpo.</li>
      <li>Over many months I got many evaporation lines and &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; looking results, a few that looked blatantly positive just after the 10 minute mark, and even one test that showed quite positive immediately!</li>
      <li>But okay for the price, especially if you want to see progression.</li>
      <li>So, they are probably good if you wait until after AF is due, but not at all if you&#x27;re an early tester.</li>
      <li>I am currently pregnant and my test strip doesn&#x27;t give me a clear positive result.</li>
      <li>When I finally did get a true positive, I was 17 DPO!</li>
      <li>that progressed and later confirmed on another brand</li>
      <li>I would reccomend that if you want to buy in bulk, go to your local drug store and buy cheap ones for a dollar.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it was correct so went out and bought a clear blue pregnancy test</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing these tests!</li>
      <li>I tried the Walmart 88 cent test and got a clear positive result in 2 minute, whereas I haven&#x27;t gotten a clear positive from these strips.</li>
      <li>Very sensitive tests!</li>
      <li>So I bought a 3-Pack of First Response Test at Walgreens and all three came back positive.</li>
      <li>digital.&lt;br /&gt;These are also very afforable if you like to est early abd often without breaking the bank.</li>
      <li>I have positive tests on the dollar general and frer.</li>
      <li>Because they are cheap and claim the same sensitivity as more expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Lucky little thing.</li>

<li> not very sensitive tests compared to similar strip tests.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive test these work better.</li>
<li> I bought these and got a faint double blue line showing positive for pregnancy.</li>
<li> no wondering evaps or anything, not even after they dry!</li>
<li> The line stayed that way and only got slightly darker 15-16 DPO.</li>
<li> and they were both very dark obvious positives.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the tests give very faint lines even though I had received strong positive results on several other brands.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve used 15/20 and still no positive result.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a zillion tests over the years, and often test every other day.</li>
<li> The strips appeared to be wider than other internet strips I have purchased.</li>
<li> I used a few more strips a few days later and a couple had still a negative result and a couple of them had a very VERY faint line.</li>
<li> and that one came back negative.</li>
<li> Early detection, but your also playing a guessing game for days as to whether your preggo.</li>
<li> Saw a faint positive and it got darker everyday!</li>
<li> I started to get a little suspicious, so I decided to test the strips out using bottled water, jewelry cleaner and nail polish remover.</li>
<li> I took these test about 5 days past my missed period and they came out negative.</li>
<li> It isn&#x27;t just one strip, it&#x27;s the whole batch, which is very disappointing.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little annoyed that I paid $12 for these.</li>
<li> Not a good buy at all.</li>
<li> I ended up getting a lot of false positives..</li>
<li> false positives with these test.</li>
<li> They also have little pin prick marks and scratches on the strip, which casts weird shadows and makes it difficult to decipher whether there might be a faint line or not.</li>
<li> Lo and behold, they all showed faint lines within the time limit.</li>
<li> The upside is I saw that faint line 10 DPO</li>
<li> I always get faint positives at 10 or 11 DPO without fail.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used different types of test strips and these are the worst ones I&#x27;ve used to this point.  </li>
<li> Very thin stick that you have to dip in urine.  </li>
<li> On 14DPO I was sick of this guessing game for four days and went and bought a dollar store pregnancy test and Walmart brand pregnancy test.</li>
<li> Horrible little test strips!</li>
<li> I say a VERY VERY faint line.</li>
<li> it was so very faint.</li>
<li> I was seeing very faint positives 9DPO</li>
<li> Took another of these with those too, still very faint and unclear.</li>
<li> Maybe it was a bad batch</li>
<li> very disappointed..</li>
<li> These have terrible evaporation lines and indents.</li>

    <li> Very thin stick that you have to dip in urine.  Works really well and sooo cheap.  Takes 5 minutes to fully develop, but I think pretty accurate.</li>
    <li> Quick deliver and easy to use</li>
    <li> Very sensitive tests! I was seeing very faint positives 9DPO that progressed and later confirmed on another brand digital.&lt;br /&gt;These are also very afforable if you like to est early abd often without breaking the bank.</li>
    <li> I ended up getting a lot of false positives..very disappointed..Will not buy them again. Its what you pay for.. cheap!</li>
    <li> I took these test about 5 days past my missed period and they came out negative. So I bought a 3-Pack of First Response Test at Walgreens and all three came back positive. I used a few more strips a few days later and a couple had still a negative result and a couple of them had a very VERY faint line. Not a good buy at all.</li>
    <li> Why spend $10 for a test or two at the drug store?&lt;br /&gt;Especially when you can get 50 for $10 here!</li>
    <li> Worked great! Saw a faint positive and it got darker everyday! I have no complaints. Works best if you dip into a cup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting various ICs for years, while ttc... Because they are cheap and claim the same sensitivity as more expensive brands. I got my first bfp on surepredict (also available on amazon) at 10 dpo, followed by first response, and finally a positive digi at 12 dpo. These tests are just beginning to have the faintest lines. So, they are probably good if you wait until after AF is due, but not at all if you&#x27;re an early tester.</li>
    <li> I had so many &amp;#34;faint false positives with these test. I would reccomend that if you want to buy in bulk, go to your local drug store and buy cheap ones for a dollar. It will give you a more accurate result.</li>
    <li> The strips appeared to be wider than other internet strips I have purchased. I liked this fact as they would be easier to read the results. Unfortunately the tests give very faint lines even though I had received strong positive results on several other brands. I would not recommend purchasing these.</li>
    <li> I received these tests in a combo lh/hcg purchase. Yesterday my blood test showed my hcg at 145. Still no line after a ten minute wait. I have positive tests on the dollar general and frer. Maybe it was a bad batch but I&#x27;ve used 15/20 and still no positive result. You&#x27;ll miss a period and still get negatives. Just go to the dollar store or Wal-Mart to get a cheap test. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I bought these and got a faint double blue line showing positive for pregnancy. Wasn&#x27;t sure it was correct so went out and bought a clear blue pregnancy test and that one came back negative. The HCG test stripe was correct and after a blood test I was confirmed pregnant. Great price and a great product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive test these work better.</li>
    <li> I started testing with these 10 DPO. I say a VERY VERY faint line. I figured it was probably just an evaporation line it was so very faint. The line stayed that way and only got slightly darker 15-16 DPO. The result takes 5 minutes to show up as well. On 14DPO I was sick of this guessing game for four days and went and bought a dollar store pregnancy test and Walmart brand pregnancy test. Took both of those on 14 DPO and they were both very dark obvious positives. Showed up quickly also. Took another of these with those too, still very faint and unclear. The upside is I saw that faint line 10 DPO and it showed something. Early detection, but your also playing a guessing game for days as to whether your preggo.</li>
    <li> I trust babies brand and this is a great deal. Especially while trying to conceive!</li>
    <li> Horrible little test strips! I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Blue Cross pregnancy test strips until this last time when I ordered 50 instead of 25. These have terrible evaporation lines and indents. They also have little pin prick marks and scratches on the strip, which casts weird shadows and makes it difficult to decipher whether there might be a faint line or not. I started to get a little suspicious, so I decided to test the strips out using bottled water, jewelry cleaner and nail polish remover. Lo and behold, they all showed faint lines within the time limit. In fact, my bottled water appears to be pregnant! Lucky little thing. Sarcasm aside, the Blue Cross pregnancy tests are unreliable and inaccurate. The Babi ovulation test strips by Blue Cross however are great! I&#x27;m a little annoyed that I paid $12 for these. I should have known better and bought a First Response to begin with. Oh well. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> These work fine, but I got some evaps on them. Like any test, definitely only read within the time window. But okay for the price, especially if you want to see progression.</li>
    <li> not very sensitive tests compared to similar strip tests.  Took 3 days longer than similar tests to show a line.</li>
    <li> Over many months I got many evaporation lines and &amp;#34;confusing&amp;#34; looking results, a few that looked blatantly positive just after the 10 minute mark, and even one test that showed quite positive immediately! They were all incorrect. When I finally did get a true positive, I was 17 DPO! This is my 9th pregnancy and I am unabashedly a test-a-holic. I&#x27;ve used a zillion tests over the years, and often test every other day. I always get faint positives at 10 or 11 DPO without fail. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing these tests! I can&#x27;t believe it took until 17 DPO to show up!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I havent used them personally. I took an ept test after ordering these and it was positive, but I have heard really good things about them.</li>
    <li> love these test stripes, they give you clear accurate results!  no wondering evaps or anything, not even after they dry! ;) also they are a great price.</li>
