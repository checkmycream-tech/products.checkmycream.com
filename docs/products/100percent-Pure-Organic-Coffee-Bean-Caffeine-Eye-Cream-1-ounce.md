<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this brand for their quality products but this one was completely ineffective and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom. Her face is visibly brighter and under eye darkness had diminished.</li>
    <li> GREAT TO PUT ON WHEN U GET UP! IT WAKE UP UR FACE!!</li>
    <li> Cream is thicker than I expected and seemed to make the problem worse.  My eyes looked and felt more swollen.</li>
    <li> Works, smells fabulous, an A plus product!  I have one consistent issue with the dispenser and if it is not resolved, I will still use this eye cream b/c it is so terrific (:.  After purchasing and enjoying a number of tubes, I have found that around 1/2 way through the tube,  the dispenser just does not work. So,  I cut the tube in 1/2, use a tiny spatula to take out all the remaining cream and put it in a tiny bowl covered tight with saran wrap.  Has anyone else found this to be true?  Anyway, thank you for this product, the scent is marvelous, it works and I am a fan.</li>
    <li> Really like this product; no negative effects.  Only complaint in that is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this item and the pump broke both times shortly after opening.</li>
    <li> Nothing against this. I do not prefer the unusual smell.  I am a smell girl.</li>
    <li> This cream is great. I put it on when I&#x27;m getting ready for work and by the time I get there the puffiness is gone. The only thing is the dispenser is kinda weird. At first it works great, then it won&#x27;t come out or when you release the pump more cream comes out making you waste a little. But because it works awesome I will keep buying it. FYI it leaves your under eye looking shiny, nothing a little powder won&#x27;t fix after it dries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; 5/15/17&lt;br /&gt;I came to this site to buy this again but I don&#x27;t remember paying$30!!!! I will try a different site or a different product that&#x27;s similar. It&#x27;s a good eye but def not worth that price!!</li>
    <li> Wife has used this for years.  Does a good job managing the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I love to use this product every day, I love the smell, and it makes me feel like I am doing something special for that delicate skin area. I don&#x27;t know that it really makes a difference what eye cream you use, just that you use one!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks and while it does leave the skin under my eyes baby smooth, it doesn&#x27;t do very much to relieve my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> A lot of people feel strongly about this smell but I actually liked it. I thought it was subtle and more on the vanilla side than coffee.  I ended up returning it because I did not see any results.  I even felt like my dark circles were worse at the end of the day.  Also not a fan of how thick it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know eye cream can only take you so far, you need to be hydrated and well rested to really cure those dark circles.  However, I also don&#x27;t want one that makes the matter worse.  I am bummed about this, because I loved the natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> My eye cream arrived a short while ago &amp; I immediately dabbed some under my eyes &amp; on my lids. Within 20 minutes  I could see &amp; feel a noticeable difference. My eyes are always puffy due to allergies &amp; sinus condition, my salt intake at nighttime, lack of sleep, and/or aging (I&#x27;m a 33 year old Caucasian woman with pale/fair skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I used to apply preparation H under my eyes &amp; it helped to an extent but can&#x27;t use it every day because it constricts the blood vessels in my face &amp; can cause headaches with frequent use, plus it smells horrible! The scent 100% pure cream emits is less offensive &amp; smells more like cookies than coffee (or the fishy smell of prep-h hemorrhoid cream). The organic coffee bean eye cream also absorbs way faster without leaving a residue, unlike other eye creams, including prep-h I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Also when I applied the 100% eye cream it did not burn or sting, which has been a problem with other under-eye treatments used in the past &amp; thrown away. A+++ for application absorption!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I may not even want to apply under eye concealer after this! We&#x27;ll see in a week or so after I visit my mother. If there is a visible improvement she will let me know without the knowledge of my new product usage. I&#x27;ll update my review after consistent application in a few weeks or so. Right now it gets 5 stars *****</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any result!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the 100% Pure Coffee Bean Eye Cream to help with the dark circles under my eyes. I had used other 100% Pure products with great success so I had confidence that this one would be a great product as well. It did not do anything for the dark circles and I have never had a problem with irritation or puffiness, but after using the 100% Pure Coffee Bean Eye Cream, I now do. I have gone back to using my Dr. Hauschka Revitalizing Eye Cream which I hope will relieve the irritation and puffiness caused by this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It gets absorbed very quickly and I definitely see an improvement in my dark circles. I was worried about the caffeine as I am sensitive to it but I only use this in the am so it hasn&#x27;t kept me awake. As for the scent...it smells like popcorn to me.</li>
    <li> I used this product daily, until the tube was empty I found no benifits at all.  I do not recommend  this product  to any one</li>
    <li> As with most skincare items, what works on some people doesn&#x27;t work on others. I can honestly say that this works for reducing puffiness. It is my go-to eye cream in the mornings. However, it has not reduced my dark circles. I don&#x27;t think anything can, really, so I&#x27;m not all that surprised that it doesn&#x27;t work either. The smell is a bit odd, but nothing I couldn&#x27;t get used to in order to reap the benefits of the rapid reduction in puffiness.</li>
    <li> Feels and smells great and makes mild puffines significantly improved!</li>
    <li> dark circles are still there.. hmm ! like how it smells!</li>
    <li> The texture of the eye cream is okay but personally I really don&#x27;t like the strong candy (coffee cream) smell...</li>
    <li> The items was delivered promptly, and the product is awsome.  I always had bags under my eyes, even when I was young.  Since using this product they are gone, I noticed it right away.  I use this morning and night and cannot believe how good my eyes look.  I never see the bags anymore.  Some people complain about the scent, I happen to like the scent very much.  Kind of like coffee but nicer, and it&#x27;s only noticable when you apply it, after that.  No smell at all.  I already bought another one, and the first one isn&#x27;t even finished.  I do not want to run out.  This is the best eye cream.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m kidding myself but I believe my eyes look &#x27;more awake&#x27; with this product. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I bought this as it came in a pack with the mascara and as it turned out I liked it more than the mascara. It is great stuff. It smells to me like baking cookies. Every time I put it on my husband asks me if I am baking something. It has such a yummy smell. It is so smooth and goes on great. I recommend this product for anyone looking for a good face cream.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers said this product smelled too much like coffee but I don&#x27;t find it overwhelming at all. I really like the way this feels and I have noticed my skin looks better around my eyes since I started using it. I also just saw on Dr. Oz that eye cream with caffeine is the way to go so I&#x27;m glad I chose this product. I would definitely buy it again and the fact that it is all organic and natural is awesome. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Coffee in eye cream. Sure. I love coffee. Put it in anything. I love eye cream too. This stuff is good. It won&#x27;t erase wrinkles. Only botox can do that. If you&#x27;re looking for soft skin, buy this for the win.</li>
    <li> I just got this product the other day..while I know I should probably wait a week or so to write a review on this, I can&#x27;t help but note that so far this product feels great!  I had really puffy allergy eyes; this product makes the skin around my eyes SUPER soft and fine lines don&#x27;t look as noticeable.  I like the hint of coffee smell. Its not overpowering at all. Even if you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee, I don&#x27;t foresee it being an issue with this product.  I&#x27;ve used it both at night and during the day.  I woke up in the morning with less puffy eyes; I didn&#x27;t feel an immediate \\&quot;tightening\\&quot; feeling like i have with other products such as the garnier nutritioniste anti-puff eye roller..but I also found I needed to reapply that throughout the day. So far the \\&quot;anti-puff\\&quot; effect of this product lasts through the majority of my work day.  Also, this is a great product for applying concealer.  I use Bare Escentuals (powder makeup) and this product allowed for a primer-like base for applying the powder concealer.  All in all I would recommend this product.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think I waited long enough to write a review.</li>
    <li> I have always had dark circles, and on top of that I work the night shift so my sleep is definitely sporadic.  I use this in the morning and at night and I do feel and see a bit of a difference.  I actually like the scent, it&#x27;s kind of like a vanilla/coffee/cookie dough smell.  I am a guy, and do not hesitate to use this product; it has helped to reduce my dark circles and makes me look a little less \\&quot;tired\\&quot;.  I will definitely buy again when I start to run low.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product well over two years now. Nice soft scent with the Coffee Bean. The cream is a wonderful&lt;br /&gt;addition to my makeup bag. I use it each evening under my eye area to help with slight wrinkles.  The tube is a compact size and&lt;br /&gt;great for someone that does a lot of traveling.</li>
    <li> It has definitely lived up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this eye cream from Amazon it was out of stock and the website did not reflect that. So, I purchased it from the 100 Percent Pure Website. So far I have been using it for a little over two weeks. It is very hydrating but the hydration does not last all day; it helps reduce puffiness and dark circles. However, I did not notice any reduction in fine lines. So, don&#x27;t expect any miracles there. Overall, it is a good eye cream when compared to the unnatural ones I have used. I would also like to mention that it has the smell of some kind of cookies.</li>
    <li> The smell is fine but i have not noticed any difference with my dark circles under my eyes.Use it a.m. and p.m. no improvement just as dark as before using this product.</li>
    <li> No results. Do not notice any difference except for the coffee smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using under every cream ever since I was 14.  I don&#x27;t have any dark circles or puffiness and I use it mainly to moisturize the eye area.  I like this eye cream due to the fact that it is natural and absorbs to the skin fast without leaving any oily feeling.  The size of the tube is huge and will last you a very long time, therefore it is worth the price.  the only thing that bothers me is the smell, which tends to disappears after 10+ minutes.  I&#x27;m not sure if I will be repurchasing this product, as I may try a different eye cream from 100 percent pure.</li>
    <li> I fortunately bought the MINI version of this off their website and am so glad I did! I will probably ONLY buy it in this form as it is super easy to push out of the tube. (I only note this as reading other reviews regarding the pump) The product smells exactly like their Tahiti line of body products; which makes me happy every time I use it. (sort of like vanilla coffee) I have noticed a huge difference in my eyes and am really thankful for this product. My small lines seem to disappear and the product sinks right into my under eye area. I even put it on the eyelids. I swear my under eyes look brighter and I don&#x27;t even need to use my concealer! I had been using Origins similar product to no avail and decided to try this. SUPER GLAD I DID! I would recommend it in the small version (cheaper too!) to try it out. I love 100% Pure and all their products!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it does anything......</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and it works!  I&#x27;ve been told I look more rested and younger since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I don&#x27;t track the results, so who knows if it&#x27;s working, but I have no complaints.  It also smells amazing and the consistency is good. My only issue is that the pump is stiff, so you either end up getting nothing, or spilling out far more than you could ever use on two eyes in just one pump.  I feel like i put more energy into dispensing it than anything else.  Otherwise though, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m starting to have a problem with waking up with bags under my eyes if I eat too much sodium the night before. It seems to help with the baggage. I&#x27;ve been using it both at night and I  the morning.</li>
    <li> I was optimistic about this product. I used it every day but didn&#x27;t find that it helped at all with puffy eyelids. It does have a nice smell and works well as a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This gave me chalazions.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I have oily skin and this is very nice.  Soaks in and is very gentle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! It does reduce the appearance of bags under my eyes. I don&#x27;t use it every day, only when needed.</li>
    <li> I have horrible, huge bags and dark circles under my eyes and have all my life (I&#x27;m 59 years old).  I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of plastic surgery and then decided to give this a try.  Within two or three days I saw a HUGE difference.  I use it not only under my eyes but above on the eyelid.  It does smell a bit different but it&#x27;s so creamy and absorbs quickly. You only need a tiny bit!  I use it in the morning and at night and highly recommend this product.  What a find!!!!!</li>
    <li> I received this product so quickly, just a few days after I placed my order.  And I even got free samples too.  Cool.  I was anxious to test it out.  Even though I have only been using it a few days, I love it.  I just use a little dab under my eyes and they feel refreshed.  It was all-natural, inexpensive, and I really like the scent too. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This scrumptious smelling eye cream really perks up my under-eye area in the mornings. I also apply it at night before I go to bed. It works well under makeup as well. I agree with the other reviews about the pump expelling too much lotion at a time. I just twist off the top and get the lotion off the pump; a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have really dry skin around my eyes. I use this and then Clinique All About Eyes gel-cream over it. The Caffeine Eye Cream absorbs very well, is not sticky and de-puffs right away.</li>
    <li> This is the very first product I ever tried from this company. I had read that someone didn&#x27;t like the coffee aroma... Bingo! That meant it had coffee in it and I knew that coffee was good for reducing bags under the eyes. Plus, I love the smell of coffee. I keep a tube in my glove compartment and apply it under my eyes at the red lights. I also put it under my chin to stimulate the little flabby waddle I have ...seems to be more defined now. I like their products.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, not sure what to expect.  I quickly found that it caused irretation and sat on top of the skin.  I had to stop using it, and didn&#x27;t mind because I didn&#x27;t like that it felt oily on my skin.  As an alternative, I opted for the olay eye roller.  Maybe I am an isolated case and this doesn&#x27;t bother other people, but for me, this product was no good (but it did smell nice).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pure Caffeine Eye Cream for a little over a year now and I love it.  I wake up with some slight bagginess under my eyes, but I apply this when I step out of the shower and the bagginess disappears.  I also have some lines and wrinkles at the corners of my eyes (I laugh a lot) and they are not as pronounced.</li>
    <li> Love this product it&#x27;s the only eye product that truly eliminates puffiness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years.  The smell of it is wonderful, very strong coffee scent.  And I swear it reduces those pesky under-eye circles.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product that lightens my circles for several years.  I like to keep mine in the refridgerator because the coolness of the cream reduces my bags and also shrinks the blood vessles quicker.  Use every day to see the results for yourself.  It will also last a long time, the price is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this, so it is too early to say if it is firming under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do really dislike the pump mechanism for this...it spits out 3 days worth of product, no matter how careful you are.  They need a pump that puts out far less or at least lets you control the output better.</li>
    <li> To be fair, I&#x27;ve just started using it.  I have no problem with the scent, I have tried almost every under eye cream out there :)&lt;br /&gt;I did base my purchase based on the very good reviews, it being \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, and wanting to diminish my puffiness so bad. Well, I guess I either have to live with them or keep on searching. Note: It is absorbes very well and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and do see some improvement in the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have chronically &#x27;clogged&#x27; sinuses, so I was happy to find something that seems to alleviate the resulting darkess/swelling I get from this. Hopefully as I continue to use this product, I&#x27;ll see even more improvement. It is also very gentle--some products have caused redness and irritaion around my eyes. And I like the scent--reminds me of cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nice and light and really does bring down the puffiness under my eyes in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little dab.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good too.</li>
    <li> It really works  I just started getting bags under my eyes. I saw a difference within minutes.</li>
    <li> Very good eye cream, pure ingredients, pleasant smell</li>
    <li> I just received same and have been using it for a couple of days.  It feels nice under the eye and I notice that the darkness goes away, but mine comes back the next day and I just keep using the cream to eliminate the circles</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product when I read the reviews, but I am a little disappointed in it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference or firming under my eyes.  I have used other under eye creams that have been equal or better than this product.  It is a nice thick cream and the 1oz bottle will certainly last a long time.  I am not crazy about the scent, but no one would ever smell it on your face.  I will definitely use it up, but I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought Pure Cosmetics Coffee Bean Eye Cream back in May 2011, took a month&#x27;s break from it in Sept, but have gone back to it. The results weren&#x27;t mind-blowing when I was using it daily from May through mid-September, but I used it anyway because it&#x27;s better than nothing. To be honest, I like how it moisturizes better than other eye creams and gels that I&#x27;ve used. I apply it under concealer for hydration and protection from whatever stressful effects cosmetics and living/working in NYC has had on my dry-to-sensitive skin. I used it without make-up for most of the summer to give my skin a break, but I saw no firming or brightening effects... just moisturized/hydrated. As I stated before, it&#x27;s better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;coffee bean\\&quot; scent is indescribably NOT coffee, cookie, or cocoa... maybe a light version of a box of soggy waffle cones? I highly recommend you smell this at a store before you buy it. It&#x27;s a super soft and creamy scent, yes, but still distinct and unappealing to me. It&#x27;s basically become a general and accepted reflex to hold my breath for the few seconds I dab this on. I&#x27;m still using it because its moisturizing ways are worth it. Plus, I love the pump... it&#x27;s a welcome relief from jars and tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect results from this, now that I&#x27;ve gone back to using it, but it feels good under my eyes: no irritation, whatsoever (i.e. my eyes don&#x27;t water or itch when I dab it on my skin); moisturizing/hydrating; and very light and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically: It&#x27;s better than what I&#x27;ve previously used. However, no life-changing results... but better than nothing.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of such positive reviews. It made my eyes puffy. I have very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it works- I&#x27;m just too sensitive. Nice smell!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much improvement in waking up my eye area.  Also, the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to take the pump off and squeeze the tube.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the past few days and it has had no effects on my eyes.  I visited my doctor a few months back because I have a bag under one eye that only shows when I smile.  My doctor says that it didn&#x27;t form because of premature aging but b/c of the way I sleep.  I thought that this cream would work resolve the issue but it hasn&#x27;t had any effect on my undereye bag.</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of this eye cream. It takes forever to dry so its not as practical in the morning when I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have so much time to wait. Putting on makeup when its still wet is not pretty under the eyes, which defeats the point of using the cream. It works better as a nite treatment. Haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic improvements so far in reducing puffiness and dark circles. Its also quite oily. One pump delivers way too much cream also. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream - is a complete waste of money. I have used this product for 3 (three) weeks, no change in the puffiness.</li>
    <li> I bought this item 2 weeks ago...first I am 48 yrs old..never had puffiness till about 6 months ago. I thought it was allergies... NOPE! I have bought several different items...from several manufacturers. Most have not worked. I read the reviews for this product and thought why not..it is a good price.Yes there is a smell to it but I did not even notice the \\&quot;coffee smell\\&quot; until about the 3rd time of using it. It does not bother me and I feel it does not last \\&quot;that\\&quot; long. I am however a disappointed in my results. Yes it did reduce the puffiness \\&quot;some\\&quot; but not as much as I was hoping for. I know it will never go away totally but was hoping for better results. It is a wonderful moisturizer !! I do notice a little greasiness but just cut down on your amount you are using.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this de-puffs, because I don&#x27;t notice a difference, but puffiness is not usually my problem.  It is however very moisturizing and smells great.  A little goes a long way and I would definitely purchase it again.  The fact it&#x27;s natural is a bonus.</li>
    <li> This cream performs as claimed.  I have been using it for two days.  Amazing.  Prior reviewer(s) suggested that it not be wasted for nighttime application... and to store it in the refrigerator.  I plan on following this advice.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t all that good for my problem.  Could work perfectly fine for someone else.  But have found products that work better.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money! maybe it wsan&#x27;t legit. In any case it did nothing for my bf&#x27;s dark circles and eye area. Waste! Was also used over a ling period of time. Tea bags and cucumbers would have sufficed.</li>
    <li> It smells good but hasn&#x27;t help my under eye baggage.</li>
    <li> Yes it does really work, my under eye puffiness definitely less noticeable when I use this. but don&#x27;t expect miracles! You will still have puffy under eyes, just not as bad</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It is creamy smooth, and rich. Helps that undereye area stay firm.  It does reduce the puffyness.  The coffee aroma is not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> I love this product. You can&#x27;t beat the cost from Amazon! And yes it has a small scent of coffee, but I&#x27;m a coffee drinker right from the south and drink plenty every day.So the smell is nothing compared to what this product can do for you. When I wake up in the morning the first thing I do is put my contacts in and reach for my Coffee Bean Eye Cream. I put it under my eyes and above my lips and then I get my morning coffee. Then I&#x27;m ready to put my other creams on my face over my eye cream and by then the bags and some of the wrinkles are taken care of. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works great.</li>
    <li> the only under eye treatment i use. it got rid of my dark circles. true story. plus i like the smell.</li>
    <li> This product has an unusual smell at first, but is a great eye cream! It is worth paying a little extra for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disapointed because it didn&#x27;t work on the under eye puffiness. But that could be because of an illness I have. I retain extra fluid under my eyes. It may work for others. It goes on nicely and is not greasy or heavy feeling. It&#x27;s always good to put some kind of eye cream under your eyes for protection of the elements around us. That&#x27;s why I only gave it a 3 star rating.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 3 months now , and it helps with swelling below the eyes , have seen some improvement , I  use it twice a day . It&#x27;s not a miracle , but helps maintain Eye area .</li>
    <li> Love! I am acne prone and break out easy with any product but I have had really good luck with this. I was worried at first because it has rose hip oil in it and when i tried using rose hip by itself i broke out. This is a great moisturizer and I feel that it has improved my lower and upper eye area. I have only been using for a month and can see a difference. It is defiantly not a miracle maker and my dark circles have not disappeared or anything like that but I feel that it really helps with puffiness which makes my dark circles not as noticeable</li>
    <li> I have genetic eye bags. No amount of sleep makes them go down. I got tired of spending an inordinate amount of money on eye creams to reduce the puffy bags under my eyes. I knew the key ingredient to reduce the swelling was caffeine, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I was very pleasantly surprised that this cream did a better job than some of the creams I&#x27;d buy at expensive makeup stores. I use this creme in combination with Garnier Anti-Puff Eye Roller. Individually, they don&#x27;t work as well. But together, my eye bags go down significantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s and have always had dark under eye circles. They got more pronounced after I had a baby. I think this cream did reduce the puffiness of my eye bags and a bit of the purple, but I still look tired without concealer. Obviously no cream can make your undereye skin less thin or change heredity. But this in conjunction with a vitamin c eye roller has made me use less concealer. That&#x27;s good enough for me, since I&#x27;m not considering surgery at this time.</li>
    <li> It would have been nicer if the product had no smell.  I am not sure it really does much for sudden morning bags, but I try it anyway.</li>
    <li> works wonderful on my puffy eyes</li>
    <li> This eye cream is gentle and really works. The product last along time and is well worth the money.  Very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the products from 100% pure. The eye cream I ordered made my eyes swell up really bad. I contacted the company via e-mail to find out how to return it. I followed their directions and mailed it all back to them with a copy of the e-mail. I did not hear from them, and weekly e-mails were not returned for 3 months! Not only did they not honor the original promise to refund my money after returning the products, they said I could call in for a credit instead. So here I am with no products, and a \\&quot;credit\\&quot; for more of what made me miserable. There are better natural cosmetic companies out there. Stay away.</li>
    <li> I really do swear by this stuff.  I use it as my daytime moisturizer under makeup.  It is silky smooth, highly emollient, absorbs easily, and actually takes away puffiness and visibly reduces lines almost instantly.  I&#x27;m not a coffee lover, but the scent is very light and actually reminds me more of chocolate than it does coffee. A little goes a long way, but don&#x27;t worry if you use a bit too much as its equally effective on those fine lines across the bridge of the nose and around the lips. Don&#x27;t waste it.  I don&#x27;t use it for night as I&#x27;m not worried how puffy or wrinkled I look once I&#x27;ve washed off my makeup and would rather save it for daytime. So for those asking \\&quot;Does this stuff really work?\\&quot;, I can honestly say YES!</li>
    <li> I was not disappointed with this product. Since caffeine works by contracting blood vessels, it really helps with hiding dark circles. I use this nearly every morning. it&#x27;s really creamy and blends in well. I don&#x27;t even use a whole pump for both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve noted with this product is it takes awhile to absorb fully into the skin, so sometimes I&#x27;ll rub my eye and the product bothers it. It burns abit, but nothing major. so only a very minor bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not really any smell that I noted either, Unless I sniff it as soon as it comes out of the tube, I never noticed it having any smell while wearing it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for around 3 or 4 weeks now.  I haven&#x27;t seen any visible improvements in the dark circles under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t really have crows feet or bags under my eyes (with or without cream) so I can&#x27;t say how it would work with firming the skin.  As far as minimizing the appearance of fine lines - it accomplishes that as well as any moisturizer I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is a wonderful light weight cream.  It has a delicate scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any perfumes, but I think it smells a bit like milk chocolate.  I also like the fact that it is a natural product and I&#x27;m not risking my health when using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it goes on really nice &amp; I love the smell.  I find it soothing using it.  I use it all over my face not just under my eyes.  Wish it came in a larger size.  On my third tube:)</li>
    <li> Smells good and works good. I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing. Waking up in the morning now is a treat. No bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great product, really reduces puffiness and dark circles. My only complaint is that the pump on my tube doesn&#x27;t work so I have to unscrew it to use.</li>
    <li> This did not work at all for me.  I have bad dark circles due to genetic reasons, and it did not lighten them up at all, not even a little bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for two years now. I orignally bought it from a TV shopping network. I accidentaly removed the autoship. I went to the 100% website to re-order. It was cheaper here. Same product and better dispensing system than the original glass bottle. It keeps my puffiness at bay and I no longer have dark circles under my eyes. The orbits around my eyes are always hydrated and smooth. It smells fabulous! Best of all, it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with this product.  It&#x27;s delivered results better than I expected.  I hit 40 and suddenly I had puffiness and dark circles under my eyes - this eye cream has helped so much!  I know nothing can completely turn the clock back with this can dial it back a little bit.</li>
    <li> I personally felt no difference.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on a lot of different eye creams before deciding on this one. I was looking for something to relieve dryness and dark circles and am very happy with this product. The dryness was almost almost completely gone the next day and within a week I saw noticeable results with the dark circles. It&#x27;s now been 6 weeks and I&#x27;m very impressed. This product works fast, does what it claims, anddddd its natural &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to help and I suspect it is making the skin under my eyes feel raw. I haven&#x27;t used the last 2/3rds of the package and will likely throw it away.</li>
    <li> Puffiness under your eyes:  not desirable, even embarassing.  This puffiness is caused by a genetic condition or more likely fluid retention due to environmental factors, i.e., sun, pollution, or lifestyle such as too much sodium in the diet, not enough sleep, stress, ageing.... Skin around the eyes is delicate and should be treated with respect.  Better than tea bags and cucumber slices, Coffee Bean Eye Cream smooths on gently, and is Organic with no harsh chemicals or Parabins to be absorbed through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tried several products with poor results and thought I would always be plagued by this.  However this product works even when I have too much salt or not enough sleep.  I use it daily and am completely satisfied with it.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This works well for puffy eyes in the a.m.  Seems to hydrate well and leaves no greasy residue.  I&#x27;m a contact wearer so this product does not effect my contacts at all.  I use a couple of different eye creams and like to rotate them every other day.</li>
    <li> Feels good going on and takes just a tiny bit. Skin is softer but no difference in dark circles yet.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream of all times!!!</li>
    <li> TOTALLY NOT FOR ME. AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED SINCE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALL NATURAL. NOT NATURAL ENOUGH I GUESS FOR ME. IT IRRITATED THE SKIN AROUND MY EYES, EVEN WITH THE SMALLEST AMOUNT I WAS USING. PLUS I BROKE OUT IN LITTLE BUMPS AROUND MY EYES.ONCE I STOPPED USING IT, THE BUMPS DISAPPEARED. THANK GOODNESS. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THAT WAS A WASTE OF $$ FOR ME.</li>
    <li> I am not sure it is really getting rid of circles, but it does seem to &amp;#34;reflect&amp;#34; light around them and it goes on smooth, smells delightful and does not overwhelm my eyes with fragrance, which can be a nuisance.  Yeah, I like it, but 4 stars because it is rather pricey.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see any difference so far.. and coffee&#x27;s smell not that pleased.. I use it twice a day in the morning and night, hope it works later..</li>
    <li> I was disappointed this didn&#x27;t take away the puffiness under my eyes as that&#x27;s what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and doesn&#x27;t make the problem worse, but no tightening effect.</li>
    <li> Well this is an ok product for me even though this is the first time I&#x27;m going to be using an eye cream,I bought it because of the reviews but I&#x27;ve been using for a month and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my eyes.maybe because I don&#x27;t have any dark circles or wrinkles,but I was expecting my eyes to look super bright and all but its just pretty much the same.but i will keep using it because I like that it&#x27;s natural and I believe it&#x27;s an healthy nice routine for my eyes.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing to get rid of the circles. Disappointed. I will not be ordering again. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love this so far , it goes on so smooth , not sure if it works I just received it but it had great reviews!  Smells good and goes on great under makeup!</li>
    <li> I think I am desperate, as it seems many are to eliminate puffiness under my eyes.  This product caught my eye mainly because it was 100% Pure.  I works fairly well and I have tried the other product in this line for eyes that did not say &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;.  I think I liked it the best.  When you first put it on it does smell like coffee.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but doesn&#x27;t do a significant job. Helps if you refrigerate it.</li>
    <li> Gets rid of the puffiness under my eyes.  The scent is not strong.  A little goes a long way, so I would use it use very sparingly.</li>
    <li> Wrapables was very helpful and thorough in responding to my concerns! After I had some difficulties with the Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream from 100% Pure, I sought to return the product and was frustrated when I could not return it. The company immediately contacted me and indicated that they would reimburse me due to my special circumstances (specifically, my skin reaction to the product). They credited my account quickly and were very helpful in this process!</li>
    <li> I used this product, previously, when it was called Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream -- and the ingredients listed green tea as the first ingredient...Now the packaging has changed, but the name of the product hasn&#x27;t, nor has the description claiming it has green tea...but if you read the ingredients -- the first ingredient listed (which means it is the largest ingredient) shows that it&#x27;s aloe vera -- and no where is \\&quot;green tea\\&quot; mentioned as an ingredient!  Misleading and deceptive.  I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s as effective as the one I previously bought from the same company. Makes me very suspicious and possibly not worth the money.  If I wanted Aloe Vera for my eyes, I can just buy that.</li>
    <li> Been using this item for about a year now, and I am happy with the outcome.  Great for under eye and crows feet due to aging.  Goes on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Used it faithfully morning and night for at least 6 weeks, with NO results.</li>
    <li> it is easier to just buy this cute little tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I think it smells really nice and feels just as nice on the skin. Seems to be very emollient but the tube goes way too fast!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a noticeable difference in my puffiness under my eyes since using this cream.  I love the way it smells.....almost a vanilla hint to it.  Its very thick so I only need to use a VERY small amount to cover the area.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on easy, but don&#x27;t waste your money. I&#x27;m a redhead with some serious eye circles (comes with the territory of thin skin!) and this has been completely non-effective.</li>
    <li> My upper eyelids are puffy year-round from allergies plus I have dark circles under my eyes (but no bags).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pleasant slighly nutty-smelling cream does depuff very nicely, but not permanently.  My dark circles do appear slightly lighter.  I&#x27;m 73 so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles.  I&#x27;ve been using this for six nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;👍</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and purchased it anyway because I know every person is different. Unfortunately this did nothing for my dark circles. It is a great lotion: it isn&#x27;t too heavy, lasts all day and isn&#x27;t sticky like some eye creams. I do not find the smell overpowering nor do I mind it; I really don&#x27;t know how to describe it but \\&quot;cookies\\&quot; seems to fit. I use it daily but basically all it is at this point is a lotion I&#x27;m trying to use up. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> My eyes look so much better after a few days of use. I have had several people ask me what I am doing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this from the 100% pure website directly.  They offer free shipping on orders over $50 and free samples with all orders.  I decided to purchase from this company since many of their products are organically certified (the only certification available in the world of cosmetics), so I trusted their composition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye creme is a little thick, as the previous reviewer noted.  However, when you pump it, it comes out in a needle -thin string of creme that is easy to apply!  It blends in very well.  You don&#x27;t need much at all.  I don&#x27;t even use a full pump for both eyes!  Any excess, I just rub on my hand since it&#x27;s silky smooth.  The only thing that I&#x27;m not crazy about is the smell.  It&#x27;s not quite coffee; it reminds me of a cookie.  It smells good, but it&#x27;s not something that I enjoy smelling every morning.  But it&#x27;s much better than having fragrances added to the product!  (That&#x27;s my reason for 5-stars instead of 4-stars.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the creme at night, so I don&#x27;t have the same problem as the other reviewer.  However, it is always a good idea to keep ALL cosmetics out of the eye!  Any cosmetic/creme (natural or not) is not healthy for the eye, and the reaction will naturally be adverse since the eye is trying to &#x27;fight the invader.&#x27;</li>
    <li> Based on all the reviews, I had high hopes for this product; however, it really didn&#x27;t do much to improve the appearance of the bags under my eyes.  The smell is wonderful - more like fresh baked cookies with a slight undertone of coffee - and it actually does do a good job of moisturizing, so I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I used this for about a month straight and didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in under eye circles or dryness at all. It seemed to moisturize when I put it on, but a few hours later my eyes looked like they always do.</li>
    <li> Very good eye cream. I ended up buying it for myself after I developed dark circles under my eyes from allergies and it works well. I had my husband try it too because he suffers from puffiness and dark circles and his results are even better than mine. I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, (it&#x27;s not a bad smell but it&#x27;s a little strong for me), thankfully it seems to dissipate within 20 min or so.</li>
    <li> Love 100% pure products. Use this on my eye area. Noticed the fine lines disappeared.  Love the fragrance of this product.</li>
    <li> This is great eye cream!  Certified organic, smells like coffee, what more can a girl ask for?  I&#x27;m using to ease puffiness - which I can actually feel.  At the age of 27, that&#x27;s unfortunately but it&#x27;s from allergies.  This definitely does the trick!  no allergy pills for me, just some amazing eye cream :)</li>
    <li> This actually de-puffs eyes. It smells like coffee a bit and overnight it&#x27;s irritating. Still&lt;br /&gt;, I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and smells good. Makes my skin silky and feels clean. Good price for product. It even takes out puffiness.</li>
    <li> For me it&#x27;s not working maybe for other people does. I&#x27; ve been using for 2 weeks with no results and i still have puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I have ever used. I love the smell and how it softens the skin around my eyes. It feels so good that I look forward to using it.</li>
    <li> delivery was on time. Nice product. It does not work miracles, but makes a bit of difference and feels and smells very pleasant. I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for a few years and I love it! It absorbs easily and I even mix it with a few drops of foundation to use under my eyes to prevent creases in my makeup.</li>
    <li> So i bought this because i was told organic was better and I saw all the awesome reviews. It came very quickly, not even three days after i bought it and i love it. The smell isent over whelming, i actually didnt notice a smell at first . Me personally, im Semi alergic to spicy food, i can eat it and all but to much of it within a short period of time and i break out in a rash. I use Hydrocordazone( however u spell it) , to get rid of the rash on my face but my face still feels icky , red, bumby and hot after that for a few days. I decided to just put it on a little bit to see if it wud help. It feels a lot better, still irradiated but it dousent feel icky like it did and definably feels a lot more comfortable .</li>
    <li> Smells good, goes on smooth. Haven&#x27;t really noticed if it works, but I am bad at paying attention to it. I have sensitive skin and it does not make me break out.</li>
    <li> Hello guys...&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought this item. I have a deep dark circles on my face  which are like really dark. I am most likely to buy natural and organic products. So I ran into this item while googling. After reading all the reviews I have decided to buy it. I am using this item since a month. I can&#x27;t really see any change instead it leaves my eyes reddish in color. May be it doesn&#x27;t suits for me. Even if it works for anyone else. But it&#x27;s not worth the given price</li>
    <li> This is a nice feeling cream, smells good and I like that it&#x27;s organic.  Sorry to say it didn&#x27;t work for my problem.  I have allergies though, and my eyes are constantly swelling.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products, so maybe nothing else would work either.</li>
    <li> I really like this eye cream. I used department store brands for years, but have been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I put on my skin, and so turned to 100% Pure. This creams works very well. I use this in the morning first thing and it truly reduces puffy morning eyes. I like to do it right after I wash my face, but before I do my eye make up, so it can soak in. It smells a bit like coffee, but I figure that is better than artificial fragrance. All synthetic fragrances do is mask chemical odors anyway. I have used this eye cream for months and see an improvement in the appearance of the skin around my eyes. Even better, it has not created any of the little white bumps that result from clogged pores that I have experienced with well-known department store brands. I will continue buying this one!</li>
    <li> I usually hate cream. I hate putting creams and oily junk on my face. I dont ever put sun screen on my face. Im latin and we dont need extra oil. But as I get older Im starting to see more crows by my eyes and smile lines. So Im trying to break my bad habit of not using creams. If youre like me me when it comes to creams and lotions, then this is the product for you. I really like this product. The smell is a little weird but its not bad. I dont drink coffee and think the smell can be overwhelming some times but it doesnt smell like coffee. Its mild and goes away within a few minutes. It feels good and Ive noticed a difference around my eyes. Really good product and a even better price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after a few months of using this product I realized why I wasnt sleeping very well. Its coffee, Duh! I dont drink coffee or do caffeine. Its also started burning a bit in my eyes area. If you dont have issues with caffeine, this is great- but if you do, might want to stay away from this product.</li>
    <li> Amazingly, instead of moisturizing my eyelids and under-eye area, this actually dried the skin out so that it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;No difference in puffiness. Not sure if the circles went lighter. If they did it&lt;br /&gt;was hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;So I wasted another 15 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;Can anyone recommend a eye cream that REALLY DOES reduce puffiness and dark circles?</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! Makes me want to eat it. I put it on at night and in the morning and its definitely lightening up the area under my eyes (i put it on my entire face though, can&#x27;t resist!)</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. I&#x27;m a woman over 40 and have a few wrinkles around the eyes. I see absolutely no difference after using it daily and nightly for 2 months. It&#x27;s ok as a cream. I don&#x27;t mind the slight coffee fragrance.</li>
    <li> So far I am very pleased with the product.  I ordered it when I saw it advertised and demonstrated on Dr. Oz (highly respected program with good recommendations).  The product appears to work very well.  Definitely love the smell... has the smell of fresh coffee.</li>
    <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product.  It didn&#x27;t come with directions, when I first tried to get any of this out of the tube the right way, the bottom of the plastic tube broke open, so I could never use this properly, and the bags under my eyes are just as big as before.  I would never recommend this to anyone, and I wonder if it worked for other women who bought it because of The Dr Oz show.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I have ever used. The dark circles and puffiness go away. It is moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item just as the pollen got intense, and my dark puffy bags were ugly even before that. Although it has not completely eradicated them, it has made a noticeable improvement in both darkness and puffiness. I imagine that the improvement would be even more pronounced if it weren&#x27;t the middle of April right now. It also helps smooth the wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;that have developed around the outside edges of the puffs when I apply it. I enjoy applying it because it is silky  feeling and smells like sugar cookies. All in all, I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time to try it and I have noticed a visible difference in the dark circles and puffiness. It is light and does not cake up under the eyes. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different and much more expensive creams but this one is definitely the best for me and it is very affordable!</li>
    <li> Coffee bean eye cream is great to use under your eyes in the morning.  It gives you a \\&quot;Now I&#x27;m awake \\&quot; look.  Goes on very smooth and has a nice cooling feel.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and feels great on my skin. I have been using it for about a month now and can tell my dark circles are lighter.</li>
    <li> I am someone who gets 4-6.hrs of sleep every night. Ive heard raves about how coffee can help reduce eye puffiness and darkness so i gave this a try. There hasnt been any change in the way my semi dark and really puffy undereye bags look. The only thing this eye cream seems to do for me is moisturize. It does have a nice scent of coffee. It&#x27;s faint and I cant smell it after I apply on.</li>
    <li> Folks, I had my doubts about this product due to the fact that I have tried so many eye cream in the past, some extremely expensive. The first day I tried this eye cream I saw improvement within hours, I’m not kidding you, it’s amazing, my eyelids was beginning to sag a little, and this eye cream is like a miracle, that extra skin around my eyelids suddenly began to firm, and my eyes looked so awake. I was shocked, I will continue to use this product as longest they continue making it, it does have a little burning sensation when you first put in on, but for the results I’m getting that little issue does not concern me at all.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like coffee, it doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla , it doesn&#x27;t smell like cookies.  The smell is disgusting.  I could be more desciptive but I realize I am with polite company. And on top of that , it does not do anything for my bags under my eyes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I have deep set eyes and they look dark at times. These cream actually helps. People constantly tell me I look years younger and I think it is due to this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for the last few years and I love it. Really wakes your eyes up with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> It might be my imagination, but I see some wrinkles softening.  I&#x27;ve read a lot about the extract, and it seems to be true.</li>
    <li> Amazing product with great results! I recommend this to anyone looking for natural, light skin care products that won&#x27;t be too harsh yet still work wonders. I read [[ASIN:1456613588 Age-Proof: Beauty Alternatives You Need to Know]] recently, and it changed my entire perspective on the importance of natural products. I highly recommend the book as it is an easy, well put together read, full of insightful DIY recipes and natural beauty alternatives that help aging, redness, and much more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued with dark circles under my eyes since I was a child and nothing really has ever worked to get rid of them as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve also started to get puffiness under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve now been using this product for over a month and my eyes do appear to be much more alert than before and I have less darkness and puffiness.  I put it on when I wake up and before I go to bed.  The smell is something that I&#x27;ve had to get used to since it&#x27;s not my favorite, but it&#x27;s not horribly off putting either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I think it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.</li>
    <li> Truly makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I thought this would help the bags under my eyes, but it has not.  I guess when you have a sinus condition nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;I also thought it would help dark rings under the eyes. It has not. It really did not work for me.</li>
    <li> (I&#x27;m Leonardo&#x27;s wife) I&#x27;ve used this product for two weeks, morning and night, and I&#x27;ve noticed a slight improvement in my puffiness, but nothing that much noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong, but it has a coffee vanilla scent that I enjoy. It doesn&#x27;t do miracles, but it helps a little.</li>
    <li> This really works under the eye.  I strongly recommend it to anyone.  I even bought it for a friend of mine whose daughter is getting married to use under her eyes.  It is magical.</li>
    <li> Does not do much for puffy eyes but moisturizing and smells amazing!</li>
    <li> It smelled good but it pilled when rubbed in. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my eyes. Maybe it would have worked better applied at night, since I couldn&#x27;t rub it in.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for months and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a complete difference in my dark circles.  Not sure it&#x27;s any different from just using tea bags, a moisturizer or cucumbers.  I&#x27;m not overly impressed.</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my eyes feel rejuvinated. I wear this in the morning before I put on my make up, it helps my eyes wake up a little bit.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to good reviews. It has a funny smell but I don&#x27;t care. It DID NOT help the puffs under my eyes as most sed. It burned my eyes w/my contacts in and made them blurry. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I use this eye cream every single day and it is FABULOUS.  It 100% completely works at hiding dark circles.  It won&#x27;t get rid of them completely, but it will definitely reduce the darkness under your eyes.  I don&#x27;t have puffiness or fine lines, just dark circles.  I prefer to use it in the morning because it does smell like coffee a little.  Just try it!! For the cost, it&#x27;s 100% worth it.  I have purchased this for several friends and family and I tell everyone about it.  If you look tired all of the time, try this eye cream!!</li>
    <li> So hoping for a solution for my inherited bags under my eyes. But this did not do the trick. The one positive is that it does not irritate either like some other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream on the market. Very gentle around the eye tissue and also great all over face. Great for those with allegories. Very gentle</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews , was hoping it would work wonders for me as well. But it didn&#x27;t do anything. :( waste of money!</li>
    <li> I noticed a very slight difference in this product for the money however I was willing to give it a try. The service was great and I&#x27;m sure they would have given a refund if I wanted it however I didn&#x27;t feel they owed me one.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my skin . Not to greasy but enough to leave your skin supple and smooth .</li>
    <li> This really works!! Within a week I noticed a huge difference in my under eye circles. I work night shift and I usually do not get enough sleep. I bought a very expensive La Mer The Eye Concentrate and used it twice a day for 4 months with no improvement. In fact they were getting worse!!! Out of desperation I searched Amazon and based on the reviews bought 100% Pure. I am sold for life. My little wrinkles are also becoming less noticeable. The smell is fine, honestly it could smell like a sewer and I would still put it on because it works. It is so refreshing to buy a product that delivers on their claims. Thank you :-)</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for!! I have tried everything from $300 La Mer eye cream to over the counter store brand and each had their own downfall and never TRULY moisturized under my eyes-mostly just irritated them. After a bad experience with Clinique I came across this and figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I am SO glad I went with my gut! This is AMAZING!! It hydrates, soothes and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. When I make sure to drink enough water and get sleep it definitely aids in my dark circles if/when I have them. Perfect price too!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best thing I&#x27;ve found for undereye bags and puffiness, and the price is great! You don&#x27;t have to use much to get excellent results.</li>
    <li> GREAT PROCDUCT! I DIDN&#x27;T WANT TO BE TO QUICK WRITING A REVIEW UNTIL I HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IF IT REALLY WORKS. SO FAR, I&#x27;M STARTING TO SEE RESULTS. INSTEAD OF COFFEE, I USE 100% PURE TO HELP ME LOOK ENERGIZE AND NOT TIRED.</li>
    <li> love this eye cream..... not as pricey as some of the other clean ingredient ones that are out on the market</li>
    <li> I first saw this stuff in my friend&#x27;s over night bag when we were traveling together and asked if I could try it. It worked. The results were mild but immediate which is surprising because so far as I am skeptical about most anti aging anti wrinkle anti puff etc., beauty products out there. Not sure what it is except maybe it&#x27;s concentration of the caffeine in it. I&#x27;ve tired other caffeine infused eye products but none of them give me any results.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. I used it a night for a couple days and every time I wash my face to take the product off my eyes get irritated. It smells weird too.</li>
    <li> Ok, I must admit, I never thought I would get old; well maybe old but I would still maintain my Rudolph Valentino/Richard Nixon good looks. Sure, you&#x27;re saying to yourself-yuck; well you have not had the benefit of this lovely mixture of a weird mug your whole life. That doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t need a bit of help occasionally. I was really unsure about this; like when I asked Donna Overnight to the prom; what would she say? Honestly, I have used a number of products, for puffiness from creams to the rollers. This is the only thing I have used where the result is immediate and I when I say immediate, I mean really apparent. It is not heavy, oily nor drying. I am not sure how it works but the results....wow!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 6months now. It does help with the puffiness but did nothing for the dark shadows.</li>
    <li> I used this product for about 2 1/2 weeks.  I didn&#x27;t see any results to reducing my puffy eyes or dark circles.</li>
    <li> I have never used an eye cream that took away puffiness or circles.  I&#x27;m kind of an insomniac and don&#x27;t get much sleep.  Therefore I usually have circles under my eyes.  This cream was amazing.  It took away most of the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  The process is almost immediate.  I put on the cream, then my makeup and by the time I&#x27;m ready to go out the door, my eyes are improved by 80%.  The smell that others complain about is minimal and lasts only a couple seconds.  It is worth giving this product a try.  I use it everyday now that I&#x27;m awar of it and will continue to do so!  I love this product.  The product can last you a long time as another person said.  One whole squirt is a little much.  I use about 1/2 a squirt.  One whole squirt is a lot of cream for under two eye areas.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product.  it smells great.  goes on great. goes a long way.  have purchased twice now. feels great on, not sticky or heavy.</li>
    <li> When i saw &amp;#34;organic coffee bean&amp;#34;, just decided to give a try. It smells so good and my under eyes bags are getting a little firm...  IT&amp;#34;S NOT CHEMICAL!  I&#x27;ll keep using it .</li>
    <li> For the first time, I can put something on my eyes and not have any allergic&lt;br /&gt;reaction.  I&#x27;m still waiting for the long term results, but so far my eyes feel&lt;br /&gt;nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of eye creams and this has to be my favorite. It has a lovely coffee smell which is really invigorating. A lot of eye creams are either too thick or too watery. I find the consistency of this just right. It absorbs quickly without much rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have hereditary dark circles and after going through so many eye creams, I have given up hope on getting rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t say that this has reduced my dark circles, but the skin under my eyes have improved and my circles aren&#x27;t getting worse even with many late nights. And it feels really good putting this on after a late night.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 5 months daily twice a day and I have yet to finish the tube. The only con I can say is with the pump which doesn&#x27;t work properly, so that I end up opening it up.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase this after I finish this tube.</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived and would not pump the cream. Taking the lid off I discovered most of the tube was dry and had a hard time getting any out.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the product.  The first one was 7 years ago and it was in a small glass bottle.  This time, it is in a tube with a pump at the top. I did not really notice anything but I hope no news is good news when it comes to eye creams.  When I used about 2/3, the pump would not work effectively. So, I would open the pump, use a q-tip to dab a little bit onto my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use every morning! depuffs my eyes and allows cover up to glide on smoothly.  beautiful packaging and all natural goodness form the largest organ in our body--skin!</li>
    <li> I have serious issues with luggage bags under my eyes. And I&#x27;ve tried some of the more expensive products in the market. But when I switched to this product it has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the bags completely but I can live with the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see myself switching to any other product at this point.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, consistency and feel of this lotion.  It&#x27;s very nice and I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> so far i like this a lot. the smell is amazing. it&#x27;s almost like a coffee/caffiene smell. great to use in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this creme goes on, not greasy or non-spreading but just right.  However, I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference and I have been using it for about a week now.</li>
    <li> Im down to 1/3 of this cream now and I love it! I feel my eyes open wider and the skin around my eyes feel tighter! Very good for it&#x27;s price and my eyes look more alert. I&#x27;ve never felt this with any other cream. No wonder there&#x27;s already so many positive reviews on here.</li>
    <li> the greatest eye cream I&#x27;ve ever had! Very light, non-allergic, smells good and long-lasting.</li>
    <li> purchased this because it was featured on Dr. Oz...i didn&#x27;t find that it did anything of improvement for my under eye puffyness...</li>
    <li> I have puffiness under my eyes. Maybe you can even call them bags because they rarely disappear. I have had insomnia for decades and that is likely the cause. I tried this product. It smells like capuccino, yummy. But, after using it a few times, my puffiness has not improved one bit. Perhaps it is because the puffiness is fat and not water retention. I am 45 years old and maybe these bags are here to stay.</li>
    <li> I could take it or leave it. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything to write home about.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I can def tell a big difference in the bags and dark circles under my eyes when I use it!</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt and packaging was nice.  I love the smell of this eye cream.  After using it for a year, I feel like it really works.</li>
    <li> Love the scent of this product, it&#x27;s creamy and not greasy; goes on beautifully and absorbs quickly.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s a miracle cure for puffy tired eyes,but it does work.  The puffiness does go down after ten minutes or so of application.  I also use Watts hyaluronic and organic coconut oil with Vit C.  If there were a body cream with this scent, I&#x27;d buy it in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for two weeks, and I have tried every eye cream you can name. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on  those creams you see on TV promising this, and that. This cream works, and I mean... works fast. I put it all over my face, and I can personally say, my face looks brighter... youthful. My dark circle are leaving ... I will buy this product for the rest of my life....so glad I found it. Thank you Pure Cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I got this for eyelid puffiness and it works really great. Having eyelid puffiness is very uncomfortable and annoying. I can see a difference right after application and makes them feel light and it&#x27;s soothing. I will definitely recommend this and buy again and again. And I love the smell.</li>
    <li> Smells funny and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Very gentle on my sensitive eye area. Other moisturizers make my skin burn around my eyes. This one does not. And it makes my dark puffy circles look better than other moisturizers I can tolerate.</li>
    <li> I sleep on my stomach and started getting puffy eyes in my late 20&#x27;s. After extensive research, I discovered three ways to combat swelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Sleeping on your back with an elevated head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Cold compresses (who has time for that in the morning?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied topically, caffeine is thought to constrict blood vessels-- expelling excess liquid. There is no published research confirming this hypothesis and the mechanism for penetration is not understood (if it exists).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, putting this caffeine infused cream around my eyes before bed has eliminated my morning puffiness.</li>
    <li> smells great!!!! but it hasn&#x27;t help me with my dark circles not happy at all. wasted my money pretty much</li>
    <li> The smell is awful, and it does not work!  It is so demeaning to keep buying products with such high claims and never meet them.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product but NEVER, NEVER order from YourShop.  The item listed is 1 fl oz but these folks only send 0.5 fl oz but label the bag it is sent in 1 fl oz. Guess they figure you would not notice.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and helps with dark circles</li>
    <li> I have really puffy eyes and noticeable dark circles under my eyes. As a full time college student with a part time job, I can tell you I get no sleep and it shows under my eyes. The scent reminds me of sweet and mild pandan leaves which is quite pleasant. There was a distinct difference when I started using this particular eye cream, compared to other eye creams I have used in the past. Not only it&#x27;s organic, but I really am pleased how I do not develop an eye irritation. It is probably because my previous eye creams had chemicals and made my eye puffiness worse. On Amazon, this is such a great deal, and the fact that it works... I am just speechless by the formula.</li>
    <li> I love it i will buy another one soon I finish it</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, non greasy eye cream to use anytime and it does very well under makeup. I didn&#x27;t really believe it could firm up the under eye area but I was surprised that it does!</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this eye cream and I love it. Smells great and really takes the puffiness out</li>
    <li> It was like rubbing coffee grounds on my face. I know some people are more sensitive to smell than others. It got tremendous reviews. I just didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> It seems to be helping with the dark circles.  You only need to use a little, and it smells nice too.  I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have had this before and have just loved it. It used to be in a glass container with a pump which I loved, now that they have changed the container it has been disappointing, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work so I have to twist it off to try to get anything out. The actual product itself is just as great, but since it is a pain to get it out of the container, it certainly doesn&#x27;t make me as happy.</li>
    <li> Thank you for selling this product ! I have been suffering from allergies and waking up with swollen eye lids and a huge amount of puffiness. I looked tired and aged. I was so sad and miserable I knew I needed to find something to help. I found this product and immediately decided to invest since it had amazing  reviews and I am so glad I did. This stuff is amazing! It worked almost immediately after application on my upper and lower eyelids.  The swelling began to subdue and for the first time in almost 2 weeks I could so my eyes again (yes swelling was that severe). It smells great and comes in a really nice package container. It is a bit pricey but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I tried it for two weeks, and it&#x27;s not working for me since then to now. I&#x27;ll keep trying for a longer time.</li>
    <li> This is a bogus product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.  It comes in packaging that says &#x27;THIS IS PART OF A SET - DO NOT SELL SEPARATELY.&amp;#34;  My portion  was separate.  Goodness knows what else it was supposed to be with or how old it actually was.  There was a plastic tape around the packaging as if someone had re-sealed with plastic packing tape.  I was afraid to use it.  Whatever it was, it was not sold as intended</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s been about a month since I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I get enough rest, and drink enough water, I can&#x27;t tell much difference from day to day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT comparing my eyes now to what they were before I started using this product, it&#x27;s immediately clear that the skin under my eyes is less puffy and not so dark.My dark circles are genetic, so I don&#x27;t think they will ever complelety go away, but the cream has made the darkness much less severe - I don&#x27;t look so haunted without makeup now lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I massage the cream all around the top of my eye and bottom for about two minutes every morning.  I can kind of feel the caffeinne getting my blood circulating around my eyes as I massage the cream in, which I think is cool.  I used to get dry patches on the tops of my eyelids and don&#x27;t have that problem any more either.  I can smell the cream when I initally put it on my face - VERY faint coffee scent - but by the time I&#x27;ve massaged about half of the cream into my skin even that faint whiff is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the quantity I think this is a good price. I only use a squirt a day and even that is a bit too mch - the cream comes out of the spout when I depress it AND when I release it, so it&#x27;s like I get twice the amount in every squirt.  I&#x27;m not sure how to stop that from happenning.  Going to try using it with the spout facing upright and see if that helps.  Even with the double squirt thing, I&#x27;m not even halfway through the bottle.  And again I&#x27;ve been using this for at least a month, every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resting and eating well and staying hydrated are the most effective remedies for my dark puffy eyes, but since I find all that hard to do every day this cream makes a darn good substitute for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/16/14:  OK...I just ordered another bottle of this stuff, but I&#x27;m STILL using this first bottle.  It&#x27;ll probably run out in another week.  That&#x27;s almost 5 months on an ounce of this stuff.  Seriously?!  Great deal.  Effects are still the same.  The spout thing&#x27;s still a problem, so I only depress it about halfway, so the depress and release combined are just enough for both eyes instead of too much.e same.  The spout thing&#x27;s still a problem, so I only depress it about halfway, so the depress and release combined are just enough for both eyes instead of too much.</li>
    <li> I received the product within a few days. The invoice said it was sold by \\&quot;EVERYTHING 24 7\\&quot;. First of all, the pump did not work and I noticed that the product was pasty and did not spread well on the skin. I checked the date on the crimp of the tube and found that it had expired in April of 2013! This product was a year old....very disappointed. I will be returning for a refund.</li>
    <li> I tried some different eye cream or eye serum. I don&#x27;t know why but all of them hurt my skin, and what&#x27;s worse, they didn&#x27;t work, including Clinique and Body Shop. But this one is creamy and gentle, easy to absorb.  I found it works really well on puffiness, but my biggest problem is my dark cycle. I am using it twice daily and I am waiting for the surprise.</li>
    <li> This product arrived within days.  it is missing the tube inside which enables the pump action to work. however, I did not contact the seller, as it works just fine when you take off the lid.  It does have a definite coffee odor, which dissipates in about 2 hours.</li>
    <li> I have never worn makeup or even much moisturizer.  One morning I saw my reflection in a darkened window and knew I should do something about it. I took before pictures and after few days I noticed a big difference.  Friends were commenting that I looked younger.  I&#x27;m not much for a lot of &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; but this is a permanent part of my day now.</li>
    <li> I use it all the time</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this works great for me. I have some darkness under my eyes but mostly puffiness.. I have used it for over 2 weeks now and it has become my favorite part of my morning routine. I apply it before my make up and let it sit for a bit before applying my bare essential fountain powder. I have seen a difference and it smells yummy too.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference at all in puffiness or dark circles.  Smell didn&#x27;t bother me (it is strong), no allergic reaction, I suppose it would work as a cream, didn&#x27;t work for what I bought it for or that which it is advertised for.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product. It felt greasy and heavy under my eyes. It felt like it keep getting into my eyes, my vision would get blurry. I even had to go wipe it off before going out and re-do the entire \\&quot;eye process\\&quot; again. I only use at night now but only because I have it. I would not buy this product again. Also,I did not see any results.</li>
    <li> This product is good for the budget.  Keeps your eyes hydrated, but for me, it didn&#x27;t do anything for my puffiness under the eye.</li>
    <li> Pros: smells amazing, and I now use as a makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I don&#x27;t notice any less bags or more alertness in my eye area. I put it on at both night and in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty bummed but it&#x27;s a great smelling moisturizer and now makeup remover!</li>
    <li> Definitely not a miracle worker. I wish it were more potent to help with under eye bags better, but I appreciate quality of the product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like coffee to me. It smells like those packaged cakes you  can buy at Asian/Oriental stores. lol  The scent is very light though and goes away rather quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t really help with wrinkles or anything. Keeps my eyes moisturized for at least half of the day; and doesn&#x27;t look oily or greasy all day long either.  Not bad, but not great.  Needs more.</li>
    <li> I so fell in love with this product that I ordered another one  immediatedly! It definitely depuffs and made my skin eye area softer. I love the caffeine smell when you apply it and the fact it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> I hate the dark circles I get naturally. I can&#x27;t say they go AWAY with this, but I can see the difference for sure. Plus it smells good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about a year now and I absolutely love it. I use it every morning. Lot only does the coffee scent help wake me up, but it also helps with brightening my under eyes. The only criticism I have is that I was told it helps with fine lines and I do not think it does.</li>
    <li> The cream smells good, but cream itself is not as fine as other cream. It feels like a scrub cream. I used for 2 weeks, it irritate my eyelids. It makes my wrinkle disappear, because my eyes kind of puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I am a caffeine sensitive person, if I applied it in the evening, I couldn&#x27;t fall asleep at night.</li>
    <li> This is my first review. When I am tired and have bags, I place a little of these cream under my eyes and it dramatically improves the bags. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Good price and service.</li>
    <li> Smells great, works very well!</li>
    <li> Smells so yummy!! Haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in the puffiness, but the color looks better when I use it. I can tell when I do and do not use it. It is not a miracle cream by any chance, but it makes a small difference that is good enough for me! And seriously the smell is so heavenly!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description very well ... I thought I was buying a product for line and wrinkles.  This is more of a &#x27;bags&#x27; and dark circles product that I don&#x27;t&#x27; really deal with.  I am using it and like it ... can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find anything that isn&#x27;t absolutely perfect about this eye cream...(except perhaps the pump which when I&#x27;m half the way through clogs up and I have to take the top off and scrape it out).  Small price to pay for this really inexpensive product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is vanilla/coffee (and I really don&#x27;t care for either scent), but it smells different than most artificially scented beauty items because it truly is 100 percent pure.  The vanilla/coffee disappears very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the perfect consistency for both upper and lower lids, and the perfect slip for makeup (the makeup goes on right over it...perfect)  I don&#x27;t get the reviewer who had it in her eyes for days, but maybe her eyes are shaped differently.  I don&#x27;t use very much, but when I do get a little too much out I put some on my cheeks (makes a really good anything cream).  I also always put some over my upper lip as I do with any eye cream to help with a few vertical lines.  I was using a very high end product which I really liked (never thought I&#x27;d use anything else), and then I gave this a try, and I just can&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just had to write this review because I&#x27;m purchasing my fourth bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:040612-&lt;br /&gt;After trying the new packaging with the pump, I wish I could take off a star.  The product is still remarkable (even better, acually), but the new pump...well...it broke off at the top (and I&#x27;m very easy on my things), and I now&lt;br /&gt;have to squeeze it out.  I&#x27;m going to have to buy the smaller version.  I will never be able to get it all out.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only under eye creams that work for me. They reduce puffiness and make my dark circles appear less dark. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, once a day, and I won&#x27;t use any other product. Overall very pleased</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had puffy under eyes and dark circles as long as I remembered.  I bought this based on another review and could not be more pleased.  I apply it usually just in the morning after a shower and before makeup.  The change has been remarkable.  No more puffiness and the dark under eye is completely gone.  Definitely recommend.  The tube is small but you don&#x27;t need much to apply.  I&#x27;m guessing it will last 1-2 months if not more.</li>
    <li> I just started using this product today, so I&#x27;m not going to comment on its effectiveness just yet (depending on how well it works, I may update my review).  It smells great, but here&#x27;s the HUGE downside - the pump on the product I received flat-out didn&#x27;t work.  I cannot stand when companies choose a pump to dispense product and then don&#x27;t ensure that the pump actually works.  If I have to take the pump off and squeeze the product, then just use squeeze-tube packaging.  I&#x27;m very irritated.</li>
    <li> This is my second tube. I noticed that my tiny lines on my eye lids were gone before I finished the first one. I&#x27;ve tried other eye creams before (Olay, L&#x27;Oreal) but they burned my eye lid skin. This one is sensitive enough yet powerful. I&#x27;ve been slowly switching all my cosmetics to organic. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for several years and really like it. It is creamy, applies easily and reduces puffiness under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an add on, and I love it.  I love the smell.  And I do not like coffee.  I don&#x27;t drink it.  But this is wonderful.  I still have the wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes, but they do look a litter better.  I will be buying more of this and others products of 100% Pure.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by the results. My eyes are less puffy and feel hydrated. I would highly recommend this product. It didn&#x27;t do much for my dark circles so that&#x27;s why I gave it a 4 star rating instead of 5.</li>
    <li> I bought it first time. I personally like organic products, works for me. Would recommend it to buy. LIke that smells naturally.</li>
    <li> I really like how it softens around the eyes. But I can&#x27;t say that it rids the dark circles. Have purchased this 2 times.</li>
    <li> smell so good. love it!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the effect. I don&#x27;t drink coffee anymore, so the refreshing cream around eyes helps waking up. Interesting effect. But i don&#x27;t use it at night, for the same &amp;#34;waking up&amp;#34; reason :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American, older with oily skin.  My under eye area is darker and has bags sometimes.  I do not have wrinkles. This is turning out to be a moisturizer and that&#x27;s it.  The good news is this is the ONLY eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  All the other eye creams, my under eye area breaks out in a few days, not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.  I&#x27;ve bee using it for a month.  I&#x27;ll update in a few months.</li>
    <li> I am afraid to try this again.  It was all natural so I didn&#x27;t worry about my sensitive skin.  Wrong! All natural does not mean just anyone can use it.  It burned my eyes and left little bumps under my eyes and on the crow&#x27;s feet side of my eyes too.  Once I have some time when I do not have outside obligations I will try it again.  I will weigh in on the after-effects then.</li>
    <li> The smell is different but I used to the pure cosmetic line and now after 2 years of using it I don;t even notice it and the product works!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I hate to give this product 3 stars, but the packaging is terrible I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t make this product in a squeeze tube or something that doesn&#x27;t make too much product come out, or NONE AT ALL. The product itself is great, but the packaging needs improvement.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy, does absolutely nothing but that!</li>
    <li> Cream is good itself, but the pump I got was broken and now I have to squeeze it out manually. I need to talk to the seller about this.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference. Placebo effect must work wonders on the rest.  Smells like coffee. The container pump was broken.  But I&#x27;m still using it so it won&#x27;t be a complete waste.</li>
    <li> I am looking for a miracle dark circle eraser, and this isn&#x27;t it. It is moisturizing and smells nice, but other than that I notice that it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my eyes. I have been using it for 4 weeks straight. No difference! I started using kiehl&#x27;s avocado eye cream, and after one week, bam!  Results!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream it works for dark circles and puffiness and don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s anti-aging too.  Just what we all need. Really our eyes age really fast and better to start as soon as possible and the price is good affordable.</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have tried everything on my puffy dark circles.  This stuff is the holy grail of eye creams!!&lt;br /&gt;As and added bonus it smells like chocolate chip cookie dough....no really, it does!! If you are not seeing results try using a bit more until you find the right level.  It will ALL soak in but may be more effective for those with huge bags like mine to apply a more liberal amount.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The scent is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;2) It moisturized well, yet absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;3) Price is good! I sometimes use it allover my face :)&lt;br /&gt;4) It does not irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;5) It does seem to reduce morning puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all--a great eye cream!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see that it really minimized puffy eyes, but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I bought this because it was supposed to help with under-eye puffiness. Did nothing.</li>
    <li> Single 1oz tube delivered promptly. Matches description accurately. Comfortable on the skin.</li>
    <li> I used it every morning and night for more than I should have.&lt;br /&gt;It made the skin around my eyes red and it had this very odd smell.&lt;br /&gt;Sort of like vanilla and something else but gone bad and stale. I had read about this smell in some reviews but tried it anyway. BAD CHOICE.</li>
    <li> Would not but again in fear of the pump not working on the tube again ....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasting product due to the fact that I am now aqueezing the tube instead of the pump which causes me to  be wasting the product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using eye cream. I have little puffiness under my eye and wanted to get rid of it and read that you should use products with caffeine in them. I have been using this for 3 days now, morning and night and sadly I see no difference after applying it. I also use other face lotions and rinse my face with ice cold water. Nothing appears to be working so far. Not sure if I am supposed to wait longer to see any difference or instantly see a change. Would not recommend to anyone to buy as it is pricey to try. It also has a strong smell. I am not sensitive to smells, but this one in particular is very strong. It goes away after a while though. It is not a stink smell, just the ingredients or whatever it is.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s light and very creamy at the same time. It absorbs quickly and it gives a great sensation of relief. It helps your skin stay moisturized for a long time. Also, it does diminish dark circles, which is wonderful. Of course, you DO have to rest well, you can&#x27;t expect it to make miracles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and this cream has helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> amazing cream. when i read that it would take puffiness away from eyes i was like &amp;#34;nah i gotta try it to see&amp;#34; since i wake up 1.5 hrs before work i dont like looking like i just woke up and this makes me look like if i was already awake since longer then that. so it works.</li>
    <li> I must say this item does work.feels great on your skin and is great all around. Thank you</li>
    <li> didnt see any change after 2 months :(</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with high hopes, due to some favorable reviews from other customers. My own experience with this cream is, unfortunately, not good. Let me say first of all that I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the miracle product that can shrink the baggy puffiness under my eyes. I&#x27;ve had a problem with this most of my life. Not only did this cream NOT help puffiness but it made my eyes feel itchy and dry, and made my eyes water. So I would definitely not recommend it, or order it again.</li>
    <li> I like this eye cream a lot but I don&#x27;t love it. I use it at night and sparingly for the day. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and firms the eye area some. For day time, use sparingly, not glopping it on thick like you do at night. The ingredients in this cream are all natural, no chemicals.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001189I3A 100% Pure Cosmetics - Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream, 1 fl oz cream]]Love this stuff, best eye-cream I have ever tried. I have major bags under my eyes, totally takes away my bags. love it can not say enough how awesome this product is.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if this works in any way that it is advertised.  I have seen no difference after three months of use.  And, it is a horrible moisturizer.  It is more like a lotion, almost watery.</li>
    <li> After some stressful life changing events I started to develop dark circles and puffiness underneath my eyes. This was highly stressful for me because I have always been pleased with my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has made a significant improvement in the puffiness. The dark circles have lessened, but after one week of consistent use, applying twice daily, I cant say I would rely on this product for treating dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to be environmentally conscious and I thought the packaging was a little much. We don&#x27;t need that much packaging for such a small tube. It makes me wonder how much less the product would cost if the packaging were streamlined by getting rid of the heavy duty card board tube the product comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is present but does not linger and is not a problem for me. The texture is luxurious and it only takes one pump from the tube to do both eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the product and if the dark circles diminish further I will come back and rate the cream higher.</li>
    <li> I originally got this for my clients (i am a massage therapist) for when i am massaging the face, but after a while they told me that it was working so well for them and I decided to get my own tube. They were right!  its an amazing product and isnt oily or heavy....and made any dark circles I had disappear after about a weeks use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye cream to use during the day as I read you should use eye creams with retinols to fight wrinkles at night.  I love the tube is made inverted so you use every bit of the product.  Mild formula on the eyes and very nice.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because it did what it says it will do.  However, it didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for the puffiness or dark circles. :-(  If I want to use it as a general eye cream only, it could be fine.  It feels very nice and the scent is wonderful (reminds me of buttered popcorn).</li>
    <li> First, I&#x27;m a 30-something year old guy. I work a professional desk job, go to the gym, wake up early (5am). I guess you could say a manly-ish man. I don&#x27;t wear make-up and generally, have never worried too much about my facial features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after 30, I noticed that someone kept leaving their complete luggage set under my eyes every morning. For a large part of my life, I worse prescription glasses and never wore sunglasses on a regular basis. I&#x27;m sure the puffiness and dark circles are from years of squinting outside. That, or insomnia. In either case, I needed a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asking one of my gay friends what to do, and was recommended to research &amp;#34;caffeine.&amp;#34;  He originally recommended putting used teabags over my eyes. Which sounded ridiculous, if not slightly hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after some research, I found this product and decided to give it a go. It&#x27;s all-natural, which is great if you have very sensitive [facial] skin. I didn&#x27;t notice anything after the first week, but decided to keep going. It wasn&#x27;t until after two month that I noticed a difference: I&#x27;m sure guy&#x27;s skin is different than women&#x27;s, so the results may take longer, but man did this really help. I no longer look tired or exhausted or bulimic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about this cream is that it&#x27;s a small tube, but it goes a long way. One full pump gives way too much cream than you&#x27;ll need. Really, you can get more out of this product by using small pumps (quarter or half pumps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this is just great. It&#x27;s not overwhelming or too powerful. It&#x27;s very faint, but smells great (not fruity... it doesn&#x27;t smell like a candle or a frou-frou woman&#x27;s product). As a guy, I get nervous that people can pick up on these things, but after two months of usage, none of my coworkers or friends picked up on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream absorbs really well. There&#x27;s no sheen when putting it on, and it&#x27;s not obvious that you have it on (it&#x27;s not make-up, so it doesn&#x27;t soften anything, or look like paint). Think of it like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product. I was quite impressed. Guys, if you suffer from really bad dark circles or puffiness, you should seriously consider getting this product. You won&#x27;t look tired... and, like me, you might be compelled to just eat this up because of how it smells...ten anything, or look like paint). Think of it like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t say anything negative about this product. I was quite impressed. Guys, if you suffer from really bad dark circles or puffiness, you should seriously consider getting this product. You won&#x27;t look tired... and, like me, you might be compelled to just eat this up because of how it smells...</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was highly excited to try this product.  But, unfortunately, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  Being a mid to late 20&#x27;s girl, I really just wanted something to help with my dark circles and hold up the aging process a little bit via fine lines starting to form around my eyes.  I love the texture and thickness of this cream.  It really does absorb well and isn&#x27;t creasy at all.  But, it smells like playdough, not coffee-ish, or cocoa-ish even.  I haven&#x27;t noticed an improvement at all.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, so something should&#x27;ve shown by now.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, that the ingredients are listed right on the bottle, and it doesn&#x27;t get any better than organic everything, pretty much.  Just wished it worked better for me!</li>
    <li> Not sure anything works really well but I like the feel of the product and think it helps some.  I will probably purchase again</li>
    <li> Immediate puffiness control. Saw it with my own eyes and tried it on a friend to confirm. Great smell. Good size (1 oz.). Haven&#x27;t seen anything on brightening or clearing dark circles yet but definitively feel it working on fine lines.</li>
    <li> Love this cream. This is a 4th purchase of it over few years and there is nothing similar on the market that is chemical free and gives the results. Bags under eyes disappear as expected every morning. this one is a must!!!!</li>
    <li> After using this product for  almost 2 weeks, I have to say I do not notice any lessening of darkness around my eyes or decrease in wrinkles around my eyes.  I am kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> I do not notice any difference in my eyes from wearing this.  It was quite expensive, but most eye creams are.  I like that it is a natural and organic product as my skin and body are quite sensitive.  I will not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over 4 months (now almost through with my tube of this eye cream) and it hasn&#x27;t improved my dark circles. I can say that the scent is very pleasant like cocoa butter and moisturizes my eye area though. Most likely won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> Used the cream for over two months.  ZERO EFFECT.  I did like the coffee bean scent, however.</li>
    <li> good product for the money</li>
    <li> This eye cream smells like vanilla and coffee! The smell is subtle and does not last a very long time. I really like the product, it&#x27;s creamy, easy to spread, and works well. The results are not instant, it will take a few days for you to notice a change, but for me, I noticed that the skin around my eyes was less sunken and less dull at around 7 days of usage, 2x a day. I haven&#x27;t seen any new wrinkles pop up and the fine lines around my eyes are less pronounced. My dark circles and eyebags are not so bad and with prolonged usage, it seems to me that the product will help improve the skin texture around my eyes. It is also long-lasting, my brother and I have been using the same bottle for two months, each of us twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like, put the product in the fridge for a cold pick-me-up eye cream in the morning, but beware, the colder it is, the more difficult it may be to pump the product out of the tube later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note: the product should always be stored properly, or it will be difficult to pump it out. Eventually, the product clumps along the sides of the tube and it difficult to get out!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this consistently for long enough, so not sure it&#x27;ll make much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure does smell like a latte tho!  Depends if you like that fragrance.  It&#x27;s ok, not my fav.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has really good ingredients so I really just need to use it every morning and evening after cleansing my skin.  I keep in refrigerator.  I just can&#x27;t speak to its effectiveness because I don&#x27;t use it daily.  Am starting as of 3 days ago to use 2 x/day on one side of my face so will see in a couple of months if I notice any difference in eye brightening and diminished fine lines around eyes.</li>
    <li> This seems okay.  The one I got had a broken pump, but I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of sending it back - so I just open it up and squeeze it out the top.  It seems to reduce the puffiness a bit and it is non irritating.</li>
    <li> At first, from reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical about purchasing the product. However, the coffee smell is actually not over powering, it is more chocolate as some said. Aside from that, just using the product for 1 week, I can see a clearly visible difference in the dark circles under both eyes. I intend on using it till all the dark circles are completely cleared. Also, you only need a small amount for those who have issues with smell; small does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months.  I have very sensitive eye area and quite recently my eyes get puffed and I do get some dark circles underneath them. It&#x27;s a very nice eye cream, it moisturizes really well, the scent is very delicate (definitely not chemical and not overwhelming), it&#x27;s very efficient and goes a long way, it calms down the puffiness nicely, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t do much for the dark circles.  Not for me.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it four stars.  I might buy it again in the future, but right now looking for something that will work on those dark circles..</li>
    <li> This cream have a nice scent and is absorbed very quickly without any greasy residue but I just can&#x27;t tell any difference in the under-eye area- will keep using .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it since 4 days ago, I don&#x27;t see results, maybe is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;But it smells bad, I don&#x27;t like it. I hope this cream works.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it states it will lessen or elminate undereye puffiness. I found that, within 10 days of starting to use it, it really does!!</li>
    <li> This product is incredible.  It goes on smoothly, hydrates beautifully and softens the dark circles and lines.  The scent is so pleasing it makes me look forward to using it.  I have recommended this product to others and after trying mine, they have ordered the product for themselves.  The ingredients are those that you feel good about putting on your skin...all natural.  Thank you 100% Pure Cosmetics for putting out a terrific product.</li>
    <li> This is a very over priced natural ineffective product. Maybe people give it good reviews because of the natural ingredients and the coffee smell. But for me, this eye cream never lightened my dark circles, never diminished my lines and never changed my puffy eyes. I used it at night only and would either waste or put it on heavy because the bottle dispenses too much product for both eyes. On more than one occasion my eye duct would get clogged and my eye would ache like someone punched me. It would go away if I didn&#x27;t use any cream for a few days. This is the only eye cream that ever did that to me. I will never buy or recommend this product. A waste of $20.</li>
    <li> Cream goes on thick and rich and in a matter of minutes did reduce the puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little like cookies but if it helps my puffy eyes I don&#x27;t mind at all.&lt;br /&gt; My eyes are usually puffy due to allergies/sinus so I will probably be using it pretty often.</li>
    <li> This product has an  appealing scent and actually works.  I suffer from seasonal allergies and I wake up with puffy eyes; this product takes care of that problem.  I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> This is my 5th time exploring another product to help get rid of my undereye bag. Don&#x27;t know what happened but it got worst! I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s ever a miracle cream for this.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of eye serums and creams and have paid top dollar for some.  This eye cream is great.  I have been using it for three days and I notice already that the area under my eyes is brighter.  My husband sometimes has puffy eyes and I had him use it, the next morning the puffiness was almost gone.  It&#x27;s great to find a great product at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it had such great reviews on Amazon. However, the first three times I used the product, I found that it smells very bad (like a bag of tortilla chips). I&#x27;m not sure if this means this bottle has gone bad or the product simply smells this way. This is not something you&#x27;d want to be putting on your face every day.</li>
    <li> I do not see any results as far as helping with puffiness under eyes at all. There are products that work better. This could be a great eye cream just for some moisture or what not.</li>
    <li> This eye cream smells great and I believe it freshens up the face providing moisture and energy. Use it every morning and night and it&#x27;s a great way to start my day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for over a month.  I use it mostly @ night because I use another SPF eye cream for day time.  I like it and I happy for the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here my review is based on its claim &amp; $$&lt;br /&gt;Texture: smooth &amp; rich but not heavy, just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: not like tradition coffee smell &amp; i can&#x27;t express what exactly like, but pleasant-candy-like smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: It is an anti-aging agent with various \\&quot;organic\\&quot; vitamins to smooth out noticeable fine lines; its de-puff works well to reduce the puffiness around the eyes;  it may have brightening my stubborn dark circles a little bit, but they still noticeable stick with me ... hope it will get a bit better later since I only use it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$$: It&#x27;s a great eye cream with anti-aging vitamins for the price.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, the feel, the results.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom, it looks very good and organic. I like its smell, and how it&#x27;s soft and not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of daytime eye creams, but keep coming back to this one.  I love the natural ingredients, the great cocoa smell, and the fact that it perks my eyes right up after a long night.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  I was a loyal Artistry eye cream user, but I love the ingredients in the coffee bean eye cream, it lasts forever, and it works great!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Just really strong coffee smell, may be pleasant to some. I see a difference in my eyes in the morning. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> best eye cream I have purchased and currently own. Affordable, smells delish and i can see a difference around my eyes.</li>
    <li> It works! My dark circles are not dark anymore!</li>
    <li> This eye cream is awesome. It does the trick if you have swollen under eyes from lack of sleep, night out or etc. It&#x27;s a saver for those beautiful eyes. And it also softens the fine lines around the delicate area..</li>
    <li> This product is okay but I really wasn&#x27;t that impressed. It smells great but I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> wakes my eyes up in the morning</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a terrible smell, not something that should be a calming smell.&lt;br /&gt;Am not happy with this product would not recommend it to anyone.  Am using something&lt;br /&gt;different now.</li>
    <li> It works to a limited degree.  However the smell is not something I want to smell like.  Its not horrible but its a little like stale coffee.  The creaminess is light.</li>
    <li> This does not do much. As a face lotion it is moisturizing, however as eye cream it is not very effective. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I keep mine in the fridge to last long and am happy to say that I have used this product for about three years. It really lightens the dark circles under my eyes and is a essential part to my daily beauty regime. You only need to use a little bit per application so it really lasts you a long time before you have to buy another one.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to have no effect but to make my eyes burn. It is ok as a moisturizer but no better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. And no effect on fine lines and dark circles.</li>
    <li> before i bought this my eyes felt like i held 2 pounds of fluid in bags under my eyes. I could feel them sag. I have used this for 3 days now and i dont feel my eyes sagging anymore. They feel tighter and look more refreshed. So glad I bought this. This really does work. I will continue to buy this. Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the whole tube up, and i applied it daily. No improvements, whatsoever. I use Organic rosehip oil now instead and it does WONDERS! This product, however.....might be a scam.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I could feel the skin tightening. Smells like coffee.</li>
    <li> I have seen no changes, yet, but I do not know just how long that will take! I&#x27;ve heard great reviews about eye creams with caffeine. I am going to stick with this one for at least 3 more weeks just to be fair!</li>
    <li> Just smells good no results noted</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. It really makes the skin under my eyes look smooth and the price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Smooths the line and wrinkles around the eye.  Love this product</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream and it works quite well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural, affordable skin care products and this fits the bill.  My eyelids have been looking dry and thin while below my eyes puffy and dull.  In just a short time by eyes look brighter and better.  A little goes a long way. It smells and feels good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not sure it makes any difference + I hate the smell. It smells like crap. I am not sure if it does anything, but I have not seen any negative effects.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me...</li>
    <li> very light texture and nice smell... not sure if it really does the trick since no result yet but overall nice product... fast shipment</li>
    <li> I discovered this eye cream through a Living Social deal about a year ago.  It&#x27;s not just for movie stars - it even works on ordinary people, like me : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly LOVE the stuff and tell all my friends about it!!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001189I3A 100% Pure Cosmetics - Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream, 1 fl oz cream]] I have used this product  for a few days now. It does help reduce puffy eyes and dark circles but not instantly. It was non-irritating and it does have a nice smell to it. Give it a few days like I did and you will see some great results. Also, make sure you apply a little at night. This organic coffee bean cream is worth the money  I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Love Love Love.  I have purchased this product many times and I am very pleased with it.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Just okay...I like that this product is all natural and it has a slight scent to it.  I use it everyday , but it does nothing for my dark circles under my eyes and I don&#x27;t think it helps my wrinkles. It just seems like a nice moisturizer. I was really hoping it would work well after reading the reviews, I&#x27;m not going to get it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s safe for your health and I saw results fast. I like that it is 100% pure and I have been using it for a few months and h ave seen major results in reducing my dark circles. Two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This is a very good beauty aid if your eyes are puffy and have dark shadows. I am not exactly a spring chicken and it lightened my eyelids and beneath my eyes. This takes years off a person&#x27;s face. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Smelled good, but couldn&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and I love it! It&#x27;s so gentle and moisturizing. The smell is delicious. It makes the skin around my eye feel so soft. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with wrinkles or bags, so I can&#x27;t say how it is with that. Hopefully it will prevent these things with continuous use.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> could not use this, gave me dark circles under my eyes like adverse effect.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this my eye bags were pretty bad.  After about 1 week of use I saw a noticible difference.  If I could get more sleep, I&#x27;m sure I would see a bigger difference.  I will purchase again.  You won&#x27;t be unhappy if you try this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple days but i LOVE this product it&#x27;s really starting to help with the dark circles under my eyes and with the puffiness. I use it morning and night. I&#x27;m going to buy this for gifts for christmas</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I use all kinds of eye cream this is better than my 110.00 brand because it&#x27;s so cost effective I can use all day long in the morning when I go to work at 430 am it makes my eyes look great no puffy no black circles I just really like this product I keep one in my purse one in bathroom bedroom I give them as gifts  I was so excited to find a product for my eyes that I can afford!!!</li>
    <li> love this product - this one was for a friend who tried mine.  will continue using and gifting friends - thanks</li>
    <li> Too strong smelling and doesn&#x27;t really work. But I might not have used it as consistantly as I should have.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much but the new packaging isn&#x27;t very convenient so what I do is open up the tube so I can get the right amount (pea-sized). I used this every morning prior to putting on makeup and I also used a heavier duty eye cream at night. This is a must item in helping conceal dark circles.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because It contains caffeine and Dr. Oz said that caffeine will reduce puffiness under the eyes.  So, I had high expectations and was very excited to try it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed so see that it does not work for me.  In fact, a while after using it, I went out and saw some friends.  They all told me that my eyes looked very puffy and tired, like I just woke up.  After telling me that, I told them about the eye cream.  Any eye cream that I have ever tried tends to emphasize the puffiness under my eyes instead of reducing it.  I&#x27;m at a loss as to what to do about it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw it reccommened in a magazine.  I don&#x27;t really notice any difference in the skin around my eyes.  It does smell great though!</li>
    <li> I bought this cream to reduce under eye puffiness. I have been using it for several weeks, and it does nothing for my under eye puffiness. However, it is a good moisturizer, I love the way it smells, and it has great ingredients, so I am using it in the meantime until I get something else. If you are looking for an under eye moisturizing cream for skin health around the delicate eye area, this will be good for you; but if you are wanting to reduce under eye puffiness, I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this cream for years and loved it and then the place I bought it from no longer carried it and thank goodness I found it on amazon.  If I wake up with some swelling under my eyes, I put this on and magic - the swelling is gone.  I use it 2 times a day and sometimes even in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> Everything is as I expected.</li>
    <li> Nice attractive smell. Weak results if any.</li>
    <li> If you have hereditary under eye bags, this product will not work for you. AFTER purchasing it, I saw a youtube video where someone said she didn&#x27;t see any results either and would not purchase it again. I will use it up since if nothing else it will moisturize the skin under my eyes. It has a coffee scent, which is not bad. Another disappointing product I&#x27;ll just add to my pile.</li>
    <li> tried it and it worked for what is was an stimulant to reduce puffiness. I have since started using my old eye cream.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream! It smells really good and a little bit goes a long way! I love that it kept my skin or eye area looking fresh and new every morning, but I&#x27;m not to sure it helped with any wrinkles around the eye area???</li>
    <li> Its awesome!! It helps alot with puffiness slowly starting to diminish the dark circles. Mind you i just started using it. Always i used to wake up and only my eyes would be tired. But with this stuff i feel more awake in the morning. I put it on morning and night. Awesome stuff!!</li>
    <li> I use other 100% Pure products and like them a lot but this cream has made absolutely no diffrence in undereye puffiness, and in fact, I think the puffiness is worse.  The pump stopped working after the 2nd day of use.  I love the smell so that&#x27;s not an issue, even though I am sometimes sensitive to fragrance,  but I really wish I&#x27;d seen the results that others seem to have gotten.</li>
    <li> This is now my all time favorite eye cream.  It has made the skin around my eyes very soft &amp; it doesn&#x27;t even irritate my eyes which is common for me with other creams.  It is also highly concentrated so a little goes a long way.  You can&#x27;t beat this stuff for the price.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream over 2 years ago and it really feels comforting on my eyes!  I wake up in the mornings quite often with puffiness both above and below my eyes.  I am 57 years old so I also have wrinkles around my eyes.  Not only does this cream reduce the puffiness, but it also smooths out the wrinkles and allows me to wear eye shadow that stays soft and smooth.  It also brightens the areas around my eyes!  Sometimes I use this cream around my mouth and on my lips because it acts as a good moisturizer.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> It is a relief to be using all natural products.  I was skeptical about the effectiveness of coffee beans but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Smooth creamy, not greasy &amp; natural aroma.</li>
    <li> Works great on my ultra-sensitive skin, but pretty pricy just the same.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever tried, you don&#x27;t get results right away but after about a week of using it, I can say I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my under eye dark circles since that was my biggest issue. I would highly recommend 100 percent pure they definitely have amazing, not to mention, organic products that work incredibly well. I will definitely be repurchasing this product. Plus a little goes a long way so it will definitely last you a while.</li>
    <li> This ins the best caffeine eye cream ever, and it really works!</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS GREAT FOR TAPPING IT AROUND THE EYE&lt;br /&gt;AREA.. DOES TAKE ANY PUFFINESS RIGHT DOWN..&lt;br /&gt;I KEEP MINE IN CHILLED FOR ADDED EFFECT..&lt;br /&gt;A HIGH RECOMMEND..</li>
    <li> I just acquired this so I don&#x27;t know yet whether it works...but it loses 2 stars right off the bat for the misleading and false product description on Amazon.  The first ingredient listed in the product description is &amp;#34;Organic Green Tea.&amp;#34;  On the actual product, Organic Green Tea is the 7th ingredient.  This is very misleading bordering on fraudulent because it&#x27;s a well known fact that the ingredients listed on products are listed in the order of concentration.  The product description on amazon implies that there is much more Green Tea product than there actually is.  The product description ALSO says it has black currant oil in it and I don&#x27;t see that listed anywhere on the actual product.  If it works anyways I&#x27;m not going to be too upset but if it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll be returning it and reporting the fraudulent adverstising to Amazon....maybe I should just tell them anyway....</li>
    <li> I use this in the mornings to try to depuff my puffy under-eye circles. It seems to work so-so (am also using it in conjunction w/Olay eye lifting serum). I think overall my eyes are a bit less puffy toward the end of the day, although I still do have some discoloration. It&#x27;s also a nice moisturizer. Nothing is going to ever work 100% with under eye circles, so this product is probably about as good as you&#x27;ll find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing -- the caffeine in this product does appear to have a &amp;#34;kick.&amp;#34; When I first got it, I used it at night, but then realized that I was sleeping less well (more tossing and turning) than usual. I stopped using it at night, and went back to sleeping normally. Could have been a particularly stressful stretch at work, but why risk it? I only use it in the mornings now.</li>
    <li> Has light fragrance that I find pleasant. Just a little goes a long way. Seems a good quality moisturizer for my eye area, whether or not it is giving any &amp;#34;lift.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have never been without under eye concealer since my teens. It seems like I&#x27;ve tried everything--all the creams and concealers I can find to hide dark circles that are just bad genetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw improvement the first day I used this. It&#x27;s only been a week now, and no, it doens&#x27;t look as bright as it does with concealer under my eyes, but it&#x27;s so improved, I feel comfortabe enough to go out in public without concealer, and that&#x27;s saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use it in the morning after moisturizer...like a previous reviewer said, don&#x27;t waste it by putting it on at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably the coffee, so I&#x27;m assuming any product with caffeine would work as well, but I like that this one is organic.&lt;br /&gt;If you hate coffee the smell will be annoying, but I think it&#x27;s pleasant, and pretty faint.</li>
    <li> Does not really working for me</li>
    <li> It is a very good cream for my puffy eyes</li>
    <li> Does not work very well for me.  I&#x27;m so disappointed!  I am a young woman, who doesn&#x27;t have extremely puffy under eye area, except when I have to be up at 5 AM for work a few days of the week.  Dark lines are something I have struggled with in the under eye area, but they&#x27;re not horrendous.  I just wanted something to help perfect my appearance and make me look more awake, as a quick fix in the mornings.  This just isn&#x27;t the cream for me I guess.  Although, I&#x27;ve been letting my mother use it, who hasn&#x27;t noticed  much of a difference either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I love about this (the reason for the two stars) are: The ingredients and the smell!  I&#x27;m an all natural girl, who loves everything NON-toxic, cruelty free, organic, clean and green.  The ingredients (as well as the 100% Pure line of products) look and are awesome with their clean ingredients, and this under eye cream smells so yummy! Smells like sweet coffee bean. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it worked better for me and my mother, especially for the price!! I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now. I&#x27;m afraid to try any other 100% Pure products because of the price.  I expected it to work better for the price.</li>
    <li> This is a highly effective eye cream, but I use it on my neck and chest as well to diminish the appearance of lines and wrinkles.  It does a great job and it smells so good.  Reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> The scent is great and I believe the coffee bean caffein wakes up my eyes like no other eye cream.</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a pleasant texture and scent. I cannot tell it has helped my problems with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have been using it for two months. I do like that it is organic. But I think maybe I may have to go back to using a non-organic product for my desired results.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  This works out great.  I have tried many anti-puff creams, and this one I like the most.  It helps with the swelling under the eyes most definitely compared to others I have tried.  It provides you with the needed moisture and smells great!  I use this twice a day and it has helped with my chronic puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to the company-- add more coffee bean, I would like it to pack more of a punch!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen significant improvement from using this product after about a month, but an eye cream can only help so much with puffy eyes. I like that it uses organic ingredients and that it smells pretty good.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s natural, vegan, silky, and really helps with my dark circles. It&#x27;s not a miracle by any means, but it helps as much as I feel it should with what it advertizes. I would not use this if you wanted to treat something like wrinkles, but it&#x27;s very hydrating so it&#x27;s great for preventative measures. I use it twice a day in addition to massage to relieve my dark circles and it seems to work great. My only complaint is that the bottle can be really stubborn and I have to give it several pumps before any product will come out, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! It hydrates and de-puffs brilliantly. The smell is delightful, and given enough time to absorb it&#x27;s a great base for concealer. The only consistent flaw is the pump design. I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of products from 100% pure and they can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to design a decent product pump. If you don&#x27;t mind taking off the lid every single time you use the eye cream you&#x27;ll be really happy. I consider this to be a must-have skin care product, and amazon has the best prices I&#x27;ve found thus far.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this item and I am very anxious to see some results. My under eyes are very dark and puffy. When I received the product I was excited but then realized that the pump didn&#x27;t work. I squeezed some cream out which seems to work fine. However I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. Going by the previous reviews, is the reason that I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the product a few times and for some reason I really don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;It also tends to irritate my eyes... so I keep it away from my eyelids and eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m picky. This product does not sting when I get it in my eye on accident. I personally love the smell (yes it has a coffee scent). I definitely believe my eyes look and feel younger. I don&#x27;t remember to use it everyday and I&#x27;ve probably only used half of the tube and yet my dark circles and bags are gone! I will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I have used this for a month and don&#x27;t think it made much of a change in my circles under my eyes. it is an ok moisturizing cream but does not do much else. It has a faint smell of coffee that goes away after a while, which I didn&#x27;t mind. Overall, I think nothing can change dark circles or baggy eyes!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this eye cream, as I&#x27;ve heard great things about the 100%Pure line of products. The good: it&#x27;s not too thick and it&#x27;s not too thin, it absorbs quickly, &amp; it smells good (like coffee kinda). The bad: it started drying my skin out and the fine lines became more visible. I had to stop using it after a week.</li>
    <li> I needed something to help with my tired eyes after having my newborn. This product helped me look like something other than a zombie and it smells great!</li>
    <li> I am a little disappointed in this product. It does help a little, about the same as other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> smells like dreams! Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> I bought a whole 1 oz bottle and used it often and when there&#x27;s a little left on the bottom (months later) I still can&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use that many products and have stopped using conventional beauty/personal products for a long time.  I like 100% Pure because of the promise of natural and organic ingredients.  So I do try and still use a lot of products from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I used it very religiously, in the morning and at night after brushing and washing my face for bed.  The reason I bought it was because I noticed a couple of fine lines around each of my eyes when I laughed.  I have never had bags or circles under my eyes.  I feel that this product doesn&#x27;t really do anything nor does it produce a difference for my eyes.  After a while, maybe 70-80% of the product was used up, I just kinda gave up and stopped using it. I think that if it&#x27;s going to work I should have seen a difference already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t found another alternative for eye cream.</li>
    <li> This is a good rich cream, but it smells like you are putting mocha coffee all around your eyes. That isn&#x27;t a bad thing, just not what&lt;br /&gt;you expect to experience when applying eye cream. One big negative....the pump on the tube is really bad.  Either you get nothing, or a huge glob!  That needs some work!</li>
    <li> Great product.  I had really dark circles when I stared.  They are not gone completely, however I have noticed a significant difference when I put this product on before my makeup.  Love the smell too - even though I am not a coffee drinker.</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m 60, this smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate .</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for the puffiness of my eyes but i still like the smell of it and still use it every day. Probably won&#x27;t buy another bottle though</li>
    <li> Thee best.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I bought this in hopes of addressing my dark under eye circles but I don&#x27;t have any eye bags or puffiness.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for me except cause irritation.  No matter how carefully I apply this under my eyes, it immediately runs into my eyes and causes a burning sensation and clouds up my contact lenses.  My eyes end up feeling puffy and irritated all day.</li>
    <li> Ok.  I&#x27;m not going to say this stuff has produced miracles, but I do think it has helped to make my under eye darkness somewhat lighter.  I try to use it each day.  Also, it smells good...like coffee with cream and sugar.</li>
    <li> I first heard about this product from my mother-in-law, and then I did a lot of research about it online. My job is time-consuming, so my problem has always been massive dark circles under my eyes. I bought this product in the hopes that it would help make them disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now, and although my dark circles are not completely gone, I can definitely tell a difference. I use this creme every morning between washing my face and applying make-up. You need VERY LITTLE product between both eyes...hardly even a pump. This was a nice fact, since the bottle appears so small for the price. This product illuminates my under-eyes, especially when applied under my foundation. It has a very prominent coffee scent, which is also a nice perk (haha) when I&#x27;m getting ready early in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest not using this product right before bed, because the coffee scent may way you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;PROS - very little needed, great coffee scent, early-morning pick-me-up, seems to be working on my under-eye circles&lt;br /&gt;CONS - a little pricy (but again, you really dont need much at all with each application), great coffee scent may keep you from falling asleep at night</li>
    <li> Heard about this one from Dr. Oz...  may not totally eliminate dark circles but it serves well as a great moisturizer around the eyes.</li>
    <li> This really does help with the black under my eyes and I very much plan to buy more! It was my first try at an eye cream (30s panic) and I am very satisfied! Only I find I have to apply it up to five times a day. A little does go a long way so its not that bad.. the bottle itself doesn&#x27;t have any instructions on it as far as how much or how often. I love the smell! Product arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> First off, I have to compliment Amazon on their wonderful delivery time. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the packaging of this product was absolutely adorable. Upon opening the package, I noticed the cream was in a pump tube, which is a plus, but it limits the control on the amount I can squeeze out at a time. Trust me you will only need about 2/3 or less of the cream that comes out of each pump. In that regard I feel that it is a bit of a waste, but I suppose I can deal with it because it is an all natural product. With that said, the smell is awful. I enjoy coffee smells, and even I thought that some of the other complaints regarding the smell were exaggerations. However, that is not the case. For some reason it does not smell like coffee. It is sort of a nauseating warm smell with a hint of expired butter cream and butter scotch. I know that all noses are different, and that each of us like different smells, but even for me this was too much. If you want to avoid smelling the product while applying, hold your breath and apply away from the nose as far up to the eye area as possible. I would not use it as a moisturizer because of the smell. It has a very emollient texture and it is a bit oily at first. I have oily to normal skin, so I do not use moisturizers (even though I should)(it does absorb well though in given time). I rather not take the risk of using this as a moisturizer because it is not diluted enough. As an eye cream it is a good product. I am excited to see the results within the next few weeks and will edit this review regarding the effects of the product. I am very please it is all natural. The other few body products from 100% pure are a bit of a bust for me, but their blush and powder/pressed makeups are lovely!</li>
    <li> I found that the organic coffee bean eye cream does help reduce my occasional  under eye puffiness from lack of sleep, etc.</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks because it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of nasty chemicals. I also use it almost daily because it leaves my eyes looking less puffy and more refreshed looking.</li>
    <li> Great Eye Cream, works as described, I have very sensitive eyes, this does not break mine out. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY eye cream that works for me.  Within one week of using it I could see a small difference.  The effects continue to improve.  The aroma is also very pleasant.  I have been tried a lot of other creams which cost MUCH more and NONE of them have given me the visible results that this product has..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in skin tone or miraculous effects that others have noticed, but a nice product overall.</li>
    <li> I really love this eye cream.  It is my second time buying it.  It smells nice, goes on nicely and I feel like it does make my eyes look a bit more awake. However, this is new packaging and the pump does not work.  I have to pound and pound on the container to get the pump to work and then it squirts out waaaaay too much and wastes the product.  I may return it for this reason and hopefully the next one will be better. However, i think it is due to the tubeless pump.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have eye bag under my eyes. However, it doesn&#x27;t help very much. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Saw improvement within the first couple of days using the cream.  Reduced puffiness and saw improvement in fine lines as well.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps my eyes to look fresh and more youthful.  It&#x27;s not an eye lift, but it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> love the smell, love that it works!  love that it&#x27;s creamy and moisturizing!  did i mention that it works?  dark circle under my eyes do lighten.  but it&#x27;s no magical, so don&#x27;t expect it to makeup for not sleeping for 5 days.</li>
    <li> While I still saw bags under my eyes, they were less noticeable. I also received compliments from friends and family who know how focused I am on my eyes (they did not know I was trying a new cream) letting me know that my eyes looked less tired, bright and they couldn&#x27;t see bags. I will be getting it again. The product is worth a try, it may work for you.</li>
    <li> Great product. Does as it says. Reduces puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles. A very good under eye cream. A product I will keep on using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice daily for 2 weeks now, and am sad to say that I do not notice any difference. Perhaps you just can&#x27;t fight genetics, perhaps there&#x27;s no replacement for a good under-eye concealer, or perhaps this just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll agree that this cream does smell nice and feels good when applied, but I signed up for diminishing my dark circles, not having soft, sweet-smelling eyes. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this as a moisturizer but once I run out, I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
    <li> The two stars are for the excellent customer service and the fact that this feels so pleasant to put on. Some people like the smell of coffee on their face, others don&#x27;t. I do. Plus, this is moisturizing. Not the most moisturizing eye cream though, so if that is your main purpose find something else. As for dark circles, I went through three of the small tubes (which lasted nearly three months with twice a day applications) and no change whatsoever. But then, I have had my dark circles for over 8 years. They are not hereditary, but they have been there since my teenager years and no amount of sleep or hydration will help with them. This might work for the kind of dark circles caused by fatigue which mine aren&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I never imagine that this cream would be so useful, but it turns out that it is very handy. It is a healthy was to absorb vitamins and it also works as a great conditioner. This along with [[ASIN:B00BPGHPFG Tru Garcinia Cambogia Extract Plus - Featuring Clinically-proven, Pure 50% HCA Extract for Weight Loss - 1,500 Mg Per 3 Capsules - Zero Filler Ingredients - The Only Product with 100% Scientifically Reviewed Garcinia Cambogia]] makes a terrific combination for any diet. I do recommend using this, whether your looking for a cleansing lotion or just a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  I don&#x27;t care much for how it is dispensed.  I think it would be better in a small jar or squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> Both products make my skin soft and smooth. Wonderful smells!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this more than once.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product! It seems to have already made a difference in two weeks to these over 50 eyes!</li>
    <li> It is true it helps a great deal with the puffiness and dark circles. I also believe it is reasonably price.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a product to reduce morning eye puffiness. This works well at a great price and uses natural ingredients. Thanks</li>
    <li> the product smells nice and goes on smoothly but unfortunately did not notice any difference in regards to the reduction of puffyness under the eyes</li>
    <li> Been using this product a couple times a day &amp; I still have the same puffiness under my eyes - don&#x27;t see anything different, but I do LOVE the fragrance of the product - like a warm vanilla smell.</li>
    <li> I am an aging woman with dark circles around my eyes from genetics and allergies as well as just aging. I tried this cream with low hopes as I have a drawer full of unused eye cream. When this arrived I noticed a light coffee scent. That&#x27;s OK with me. The scent goes away quickly when applied.  It is a large tube that last a long time. It applies well and absorbs great. I found with regular use my eyes looked much better much to my shock. I only use this AM so have not had problems with my sleep as some reviewers have reported but I sleep at night and don&#x27;t have a night job etc. I try to use gluten free eye shadows and have not found any problems with make up application of the product seeping into my eyes like some products. It also stays fresh. I really love this product. Nice tube too for applicattion.</li>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t see the results like the others who did post.  The smell was fine. I usually don&#x27;t get results from eye creams though so I may not be a good judge.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using this product so far so good.. not a drastic change but I see progress.</li>
    <li> I just love the smell of this eye cream! Very invigorating. It wears well under my makeup and sometimes I use it over my whole face because it just plumps up my skin so well.</li>
    <li> I just started using the product and so far I am impressed...not only with the smell of cocoa but I love the results.  Seems to be making a difference already and I look forward to seeing what the next couple of weeks bring.  Seems that a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my friend who really loves it but not without trying it first.  It seems to be a very good product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This works as good as anything else I&#x27;ve found at half the price.  This isn&#x27;t going to take you back to age 30 or anything but it&#x27;s sure better than looking in the mirror without it.  Now, you could spend 5 grand and not need it but the doctor told me I&#x27;d look different for a while and I just don&#x27;t want to do that plus what if he gets the jitters just at the wrong time.  No thanks.  I&#x27;ll just look the best I can with this.</li>
    <li> This works and smells delicious, as do all of their products!  Another favorite is the body scrub that comes in several wonderful scents- highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that the caffeine in this cream would help lighten my under eye circles.  It did not and I am sad.  But it helped me to decide not to invest in the more expensive brands with the same ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewers commented on the odor and if you put it on heavy, the coffee smell can be fairly strong.  I don&#x27;t mind it but the coffee smell mixed with face cream fragrances can be a bit obnoxious.  Odor is minimal if you apply thinly.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is emollient yet not greasy, and the divine smell of coffee and vanilla is absolutely yummy. I love the natural ingredients, I can actually pronounce all of them and know what they are, so that&#x27;s always a good sign. The pump doesn&#x27;t always work (gets clogged maybe?), but I just twist off the top and squeeze. This cream makes my skin soft and plump looking but not overly shiny - I love it. Goes great under make up, too.</li>
    <li> i purchased this primarily to be used as an eye cream for moisturizing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;within 3 hours after putting this on, my eyes became very irritated, red &amp; watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at first i thought my eyes were reacting to the dryness from wintering in arizona.  i used it for a couple of days and then stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried again recently after returning to my home state.  same symptoms reappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m not allergic to anything - never have been - but this eye cream is very irritating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m also frustrated because my \\&quot;window\\&quot; to return the cream to amazon has expired!  what a waste of my money...</li>
    <li> I received this cream and was so excited after reading so many reviews, however, after I unpacked it and tried to push out some cream nothing came out. I unscrew the top and saw that the cream is dried up already and smells not pleasant, then I checked the expiration day and saw that it was already expired couple month ago. Very dissatisfied and upset with the service!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference. I wouldn&#x27;t bother ordering it online. I&#x27;m back to my usual, good, drugstore brand (Neutrogena)!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice eye cream, if you love coffee like I do you would love the smell. Ive notice it calms my eyes when they are puffy, a little goes a long way. Definitly ordering this again!!!!!!</li>
    <li> UPDATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 31, 2014&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a fair chance.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it.  The cream doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin around eyes well.&lt;br /&gt;Zero anti aging effects.&lt;br /&gt;No pump came with my tube. I have to use extra care when squeezing out the product (kinda like squeezing out toothpaste), but too much comes out and the consistently is a mix of runny fluid and clumpy cream.&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to like this.  Yet, I am disappointed and won&#x27;t but again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;March 25, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Just received the product yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s effectiveness, yet.&lt;br /&gt;However, I was staggered that the thing didn&#x27;t come with a pump in it.&lt;br /&gt;Is this normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to squeeze the stuff to the top of the tube and had to keep trying not to get too big of a blob on my finger.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed on this part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jury is out on how well it works.</li>
    <li> I liked this cream when it was selling in a little glass bottle with pump. Now they for some reason decided to put it in a plastic squeeze tube. Plastic is not very organic, is it? Then, for some reason they added horrible unusable pump to this tube. Why would a squeeze tube need a pump is a mystery of its own. But why would it need a malfunctioning pump is even more puzzling. I ended up throwing away the pump and squeezing cream from the tube into the old glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The external carton package is even more aggravating.  It&#x27;s big, heavy, I had hard time extracting the tube from it. The product label looked like something printed on an ink-jet printer. And then there was something over it that looked like a scotch tape used to attach this label to the carton. Basically, it looked fake and useless. If the purpose of that packaging was to make a product look attractive and &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34;, it failed miserably.</li>
    <li> I don;t like to go on hypes usually but with this product i am shocked. I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s got but it certainly was like magic to me in just one week. I am young though, but because of college and wanting to make something of myself I sleep an average of 2 hrs a day.... so my eyes... yeah... I even got nicknamed panda. So you can imagine how they looked. I got really good concealers but my eyes were too dehydrated.. :( I tried everything. Even teabags, and really expensive Japanese brands like Cle de Peau dark circle and puffiness serum. While that one is good too, it is no where near the unexpectedly quick results from this one... Definitely buying again and highly recommend. it is a product worth investment. If you don&#x27;t see results stick with it, this is an organic product and reacts differently with everyone&#x27;s PH so stick with it. But I can tell you... the ravings are no lie, this works.</li>
    <li> This stuff hasn&#x27;t completely removed the full-sized pieces of luggage sitting below my eyes,&lt;br /&gt;but it has certainly replaced it with carry-ons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for well over a year, and this is definitely my go-to for those early morning puffy eyes. After I apply, I feel like I can instantly see a difference, and by the time I apply my makeup, the puffiness is gone. Not only does it do what it says it does, but it smells great and is also a great moisturizer. I will definitely be purchasing again, and from this seller, the transaction was swift and the product arrived even sooner than the expected delivery.</li>
    <li> The product is good the manufacture could make the pump better though, you really have to work with the pump to get the product out.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye cream! Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye cream for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product. The smell is fresh and the cream is luxurious!</li>
    <li> This eye cream moisturized and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, but the smell is bad and hard to tolerate. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference with puffiness or undereye circles. I recommend Skin by Ann Webb Eye Balm - Coffee Berry. It also has caffeine and a more pleasant smell. I use it under my regular eye cream.</li>
    <li> Just ok, don&#x27;t see a big reduction in bags(which is what I bought if for) however I rank it a 3 since it does seem to brighten up my eye area  and help my mineral powder go on much smoother. and it does smell good</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I hope to buy many more and stock up- I have black puffy circles around my eyes from allergy and sinus drainage.  The first night I used it I woke up and saw a slight less puffiness- that was the first product after trying many that I could see a real difference (and I even tried using hemmoriod meds to no effect) .  So I am convinced the caffiene is the majic ingrediant for me.  I do drink a lot, but that never helped my puffy baggy eyes.  This has a slight odor that goes away so fast I don&#x27;t see why its an issue. Also, I can&#x27;t believe it is enough caffiene to notice any affect on heart rates, sleeplessness etc. Especially if you already drink it.  You put on only a pin head amount to cover both eyes- so that doesn&#x27;t seem much caffeine to me.  I love it.  I dissolves fast and seems to be really helping me- been using for a month now and I believe it is helping- my sinus is cronic, and my sleep is nill- so I know I am a challenge-but do think I see a huge deflation of bags.  I don&#x27;t ad HA or moisturizer on the bags, but under around. Only this product and then sunscreen, and then makeup over.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic.  I have been using it twice/day for at least a year.  I tell everyone I know that it is the only facial-type cream I have ever used where I could literally see the improvements.  My under-eye area is smooth, bright, and has no bags at all.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is the pump.  It needs improvement.  It often doesn&#x27;t pump the cream out at all, even when the tube is full.  I solve this by simply removing the pump and squeezing the tube until a small amount comes out.</li>
    <li> The cream does make under eye circles less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Does nothing for puffy eyes. Won&#x27;t use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was featured on Dr. Oz show, so I trusted.  But after only a few days usage, a line appeared under my right eye.  In the past, I used the product which didn’t work, but never did any damage.  This is shocking.  I don&#x27;t think this product is good enough to use on delicate under eye area.  So I immediately stopped using it.  Since it is so cheap and I don&#x27;t want to bother going to the post office to return it.  I will probably use it to keep my feet moist.</li>
    <li> I wake up every morning, wash my face, then put this cream under my eyes. It is great, it reduces the bags I have when I first wake up, but does NOT reduce the darkness under my eyes (apparently drinking enough water will help with this).This stuff smells so yummy, dries quickly, and is not sticky. It is light and can be worn under make-up. This is my second week using this product. I hope to see an even greater change in two more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product  at night too!</li>
    <li> My vegan GF liked 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream.  Strangely, it had a faint smell of buttered popcorn, not coffee.  For real.  She said that she would use it again.</li>
    <li> After 5 days of applying the product twice a day I have seen no reduction in the puffiness around my eyes as it was advertised to do.  Nice packaging and I am sure it is 100% pure.  I consider it a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works and doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the product, it&#x27;s fresh. It seems a little greasy but I put it on at the end of the day after I have taken off my makeup and when I wake up it has been soaked up by my skin. I do not like the pump dispenser. One full pump and you unload enough cream for your entire face. You have to press down halfway on the pump to dispense the right amount. I was looking for a product that would reduce the amount of lines around my eyes, this one is supposed to make the area around my eyes look \\&quot;more awake and youthful\\&quot;. I made the purchase because it says it&#x27;s 100% pure and 100% natural. It wasn&#x27;t very expensive so it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of eye creams.  I have very oily skin to begin with BUT, I love that it is organic, I love that it is natural and I would say without a doubt if that is the life you are striving for then this is the product for you.  I have to say the smell is a little overpowering to go to sleep with, that is the only downfall.  I got a sample of this through the NTH Review Group @ [...]</li>
    <li> Great cream, very hydrating, no chemicals in it which is great, doesn&#x27;t do much for undereye circles for me but I love this cream for its hydration, amazon has this at a great price!</li>
    <li> This eye cream smells really good. I&#x27;m not sure it really delivers your eyes from looking tired. It&#x27;s supposed to lift the skin around the eyes. I don&#x27;t see much of this happening but it does lighten the dark circles you get from not enough sleep or from being tired. I use with other eye products and it seems to work better then on its own. Not sure if I will buy it again?</li>
    <li> I just started using this a few weeks ago, and so far I like it.  I can&#x27;t say that the puffiness is gone completely, but it has seemed to help.  I&#x27;m hoping that the longer I use it, the more results I will see.  I would defenitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I chose this cream after reading the reviews. I have used it now every day for about 3 weeks. I can see somewhat of a change in wrinkles but nothing that wowed me. It does have a coffee scent but nothing that I could not deal with. If you are looking for something that will cause dramatic changes, this cream didn&#x27;t do it for me. However, I will continue to use it just in a case the changes take longer.</li>
    <li> I like this cream because it feels soothing. I use it at night only underneath my eyes for dark circles-seems to work. It has a definite scent that I believe is vanilla.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of the cream, have only used it a couple times because the pump is defective. Hoping to figure out a way to get a replacement? A lot of product is being wasted by squeezing it up with top off.</li>
    <li> At first I was a bit skeptical about trying this product as I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other products for my dark circles I inherited after having my kids.  Based on the great reviews and a glimmer of hope I decided to go for it.  Firstly, the smell isn&#x27;t of coffee or chocolate in the traditional sense...it&#x27;s more of a nutty smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Secondly, after only 3 days, I noticed my eyes seemed brighter and more alert.  As I kept using it a few days more, my husband asked me what I did differently as my face looks so different....and YOUNG!  Well, after that compliment how could I not give 5 stars!  I must say I actually love to look into the mirror now and notice my young, bright eyes.  This product is the real deal.  It works....simple...and I&#x27;m ever so happy for that.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed the sweet coffee scent.  The cost was reasonable from this company.  The product has great moisturizing benefits and that is the reason I would purchase again.  I&#x27;ve been told by physicians that the only way to get ready of the bags is to have those nasty fat pads surgically removed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...has a pleasant cocoa-y fragrance and applies smooth and the amount is quite good for the price - I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading reviews elsewhere.  I see no improvement after using this cream.  I use it in the morning and if anything, my eyes seem more swollen.  Sorry, not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2013&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I wanted to find a use for this cream, so I add a squirt to my cream makeup and blend in my palm.  It works great and give me a nice glowy look.  Sorry to learn that it has been reformulated and no longer has green tea but does have aloe vera.  Also, it is in a tube now....an organic product deserves glass.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much of anything. Nice cream. Nothing special. I&#x27;ll use it up but it doesn&#x27;t do anything other than hydrate like any decent cream. Nothing bad, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I have had dark circles since I was young due to allergies and blockages in my nose. I have tried everything! This is the ONE cream that works. It&#x27;s amazing. I look totally different when I wake up now. It doesn&#x27;t completely diminish the darkness, but I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will. It works so well already I am in love! Plus it&#x27;s all natural which is an even bigger perk. Definitely a must-have!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not fond of the strong fragrance . After using prior to a two hour shopping trip I could still smell the coffee. I wondered if people near me in the stores could smell it.&lt;br /&gt;  After using a full container I never saw full improvement . I often experience mild congestion and have decided that with a medical condition this product will not be of much help. Every morning when I wake I have puffiness under at least one eye.Most days the puffiness will go down later in the day . I had hoped this cream would help but not in my case.&lt;br /&gt;  I also was disappointed by the packaging which causes one to believe the product will be a larger size  than it actually is the tube is quite small.</li>
    <li> Very pure coffee flavor, feel without adding anything else, with up to absorb liquid well.But the effect is not very obvious.</li>
    <li> It gave me an allergic reaction. My eyelids were itchy and I developed a rash around the eye area and no results were seen</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It is odorless and does not leave your face oily.  I will definitely purchase this item again in the near future.</li>
    <li> I order this eye cream for my mother. The ingredients are great all natural however, I don&#x27;t think the product has done its job since I can&#x27;t tell a difference in my mom.</li>
    <li> I received this product to try as part of a review group @ [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the scent reminded me more of chocolate than it did of coffee, but the smell is light and enjoyable. I noticed right away after applying, that the puffiness under my eyes had been reduced significantly. I also noticed the finer lines were looking less rigid. It&#x27;s important to me that the ingredients are all natural, and I enjoy the fact this cream doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling or a greasy film either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will purchase more when I run out!</li>
    <li> So, I wish I had found this stuff at least 15 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;It smells like cookies and it works if you apply it 3 times a day. It doesn&#x27;t say how many times to apply, but I&#x27;ve been using it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been cursed with baggage under my eyes thanks to my mothers side of the family and have used different organic methods to rid of them for years but have not had any real success.&lt;br /&gt;Until now.. this cream seems to actually deflated the puffiness! What seemed impossible now looks possible. We&#x27;ll see tho.. I got this about 3 weeks ago. I&#x27;ll update again in another 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> This cream has a pleasant scent and it absorbs quickly when applied.  It does seem to soften the skin and appears to improve my puffiness.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I noticed a small difference while using it, but when I ran out I noticed a big difference and I missed it. Smells like heaven too!!!</li>
    <li> I was dissapointed with the coffee bean eye cream I can&#x27;t tell any difference in the puffiness under my eyes and it has a strange order that I smell all day long. not a smell like coffee would be good if it did but a smell I can&#x27;t say I have smelt before not pleasant at all. I .would not buy this product again</li>
    <li> I used Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream twice a day for at least three weeks. And while it did no harm, it also did no good. There is no noticeable difference in regards to my under eye bags. If anything, they are a bit larger than they were previous to the use of the eye cream. Wished it had worked.&lt;br /&gt;J.Jill - Prescott, AZ</li>
    <li> love the scent and the my mom recommended and i love it too, will buy again.  love the creaminess and absorbs nice.</li>
    <li> Lllove it. Works great.holy grail for under eye and puffy/ dark circles. Perfect for me. I have fair sensitive skin..</li>
    <li> I read a lot of great reviews on amazon about this product. I was so excited! I bought it and to my surprise I am very disappointed. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes, I get plenty of sleep and apply it twice a day. The only thing its good for, is for moisturizer before I apply my concealer. Not what I wanted it for,,,wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the first week so far okay. Does however eliminate tired look instantly which is a plus for me.</li>
    <li> It reduced some puffiness but did nothing for under eye circles. After trying many items I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that only a cover up for under eye helps. I haven&#x27;t found a cream that will make it go away. I like the smell. It smells sorta like popcorn.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Works exactly as stated, My eyes love it. A little goes a long way, so it lasts awhile!</li>
    <li> I really like how this product works - I&#x27;ve seen noticeable differences in bag size under my eyes when I wake up with puffy bags. It could be the placebo effect, but I&#x27;m definitely more confident around my under eye circles (not confident enough to leave the house without concealing them, but definitely more confident.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT I&#x27;ve been really upset with the heavy scent (this is a major no-no for sensitive skin), I&#x27;ve seen a slight increase in my milia, and I find the pump prohibitively bad. At first it was working fine and I could really control how much of the cream I was getting, but after several days, the pump broke. The pump will either squirt out nothing for several pumps or suddenly FAR TOO MUCH cream.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. It smells wonderful - like vanilla cookies! But sadly it didn&#x27;t do anything for me :( The pump also stopped working after a week. Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> The 100% Pure products are nice, they smooth onto the skin easily and each have a mild scent to them however, I really think these products are meant for women in their 20/30&#x27;s as they were not effective on more mature skin (&amp;#62;40) and I have really good skin to begin with - good genes I guess. So if you&#x27;re a young woman that wants/needs lighter results, these products are probably for you.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this got such good reviews. It does nothing. It smells nice though. I used it for 3 months every night and it didn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for the results to appear for a while and then nothing happened. Not even the slightest change to my complexion in two weeks of use. I also had to put up with the horrid smell of this cream which was like a very strong chemical vanilla smell. So I can only give this two stars because I&#x27;m sure it does work for some people, just not for me.</li>
    <li> The pump design on this tube is very impractical. You end up wasting a good amount of product. Not necessarily a bad thing, considering the creme smells like death. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I used this product several years ago and was very happy to find it on Amazon.  It was my favorite cream for puffy eyes...but at the same time, I found a different brand with obviously more caffeine...and it does work so much better.  Costs more, but I want results, total results, not just improved somewhat...</li>
    <li> I like the way my eyes feel when I put this on.  Price is good and it does work.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.</li>
    <li> i am a HUGE 100 Percent Pure advocate NOW. For years I have stuck to Clinique. Ohhh did I have it wrong. I had NO idea that it was actually causing my skin to break out. Then one day I had enough, I made a total switch to all Organic/Sulfate/Paraben free products including 100 PERCENT PURE face primers. Not one pimple since this happened. This Product has significantly reduced the dark circles under my eyes! It really is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been skeptical of cosmetics but I purchased this for my mother who asked me for a good eye cream, mainly for the reasonable price and good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, she was seeing a dermatologist for melasma issues and purchased hundreds of dollars worth of Obagi products. When she went back to see the dermatologist after a month, they compared before and after photos. The dermatologist noted that there was a remarkable improvement in the eye area, thinking it was due to the Obagi. Then she was surprised to learn that all that was used was this product in the eye area. (In case you&#x27;re curious, the Obagi products did little to improve the melasma condition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well color me impressed. It really works.</li>
    <li> I really thought this product would reduce puffs more than it does as it is caffeine and that has been recommended for this problem.  But I don&#x27;t notice that much difference in the eye area.  It does smell OK and I will use it to put a little moisture in the that area during the day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this!!!  Saw immediate results. Will be ordering again:). Will definitely recommend to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> The cream is nice, but I really have not seen much improvement.  I read a lot of reviews before buying this product so my expectations were high.  Worth giving a try.</li>
    <li> Tried it once.  Noticed no difference.  Too expensive for zero results.  Guess I&#x27;ll  have to get used to getting wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> This cream delivers on its claims.  In addition, I&#x27;ve noticed it seems to help prevent styes, which prior to using this product I suffered from often.</li>
    <li> This is so good for your eyes.  It&#x27;s one product that I will not do without!</li>
    <li> smells sooooo good, as does all 100% pure products. Best eye cream ever. I&#x27;ve been using for a week now and use it morning &amp; night. Makes big difference</li>
    <li> Does not have any effect on puffiness or dark circles.  Used it twice a day for thirty days.  Not worth the time and the smell really bothered me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product without reading reviews because I saw it on Dr. Oz. Well I have had it for a few weeks and so far I don&#x27;t see any difference. I know these things take time, however, frankly I have not found an eye cream for under eye puffiness that works. I have tried cheap and expensive creams. Nada!</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been having an awful time for a while with itchy eyes, so I came back to this product and took a good look at the ingredients list. As it turns out, it has Calendula in it--if you are allergic to ragweed, stay away from this natural ingredient. It just so happens I&#x27;m allergic to ragweed... how disappointing. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months (always at least once a day), and while I definitely can say, \\&quot;Sure, this is okay,\\&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to suggest or recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are no super crazy or funky ingredients.  I can put this all over my eyes with zero irritation and no itching, and I have to admit I really love the smell (yum!)--it seems a lot stronger when you first start using it, but it disappears pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT: The cream is a white, thin lotion that spreads easily.  It&#x27;s not the kind of lotion that instantly absorbs into your skin, and a little goes a long way!  There is going to be a moist film left behind for a while, so if you&#x27;re an instant-absorption sort of person, this might catch you off-guard. However, I like that it doesn&#x27;t instantly dry because my eyes feel more hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PACKAGING: There are several comments talking about how crappy the pump is and how it &#x27;breaks&#x27; easily.  I haven&#x27;t experienced it directly breaking, but I can see how people might have problems.  The pump doesn&#x27;t pull lotion from very deep inside the bottle, so it leaves behind a gap in the lotion eventually each time you pump because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;settle\\&quot; to fill the spot after use.  If you squeeze from the bottom of the bottle a little bit before using or unscrew the top and jostle the bottle a bit, you&#x27;ll be able to \\&quot;fill\\&quot; that hole created over time through using the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:  I&#x27;m in my early 20s and have been blessed with pretty good genes, so wrinkles and puffy under-eyes really aren&#x27;t a huge issue for me.  However, I really love how moisturizing and hydrating this cream is.  The smell is pleasant, and I&#x27;m probably about halfway through the tube in two months, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a decent bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot!  If wrinkles and puffiness are a concern for you, this might not be your holy grail product, but it&#x27;s also inexpensive enough that I think it&#x27;s worth trying out without feeling awful if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tiny note - I don&#x27;t know if this is relevant, but I have noticed since using this product I seem to have gained a small cluster of freckles around my eyes in places I&#x27;ve never had freckles before.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s from this product, but it certainly struck me as unusual.urizing and hydrating this cream is.

    <li> Like the cream but I have trouble getting the it to pump out properly. I have to take the lid off to get it out. Company need to work on this. I have ordered twice and both tubes have this problem.</li>
    <li> I tried this stuff because of all the awesome reviews, it works to reduce eye puffiness. It takes about a week or so to really see a difference. One of the best eyecreams especially when you combine it with collagen. The two make a good match. Im in to the combination thing and believe that combining products together have the best effects when you are treating under eye circles.The only reason why I didnt give it five stars is because I saw the difference when not using it with the collagen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since March of 2014 and love it.  Noticeable results after just a few uses.  A little goes a long way.  I will buy this again.  It took a while to get the pump dispenser primed and working properly, but then it is smooth sailing and dispenses just the amount you want.</li>
    <li> This is the second time ordering this product. I love it.</li>
    <li> Seems to have helped a lot with dark circles after a week of daily usage, morning/night. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This coffee bean eye cream has a great odor and feel. I have been using it for at least a month and it&#x27;s great. I use it on my face not just eyes because I really like the smell.</li>
    <li> No use - waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  over 50 and usually the creams are oily.  This cream not only tightens fine lines, but reduces puffiness in minutes.This is my second purchase.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bothered me before was the how it was dispensed.  HOWEVER, they fixed it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The perfect eye cream in the perfect dispenser!</li>
    <li> I read about it in a magazine, it has tightened up my eyes and I even use it around my mouth. It takes vey little and lasts forever.</li>
    <li> Love it!  I have a very sensitive eye area and this is great!  The scent is very mild and no chemicals!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s effective for eye bags, since I use this as a preventative measure against problems around the eyes instead. I&#x27;ve tried eye creams out there that leave a stiff, tight film. This one on the other hand is creamy, smells heavenly like fresh coffee, and leaves my eyes moist without the film. The cream really sinks in without just sitting around the eyes. So, even though this may or may not help with eye bags, I am going to continue using this. You also only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone said, don&#x27;t use this when you&#x27;re trying to go to sleep! The caffeine does absorb thru the skin. I was a bit tired before my driving test. I applied a toothpick amount around my eyes. It kept me awake and I passed. :)</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it says. It reduces dark circles and puffiness. It feels good when you put it on. I put it on over my anti-wrinkle cream. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but if you give it a few minutes to dry, it will not interfere with your eye makeup. It smells weird- like buttered popcorn. I *wish* it smelled like coffee or chocolate like other people said but it&#x27;s not that nice. However, it goes away quickly. It&#x27;s all natural and inexpensive. I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I used it all, twice a day, and no effect on dark circles, puffiness or wrinckles.&lt;br /&gt;No effect at all. Waste or money. Smells good.</li>
    <li> Was recommended this product by a friend.  He said he really saw an improvement. I think it varies from individual. I feel it works best in the morning, to reduce puffiness.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and i have to say i enjoy putting this cream on. The smell isn&#x27;t horrible and is definitely something you get use to. I notice that my dark eye area is smoother and less noticeable, however, I am waiting for some kind of transformation-so we will see. This product still receives 5 stars because you have to take into consideration that this product is organic and 100% natural.  Alternative methods that reveal improvements quicker contain harsh chemicals that penetrate your body&#x27;s protective covering and may cause you harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD DEFINITELY BUY ANY OF 100% PURE COSMETIC&#x27;S PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Visibly lightened my under eye circles as well as providing great moisture.  This is a great product, I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> What a miracle worker! I am shocked at how well it works.</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for the bags below my eyes. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> first one I bought shipped to a neighbor and I never got it back. I ordered a second one since this product is so highly rated here on amazon. Used up the whole tube, lasted a long time. did not see any improvement on dark circle, might slightly gets down puffiness, but not significantly since puffiness isn&#x27;t much a problem for me.  works just like any moisturizing eye cream out there.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles around my eyes so I decided to give this cream a shot. I&#x27;ve noticed that it reduces the puffiness around my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the dark circles as much. However, given that I have only been using it for about a month I want to give it another month to see if I notice any changes. I will try to repost later to let you all know if I see a difference.</li>
    <li> the best eye cream in the market! it&#x27;s affordable and organic! smells great, very light</li>
    <li> Works great! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Did not notice anything spectacular about the product. I&#x27;m sure my skin enjoyed the moisture...however I was not overly impressed with the results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement in reducing under eye bags.  It moisturizes but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> Truly works as they claim</li>
    <li> I like 100% pure products and this eye cream works, it is very creamy and does not feel greasy on the skin. I have been using this for several years and will continue.</li>
    <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t really do anything for me...such a disappointment. I was hoping that it might help with a bit of puffiness that I have under my eyes...but...nothing. I thought maybe it would help moisturize or do something....but...nothing. Maybe I don&#x27;t have the right skin type for it or maybe there is no hope for my eye puffiness. Sadly, for me, this was a waste of good money. It has an odd smell too.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this bc/ of all the great reviews I read. They made me excited. I&#x27;m in my early 30s, but I have really bad dark circles that started about 2yrs ago &amp; my eyes are always puffy when I wake up. After applying this for nearly 2months now I&#x27;ve noticed zero results. It smells like strong coffee, not bad though just strong, and it does moisturize, but what under eye cream doesn&#x27;t? My generic $10 drug store retinol cream is a better moisturizer. I was really let down by this product, and I definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am forty and have bags from hell under my eyes due to lack of sleep after having kiddos.  This morning I woke up with one under eye more horrendously swollen than the other.  I did an experiment and slathered on a generous amount of this stuff.  I mean generous, to the point where the cream was still white and not fully rubbed in.  After about an hour, my eye had depuffed about 40 %.  Keeping in mind that my undereye bags are pretty much permanent at this stage in the game, I&#x27;d say this cream did what it said it would do.  It reduced the swelling, but not miraculously.  My bags have been there for so long that I think my skin is just stretched and lost elasticity.  If you are looking for surgery results, forget it.  But, if you&#x27;re looking for a little extra topical help, a nice moisturizer and have at least an hour to spare to allow it to work, then this does that.  Mine did not have green tea, as others have mentioned.  Good luck! Under eye puffiness sucks!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  I&#x27;ve been looking for cream that helps with puffy, tired eyes and had no luck until I found this coffee bean eye cream.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I use it in the morning and my eyes feel instantly less puffy and more awake.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it promised</li>
    <li> I purchased this about two weeks ago, and I have huge eye bags. I didn&#x27;t use it everyday because of my laziness.. but it definitely worked out!! I did not notice it until today I was taking a picture of myself and I saw the huge difference! My eyebags almost disappeared!!!!</li>
    <li> No harm no foul.  Can&#x27;t tell that its done anything at all after a month of using. I say don&#x27;t waste your money if looking for a miracle. On the other hand it is nive smelling and a creamy eye cream but nothing special</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT FOR ME.  IT WON&#x27;T WORK FOR EVERYONE, BUT FOR ME IT TAKES AWAY JUST ENOUGH OF WRINKLES AND UNDER EYE BAGS TO SEE A DIFFERENCE.  I&#x27;LL BUY MORE OF THIS WHEN I GET LOW.</li>
    <li> Coffee bean caffeine eye cream  Does not work for puffiness under eyes. I am very disappointed with the product.  Paid a lot for the cream</li>
    <li> I went to a plastic surgeon to talk about a lower eye lift.  He explained that the baggies under my eyes was fluid retention.  I had a lower eye lift 15 years ago in which they remove the fat pads so this is not my current problem. I heard that products with caffeine will help reduce fluid retention so I bought this eye cream.  I have been using it for several weeks now and I can definitely see that the under eye bags. I am not seen any change in the dark circles. This product has also soften the crows feet and other lines around my eyes. I like this product very much.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. I felt like I was putting food on my face. It was just a bit unsettling.</li>
    <li> It has a light coffee scent to it, it doesn&#x27;t smell awful at all by no means, it smells almost like coconut/coffee mixed together...I really do believe this product does the job, it&#x27;s very excellent, however I stopped using it because I&#x27;m still pretty young lol, but will definitely see someone a little older enjoying this product! this is very creamy and smooths on/absorbs easily underneath your eyes....it does leave a slight &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; feel underneath your eyes, but after while it just absorbs fully/goes away.  Long story short, yes this does lighten up your dark circles almost instantly :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream since it arrived, you only need to use a small amount for it to do its job.</li>
    <li> This is second time I&#x27;ve purchsed this cream.  The first tube was fine and I liked that the cream was non-greasy and easily absorbed. With the second tube, the cream dispenser does not work properly.  Its not clogged, its just either difficult to get it out or you get too much with a pump.  I&#x27;m also not finding that the cream is doing anything for the skin around my eyes.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I thought I would try this product and have been happy with my purchase.  It takes very little to cover under the eye.  It will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This cream performs very well as a day eye treatment. It moisturized in preparation for correctly/concealer, without being overly greasy. Soaks into the skin quickly and leaves a smooth surface. The Caffiene makes a small difference in any puffiness right away and is accumulative over time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand many of the begative reviews. This is not plastic surgery. I thing expectations by many are too high for any topical cream.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s EVRN a poor review by someone who had issues with a return to 100% pure. If she bought it on Amazon, they would have taken her return. If no, this isn&#x27;t the place to leave a disgruntled review. a Remember you are buying a $19 eye cream. Be realistic and there won&#x27;t be  any disappointment .</li>
    <li> I like it! For the amount and the price, it&#x27;s lasted me quite a while - super reasonable. Does it do magic on the eye area?? Who can say :) but it&#x27;s nourishing and better than nothing or something super pricey!</li>
    <li> seems to reduce puffiness around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Used it faithfully morning and night with no positive results.</li>
    <li> the product smells great, and works as a moisturizer, but does it help the eye puffiness or dark circles? Not for me. The pump is completely useless, i have to unscrew the pump every time to get anything to come out.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m biased but I really LOVE all products from 100% Pure. This eye cream feels &amp; smells great. Soothes under eye area immediatly</li>
    <li> I gave the Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream a try since I wanted to see improvement in my under eye swelling. It has a medium weight and has a light mocha scent, nothing distracting or noxious (I have a sensitive nose). In terms of moisturizing, this cream does a fine job. Concealer is easy to apply on top of it and there is no stickiness or blending issue when the two products are combined. I didn&#x27;t notice an improvement in my puffiness however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, if you have extremely sensitive eyes and are a little sloppy with the application, you may have eye irritation (redness and slight burning in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try, it might work for you. I&#x27;m still trying to find the cause of my puffiness so it could work for other types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing dramatic results but I do like this product and would buy it again especially because it&#x27;s organic!</li>
    <li> smells horrible and unsure of effectiveness</li>
    <li> This product is very light and non greasy.  Easy to use application tube. Easy to pack for travel. Nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I didnt see much of a difference using this product. I saw more of a difference using cold spoons in the morning .</li>
    <li> I first received a large sample size of this with a drugstore dotcom purchase a couple of years ago and liked the scent and texture of the eye cream.  I also have very sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any issues for me.  I bought a pump bottle of it and was disappointed in the bottle so I never bought it again.  I tried several other expensive eye creams and never noticed anything and in those two years I started getting (genetic, I&#x27;m sure) bags/circles under my eyes.  Those other creams were doing nothing for me.  I received yet another large sample of this in a drugstore purchase and began using it again.  Within a week, I have noticed that my eyes are looking younger and less tired and even the circles are less apparent.  I am going to try buying the full size of this again, but I really hope they have changed the packaging so that it&#x27;s not in a pump anymore!</li>
    <li> This product really works and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I can see reduction in th dark circles and puffyness. The pump does not work.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this product does anything special. It&#x27;s okay for a cream, although slightly greasy. Certainly no miracle worker. Smells nice, though.</li>
    <li> Really worked and was a great value for the price.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good organic line.</li>
    <li> On a recent vacation, a friend let me use her 100% Pure eye cream. Over the 10 days, I put a little on each morning before makeup and at night after washing my face. By the end of the ten days, I could see a marked difference in the skin texture around my eyes, smoother, more even tone and more supple. I&#x27;m 58, so I will take every good bit of luck I can get! As the trip was drawing to a close, I was thinking that I&#x27;d miss this product a lot until I could find a place to purchase it for myself. As we were packing our suitcases, my friend handed me the tube and said I should keep it, that she&#x27;d bought a set of three and still had two at home. SCORE! What a great gift that was. That was back in October 2012. It&#x27;s February 2013 and I still have a bit left in the tube she gave me so it&#x27;s just now time to replace it. I highly recommend this cream. Your makeup will apply smoother, your skin will feel silky and moisturized and the scent is a nutty and faint coffee fragrance, which I&#x27;m sure is what parts of heaven smell like. Note: I also put a little around my lips to smooth out those fine lines that make lipstick look like you applied it with a wallpaper paste brush. It sort of puffs the lip a bit to give me back a smoother lipline. I love this stuff and only wish it came in a bigger container for home and a tiny one for my purse to touch up throughout the day. What do you say 100% Pure? Can you make other sizes for me??</li>
    <li> I like the pump dispensing a right amount. It is a nice cream and goes on nicely.  I smells nice. I don&#x27;t know that I feel like it is doing anything for wrinkle prevention or any other benefit but I trust it is moisturizing. I would buy it again, but I am still on the hunt for good natural eye cream... I like devita brand as well and alternate between the two eye creams at the moment</li>
    <li> I thought the faint coffee smell was soothing...but it didn&#x27;t do anything to my dark eye circles. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a soft velvety light yet creamy consistency that sinks right into my skin. I have a very sensitive under eye area and this eye cream did not irritate my skin at all plus it felt moisturizing yet not greasy. It has helped with my under eye bags; this cream reduces any puffiness around my eyes and feels soothing on my skin. It has a very slight coffee scent which is pleasant and not overpowering. Since this cream is made of coffee beans, it contains caffeine which is great anti-inflammatory properties as well as antioxidant properties (from the caffeic acid). Caffeine is also a diuretic which is probably why it has helped reduce my under eye bags/puffiness so well. So overall you get a lot of bang for your buck; it being a generous 1 fl oz is twice as much as most other eye creams which are usually sold in 1/2 fl oz containers. I definitely recommend trying it!! I will be buying again even though this eye cream is going to last a really long time since you only need to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I had in mind.  I thought it would be more radical!  I don&#x27;t like the fact that they make you put a counted number of words on these feedbacks!!</li>
    <li> This product delivers. It&#x27;s well priced, and it does exactly as it claims: to reduce puffiness and fine lines. I recommend it to anyone that is willing to try a new eye cream.</li>
    <li> I know that some reviewers have stated that this product did not work for them.  It works very well for me.  I use it in the morning and it definitely reduces the puffiness under my eyes.  I purchased it through Amazon as it is more affordable that purchasing it from 100% Pure.</li>
    <li> It smelled really nice because of the coffee but it did nothing for my eyes.  I saw no difference whatsoever and used it faithfully.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll try any product that claims to reduce under-eye circles. I bought this based on a recommendation on XOVain -- and I&#x27;m really happy with it. There is a visible difference a few minutes after you use the cream. Best not to put it on right before you leave, as it looks a little oily. Works best if you use it overnight then again during the day. Smells like cocoa butter. The only problem is that the pump is a little wonky, so it pumps out extra lotion when you&#x27;re not expecting it.</li>
