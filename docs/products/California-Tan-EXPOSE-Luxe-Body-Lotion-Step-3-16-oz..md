<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My wife has found this the best lotion for dry skin (forget about the suntan part). She has used super expensive ones and cheap ones. Areal &amp;#34;value priced&amp;#34; buy.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion, the best lotion I have ever used! Keeps my skin moisturized and keeps my tan looking great! I use it after every tanning session and inbetween! I will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> Smells good! Gives good moisturizing lasting a good day. Very silky and good for everyday use even if not tanning.</li>
    <li> Best after tanning lotion ever! Besides it leaving a nice glow after lathering it on it also smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Great smell and very moisturizing. Use after tanning or anytime after bathing. I use almost every day. Good for very dry skin, too.</li>
    <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing. I use it after every tan, and even in between. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and it smells heavenly good. It definitely works to help your tan last long and it leaves your skin silky soft. Highly recommend this product over any other step 3 lotion, from any brand.</li>
    <li> I love to use this after showering even if I don&#x27;t go tanning.&lt;br /&gt;When I tan this is a must have for saving your skin and keeps it looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love it !</li>
    <li> The delicious smelling lotion is a fast absorbing,non-greasy slice of heaven!  I would recommend this to any desert dweller or someone looking for a killer lotion!</li>
    <li> Best lotion ever! I use it year round even though I don&#x27;t go to tanning bed.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion use it every tanning season. I have used about 4 bottles so far. Males ur skin extremely soft and has a sheen to it. Good smell and last all day. Does extend ur tanning lotion too.</li>
    <li> 3rd time purchasing this. This product leaves my skin so incredibly soft all day long. Definitely prolongs my tan. So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> BEST lotion ever.  Worth the price.  Smells wonderful and applies great.  I keep a bottle at work and home :)</li>
    <li> the smell is very perfumey but I love it also it is oh so hydrating and I even used it when I stopped tanning for awhile. It is hands down one of the most moisturizing after tan lotions I have ever used, I also have semi sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin at all</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good</li>
    <li> Much less expensive than my tanning salon price!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best body lotion I have used! I&#x27;m a year round &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; and this lotion has kept my skin nice and soft. It smells so good too! I have purchased this at my local tanning salon many times so I knew what I was getting. The advantage of getting it through Amazon was it is a fraction of the price I paid in the Salon. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It is okay. The smell is pretty strong and smells exactly like a grapefruit. If you are not a fan of grapefruit, (like me) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. The product is fine. It is a little watery and I really haven&#x27;t notice any difference with my tan. It is moisturizing, but there are a lot of products out there that do the same thing for  a cheaper price. I would&#x27;t buy at the tanning salon, but if you dead set on it, I would recommend you purchasing on here!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this item from a local tanning salon.  She LOVED IT. The smell is amazing, and we are glad we found it on Amazon, because it was more than double  at the tanning place!</li>
    <li> While admittedly expensive, this is the best lotion my wife has ever found (and it smells terrific).  It helps keep the skin moist and honestly does seem to help retain your tan (what little tanning my wife does).  It goes on creamy and soaks in quickly leaving the skin smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Wow! This lotion not only smells wonderful but is very moisturizing on my skin without feeling greasy. It feels light and softens without feeling like you have a layer of goo all over your skin. It is especially effective after spray tanning to prevent dryness from the solution and to extend my tan. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The shipper and product are both amazing! I highly recommend this to anyone that tans or just needs a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> MAKES MY TAN LAST LONGER!!!!  I AM REALLY WHITE AND IT TAKES FOREVER FOR ME TO GET A BASE TAN THAT WILL LAST ALEAST A WEEK AND THIS STUFF WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> Not a strong smell.I usually use olay quench.put it on no more dry anywhere.elbows are good all day.your skin just looks good.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had!  It&#x27;s pricey, but so worth it.  I usually buy it from the tanning salon and pay more.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> It is light and not a thick lotion.  This I like!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it everyday even on the days I don&#x27;t tan indoors. It smells fantastic and really softens your skin. I like to use baby oil in the shower in addition to it and use this afterwards. My skin went from being really dry and flaky to smooth and soft in a matter of days. Aveno or any other OTC lotions were not doing the trick. This product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  I hope CT does not discontinue</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, even for everyday when I&#x27;m not tanning. It smells heavenly and makes your skin baby soft. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will buy again.</li>
    <li> My fav tan extender EVER! Smells sooooo good and I love the texture. Its not greasy at all. However, I wished it were in a bigger size cause I use it a lot LOL. Fast shipping and easy processing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Great service too!</li>
    <li> Lotion was fine, smell was good, not great. Glad I bought this off amazon for cheap and not the ridiculous amount they ask for at the tanning salon. Wont buy again, better lotions for less out there and I did not find this to be any more moisturizing than other lotions.</li>
    <li> Really keeps your tan and made my skin extremely soft!  The smell is very floral and summery like. Would buy again</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have tried this product for the first time based on some of the reviews I read here on Amazon.  This lotion smells great and feels wonderful to slather on after my shower.  I love the subtle sheen it has, not glittery or anything like that.  It makes the skin look moisturized.  My skin feels soft and supple.  I either use a spray tan at the salon but most times I use the Fake Bake spray at home.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t seem to fade my tan at all!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy lotions, but I am so glad I bought this.  It is very moisturizing, but not too heavy and the smell is amazing!</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion itself makes you feel like a million bucks. Goes on smooth but not too thick, yet very moisturizing. Keeps you soft for hours.</li>
    <li> My wife and I have been tanning now for 10 weeks when she started to use the California Tan Expose (it was recommended by the tanning salon but twice the price we paid on amazon.  Our skin started to look dry even using a regular moisturizer.  My wife started using the Califorina Tan first and her leg suddenly looked full of life and the tan really stood out.  Besides the great look and the smooth skin that she was showing the body lotion smells very nice.  I was hesitant at first to use it because of the girly smell but the way it brings out my tan and makes my skin look nice and healthy I decided to start using it after every tan.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday, not just for tanning. I have yet to find a better lotion, regardless of price. This keeps my skin moisturized all day with out feeling oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> The lid was unscrewed and leaking out of the bag</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing it really hydrates your skin and makes it really soft. Other lotions last maybe 20 minutes to a hour this one will last for about 12 hours or longer.</li>
    <li> its pretty watery. Not sure I really like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product it has a great smell!!!</li>
    <li> The picture of the bottle and at my tanning salon look A LOT more pink than the one I got. It also doesn&#x27;t smell AMAZING like the past reviews have said. With that stated it was a very moisturizing lotion leaving my skin pretty smooth and it smelled a little like cleaning solution (lind of lemony) The one at my salon for some reason smelled better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smells amazing, feels silky smooth, looks good on akin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy,  it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> It was just what I had gotten from my local salon.  Better $ and love the product. Nice fresh smell</li>
    <li> Does not feel, look, smell like what I have bought in the tanning salon. Try a different seller, the real lotion is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been looking forward to using Expose for some time now. From personal experience, it smells amazing and it absorbs quickly onto your skin. The drawback is that this lotion is NOT thick at all. It’s a watery consistency and I prefer thicker lotions and body butters. Due to the thin consistency, you will probably go through the bottle relatively quickly because it absorbs fast and you feel like you don’t have enough on. But like I said, it stays true to what the bottle says and makes your tan last super long.</li>
    <li> This one is still out for making a actual recommendation. Not as good as I thought it would have been.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Totally hydrating silky soft and smooth. Makes the skin feel renewed after an indoor tanning session. It also smells good. I find myself using it daily after my shower and after I tan.</li>
    <li> love the product shipping was an issue.  The lotion leaked and made a mess. Need to improve the packing method</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t normally like smelly lotion and it smells great not overbearing at all. Also don&#x27;t like to put lotion on and skin be oily, this stuff is great not greasy. My skin looks good I use it everyday and have now for two years!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite tan extenders and I was so excited when I seen how much I could buy it for and with free shipping, it was way cheaper then in the salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome for everyday as well as after tanning. Makes your tan last so long, maybe even makes it better. Smells great, feels great. Love it for a real or fake tan and also as an everyday lotion. Purchased it in a tanning salon for much more than on here, and when it was delivered it was very well sealed and no problems!</li>
    <li> It leaked in shipping process probably heat but still a mess</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended to me by the tanning salon that I go to - it was $80 at the tanning salon and MUCH cheaper here. I think I paid about $12.  Smells great and I use it all of the time.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually prolongs your tan but I do love the smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin after a while like other lotions.</li>
    <li> AWESOME...have to buy another one!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  It smells nice and really hydrates the skin. I have used it as an after lotion as it is supposed to be used, but it also works well as a lotion to apply before a tanning session. I would buy again!</li>
    <li> I have tried many lotions. This one is my absolute favorite! It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft!</li>
    <li> At first I was afraid to buy this product online but since it was way cheaper than in the stores I did anyway and I love it. It smells great and its not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several bottles in the last couple of years. This does not contain mineral oil so never heavy or sticky. Feels as though you are putting powder on. Best thing is I love the smell. Never gets old. I use this before and after I go in the sun or tan. Glad my tanning place told me about it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years, I have even worked at tanning salons in the past and this by far is the the best after tan lotion! its not greasy, it smells great and one bottle lasts about 2 months so it&#x27;s really affordable compared to the over priced lotions sold in tanning salons.</li>
    <li> This is a nice lotion but not as good as California Tan&#x27;s Helioderm lotion that was discontinued years ago.  I am still trying to find something as good as that was.</li>
