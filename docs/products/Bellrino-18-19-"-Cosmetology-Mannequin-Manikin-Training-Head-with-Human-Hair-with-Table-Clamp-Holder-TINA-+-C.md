      <li>We have not been able to use the table clamp holder.</li>
      <li>looks ok but didnt come with the clamp</li>
      <li>I liked it the hair seemed to shed alot when I first got it</li>
      <li>This seller is accurate and trustworthy.</li>
      <li>Delivery was on time , the package was secure .</li>
      <li>but the table clamp cannot fit in the mannequin head at all</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, Tina&#x27;s hair nice and full</li>
      <li>I figured a real hair option was the better idea.  </li>
      <li>For those needing it for school, that&#x27;s a bit more of a real need.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t very pleased at the actual length of hair</li>
      <li>I practice new techniques with  it, new color combinations, and much more!</li>

      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I received product very fast.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and product was exactly as advertised!</li>
      <li>I bought this for cosmetology and it is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>First of all she has 18 inches of length but the majority of her length of the hair is about 12 inches.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s exactly what I need.  </li>
      <li>It is exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a heat protectant when curling or flat ironing the hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really complain to much!</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for this product.</li>
      <li>it worked really well</li>
      <li>The hair is much shorter than said</li>
      <li>but top is roughly 10-12 inches .</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The head was actually full of hair unlike se dolls that have big spaces between the strands.</li>
      <li>I could not do a decent part in its head for braiding.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t do very much with it sides of hair much shorter than back.</li>
      <li>BUT OTHER WISE THE MANNEQUIN DOES THE JOB &amp; THE HAIR IS SUPER THICK.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a mannequin to give to a child to play with this is it but for a professional or someone who wants to learn to become a pro</li>
      <li>The mannequin appears to have long full hair.</li>
      <li>It is not as long or as full.</li>
      <li>It was very professional.</li>
      <li>Received early!</li>
      <li>Ordered for my 4 year old since she likes spraying water on her dolls hair messing them up.  </li>
      <li>I  couldn&#x27;t send her back  because I really needed her</li>
      <li>This is gonna be a Christmas gift for my 13 yr old daughter.  </li>
      <li>Now as far as the hair type of manikins that&#x27;s a difference story, they all suck and have crappy hair but worked for my haircuts.</li>
      <li>so i finished the tasks on time/ early.</li>
      <li>I bought this for my second year of cosmetology school (i did my cosmetology program in high school).</li>
      <li>The head is smaller than what i normally practice with at school</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very displeased that I spent Money</li>
      <li>Other than that, this mannequin is decent  for chemical and thermal services, etc.</li>

<li> and I waited long enough for her to arrive.</li>
<li> I think it will last a long time.</li>
<li> My granddaughter is enjoying it, but the hair is a little thin</li>
<li> and it was clearly texturized and thinned out previously.</li>
<li> Her hair wasn&#x27;t 18&amp;#34;-19&amp;#34; long there was a peak in the back of her head and it still wasn&#x27;t as long as advertised.</li>
<li> If you want to practice long cuts I would recommend buying a longer length than the 18-19 inch.</li>
<li> In all honesty the hair is not as long as the picture.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not for long term use at all , because it&#x27;ll probably be bald from all of the shedding .</li>
<li> Hair is not that long</li>
<li> Also has a lot of grey hairs !</li>
<li> Hair wasn&#x27;t as long or the quality I had expected.</li>
<li> Cutting and coloring I think it would be fine.</li>
<li> I expected to use this doll to practice Dutch braid.</li>
<li> 2)the difference hair length throughout the head made the braid harder.    </li>
<li> It not what I expected.</li>
<li> so I expected that</li>
<li> The length it not as expected.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had some shedding only a few Straids</li>
<li> it was about 15 inches of fullness and the other 4 to 5 inches were strands...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I brought this for my granddaughter and she loves it she loves styling her hair very nice hair on it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it</li>
    <li> The image of the product is deceiving. The mannequin appears to have long full hair. That is not the case. It is not as long or as full. We have not been able to use the table clamp holder. It is very difficult to fit into the mannequin&#x27;s neck.</li>
    <li> Was not as shown in picture or correct length. Asked about returning it and never got a reply</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was a gift for an aspiring stylist. The head was actually full of hair unlike se dolls that have big spaces between the strands. They loved it! They were unsure how to put the table clamp together though, there were no instructions for that. That&#x27;s the reason I rated it a four.</li>
    <li> This is gonna be a Christmas gift for my 13 yr old daughter.  She&#x27;s into hair, so I know she&#x27;ll love it. For those needing it for school, that&#x27;s a bit more of a real need. If it were me buying for school, I&#x27;d prefer to go to the store. That way I&#x27;d know, instead of relying on reviews. Not that they aren&#x27;t helpful. But somethings just should be purchased in store.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It was very professional. I think it will last a long time. I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> The hair is much shorter than said but my daughter likes it so... hey</li>
    <li> The delivery time was awesome! I am satisfied with this product. It is exactly how it looks in the picture. There is one very slight  problem with it that i must mention. One of the eyebrows are faded away.</li>
    <li> Ordered for my 4 year old since she likes spraying water on her dolls hair messing them up.  I figured a real hair option was the better idea.  This hair was not 18-19 inches more like 7-10 at best.  Very disappointed.  I&#x27;m going to a store in person to purchase one i know has longer hair.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, Tina&#x27;s hair nice and full</li>
    <li> Hair wasn&#x27;t as long or the quality I had expected.</li>
    <li> The model&#x27;s hair is kinda choppy which makes it harder to braid on and braiding was the reason why it was purchased.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my cosmetology practical exam. i had a little trouble with it during the exam but it got the job done. The head is smaller than what i normally practice with at school so i finished the tasks on time/ early. The mannequin hair was difficult to manipulate during the hair cut, perm, pincurl, and fingerwave section.</li>
    <li> Hair is not that long</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the length. About 5-6 inches of the length was extremely thin. The condition of the hair was fair. It felt much better once I washed, blowdryed, and cut to shoulder length. Overall, I think the length described and showed in the picture is misleading. If you want to practice long cuts I would recommend buying a longer length than the 18-19 inch.</li>
    <li> the item look better than on the picture on the web. Nothing to complain about it</li>
    <li> 18-19&amp;#34;? Girl, bye! That&#x27;s not true...more like 10&amp;#34;. Other than that, this mannequin is decent  for chemical and thermal services, etc. I&#x27;m using it for state board practice.</li>
    <li> My God daughter loves this she&#x27;s in training to be a stylist ....awesome price</li>
    <li> This worked well for what I needed it for. Had less hair than I expected and it was clearly texturized and thinned out previously. Great for practicing updos though!!</li>
    <li> it worked really well , I enjoyed this doll head it was wonderful and gave me no problems at all</li>
    <li> I bought this for my second year of cosmetology school (i did my cosmetology program in high school). To be honest I cant even tell the difference between the ones that came in my kit and with this one. Now as far as the hair type of manikins that&#x27;s a difference story, they all suck and have crappy hair but worked for my haircuts.</li>
    <li> I should have went with a longer hair length, but all in all the quality was really good. Just make sure you go longer for updo practice.</li>
    <li> The hair has no conditioning what so ever. I would suggest it to work with it. A lot of shedding. I am making it work for what I needed, not good for learning braiding. hair is too silky. Cutting and coloring I think it would be fine. I was expecting to get it in several days , but it arrived in 2. Very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> The item did not look like the picture when received in the mail. The hair look very thin &amp; not full. As soon as I brushed it, it started to shed. I could not do a decent part in its head for braiding. It&#x27;s not for long term use at all , because it&#x27;ll probably be bald from all of the shedding . I was able to braid it but nothing looks neat. I colored and &amp;#34;tried&amp;#34; to curl it. Basically I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I only kept it cause I didn&#x27;t want to bother with returning it.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for this product. It is really been very useful for me. I practice new techniques with  it, new color combinations, and much more!</li>
    <li> Good product to practice any thing on... The only thing she haven&#x27;t practiced on it yet is decolorizing it.... But she loves it.</li>
    <li> I am using it for my upcoming cosmetology practical exam.  And it&#x27;s exactly what I need.  I ordered it Friday and it came today!  I take my test next month and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out tonight!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS MANNEQUIN FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE LOVES IT BUT IVE NOTICED THAT IT SHEDS LIKE CRAZY. I FIND HAIR EVERYWHERE THAT SHE USES IT. I HATE THAT. BUT OTHER WISE THE MANNEQUIN DOES THE JOB &amp; THE HAIR IS SUPER THICK.</li>
    <li> I liked it the hair seemed to shed alot when I first got it but after I shampoo  and conditioned it  seemed to stop.&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a good product</li>
    <li> like it but too dark.  Have to spend a lot of time lightening.</li>
    <li> The quality and price were good and the prompt arrival was great. Thanks</li>
    <li> It not what I expected. The hair was poor quality.  The 18-19&amp;#34; was only at the nape. The hair different length throughout the head. I will not order this again</li>
    <li> I purchased the doll for practicing haircuts in cosmetology school. First of all she has 18 inches of length but the majority of her length of the hair is about 12 inches. Second, I got one trim out of her to take off the thin areas of the hair and  then I blow dried her. Once I got to do my second and actual hair cut her hair shriveled up almost as if I took a torch or something to her and is nasty and frizzy. She shouldn&#x27;t be doing any of that especially while CUTTING her hair. And especially if she has 100% human hair. I should be able to blowdry, marcel, straighten, cut, ANYTHING with ease. Only reason it should act this way is if it is synthetic.  I&#x27;m very displeased that I spent Money On THIS TO HAVE To Throw It Away Because She Cannot Be USED anymore.</li>
    <li> The hair is real human hair is real silky and the ends of the hair is real thin. It&#x27;s okay, but i would recommend a longer length. The mannequin hair does not look like it does on the picture.</li>
    <li> I used this mannequin for my state board test in Tennessee. Worked great...Only complaint is the hair is a little thin. But I passed so I can&#x27;t really complain to much!</li>
    <li> Quality great and arrived ib perfect shape only issue is Picture misleading. Hair looks longer than actually is. This length difficult to handle any type of updo or braiding. Can&#x27;t do very much with it sides of hair much shorter than back. Would have ordered mannequin with longer hair if known.</li>
    <li> Bought this mannequin for a cutting class and was very dissapointed. Mannequin looks like it has been texturized from root to end. All though the longest of hair might be 18-19 in., majority of hair is 10 in and some hairs even as short as 2 in. It is very thin and hard to work with, unfortunately I do not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t very pleased at the actual length of hair it was about 15 inches of fullness and the other 4 to 5 inches were strands...</li>
    <li> Exceeds expectations. Great hair, head and clamp. Definitely a great deal. Received early!</li>
    <li> my daughter uses it for school very happy with it</li>
    <li> Sheds alot and I thought the hair would be a little thicker its kinda layered already for you in away</li>
    <li> Delivery was on time , the package was secure . Hair is very thin at the ends and length is choppy. Back is about 18 but top is roughly 10-12 inches . Also has a lot of grey hairs ! I&#x27;ve had some shedding only a few Straids but I&#x27;m using it for braiding so I expected that but it&#x27;s good for the price . Wouldn&#x27;t use it for state exam though</li>
    <li> I expected to use this doll to practice Dutch braid. However, 1) the length of the hair is about 12 inches, not 18-19\\&quot; as described. 2)the difference hair length throughout the head made the braid harder.    This training head does not meet my expectation.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product was exactly as advertised! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Hair is very short.Can&#x27;t do nothing with it. The length it not as expected.</li>
    <li> i love the hair i work it, and it work with me. thank you</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting , will work great for what I need it for</li>
    <li> looks ok but didnt come with the clamp</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is enjoying it, but the hair is a little thin</li>
    <li> not impressed at all hair is thin missing chunks throughout the whole thing</li>
    <li> In all honesty the hair is not as long as the picture. The mannequin has a razor cut hair style that scissors down to 18 inches. There is just a few strands that are 18 inches. If you&#x27;re looking for a mannequin to give to a child to play with this is it but for a professional or someone who wants to learn to become a pro i suggest spending more money to purchase a better one. Im not a pro just looking for something to practice styles on.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair easy to do updos because of the cut way cheaper then buying it from school thank you</li>
    <li> Beautiful maniquin. It was a gift for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with this mannequin. Her hair wasn&#x27;t 18&amp;#34;-19&amp;#34; long there was a peak in the back of her head and it still wasn&#x27;t as long as advertised. Also she arrived with her neck damaged. It looked like she was the reject mannequin that they threw away. I  couldn&#x27;t send her back  because I really needed her and I waited long enough for her to arrive.</li>
    <li> I bought this for cosmetology and it is exactly as described. Saved me money as a student and was very good for class! This seller is accurate and trustworthy. I received product very fast.</li>
    <li> but the table clamp cannot fit in the mannequin head at all so i cant use the clamp : {{{{</li>
    <li> Wash hair to stop majority of shedding... The ends are very thin. Make sure you use a heat protectant when curling or flat ironing the hair.</li>
