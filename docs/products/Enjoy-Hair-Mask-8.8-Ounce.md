      <li>Nothing can beat this Enjoy hair mask, neither results or price.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and always buy more when I run out!!</li>
      <li>I was originally going to use it every 10 days but to get my hair in shape</li>
      <li>and this is one of my favorites right now!</li>
      <li>It really helped save my hair!!</li>
      <li>But considering how tangley my hair can be, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite hair treatment.</li>
      <li>I recently started using Enjoy hair products and LOVE them all.</li>
      <li>This item arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>how healthy it looked in general.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and packaged well in a large box.  </li>
      <li>I use super hot styling tools to straighten my hair and this really helps protect my hair from damage.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
      <li>U don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really helped!</li>
      <li>But the shipping was fast!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend the entire Enjoy line!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited to try other ENJOY products.</li>
      <li>I have dry thick hair and this product is the best I&#x27;ve tried as a conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I quickly ordered another bottle of the Enjoy hair mask and am tempted to just toss the other one.</li>
      <li>and I can really feel a difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>This product really detangles my hair if it sit under a plastic cap or dryer for 5 mins or so.</li>
      <li>Really helps soften my hair from damage of color and heat.</li>
      <li>I began using it once or twice a week, washing my hair normally and then applying the mask after rinsing and letting it sit for 10-20 minutes in a hot shower.</li>
      <li>I been using Enjoy products for years including their regular conditioner.</li>
      <li>something that isn&#x27;t easy to do when your hair is dry and over processed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product helps keep my hair soft and smooth until my next trim.</li>
      <li>I later tried a $42 hair mask assuming that the results would be even more astounding and boy, I was wrong.</li>
      <li>was the new packaging and not a couple years old product sitting on the shelf as an overstock.</li>
      <li>Wanted to pass on that even though the picture displays the old packaging, it is the new packaging.  </li>
      <li>The $42 hair mask did not do even half of what the Enjoy one did</li>
      <li>and I felt completely ripped off in the end.</li>
      <li>I could definitely tell a difference in the way my hair felt, how much easier it was to curl it</li>
      <li>but this didnt help with moisture or being soft.</li>
      <li>Love this and use a small amount daily!</li>
      <li>I have straight thin hair, my mom who also loves it has wavy thick hair; works great for both.</li>
      <li>I have color treated long thick hair and have been using Enjoy since it first started.  </li>
      <li>This product really moisturizes dry hair but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great price, quick shipping, and you only need a little bit!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product if you need extra hair conditioning at least once a week; just use in place of your regular Enjoy conditioner.</li>
      <li>I just put a small amount in with the enjoy luxory conditioner and leave it on while I shave and then brush with a wet brush as I rinse it out.</li>

<li> I use it a few times a week after a cleansing shampoo or whenever my hair starts feeling like straw.</li>
<li> this keeps my hair well hydrated in spite of my harsh and drying routine</li>
<li> This Hair Mask used a couple times a week works well in restoring moisture to my hair, which as we all know helps tame the frizz!</li>
<li> It was a little difficult to remove all the tape around the product</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed with this Mask!</li>
<li> This product is a game changer!</li>
<li> The only problem is, it smells terrible.</li>

    <li> This product really detangles my hair if it sit under a plastic cap or dryer for 5 mins or so. The only problem is, it smells terrible. I feel the need to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; the smell with another conditioner. But considering how tangley my hair can be, it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, Excellent quality and half the price on line.  Received in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed with this Mask! I love enjoy hair products but this didnt help with moisture or being soft. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I have started using this mask once a week to combat my very dry hair. It&#x27;s working!</li>
    <li> Really helps soften my hair from damage of color and heat.</li>
    <li> Wanted to pass on that even though the picture displays the old packaging, it is the new packaging.  I contacted the seller to verify it was the new packaging and not a couple years old product sitting on the shelf as an overstock. I intermix the Hair Mask with the Luxury Conditioner.  I have color treated long thick hair and have been using Enjoy since it first started.  Accidently met one of the owners years a go in HOllywood and he gave me some samples.  Been using the product ever since!  I do miss the $12 a bottle price tag, but they started competing with Pureology. Highly recommend the entire Enjoy line!</li>
    <li> Love the product, leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy!  I love Enjoy hair products, would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Love this and use a small amount daily!</li>
    <li> good stuff made my hair sift and smells great ! :)</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite hair treatment. The formula is amazing and I love how it keeps my hair well-nourished. It has an amazing smell to top the cake! I would recommend this to anyone who has very dry hair.</li>

    <li> Works great. Always have an extra on hand since I swim a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Takes out all tangles and conditions.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this hair mask by my hair stylist after she noticed my hair did not seem as healthy and I was actually losing some in the back as well. I began using it once or twice a week, washing my hair normally and then applying the mask after rinsing and letting it sit for 10-20 minutes in a hot shower. The results were off the charts! I could definitely tell a difference in the way my hair felt, how much easier it was to curl it, how it didn&#x27;t tangle as easily and how healthy it looked in general. I later tried a $42 hair mask assuming that the results would be even more astounding and boy, I was wrong. Nothing can beat this Enjoy hair mask, neither results or price. The $42 hair mask did not do even half of what the Enjoy one did and I felt completely ripped off in the end. I quickly ordered another bottle of the Enjoy hair mask and am tempted to just toss the other one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every deep conditioner on the market and this is one of my favorites right now! Truly works and makes my hair feel like silk... something that isn&#x27;t easy to do when your hair is dry and over processed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, quick shipping, and you only need a little bit! I tend to use this on the ends every time I shower just to keep my hair healthier.  I&#x27;m excited to try other ENJOY products.</li>
    <li> I been using Enjoy products for years including their regular conditioner. Recently it seemed like it was not working well anymore. I tried their hair mask and I can really feel a difference in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I have added product in my hair but instead it feels healthier and more managable.</li>
    <li> My hair is processed and this product makes it shine and awesome.  I Love It.</li>
    <li> Fabulous! This product really moisturizes dry hair but isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I was originally going to use it every 10 days but to get my hair in shape, I&#x27;ve used it more often and it&#x27;s really helped! Great product.</li>
    <li> Love love love the mask. Excellence product. Help my hairs look and feel silky and shiny</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years-- the best hair mask I&#x27;ve tried. The texture is almost buttery. You don&#x27;t need much. It&#x27;s extremely nourishing without making the hair frizzy, as I find with a lot of moisturizing hair products. I use it a few times a week after a cleansing shampoo or whenever my hair starts feeling like straw. I have straight thin hair, my mom who also loves it has wavy thick hair; works great for both.</li>
