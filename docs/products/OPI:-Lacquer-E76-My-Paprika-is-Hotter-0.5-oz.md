    <li> This color is electric orange. I love it. I have more OPI than I want to count but I just had to have this one too. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to apply evenly, but oh so beautiful when you&#x27;ve put it on:) I&#x27;m planing on buying the Euro-Mini set next.</li>
    <li> I love opi for nails - I have purchased many different colors through different sellers, recommend this seller- item was delivery quickly and priced fair.
