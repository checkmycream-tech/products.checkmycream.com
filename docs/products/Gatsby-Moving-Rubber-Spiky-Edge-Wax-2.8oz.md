      <li>Works good for me.</li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing product in my opinion.</li>
      <li>This product is one of a kind.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so much better while using this product instead of hair sprays and gels like echo that flake.</li>
      <li>and my hair is choosy though it only works for gatsby :D</li>
      <li>The best wax out there for Asian hair.</li>
      <li>Although, if you end up sweating like I have in 90+ degree weather you may need to apply more as it wears off.</li>
      <li>Glad you carried it.</li>
      <li>Love the apple scent and the fact that it works.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Nothing better on the market that I have come across.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this</li>
      <li>I just ordered more for people at work that I let try it.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to style my hair.</li>
      <li>It costs a little bit more but honestly it has lasted me a good year or so.</li>
      <li>This is the beat hairwax available.</li>
      <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>I wanted to give this product a go and thanks to the seller I was finally able to try it.</li>
      <li>Good stuff if you are an Asian.</li>
      <li>It has fantastic hold but is never sticky (if you use it right).  </li>
      <li>He likes that fact that girls can run their fingers through it without losing this artistic masterpiece.</li>
      <li>Perfect hold for my thick, straight hair.</li>
      <li>This worked better than most other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and my hair isn&#x27;t stiff either.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is first time to use here but shipping also</li>
      <li>This means that my hair has to be willing to stand up and out.</li>
      <li>I have searched for years to find something as good as Modern Organic Product&#x27;s Finishing Paste (which, sadly, has now been discontinued) and have bought a huge variety of products that claim to be strong hold</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hands down my favorite hair styling product!</li>
      <li>best way to use it is after you wash your hair, dry it with a blow dryer and then apply a small amount to your hand, rub your hands together and then run your hands through your hair.</li>
      <li>product is not expensive, last a long time, and hold my hair fairly well throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I found it best to apply to towel dried hair - push things generally into place, then go get dressed and come back after dressing to finish styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Takes some work washing out but smells great,like green apples, and works amazing all day.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s made my mornings so much simpler.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very forgiving, and if you style your hair one way, decide you want to change it, you can.</li>
      <li>very much&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it really holds longer</li>
      <li>Works fast and stays all day.</li>
      <li>I love pink Spiky Edge</li>
      <li>This is hands down the best styling product for short spiky hair, i bought this because being asian, we have very coarse hair.</li>
      <li>Natural look after application and able to be re-styled during the day by adding a little bit of water with no need for additional product.</li>
      <li>Most other products dont work real well for all day style without eventually starting to fall flat.</li>
      <li>The shipping on this was super fast - weeks earlier than expected.  </li>
      <li>However that has more to do with the slow usps then anything else.</li>
      <li>Gatsby is pretty popular among the Asian community because our hair is pretty difficult to tame.</li>
      <li>This Does not flake for me, easily gives me messy/spike hair with only a small amount of product, comes of when you need it to, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and rubbery, and works perfectly for my very thin hair.</li>

<li> very runny, hard to open and use without making a mess, could never bring this to the gym, I am a bed head guy</li>
<li> My hair is extremely stubborn, and there are not too many wax or gel products that can help remedy my crazy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Holds all day, doesn&#x27;t look wet, if I let me hair dry before I put it on.</li>
<li> Not too hard nor soft.</li>
<li> I have short hair that I like to wear in the messy look.</li>
<li> I cannot comment as to how well it works versus other Gatsby products because I haven&#x27;t used them yet.</li>
<li> this stuff on the other hand works wonders.</li>
<li> The only complaint is that it took 6 weeks for delivery.</li>
<li> only complaint is it leaves your hair feeling slightly oily and slightly sticky.</li>
<li> In other words, keeps the shape but doesn&#x27;t feel all stiff and crunchy.</li>
<li> This product achieves the effect but without the crusty, hard, plastic feel that some super-hold products leave.</li>
<li> This is the least amount of hold out of the Gatsby line I believe.</li>
<li> Dries very hard and takes a while to wash out of your hair.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
<li> This holds my son&#x27;s hair in all the weird configurations he can think of.</li>
<li> I would recommend this to anyone with difficult to manage hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My son loves this stuff.  Glad you carried it.</li>
    <li> I like wearing funky hairstyles this holds it in place all day great stuff!</li>
    <li> i thought the shipping rate of the item based on where it is from is excellent as well as the product itself, it exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> This product is one of a kind. Takes some work washing out but smells great,like green apples, and works amazing all day. You can rework your hair into different styles and it will never leave your hair. Great product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have searched for years to find something as good as Modern Organic Product&#x27;s Finishing Paste (which, sadly, has now been discontinued) and have bought a huge variety of products that claim to be strong hold but which end up just being greasy. Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge Wax is perfect--not at all greasy, and it gives incredible hold. I have short hair that I like to wear in the messy look. This means that my hair has to be willing to stand up and out. This product achieves the effect but without the crusty, hard, plastic feel that some super-hold products leave. This is a winner!</li>
    <li> This stuff is NOT what it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  Dries very hard and takes a while to wash out of your hair.  I prefer hair wax over this stuff.  I&#x27;d compare this to putting candy in your hair, and having it harden.  It&#x27;s weird.</li>
    <li> Love it. I look like Japanimation</li>
    <li> I found this product when I was living in Okinawa, and haven&#x27;t looked back. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s thick and rubbery, and works perfectly for my very thin hair. It&#x27;s also very forgiving, and if you style your hair one way, decide you want to change it, you can. It&#x27;s hands down my favorite hair styling product!</li>
    <li> very runny, hard to open and use without making a mess, could never bring this to the gym, I am a bed head guy</li>
    <li> This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried everything from drug store products to specialty salon products. It has fantastic hold but is never sticky (if you use it right).  The shipping on this was super fast - weeks earlier than expected.  The price is great too!</li>
    <li> Nothing better on the market that I have come across. This is the beat hairwax available. Hair prone to buildup should probably avoid this</li>
    <li> I had 3 dozen hair products of all types and brands that I threw away once I discovered Gatsby. It&#x27;s light and easy to style my hair. You can&#x27;t even tell I have product in my hair but it manipulates however I want it to! I absolutely love it. I just ordered more for people at work that I let try it. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this, it&#x27;s made my mornings so much simpler.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and swear by it. Natural look after application and able to be re-styled during the day by adding a little bit of water with no need for additional product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing product in my opinion. Works fast and stays all day. Although, if you end up sweating like I have in 90+ degree weather you may need to apply more as it wears off. I loved this product.</li>
    <li> Too oily. I prefer a wax</li>
    <li> I love pink Spiky Edge gatsby.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonder with short or medium-long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all, but especially to Asians.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Lots of control. I found it best to apply to towel dried hair - push things generally into place, then go get dressed and come back after dressing to finish styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is it leaves your hair feeling slightly oily and slightly sticky.</li>
    <li> This always works find for me and I like this very much&lt;br /&gt;This is first time to use here but shipping also so fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best styling product for short spiky hair, i bought this because being asian, we have very coarse hair.

I cannot comment as to how well it works versus other Gatsby products because I haven&#x27;t used them yet. It has a nice scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and my hair isn&#x27;t stiff either. I will either purchase this again or try out another Gatsby hair wax. I would recommend this to anyone with difficult to manage hair.</li>
    <li> Works good for me. Not too hard nor soft.</li>

    <li> Great wax for styling your hair and it really holds longer and my hair is choosy though it only works for gatsby :D and it smells apple too so 10 stars!!!!</li>
    <li> This is all I use now. My hair feels so much better while using this product instead of hair sprays and gels like echo that flake. This Does not flake for me, easily gives me messy/spike hair with only a small amount of product, comes of when you need it to, etc. Great product for the price and It&#x27;s all I use.</li>

    <li> The best wax out there for Asian hair. Well short Asian hair. I need wax to look good and this delivers</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely stubborn, and there are not too many wax or gel products that can help remedy my crazy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not expensive, last a long time, and hold my hair fairly well throughout the day.</li>
