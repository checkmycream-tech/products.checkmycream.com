    <li> I love the scent of this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Bath &amp; Body Works lotions. Warm Milk and Honey is the perfect name for it. That&#x27;s just what it reminds you of, especially the way it smells. And it&#x27;s so soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer K. Lafferty&lt;br /&gt;Author of Offbeat Love Stories and More</li>
    <li> This lotion is PERFECT!!!! I love the way it smells and the way it relaxes you after applying.  It has a nice scent and you will sleep like a baby!!!</li>
    <li> I was bummed to receive the body wash instead of the lotion I ordered. I already have the body wash and really like the smell. I&#x27;m wondering if this product has been discontinued (I didn&#x27;t try to re-order the lotion - just requested a refund). The return process was very easy and I received a full refund quickly.</li>

    <li> One of my clients gave me a bottle of this and I fell in love with the smell! Hunted around my area and couldn&#x27;t find it, was told this particular smell was only available on holidays, have no idea why, sounds ridiculous, but I found it online and bought an extra couple of bottles, wonderful warm scent!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother all the time because it is her favorite lotion and they discontinued it from bath and body works. The smell is so warm and delightful! She gets compliments all the time! I highly suggest it;</li>

    <li> This lotion, while feeling lovely and absorbing quickly, had absolutely no discernible scent to me, and so I sent it back.  A couple of weeks later, I actually had an opportunity to take a sniff at a Bath &amp; Body Works and *found* the scent in the B&amp;BW sample!</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic!  Nicely moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product goes on great and smells good.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t think the fragrance lasts very long.</li>
