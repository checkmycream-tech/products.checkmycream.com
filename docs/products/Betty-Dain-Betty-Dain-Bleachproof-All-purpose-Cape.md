      <li>Love the color also!</li>
      <li>I dye my own hair and use this every time.  </li>
      <li>Nice cape.</li>
      <li>I love the way it repels water, it works great with lose hair and my clients love the color.</li>
      <li>: Nice color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>In the meantime I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and the price.</li>
      <li>Much better than the housecoat and towel that I was using.</li>
      <li>Clients Love the colored this cape.</li>

      <li>So far I&#x27;m loving the fact that the cape is almost water resistant even though it&#x27;s not a cape for dying hair</li>
      <li>I would prefer velcro, but didn&#x27;t want to do a lot of searching as I needed this quickly.</li>
      <li>so the hair slips right off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>High quality, bleach proof, doesn&#x27;t tear or rip easy (none yet, had the first one about 4 months)</li>
      <li>so, very durable!</li>
      <li>But I can add velco easy enough if they do.</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s cloth, it certainly seems to be waterproof.</li>
      <li>It was shipped out fast as I&#x27;m a prime member, so I received it in two days.  </li>
      <li>cloth is very durable and nothing seems to stick to it.</li>
      <li>Very durable and water just beads off them.</li>
      <li>Maybe the water resistant-news will fade after a few more</li>
      <li>It is smooth and tightly woven</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my husband, 13 year old son, and 4 year old son.</li>
      <li>I bought this to replace a plactic, torn cape I had that came with an old set of trimmers that I bought.</li>
      <li>Heavy duty and large enough to cover clothes so they don&#x27;t get damaged or hair all over them.</li>

<li> I have been cutting hair for 17 years and this is my favorite hair</li>

<li> For someone who isn&#x27;t as messy as I am the back length would not be a problem.  </li>
<li> and I am not disappointed because I can use it as a cutting cape or a chemical drape.</li>
<li> Bad quality for the price and a full service salon.</li>
<li> color is a little darker than in the picture.</li>
<li> She&#x27;s had it for a few months and has had no complaints about it.</li>
<li> Long in the front, short in the back, and annoying.</li>
<li> : Way, way, way, too short in the back to protect your client from chemicals or hair clippings :(</li>
<li> Very disappointed, after first wash snaps coming off the capes.  </li>

    <li> Great purple color! Heavy duty and large enough to cover clothes so they don&#x27;t get damaged or hair all over them. Nice snaps at the neckline!</li>
    <li> I have been cutting hair for 17 years and this is my favorite hair cape.&lt;br /&gt;The cloth is very durable and nothing seems to stick to it. Even though it&#x27;s cloth, it certainly seems to be waterproof.</li>
    <li> This was definitely a great product for the price and I am not disappointed because I can use it as a cutting cape or a chemical drape.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I dye my own hair and use this every time.  It&#x27;s a good quality item for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Much better than the housecoat and towel that I was using.</li>
    <li> I got several Betty Dain capes for my daughter for Christmas. She is extremely happy with the look and quality</li>
    <li> This is great cape, one of the better ones we had in a long time. Clients Love the colored this cape.</li>
    <li> High quality, bleach proof, doesn&#x27;t tear or rip easy (none yet, had the first one about 4 months) so, very durable! Love the color also!</li>
    <li> I got this item the next day after I ordered it even though I didn&#x27;t pay for express shipping. This is a very large cape and the snap closers are got for big and thin necks. So far I&#x27;m loving the fact that the cape is almost water resistant even though it&#x27;s not a cape for dying hair and it&#x27;s not plastic. Maybe the water resistant-news will fade after a few more washes-- I still don&#x27;t know. In the meantime I&#x27;m pretty happy with it and the price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend who is in cosmetology school and she loves it. She&#x27;s had it for a few months and has had no complaints about it.</li>
    <li> I love the colors of the cape and that its light weight. It washed up nicely and air dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Nice cape. Light weight and I like the colors on both sides. I would not say it is water proof.</li>
    <li> Love the fabric feel of the cape, this is my first fabric cape and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it. I am not a fan of the plastic snaps because I&#x27;m guessing those will wear out. But I can add velco easy enough if they do. I would prefer velcro, but didn&#x27;t want to do a lot of searching as I needed this quickly. It was shipped out fast as I&#x27;m a prime member, so I received it in two days.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Great chemical capes!! Very durable and water just beads off them. They wash up very nicely. Will definately order again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, after first wash snaps coming off the capes.  Won&#x27;t purchase these again. Bad quality for the price and a full service salon.</li>
    <li> I love the way it repels water, it works great with lose hair and my clients love the color.</li>
    <li> All in all this cape is very good.  My only issue is the back could be a little longer, otherwise 5 stars.  I love the color, the material functions perfectly, and the snap collar snugs up nicely to any size neck.  For someone who isn&#x27;t as messy as I am the back length would not be a problem.  My sister uses this and has no complaints, she gives it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;We use it for haircuts and dying.  It is smooth and tightly woven so the hair slips right off.&lt;br /&gt;The color is a little darker than in the picture.</li>
    <li> Not disappointed with this purchase at all. I bought this to replace a plactic, torn cape I had that came with an old set of trimmers that I bought. I&#x27;ve used this on my husband, 13 year old son, and 4 year old son. The adjustable button closure fits well on all of them and it&#x27;s easy to take off.</li>
    <li> Nope, not for me, here is why... The back of this cape is waaayyyy too short to protect the clients clothing (I hope you have them change into a gown before you start a service if you are going to use this cape). Long in the front, short in the back, and annoying. Not pro level at all. For home use haircuts, (can&#x27;t recommend that) still too short in the back to protect from chemicals or hair clippings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Way, way, way, too short in the back to protect your client from chemicals or hair clippings :(</li>
