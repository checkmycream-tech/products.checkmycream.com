### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>And in fact, NutriBiotic&#x27;s Deoderant Stick is the best of the bunch.    </li>
      <li>I think this is a very good product and delivered on time as promised by supplier.</li>
      <li>Great product, works well.</li>
      <li>We love it, works great!</li>
      <li>It works about as good as using nothing.</li>
      <li>Good if you want to smell like a hippie.</li>
      <li>An excellent and effective product that is aluminum free.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased and will buy again.</li>
      <li>Also I believed then that most perfumed scents were attractive and clean-smelling.  </li>
      <li>Even without deodorant I smelled better than when using this!  </li>
      <li>The liquid is effective in getting yeast infections under control, love the ointment!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn or any kind of underarm problems since I started using this.</li>
      <li>Speaking of effective, this stuff is amazingly effective at keeping me from smelling sweaty.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>But those were the days when I used any kind of deodorant</li>
      <li>Amazing odor control and safe while breastfeeding.  </li>
      <li>The best natural products for killing those bacteria are grapefruit seed extract and witch hazel.</li>
      <li>Effective, but I don&#x27;t get a strong perfumed scent from it.  </li>
      <li>and I read up on a certain skin condition I am trying to treat and it works great.  </li>
      <li>Sure hope it works better for him than it did for</li>
      <li>whenever we are on the threshold of &amp; throughout illness (have for many years),as</li>
      <li>I tried many products, including the ubiquitous \\&quot;crystal.\\</li>
      <li>This works fantastic!</li>
      <li>We do ingest many more than the recommended amts.tho&#x27;.</li>
      <li>When I took a whiff of this from the top of the stick before I turned the knob, it smelled most like a women&#x27;s moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than having to buy everything you try on.</li>
      <li>I plan to get more.  </li>
      <li>&quot; More research taught me that the stink is created by bacteria which feed off our sweat.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>wanted to love this NutriBiotic deodorant because it&#x27;s unscented as well as free of aluminum and parabens.  </li>
      <li>I have to try other brands to see which one will work best for me.</li>
      <li>and that is aluminum-free and paraben free .</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this product would work effectively as a non-chemical deodorant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to find a healthy deodorant, without aluminum and such in it, and that doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my third stick right now, and am still loving it.</li>
      <li>and the texture is smooth and glides on really nicely, but it didn&#x27;t keep me from stinking on an active day.</li>
      <li>certainly have not noticed any &#x27;B.O.&#x27; issues emanating from him!</li>
      <li>My husband is in a hot deli kitchen all day and he always had armpit odor even right after showering.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but the deodorant effect of this product doesn&#x27;t last all day if it&#x27;s warm</li>
      <li>My favorite, and the only deodorant I have needed - for about 15 years!</li>
      <li>The thing that I like about this deodorant is that it seems to work better than some of the regular types without the harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>I am not sorry that I tried this product out, I really hope that it works for others because I feel that we would all be better off and healthier if we would move toward more natural remedies for everyday problems.</li>
      <li>Again, I have struck out, because this deodorant only works for a couple of hours in mild office conditions before abandoning all attempts at keeping me smelling fresh.  </li>
      <li>No irritating ingredients or fragrances</li>
      <li>I was very eager to find a deodorant that does not have Aluminum in it.  </li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>really wanted to like this product.</li>
      <li>For me, this stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>I am not entirely certain how this is doing because I lost most of my sense of smell about 6 months ago.</li>
      <li>I detect a mild witch hazel scent - barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>Goes on easily, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t need to dry, has zero fragrance, and you have zero odor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>That does not mean that it will not work for others, I am taking heart medication</li>
      <li>I wish I was made aware earlier in life of the danger of antiperspirant; specifically aluminum chloride.</li>
      <li>I bought this deodorant stick in the hopes of finding a natural deodorant that actually works for the whole day.  </li>
      <li>so I use this deoderant because I like GSE and want something natural.</li>
      <li>products.&lt;br /&gt;Happy that it is offered at such reasonable prices.  </li>
      <li>So far it seems to be working well, with helping to eliminate body odor.</li>
      <li>I tested it the first day with a 2-mile run followed by a few treks through the woods and some firewood chopping.  </li>
      <li>But a product that confers an odor like semen probably sends the wrong message in most social contexts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> After a cancerous breast tumor showed up in my underarm, I researched the antiperspirant issue and decided that the evidence was tentative but sufficient for me to give up aluminum-based antipersperants. Yowie kazowie did I stink!    I tried many products, including the ubiquitous \\&quot;crystal.\\&quot; More research taught me that the stink is created by bacteria which feed off our sweat. Nice. The best natural products for killing those bacteria are grapefruit seed extract and witch hazel. And in fact, NutriBiotic&#x27;s Deoderant Stick is the best of the bunch.    In keeping with lessons learned, I stash alcohol preps in my purse for emergencies (usually, when trying on clothing at the store). It&#x27;s not the gentlest way to kill bacteria but it&#x27;s better than having to buy everything you try on.</li>
    <li> We love it, works great!</li>
    <li> An excellent and effective product that is aluminum free.  This is not an anti-persperant so it also does not clog your pores.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was very eager to find a deodorant that does not have Aluminum in it.  This one doesn&#x27;t, but it also caused my skin to break out under my arms after about 5 days.  I had to stop using it.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a viable solution to the big brands, which I don&#x27;t like for the crap they put in them.  Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with them for at least a while longer, though.</li>
    <li> I wear this everyday after trying some other natural deodorants. 95% of the time I don&#x27;t smell because of it, but if you are planning on going to the gym or work construction and think that this will stop you from smelling, look else where. I&#x27;m on my third stick right now, and am still loving it. I used to change brands every other time, but I am going to stick with this for a while.</li>
    <li> Finally one that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate. No irritating ingredients or fragrances and it does it&#x27;s job for 24 hours.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Good if you want to smell like a hippie.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth the money.  I plan to get more.  It really works.  Will look into the other ingredients.</li>
    <li> Amazing odor control and safe while breastfeeding.  I will use this deodorant from this point forward.  I wish I was made aware earlier in life of the danger of antiperspirant; specifically aluminum chloride.</li>
    <li> My favorite, and the only deodorant I have needed - for about 15 years!</li>
    <li> I like that this deodorant don&#x27;t cotain aluminum but it only work for me half a day. I have to try other brands to see which one will work best for me.</li>
    <li> Goes on easily, isn&#x27;t sticky, doesn&#x27;t need to dry, has zero fragrance, and you have zero odor.</li>
    <li> Bought this because it has grapefruit seed extract and I read up on a certain skin condition I am trying to treat and it works great.  So I dont use it as deodorant, but I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted it to work, because it seemed like GSE should kill bacteria well and the texture is smooth and glides on really nicely, but it didn&#x27;t keep me from stinking on an active day.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Effective, but I don&#x27;t get a strong perfumed scent from it.  Speaking of effective, this stuff is amazingly effective at keeping me from smelling sweaty.</li>
    <li> I am not entirely certain how this is doing because I lost most of my sense of smell about 6 months ago. I am now paranoid about stinking other people out and not knowing it so I use this deoderant because I like GSE and want something natural. I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints or dirty looks yet so I am assuming it is (hopefully) working.</li>
    <li> Works well.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product because I am trying to reduce the man made chemicals and unnatural substances in my life, unfortunately this product did not work for me. That does not mean that it will not work for others, I am taking heart medication and I have medical conditions that might affect the results for me. I found though that I was better off with nothing at all than to use this deodorant, so unfortunately I was forced to return to the standard store bought brand. I am not sorry that I tried this product out, I really hope that it works for others because I feel that we would all be better off and healthier if we would move toward more natural remedies for everyday problems.</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working well, with helping to eliminate body odor. Avoid the harmful chemicals and give this a try.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much but the deodorant effect of this product doesn&#x27;t last all day if it&#x27;s warm and/or if I&#x27;m excercising or under a little stress.  I like how it feels going on... slightly moist but not wet -- it&#x27;s not sticky and dries faster than a lot of other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was a teenager, deodorant products lasted 24 hours, from morning shower tothe next morning&#x27;s shower.  But those were the days when I used any kind of deodorant and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to ingredients.  Also I believed then that most perfumed scents were attractive and clean-smelling.  Later in life, I became allergic to scents and also I started learning about some of the questionable ingredients used in household and personal products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this NutriBiotic deodorant because it&#x27;s unscented as well as free of aluminum and parabens.  But to keep odor-free, I&#x27;d have to shower a few times a day while using this.  But I&#x27;ll keep using this until I can find an unscented deodorant that prevents odor longer and that is aluminum-free and paraben free .</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant stick in the hopes of finding a natural deodorant that actually works for the whole day.  I like the NutriBiotic brand and have used their grapefruit seed extract in the past.  Again, I have struck out, because this deodorant only works for a couple of hours in mild office conditions before abandoning all attempts at keeping me smelling fresh.  It works about as good as using nothing.</li>
    <li> For me, this stuff really works.  Put it on generously.  No fear of absorbing nasty chemicals through the tender underarm skin.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> This deodorant didn&#x27;t work for me--it became ineffective after about half a day&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> Great product, works well. I will never go back to dove or secret. I haven&#x27;t had any razor burn or any kind of underarm problems since I started using this. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm. My husband is in a hot deli kitchen all day and he always had armpit odor even right after showering. No worries now. This works fantastic!</li>
    <li> I began to doubt that I would ever find a natural deodorant devoid of nasty chemicals that actually worked.  I tried this on the advice of another trusted web site.  It works.  I tested it the first day with a 2-mile run followed by a few treks through the woods and some firewood chopping.  I like that it&#x27;s unscented.  I detect a mild witch hazel scent - barely noticeable. Very pleased and will buy again.</li>
    <li> When I took a whiff of this from the top of the stick before I turned the knob, it smelled most like a women&#x27;s moisturizer.  Unfortunately, as soon as it is applied, it smelled most like, uh, a Bradford Pear tree in blossom, and doesn&#x27;t fully go away.  Maybe the odor is due to mixing witch hazel with one of the other ingredients, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to find a healthy deodorant, without aluminum and such in it, and that doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  I was hoping I had found it with this product, even though it is more expensive than average.  But a product that confers an odor like semen probably sends the wrong message in most social contexts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an especially sweaty or stinky guy and I work in an office 8-5. This product worked until about noon and then I started to get a decidedly musky aroma. By 5:00, it was full-on body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this product. But it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> The thing that I like about this deodorant is that it seems to work better than some of the regular types without the harmful ingredients. Plus it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m pasting myself with the stuff.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping this product would work effectively as a non-chemical deodorant. Sad to say it did not. Even without deodorant I smelled better than when using this!  I was intending to return it when my husband said he&#x27;d like to give it a try. To my knowledge, he has not yet used it, but will try to post a follow-up,  if/when he does.  Sure hope it works better for him than it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;I must add that we use the nutribiotic tabs. whenever we are on the threshold of &amp; throughout illness (have for many years),as it does seem to stop the infection - or decrease the length of time it lasts. We do ingest many more than the recommended amts.tho&#x27;. The liquid is effective in getting yeast infections under control, love the ointment! ( cleared up an infection in my finger that other products did not, &amp; it&#x27;s all I reach for when an antibiotic ointment is needed) I just recently found &amp; ordered the ear drops for grandsons who have ear wax build-up &amp; ear infection issues.  Will see how that goes.  Overall, though, I am obviously a big fan of NutriBiotic products.&lt;br /&gt;Happy that it is offered at such reasonable prices.  Retail in Canada for the tablets can cost $25.00 a bottle - not affordable on our pensions.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - husband just informed me that he likes the deodorant &amp; I certainly have not noticed any &#x27;B.O.&#x27; issues emanating from him!</li>
    <li> I like this line of products, at least those I&#x27;ve tried.  I think this is a very good product and delivered on time as promised by supplier.</li>
    <li> I hate scented deodorants, and those that stick to your body and your shirt. This one is great, and it&#x27;s really not more expensive than the terrible deodorants sold at all the drugstores and supermarkets. Highly recommended.</li>
