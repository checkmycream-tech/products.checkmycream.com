      <li>/&gt;Drawbacks: The bottle is tall and therefore it didn&#x27;t fit upright in my drawer where I wanted to keep</li>
      <li>It is advertised for $18.30 + FREE SHIPPING.  </li>
      <li>Very clean and fresh</li>
      <li>bottle is 3.4 ounces which is a nice, decent amount for under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>

      <li>I receive buckets of compliments on its fresh, sweet scent.</li>
      <li>If you like a fresh shower mellow scent.</li>
      <li>it was well worth the purchase.  </li>
      <li>However, due to good reviews, I purchased this Jewel by Alfred Sung for Women Spray.</li>

      <li>The order arrived promptly and without damage so thanks very much!</li>
      <li>In addition,the package arrived in perfect, plastic wrapped condition just as if it were purchased at an expensive department store in the mall.</li>

      <li>just lovely and fresh, not strong at all and lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
      <li>Regardless of price or other factors...this fragrance came out at the top of the list for a summer &amp; all around fragrance.</li>
      <li>I use this perfume for special occasions only.  </li>
      <li>I purchased several different perfumes all at once, mostly on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It has the right combination, not too sweet or sour.</li>
      <li>I also own many expensive perfume such as dior, channel, kate spade, and DNKY, but none of those smell as classy as alfred sung&#x27;s Jewel.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes from the past.</li>
      <li>very soft romantic perfume ,thanks alot</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells good, but lasts only a couple hours each time for me. Perhaps other people it may smell on them longer, but for me I cannot detect it after short time. Was a bit disappointed there, as it does smell nice. If you only need for a short smell, then go for it.</li>
    <li> I truly love just about all of alfred sung perfumes&lt;br /&gt;hard to find been lucky finding them at marshall&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;louve the scent so soft not too loud&lt;br /&gt;but a very nice fragrance</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance.  Everyday, someone somewhere tells me how good i smell!!</li>
    <li> Love the refreshing smell - just delicious.  Wish I could find the Body Lotion as well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a light airy floral. Jewel is wonderful and is like being in a spring garden on a humid night when you can smell the jasmine and orange blossoms. I don&#x27;t smell the coconut but it is a light but lasting scent. My husband loves it!  The bottle is beautiful and for the price you can almost take baths in it!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is really nice but lasts all of just a few minutes and then is gone.  I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like all of Sung perfumes so far.</li>
    <li> I bought Jewel Perfume For Women by Alfred Sung as a newbie to perfume. I didn&#x27;t want to pay an arm and a leg to try out what I like in perfumes, and the pricing of this is just unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple blasts were strong. Then the next few smelled of alcohol, soap, or chemicals but it might have had to do with storing it horizontally instead of vertically. The past few weeks I have been enjoying the clean scent of the perfume. Not too old, not too young. Just right, and I now use it on a daily basis for a not overwhelming, not too powerful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: The bottle is tall and therefore it didn&#x27;t fit upright in my drawer where I wanted to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;You have to turn it upside down to spray.&lt;br /&gt;That gold part is pretty flimsy and it already cracked. Good thing the crystal didn&#x27;t or I would have a mess that would reek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is 3.4 ounces which is a nice, decent amount for under $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are not sure what type of perfume works well for them, this is a good choice to start learning preferences.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this forever, and now I know where to get it I will always go here. I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> If you like a fresh shower mellow scent. This is for you. Great for women who don&#x27;t want their perfume to enter the room before they do. Almost like a powder scent, daytime scent.</li>
    <li> I miss this smell, thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> its original made by canada thats what i want    very soft romantic perfume ,thanks alot</li>
    <li> This perfume smells sooooo good!!  I wasnt sure when i ordered it what it would smell like....it was well worth the purchase.  Its clean, fresh but bold.  It lasts a long time!!  Will order this one again for sure!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice, light perfume. It isn&#x27;t too heavy but its not extremely light to a point that it cannot be smelled. Good price and a nice bottle shape.</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of the BEST perfume I&#x27;ve ever owned! If you are a type of person that likes mellow, fresh, jasmine smelling perfume, then this is the one for you! I&#x27;ve always hated the type of nasty perfume that you can smell from a mile a way and sting your nose with it. But this perfume has that affect but doesn&#x27;t over power your nose. If you want a intimate and personal smell, Jewel is ideal. This perfume is great for people of all ages, a perfect gift for yourself, girlfriends, mother, grandmother, etc. I also own many expensive perfume such as dior, channel, kate spade, and DNKY, but none of those smell as classy as alfred sung&#x27;s Jewel.</li>
    <li> The perfume smells beautiful--a white floral with a hint of citrus.  This is a scent you can wear anywhere and be noticed, but does not overwhelm or offend other people.  It does not wrinkle your nose.  I will bury again and am currently searching for the body lotion to enhance the perfume.</li>
    <li> love this perfume ...some reason this one I bought on the net didn&#x27;t really leave a lasting sent</li>
    <li> just lovely and fresh, not strong at all and lasts the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;will purchase another when i finish the bottle</li>
    <li> This flowery and tangy fragrance hits just the right note for the spring and summer months.  Not too strong, yet it lingers sweetly for a good long time.  My favorite, after searching for quite a long time.  Just a hint, though, read the instructions for storing the bottle.</li>
    <li> I receive so many compliments when I wear this perfume and it&#x27;s so light and refreshing and lasts over 8 hours in a day:)&lt;br /&gt;This is my summer of 2014 signature fragrance:)</li>
    <li> This happens to be one of my favorite scents.Since I am now on a limited income, perfumes are now a luxury as opposed to a necessity. This great deal allowed me to treat myself to a wonderful scent. The item was shipped within the time frame stated by the seller. In addition,the package arrived in perfect, plastic wrapped condition just as if it were purchased at an expensive department store in the mall. I was hesitant to purchase this item online. Now, I will check with this seller anytime I allow myself a treat. Perfect experience, no issues at all &amp; a great price! What more could you ask for??</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. I love that the smell is not too overwhelming, but still strong enough to last a long time. Great buy...</li>
    <li> Smell very sweet and flowery ..last about 4 hours .</li>
    <li> I use this perfume for special occasions only.  I love this perfume because it&#x27;s not to overpowering or nauseating. It&#x27;s light and fresh and beautiful. Love it!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRODUCT - BAD SELLER! A friend of mine came into my office at work.  She smelled amazing! I asked her what she was wearing - she replied &#x27;Alfred Sung Jewel&#x27;.  She let me try it and I had to have it! I Googled it and it  brought me to Amazon.  I ordered it from AAA PERFUME MERCHANTS on Amazon.  It is advertised for $18.30 + FREE SHIPPING.  However, when you go to check out, it adds $5.94 for shipping! I immediately cancelled it and then reordered directly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes from the past. I decided to order it again and I was not disappointed. The scent stays with me all day and it sweet and soft.</li>
    <li> I had been looking everywhere for this perfume !! I love it!! Great price!!</li>
    <li> It one of my favorite scents of perfumes. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this present for my girlfriend and was a little hesitant about getting perfume off the internet and not sampling it beforehand. However, due to good reviews, I purchased this Jewel by Alfred Sung for Women Spray. My girlfriend, who admits she is difficult to buy perfume for, actually really likes the pure, citrus fragrance. If she is happy, I am happy. Plus she smells great wearing it.</li>
    <li> I purchased several different perfumes all at once, mostly on Amazon. Regardless of price or other factors...this fragrance came out at the top of the list for a summer &amp; all around fragrance. It has the right combination, not too sweet or sour. It&#x27;s my go to fragrance now &amp; at just the right price!</li>
    <li> This perfume is light and has a fresh scent to it. I really like it!</li>
    <li> Jewel perfume is so hard to find in stores. I have been wearing it for years &amp; is my favorite! The one I ordered online smelled as expected, but I don&#x27;t know why, it looks clear like water comparing to the store bought bottle, which has a tint of yellowish color to it, I had at home.</li>
    <li> Great price. Received on time. Great purchase</li>
    <li> I got this perfume a couple of years ago. My friends love it so much that I give it to them as gifts on their special occasions.</li>
    <li> Use it all of the time</li>
    <li> Bought a quantity of this product. The order arrived promptly and without damage so thanks very much!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent of this parfumerie other than intoxicating. I get compliments on it every time I wear it! Great price and it came on time and as described.</li>
    <li> So cheap and smells so expensive I love it. Very clean and fresh</li>
    <li> The scent was pleasant, nothing exceptional about it, but it didn&#x27;t last too long.  Will try another scenr from Alfred Sung.</li>
    <li> Because the fragrance only lasts about three hours or maybe four.  I&#x27;ve tried it in the past so, I decided to try it again because I needed some perfume.</li>
    <li> I have also used this perfume and I really love it it is a old product but I will still buy.&lt;br /&gt;I am always receiving compliments everytime  I wear it</li>
    <li> I did not get the jewels by Alfred Sung.. Got some other perfume and its awlful.</li>
    <li> I did not get the same bottle that is pictured here - like the old bottles I used to get a few years ago.. I got the bottle with a seperate top and a spray nozzle on top of the bottle.. Also I spray it on me and a few minutes, actually less than that, there is no scent left. I walk into the other room after dousing myself with it and my husband says , no, he can&#x27;t smell it either.. It&#x27;s like water.... what&#x27;s going on with this lovely scent that I used for years?</li>
    <li> Got my order today and I so  love it!!! Smells like Angels breath Cologne  but  this is a perfume. Light scent and good for ages 18 above.</li>
    <li> I love Alfred Sung.  I like the unique bottle and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this perfume.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume!  I receive buckets of compliments on its fresh, sweet scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite! Thank you</li>
    <li> I have bought this before and will buy it again when mine runs out!! I even bought some for a friend of mine as well before.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and in great quality. would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> I was desperate to find a replacement for the bottle I already had and I was nearing empty!!  Oh no!!!  So I turned to my favorite online &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; and found it...YEAH!!!  I wish Alfred Sung would bring this scent back!!!</li>
    <li> It is just great! Just what I wanted and it arrived in good time.</li>
