      <li>Good hold for fine hair.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best I have tried.</li>
      <li>this product is the best product for curly hair so far that I have found.</li>

      <li>should have known that it was too good to be true for $11.00 vs the $18 I pay at the salon.  </li>
      <li>Very Light</li>
      <li>I could not ask for more.</li>
      <li>Love the consistency.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I remember it being more defining on the curls.</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to whether it keeps hair healthy if you straighten every day.</li>
      <li>:I was able to order the made in USA from e-commerce closeouts on this site.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Sebastian is one of the top quality brands out there</li>
      <li>you will love this mousse.  </li>
      <li>This Mousse was ok.</li>
      <li>I have tried many mousses to get the results of curl definition and softness.</li>
      <li>Like it more than the whipped cream.</li>
      <li>It is still a pretty good mousse.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light, but provides good hold to my straight hair.</li>
      <li>out easy.</li>
      <li>I would strongly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I actually read about this mousse in a magazine of mine and decided to try it, it gives you great style without the stickiness that most cheap mousse&#x27;s give you.</li>
      <li>If you have baby fine hair...</li>
      <li>Great product for coarse and frizzy hair!</li>
      <li>When I recieved it I checked everything out and it is the excact same great product.</li>
      <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything that is available for curly hair out there.</li>
      <li>I find it to provide great hold, but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t put a brush in my hair later that day.  : )</li>
      <li>I have fine, hard to manage, straight hair and this mousse is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  </li>
      <li>and this product did not disappointment.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>You should make a whipped cream that&#x60;s slightly more masculine.</li>
      <li>Exact replacement of old mousse at a better price.</li>
      <li>It does not weigh it down and the hold is good.  </li>
      <li>This mousse does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
      <li>(Aveda Smooth Infusion is the only other good one I&#x27;ve found).</li>
      <li>My big question is do I really want to put a product on my hair that has Propane and Butane as the top two ingredients after water.  </li>
      <li>The large orange flame fire warning on the side was my first clue.  </li>
      <li>We love this mousse - have been using this for a long time.</li>
      <li>It leaves your hair full, curls defined and soft.</li>
      <li>I bought this with the understanding it was the real thing.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i don&#x27;t use it very often and keep it just in case i run out of product and need something to use fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have gone through many bottles of the Sebastian, this time the ingredient seems different, smells different.....</li>
      <li>Butane is mainly used as a fuel.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Seeing the price compared to other cheap $4 ones I could get, I began with high expectations for Sebastian mousse.</li>
      <li>I only use it if I plan to style my hair with a straightener since it gives good hold without being too hard, there is still some movement in my hair after I am done using it.</li>
      <li>but it did leave my hair very soft and silky</li>
      <li>I have medium thickness, slightly wavy hair that tends to be so smooth that bobby pins don&#x27;t hold and braids fall apart in minutes.</li>
      <li>after 4 minutes there was still a slight liquid sound in the made in Argentina can.</li>
      <li>I use this mousse everyday and it washes out easily too.  </li>
      <li>sure if it&#x27;s worth the extra money though compared to other brands that cost half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also compared the two on shaking and the USA can almost immediately goes silent meaning the foam is ready and</li>
      <li>Does a good job of lift and body... expensive in salons and at department stores.  </li>
      <li>It washes out well and after conditioning, my hair is back to how it normally is.</li>
      <li>From now on I will buy no other.</li>
      <li>This is one of 10 different moussse brands I have tried so far</li>
      <li>and you can tell by the sound that it is getting thick.  </li>
      <li>Shook the can again - even more than usual; and still it was not right..</li>
      <li>First I&#x27;ll say that I am male, asian, pretty short hair (I have bangs down to my eyebrows), very thick, straight hair.</li>

<li> There are other differences in the ingredient lists as well.&lt;br /&gt;The foam compared side by side is obviously thicker with a richer feel from the USA can and stays as a foam when smeared across my hair while the Argentina foam immediately turns liquid.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderful mousse with no stickiness.  It gives some volume to my very fine hair.</li>
    <li> Sebastian products are great.  This mousse does exactly what it claims to do.  It leaves your hair soft and manageable with fullness and no stiffness or stickiness like some other products.  I use this mousse everyday and it washes out easily too.  I will never buy any other mousse.  This is the best.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Sebastian is one of the top quality brands out there and this product did not disappointment. It&#x27;s very light, but provides good hold to my straight hair. My hair still feels soft after applying this mousse unlike other mousses I&#x27;ve used which makes my hair very stiff. I could not ask for more.</li>
    <li> We love this mousse - have been using this for a long time.</li>
    <li> Always consistently good.</li>
    <li> works well, not greasy</li>
    <li> I have fine, hard to manage, straight hair and this mousse is the best I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  It does not weigh it down and the hold is good.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> my old mousse dried out my hair so bad but this stuff didn&#x27;t! gives me the body and hold i want without all the dryness</li>
    <li> I would strongly recommend this product.  I find it to provide great hold, but not so much that I couldn&#x27;t put a brush in my hair later that day.  : )</li>
    <li> Very pleased. Same product I use and have purchased from salons. Unlike other reviews, my can DOES say, made in USA as well as looking and feeling the same as other cans I have purchased in the past. From my experience, my purchase is defiantly the same product.</li>
    <li> Exact replacement of old mousse at a better price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Mousse. Does the job holding &amp; giving body. It also smells nice. My only con is it is a little heavy</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Works well for my hair.  I&#x27;ve used this for many years and simply love it a lot!</li>
    <li> It has a great fragrance and it is light and gives great hold and body to my hair.  It helps me keep a curl all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 years; I received this order; and immediately when I put a small amount in my hand I noticed the formula different....Shook the can again - even more than usual; and still it was not right..I contacted the seller; and said what is going on the can is in spanish it isn&#x27;t extra hold (which is always on the front of the can)  the product formula hasn&#x27;t changed per Sebastian. their response is all their products are from Venezuela they never disclosed this.&lt;br /&gt;Their response is that all their products ship from Venezuella...well that explains this-  and they didn&#x27;t even disclose this-</li>
    <li> Seeing the price compared to other cheap $4 ones I could get, I began with high expectations for Sebastian mousse. I have the kind of hair that does not like to be controlled and its almost impossible to get it to work with a lot of the hair products out there.  Over all it got me through the day, without the feeling of getting home looking in the mirror and thinking I hope I didn&#x27;t look like that all day.  This is one of 10 different moussse brands I have tried so far and this is one of two that actually works on my hair, but it still doesn&#x27;t produce the results I would have wanted compared to another cheaper one I&#x27;ve been using.  Good mousse but I&#x27;m still in the search for the perfect mousse.</li>
    <li> It was runny. Had to throw it away. Not usable. I had to buy another one at my hair salon.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this having used it before. Although I read the reviews after my purchase I grew concerned. When I recieved it I checked everything out and it is the excact same great product.</li>
    <li> thank you, will purchase again</li>
    <li> Great Mousse!! Love the consistency.</li>
    <li> I love this mouse! I have medium thickness, slightly wavy hair that tends to be so smooth that bobby pins don&#x27;t hold and braids fall apart in minutes. But not with Mousse Forte. It gives my hair volume, texture and great hold. I like the smell a lot, too. I like to add a little Oscar Blandi dry shampoo on day 2 afte</li>
    <li> I actually read about this mousse in a magazine of mine and decided to try it, it gives you great style without the stickiness that most cheap mousse&#x27;s give you. It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything that is available for curly hair out there. this product is the best product for curly hair so far that I have found.</li>
    <li> I have tried many mousses to get the results of curl definition and softness. This is by far the best I have tried. It leaves your hair full, curls defined and soft. From now on I will buy no other.</li>
    <li> I love this foam! Does a good job of lift and body... expensive in salons and at department stores.  These prices are about half!</li>
    <li> If you have baby fine hair...you will love this mousse.  I can use very few products that will not weigh my hair down.  Sebastian Mousse Forte was a good find for me.  It leaves my hair with a great shine...and styles nicely with my blow dryer.  I&#x27;m sold on this product....just use it once and you will be, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product which was recommended by my hair dresser. Good hold for fine hair.</li>
    <li> Like it more than the whipped cream. You should make a whipped cream that&#x60;s slightly more masculine.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for light hair control</li>
    <li> Great product for coarse and frizzy hair! It gives body and defines your curls. I usually have to run a flat or curling iron through it or I cannot even leave the house without strange looks. Best product found in my lifetime of dealing with this hair! (Aveda Smooth Infusion is the only other good one I&#x27;ve found). Be sure to use a GOOD diffuser.</li>
    <li> great product a great price. love it</li>
    <li> Here is my comparison from the can I bought from the salon vs the one i got here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have known that it was too good to be true for $11.00 vs the $18 I pay at the salon.  The can is slightly smaller and doesn&#x27;t have the same &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; feel or logo as the salon can.  It also says &amp;#34;Hecho in Alemania&amp;#34; vs &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34;.  The mousse isn&#x27;t as thick and smells like a mans cologne with too much alcohol and almost immediately turns to liquid when you rub hands together.  The large orange flame fire warning on the side was my first clue.  Usually you shake a can of mousse and you can tell by the sound that it is getting thick.  Not on this stuff.  You can shake it till your arm falls off and it still sounds like a can of liquid.  It does nothing for my hair.  I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again unless its from a local salon, and give it a big thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the understanding it was the real thing.  The packaging looks like it, the name is the same.  The product is NOT SEBASTIAN MOUSSE FORTE!  I am sad and do not blame Amazon for such a miserable counterfeit.  I feel awful that they are using the Sebastian name.</li>
    <li> ....Very Light No build up - An amazing product.....You can&#x27;t beat the price either!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal tell all your friends!</li>
    <li> I am in the hairstyling business and haven&#x27;t used this product for a long time. I remember it being more defining on the curls. It is still a pretty good mousse.</li>
    <li> My favorite!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve have gone through many bottles of the Sebastian, this time the ingredient seems different, smells different..... something weird about it.</li>
    <li> good strong hold for hair!&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a male with hair about 2-3 inches long. i&#x27;ve been trying to find a product that has a lot of hold without getting crunchy or greasy. this product has the hold, but it still makes my hair crunchy before i get enough hold out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;washes out easy. big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extra money though compared to other brands that cost half as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t use it very often and keep it just in case i run out of product and need something to use fast.</li>
    <li> This Mousse was ok. It didn&#x27;t give me the volume I wanted but it did leave my hair very soft and silky which was nice. I love Sebastian products!</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll say that I am male, asian, pretty short hair (I have bangs down to my eyebrows), very thick, straight hair. This mousse works well. I apply it in damp hair, then blowdry, and then striaghten/style. I only use it if I plan to style my hair with a straightener since it gives good hold without being too hard, there is still some movement in my hair after I am done using it. Also, this mousse has heat protective qualities, and I believe that. It washes out well and after conditioning, my hair is back to how it normally is. I blow dry every day but i don&#x27;t use a straightener every day though so I can&#x27;t attest to whether it keeps hair healthy if you straighten every day. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product. Smells great and has a good clean feel to it.</li>
    <li> small bit goes a long way</li>
    <li> Unfortunately for Sebastian I have one of the cans that says Made in USA to compare against the one made in Argentina and the Ingredients on the side of the can do differ.  Not only that but the one made in Argentina has Propane as the second ingredient and Butane as the third.  On the Made in USA can Isobutane is second and then Propane is #8 and Butane #10 on the ingredient list.  I also compared the two on shaking and the USA can almost immediately goes silent meaning the foam is ready and after 4 minutes there was still a slight liquid sound in the made in Argentina can. There are other differences in the ingredient lists as well.&lt;br /&gt;The foam compared side by side is obviously thicker with a richer feel from the USA can and stays as a foam when smeared across my hair while the Argentina foam immediately turns liquid.&lt;br /&gt;So Sebastian is misleading anyone they tell that the formulas are the same.  My big question is do I really want to put a product on my hair that has Propane and Butane as the top two ingredients after water.  Don&#x27;t think so at any price, so unless I can be assured that the product matches my Made in USA can I won&#x27;t be buying it at any price.&lt;br /&gt;Isobutane is a refrigerant and is commonly used as a aerosol propellant as is Propane gas.  Butane is mainly used as a fuel.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:I was able to order the made in USA from e-commerce closeouts on this site. I noticed his picture looked like my USA can so I emailed him via Amazon to inquire if his product said made in USA and he immediately replied yes and I ordered a stockpile from him which was promptly delivered.</li>
