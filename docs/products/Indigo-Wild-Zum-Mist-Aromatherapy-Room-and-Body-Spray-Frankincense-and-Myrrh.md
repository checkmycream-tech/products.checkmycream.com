<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this as a room spray for years. It is my family&#x27;s favorite. The fragrance is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a unique and  wonderful smelling room spray.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and the fact that its made with the real essential oils. I can totally understand why Frankincense and Myrrh were considered desirable gifts of the Magi. The smell is intriguing: sweet and somewhat musky -a complex mature aroma.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I don&#x27;t know why reviewers can&#x27;t review the product instead of mouthing off about a shipping problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrances I&#x27;ve tried are fresh, not too heavy (which is a cardinal sin for oils like patchouli) and don&#x27;t overwhelm.  Overall, a good value (and smell) for the money.</li>
    <li> This product lifts my spirit every time I wear it...which has been daily since I got it.  Frankincense &amp; Myrrh is my new favorite body spray/personal scent!  I&#x27;m mildly allergic to cheap toilet water, so can only wear natural oils or &#x27;expensive&#x27; perfumes.  I prefer floral or woodsy, herb, earthy scents. This scent is woodsy earthy in my opinion.  When I want an extra punch of durability I layer it over Synergistic Living&#x27;s Shea Butter with Pure Frankincense.  These products go well together.</li>
    <li> just like i thought it would smell - yay!</li>
    <li> Smells great - would buy again.</li>
    <li> We love this product.  It actually works against smelly smells and has a fragrance that&#x27;s not too feminine for the men.  Have been using it in my house for 2 years.  Walking into a freshly sprayed room is a pleasure.   While I really dislike the patchouli scent, I love the frankincense and myrrh.  The lavender is also quite pleasant and equally effective.   Nice that these are natural products: only water, oils, and glycerine.   When the bottle is too empty for the spray to work, my daughters fill them with water and still find the watery mist a pleasant smell (and handy for spraying your doll&#x27;s hair, too).</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to the scent from anointing oils (which has a much sweeter note from the Frankincense), but this mist has quite a strong (but not sweet) &amp; lingering scent. This version has taken up residence in my bathrooms where 1 squirt is plenty for deodorizer after the male half has been in there. ;&gt; As for scenting the bedroom (&amp; me), I&#x27;m sticking to the anointing oils and a home-made spritzer from the anointing oils.</li>
    <li> Pleasant but not what Im used to as far as frankincense and myrrh go.  A bit perfumey and powdery for me.  Possibly I got a bad batch?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before but it seems as if they changed the formula....this one separates and needs a lot of shaking to mix. I  really haven&#x27;t used it that often because it is greasy to the touch.</li>
    <li> Frankincense &amp; Myrrh this is best for creating a soothing room scent and a warm body spritz. I love this mixture from Indigo wild. I first discovered it in Florida - at a Publix. 2 or 3 years later it is still a favorite, but not always easy to find. Recently, I found it and bought it on Amazon. Very happy the product that I got is what it should be. About the same cost (maybe slightly more on Amazon) if I remember correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product or type of product, if certain air fresheners and perfumes are too overpowering or chemical laden for your preference. In my case, I avoid many spray air fresheners, even candles (and let&#x27;s not even mention incense!) because it just gives me a headache and I do not find them smelling &amp;#34;uplifting&amp;#34;. Frankincense &amp; Myrrh from Zum Mist is different, it does not bother me at all and I enjoy it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the other Indigo Wild Zum Mists, I have tried the Sandalwood and Citrus (not to my liking to wear or rooms- it maybe ok for certain rooms and moods, just not for me. I did not notice much citrus, for me it&#x27;s too exotic/spicy scent), the Patchouli (it smells like the familiar patchouli, love vibe, nice in rooms) and the Sea Salt (I like that it smells like lemongrass with a coolness to it, great for summer but not my favorite like Frankincense &amp; Myrhh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturalist/Purist friends of mine have loved the scent, finding it did not give them a headache, and wanted to know what it was/ borrow it when I used it as an air freshener.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it, it lasts (although I am used to the scent and I barely notice it) and I have gotten compliments on my scent.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase- it&#x27;s the real deal- just shake it up each time before you spray. It lasts long. A spritz or 2 on you is all that is needed.</li>
    <li> awesome mist. a little goes a long way. we love it and it smells great. will be purchasing more. Thanks</li>
    <li> We love this company and their products. Buying high quality scent, made from quality essential oils, is a healing experience, rather than buying cheap chemically compounded products. Well worth the cost and a little goes a long way, lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.  The spray fragrance is very faint and does not last.</li>
    <li> smells amazing, lasts a pretty long time, doesn&#x27;t have that super strong/sweet/artificial smell most commercial perfumes (like department store ones) have.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this scent!  I&#x27;m now on my 2nd bottle--I&#x27;ll keep buying this over and over!  You&#x27;ll love it!  And it doesn&#x27;t take much!  Just a pump or two and the whole room will smell marvelous!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this stuff but it&#x27;s not what I think of when I think of F&amp;M. After the inital spray, you are left with a unpleasant musk smell. I don&#x27;t even want to use this in the bathroom and thought of it as a body spray makes me cough. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Way over priced for the amount of essential oil vs water</li>
    <li> Have returned all products - one leaked all over contents - 3 were missing.  Still awaiting credit to my account for returned goods on 12-29-09 - today is Jan 24!!!</li>
    <li> The only perfume I wear that I ever get compliments on!  I use two squirts and it gives me a lovely scent.</li>
    <li> It is OK (seems different from this vendor) - Doesn&#x27;t seem to be OEM product.  A little on the weak side.  Other than that, I love this product.  First time buying from this vendor.</li>
    <li> My sister had this spray which is why decided to get it.  She smelled so good, I couldn&#x27;t get enough.  For whatever reason mine smells more like Nag Champ and less like the light sweet fragrance she was wearing.  So, I would say, for some, you&#x27;ll love it and others maybe not so much.  You just have to try it to find out.  Luckily, it&#x27;s not that expensive, so perhaps worth a try.</li>
    <li> Love Love LOVE Zum products!  Especially Frankincense Spray Mist!  A definite 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> Whoa one squirt and the sheets smell divine</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a family member for my sons anxiety/sensory overload issues. Said family member is a SPeech Language Pathologist and works with learning delay students, she uses this product on herSelf for aromatherapy benefits. I used this on my son when he was having anxiety going into speech therapy and preschool. The first day I used it, he was a different child. He didn&#x27;t fight me to go to speech, and didn&#x27;t throw himself on the ground on the way out of speech. I wish I could give it 50 stars and bathe my child in it.</li>
    <li> I first found Zum Mist in a local natural food store in my city. It was in the fragrance section and I was looking for a new perfume to wear. The bottle said it was a room spray, but that a person could also wear it. I loved the frankincense  and myrrh, so bought that first. ( now I have 4 or 5 different kinds)I am not kidding when I say that I have been stopped at least 10 times in the last year or 2 and asked what I am wearing when I wear it. - and I am not that social of a gal. I imagine if I was out and about more frequently even more people would have asked. People who asked me were just regular everyday people at Wal-Mart, or even in the bus stop. It smells GREAT! - and a whole bottle lasts me for a year, at least.  You only need about 1 or 2 squirts. The scent lasts, and is very powerful. I love this stuff. My kids love it now too, and when they are on trips, I love when they tell me the packages I send smell like mom. ( frankincense and myrrh.)</li>
    <li> Even though a little goes a long way, too pricey for me to use in the whole house. I do use it in the car and bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Very unique and pleasant smell prompts everyone to ask me what it is.</li>
    <li> This scent was much to &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; for what I was looking for. Have had frankincense and Myhrr spray in the past and this was not as strong as this spray.</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the bathroom for 3 years. Very satisfied with the fragrance and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Just got it to day and spayed it on and FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!! IT SMELL SOOOO GOOD!!! I love it and I oder two more bottles!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Huge bottle. Very potent. Perfect room spray. Smells spot on to what I remember the incense smelling like. Oh and the cat loves it. Very good quality product. Perfect middle ground scent for a married couple. don&#x27;t forget to shake the bottle really well before spray. Go easy, it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
    <li> I use this mist all the time. I liked it so well I bought more and I spray a room and  I spray myself.</li>
    <li> All their products are good this happens to be one of my favorites</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful! The scent lasts on pillows and clothes. I love it in my car! Everyone wants to know what it is and expect it to be some very expensive perfume. It puts me in a better mood just smelling it..plus when I smell it makes me feel like I&#x27;m home..</li>
    <li> Amazing scent! No too heavy, not too light.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah..this spray is nice, nice, nice. Lasts a long time, covers even recent cat box odor. Very relaxing scent.</li>
    <li> This is an amazingly heady scent that everyone comments on approvingly! I  also spray my hair pieces with it in the scalp area between washings to keep them smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent! I also buy the soap. Have had people stop me and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. One guy even guessed what I had on!! At least the Frankincense part of it and said he loved it when I walked by him. lol</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the lotion in this same line and scent first.  I treated myself to it today finally after smelling them both in my local HEB and Whole Foods store.  The lady at Whole Foods told me that Frankincense &amp; Myrrh is excellent for anxiety and depression and that when she feels the blues or has anxiety she rubs this oil on her pressure points and sprays these scents around her, before she knows it her anxiety subsides.  She said certain oils and scents have healing properties this way.  I went back to work and read up on this a bit and she was correct.  I went back and purchased both the lotion and the spray.  I was also sold after reading the many reviews on this as well.  I am a big fan of Amber oil and natural scents in lieu of perfumes.  I absolutely love this one.  I sprayed it in my office and on my wrists and I feel happy and refreshed.  This is a neutral scent that men or women can enjoy in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this body spray. I found it at a Publix Supermarket and immediately fell in love. I get SO many compliments when I wear it. I&#x27;m a perfume girl and have had every sort of expensive, brand name perfumes through out the year. Putting its price and quality into consideration, it&#x27;s definitely my new favorite fragrance.i get compliments frequently!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s personally too sweet for me and that was what the 3 stars reflects. It is otherwise pleasant. I expected it to be a but earthier.  If you like sweeter scents, it is very nice. I would even say I liked it, but just not to wear regularly.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine uses this spray and once I smelled it I had to have it!  Now my mom and friends are ordering it too! It&#x27;s very strong and lingers longer than most other room smells, I also wear it too :-)</li>
    <li> Clean scent. Reminds me a little of baby powder. I prefer the patuouli scent over this one.</li>
    <li> I use this product after I take a bath/shower... I love the smell on my body and through out my house. I use Raw Cocoa butter, Shea butter,Coconut Oil,and Sweet Almond Oil mixture as a skin moisturizer then I spray a lil of this on again. When I am out and about women stop me to tell me I smell good or to ask me what scent I have on... Frequently. Men tell me I smell divine. My skin is even and glowing due to my mixture butters and oils[[ASIN:B0009YDO32 Indigo Wild Zum Mist, Frankincense &amp; Myrrh, 4 Fluid Ounces]], I smell wonderful and nature due to Indigo Wild Zum Mist, Frankincense &amp; Myrrh. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about this lovely scented spray.  I use it daily on my sheets &amp; comforter before I make my bed.  It leaves a subtle, calming, almost &#x27;welcoming&#x27; scent that I so enjoy.  Also after I&#x27;ve cleaned the house/furniture as the fragrance is just lovely to have floating throughout the house.  This is my 3rd re-order -  never want to run out of it!</li>
    <li> Zum Mist was ok but I feel it was a bit high priced because it was mostly water.The scent did last tho</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the combination of the frankincense and myrrh together. It leaves a nice ambience to any magick you are performing.</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago and it smells amazing!  It&#x27;s a little strong at first and you might think you&#x27;ve sprayed too much but give it a little time and it will dissipate to a nice mellow level.  So far, I&#x27;ve received 2 compliments in 2 days.</li>
    <li> Great smell - makes the whole house smell wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a great aromatherapy scent. It lasts for a while in the air and is great for bedding too.</li>
    <li> When sprayed in a closet,  everything smells really beautiful.  This is more like incense for clothes, or a bedroom - not a regular perfume.  Would work well as a car spray, too.  Scent is hard to describe; it&#x27;s a more serious, thoughtful smell - not fruity.</li>
    <li> When in my local grocery stores that carry Zum, I can smell their products down the aisle and always stop by for a sample. Zum&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;F &amp; M is my all time favorite and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It&#x27;s a natural scent unlike the chemical scents you find in plug ins. So that might be why I am drawn to it. I am sensitive to smells and my house has an &amp;#34;old house&amp;#34; smell to it. So when people come over, I pray one pump of Zum F&amp;M in the foyer about 20 minutes before people arrive. Everyone comments how my house smells so good. I&#x27;ve never thought to use it as a body spray but when I get my new batch, I will try it. I would buy all Indigo&#x27;s products if the prices were lower and glad to find better prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay.Certainly not Frankincense and Myrrh.If you want good stuff be ready to spend $50 plus.Go for oils</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this scent and the way it makes a room smell earthy, and refreshing at the same time.</li>
    <li> GOOD N AST SHIPPING, SMELLS GREAT, I WILL ORDER AGAIN, AND EVERYONE LOVES THE SMELL THAT COMES TO MY HOME, THIS IS A BUY BUY,  BUY,</li>
    <li> The scent is great and long lasting! I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all of my friends. You wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> Lucky to have received my first Zum Mist Spray as a gift and oh my it&#x27;s so wonderful that I determined to purchase more. I sprayed the mist in the room and upon myself and right away the fragrance was totally different but still very pleasant. Just not what I was excepting thus a bit disappointing.</li>
    <li> On Tim and as expected.</li>
    <li> Now my house and mind match in the aura of this scent! Love this natural scent floating through the house!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled this smell before and I&#x27;m weird about scents because I get sick of them quickly. I usually like sweet smells but ones that aren&#x27;t fake and perfume-y. I chose this because of all the reviews and I&#x27;m so happy I did!!! It&#x27;s the perfect combination of refreshing, light and slightly sweet.. It lingers nicely too. I&#x27;ve sprayed it through the house and will come home a few hours later and I can still smell it!! I do take advantage of the &#x27;body spray&#x27; option too! That&#x27;s how much I love the smell!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite house spray for my home and as a morning body spray. I love it! I also love this price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> If you spray a little on you, or in the atmosphere, it&#x27;s a tranquil sweet aroma and you feel sweeter smelling it. It worked for me!</li>
    <li> Perfect for Xmas time or any time really. I have asthma, and I smelled this at a store. I could not forget it. My husband doesn&#x27;t even wear deodorant because my asthma is so bad. I wanted to know what the iconic gifts of frankincense and myrrh smelled like. This is supposedly all natural. While its fabulous and most of the time doesn&#x27;t hurt my lungs/head or give me an asthma attack, I wish they would label what the perfume scent is, that&#x27;s why I gave this a 4/5. The smell is a gentle woodsy, nice musk.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful fragrance! Love it! I use it as a room freshener. Plan to order again. Wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Not a spray for your body thats for sure....but its nice to spray one tiny squirt in the house...it goes a long way and lasts all day</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this spray.  I get loads of compliments when I wear it.  I like to spray it right after I shower.  I also like the rest of the Zum product line.</li>
    <li> Just opened the box - one spray and I&#x27;m hooked! Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells really good, I&#x27;m using as a room atomizer and on my body before the gym. I don&#x27;t spray it anywhere above my shoulders though. The couple times I did it make my eyes burn. Pretty potent.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell I like it a lot. To me the scent was light but my husband felt differently. Said way too strong. Must be the oils.</li>
    <li> Effective and has a great scent. I love Zum products. The quality is there. Does the job on my husbands bathroom visits.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good order.  Not crushed, no leakage.  At this moment, I find the smell to be quite strong and plastic vs the myrh or frankincense essential oils.  I will update if the smell if it develops to something better after several hours of use.  I have yet to get use to it.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;From 3 stars to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I gradually learn to like the smell.  One spritz above the belly button! It&#x27;s soapy too.  I got a lift from a friend and he finds it potent and nauseating.  So, beware of who you are with when you use this spray!</li>
    <li> great smelling stuff. I use it as a after shower splash and car deodorizer.  It covers up smoke odors really well.  I am actually kind of hooked on the stuff and always like to be stocked up</li>
    <li> I was expecting a subtler smell but just one teensy spritz of this and the room is filled with the scent. It&#x27;s OK, I just use a very small spray now. It&#x27;s kind of a manly smell so I mostly use it in my husband&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> The ingredient list is vague and the effect is overwhelming. I don&#x27;t know what is really in it - but a friend picked it up thinking it was natural. It certainly does not feel, smell or seem natural at all to me.</li>
    <li> Wow-- this is delicious! I first got hooked on the Zum Frankincense &amp; Myrrh laundry soap, which makes our clothes smell heavenly, kind of like cola + lean, earthy spice. I knew the Zum Mist would make a great car freshener. However, I wasn&#x27;t sure how that scent would translate as a body fragrance-- until I spritzed it down my shirt a couple times. It&#x27;s woodsy, faintly sweet, and absolutely addictive, and as I&#x27;ve become more sensitive to synthetic fragrances (formerly beloved Strong Orientals and Bold Florals have become Strong, Bold Migraines), I appreciate how comfortable and easy this scent is to wear. Totally unique, too. The only thing I can compare it to, is Nature&#x27;s Gate Herbal Conditioner, which was sold in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s and also contained myrrh. Man, I LOVED the smell of that stuff and I&#x27;m so happy to re-experience it in a body mist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, this is quite concentrated. You shake the bottle to emulsify the ingredients, then spray it on your skin. Two to three sprays has the lasting power of an essential oil or eau de parfum. Although it contains clearly visible essential oils before you shake it, there is no oily stain on clothes or skin. My husband calls the fragrance &amp;#34;wonderful,&amp;#34; and most of the time he politely tolerates my choices because he likes fresh &amp; clean and I like heavy :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be scared off by comments that this smells citrusy or like wood cleaner. I don&#x27;t get that at all. It smells more like powdery myrrh-infused cola. Soft, mysterious, and very wearable by both genders. Delightful and cheap!</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes of it being &#x27;spa-like&#x27;, but its not. Has kind of a funky smell to it. I won&#x27;t be using it for our house.</li>
    <li> I am in love with my Zum Mist! I love the clean, fresh scent and get compliments on it all the time. I will buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> THIS SMELL IS WONDERFUL I CAN&#x27;T STOP SPRAYING I JUST LOVE IT I WISH IT CAME IN A BIGGER BOTTLE.I WOULD LIKE TO TRY THE OTHER CENTS.THE SELLER SHOULD SEND ALONG LITTLE SAMPLES OF OTHER SMELLS GOOD BUSINESS  BECAUSE I BUY EVERYTHING,ANYWAY PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I *love* this spray! I smelled it for the first time about a month ago and went on Amazon right away to find me some, I bought 4 bottles because I love it that much! I plan on purchasing more to give out as gifts for Christmas. Very please with this product and tell all my friends about it!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars cause it&#x27;s a bit strong so I&#x27;m just using it as a room spray for now, one spritz it&#x27;s all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite Zum product is the Frankincense and Myrrh soap, LOVE that soap. Can&#x27;t wait to try the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Zum soaps, they&#x27;re awesome.</li>
    <li> A rich, but not overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> This scent is fantastic.  I ordered it based on the the reviews. Beautiful. I sprayed my sheets and my body.  I went to buy groceries and 3 people asked me what perfume I was wearing.  It is woodsy and very original.  It does not wear off quickly.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear it on a trip I am taking.  It also makes me feel happier.  The seller was very fast.</li>
    <li> Watered down.  Need to shake before using.  Was looking more for the health benefits rather than perfume. But as a body spray it had a nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this! I use it as an all over body spray or spray a bit into my unscented lotion. It is not overwhelming like some body sprays.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful-smelling product. It&#x27;s very nice scent for mid-Winter.  The product came exactly as promised.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Found this at Publix for under $10! I had never heard of Zum before and figured I would try it out.  I LOVE this scent.  I spray a squirt in both the living room and my bedroom and it carries throughout the house.  A little dance in the mist while I spray and I smell great, too :)  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> First off this products costumer service is the best ever! Amazon &amp; the post office messed up on my order and what usually would be a big ordeal this company took care of right away. They not only refunded me my money they sent me another right away. The spray itself smells so amazing. I&#x27;ve had many other organic sprays that you have to spray over 5xs and they still fade quick. This one only needs one spray and it lasts almost a whole day on just one spray ...amazing! I&#x27;ll for sure be trying other items from this brand. If I could give them more stars I would. Great spray and amazing brand!</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful. If the scent of frankincense &amp; myrrh is what you are looking for in an aromatic mist, then this is the product.</li>
    <li> Great aroma and long lasting... I&#x27;ve seen others, but this one is very intense, great sprayer, and non leaking bottle.  And the aroma... GREAT!  You willn&#x27;t be unhappy with it.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice full but llight mist!</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from a friend and what they had seems more pure. What I recieved seems diluted.</li>
    <li> This scent works wonders! Man, woman, and child - nearly everyone who enters my apartment comment on how great it smells. I am hyper sensitive to standard perfumes (to the point of getting nauseous or triggering a migraine) and absolutely love using this in my house. I use the Frankincense and think it is simply amazing and I just put in an order for 3 more.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that this spray would smell like Frankincense or Myrrh. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like either. It is very citrusy and quite strong. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not like I was expecting. I was planning on using it as a body spray but it is way to lemon-ny smelling. I use it as a car air fresher- One or 2 sprays last a couple days.</li>
    <li> Makes me gag, unlike the Zum rosemary-mint. To each his own, I suppose, but I think the addition of fragrance to the oils makes it unexpectedly intense and artificial smelling.</li>
    <li> The fagrance is absolutely wonderful.  It&#x27;s the best spay I&#x27;ve every had.  It is more of a winter scent, however.</li>
    <li> Bought 5 so far, sometimes you can get this at Wholefoods too.  This particular smell is divine!  I give it to all my gals!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Even my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I will be buying a lot of it in the future. I want to try the other scents and products they make</li>
    <li> Love It!! Smells like to just stepped out of the spa!!! Makes you feel that good too!!!</li>
    <li> Love it. One squirt is all you need</li>
    <li> Do not over spray, it may be too strong.  Otherwise the aroma is pleasing.  Use it for beddings and curtains.</li>
    <li> The body mist that I received must be quite old. The ingredients begin to separate right after it has been shaken.  This was not the case with my previous mist that was purchased directly from Indigo Wild. In addition, the smell is &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  Waste of money.  Would give this zero stars if possible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really pleasant scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I sprayed it on a chair and curtains in my living room in the morning and smelled no trace of it when I returned home from work in the afternoon. I think I would do better with a candle or room freshener.</li>
    <li> Incredible....this will be the last scent I ever use. Been looking for a signature scent my whole life and I have found it. The oils mix well when shaken and lasts and lasts. Wonderful. always going to use!</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful.  I use it as perfume.</li>
    <li> Love...love ...love! I use it as a body mist and stays on all day! Have received many compliments! Finally found a great product!</li>
    <li> Love the traditional smell of frankincense and myrrh. Gets the essence of the scent without getting too &amp;#34;churchy&amp;#34;. Spiritually soothing. Be careful - it may open up Jacob&#x27;s Ladder, so if you&#x27;re not interesting in smelling great as well as  interior transformation, then beware! ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male and I use this right after a shower, I have an arsenal of cologne and body sprays but the ladies seem to enjoy this one the most lol. I highly recommend and will order more in the future!</li>
    <li> I Have work Frank and Myrrh for years and there isn&#x27;t a single day when someone doesn&#x27;t stop and beg to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.  For the price, it&#x27;s out of this world.  It&#x27;s also an oil and lasts a long time.  I hope to never be without this.</li>
    <li> I thought this was essentially a pure essential oil product.  It must contain perfume because I ended up with an excruciating headache the second I sprayed this.  I am very sensitive to perfumes. On the bottle, it states fragrance oil as an ingredient - that must be another word for perfume.</li>
    <li> Great room and body deodorizer.  No toxics. Spray it around your room and on your body. Frankincense &amp; Myrrh is good for the body.</li>
    <li> I really like Zum products.  My favorite scent is Frankincense and Myrrh.  This is a strong, and earthy, scent and so if you&#x27;re sensitive to scents ... you might need to know that this is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s wonderfully strong!  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I never mind spraying it around the animals.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. Many used. Natural spray for clothing or on the body. I also spray my home and car! A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love love love this scent :-)</li>
    <li> I already have this and I love it! But I got it way cheaper at Publix.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, but not this particular smell. The aroma reminds me of a perfume aimed towards an older age group. I can&#x27;t even imagine using the entire bottle like I have with my Rosemary mint spray.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who likes these essential oils, I however, don&#x27;t enjoy them.</li>
    <li> I found this little secret years ago and have been an avid fan ever since! This is a compliment to the oil (by the same name) which is the best moisturizer ever! No matter the complexion, this product will keep you smelling with a hue of a natural scent. It also, pairs well with any perfume! A nice blend of scents that will mezmorize as you walk by......</li>
    <li> This is very nice and only takes a little to make the room smell great and calm.</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It really lasts and it is both calming and warming at the same time. I use it on curtains, in the air, as a perfume.</li>
    <li> Fresh and pure revitalization to any room.  I haven&#x27;t used it as a body spray but I love love this scent and everyone that walks in my room proclaims it smells great.</li>
    <li> Im not kidding.  Besides from getting laid by my own girlfriend, four other ladies commented on how much they liked it.  One woman even stepped over her own husband to ask me about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides for the great balanced scent, its very long lasting and grows stronger during the 4-6 hours of passionate sex that accompanies its use.  Just when you think you a sweaty stinkin mess, your better half will tell you how awesome it is.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I use it as an air freshener, body mist, or whatever else I can.</li>
    <li> It is nice, however I like the Patchouli more.</li>
    <li> If you know your Bible then you&#x27;ll know that these two aroma scents were part of the gifts given to Baby Jesus....it brings about a sense of calmness. I have a bottle at home and a bottle at work.  I love the calm feeling that this scent invokes.</li>
    <li> I love it as a room spray - but as a body spray (except perhaps in winter), it&#x27;s a wee bit MUCH... This is a marvelous one-of-a-kind fragrance, but best that the MIST stays off me (I use the other Frankincense/Myrrh body items and they are fabulous!)</li>
    <li> Smell lasts way longer than I expected (pretty much all day), obviously doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that traditional perfumes have.</li>
    <li> This stuff is super powerful. When I say one spray.....I mean one spray!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful!!  Stays in the Room Air.  Have used it on pillows and furniture to carry the scent.  Will buy again!</li>
    <li> This products smells great. I add it to other things such as a room mist, and laundry. It&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments on the scent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a natural alternative to the super-chemicalized air fresheners for cars. I found a thing that goes into the cigarette lighter and also picked up a bottle of this stuff. Everyone who gets in my car comments on how lovely it smells. Also, since it has oil in it, I use it to help condition my leather seats. My husband and I both adore this stuff!</li>
    <li> In purchasing this product, I have to confess I am not new to this brand. I have been purchasing Zum products for years now, and am a firm believer in what Indigo Wild is all about. Sadly, the only reason why I have purchased this online through Amazon, is due to shipping. I live in Alaska, where shipping is not only expensive but almost non existent for certain lower 48 companies. Apparently some companies think we are a foreign country.&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to see that Zum is offered on Amazon, so I had to restock. F&amp;M (Frankincense &amp; Myrrh) spray is my favorite addiction. So here is a short list of items I use the spray on...&lt;br /&gt;Dog&lt;br /&gt;Bed&lt;br /&gt;Pillow&lt;br /&gt;Furniture&lt;br /&gt;Drapes&lt;br /&gt;Blankets/throws&lt;br /&gt;Socks&lt;br /&gt;Shoes&lt;br /&gt;Clothes&lt;br /&gt;Me (fresh from the shower)&lt;br /&gt;Purse&lt;br /&gt;Gym bags&lt;br /&gt;Car&lt;br /&gt;And the list continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is un-earthy good!  Great for men or women and tends to last for several hours without being rubbed off. One note...to get the most out of your spray you have to shake the &amp;*%$ out of it before you use. Otherwise you will not be getting the full fragrance effect.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is because I have to purchase my Zum products I like from different purveyors. What a shame. :(</li>
    <li> The scent is good. I actually use this for a light body spray since people around me have allergy&#x27;s to perfume.  So far no one has sneezed with this but people have said I smell good.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice...feels so good just spraying this in my home. It just needs a tiny little spray and the fragance is so sweet, relaxing and calming... my favorite mist. I also love their perfume and soap w/ Frankincense and Myrrh...</li>
    <li> I love this mist spray.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent but a little on the expensive side. I kept running out because i love it so much. Finally I just bought the essential oils and made my own spray!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It has a wonderful scent which has more body than something you&#x27;d describe as \\&quot;light,\\&quot; but is not heavy. I chanced on this product at the after-holiday sale in a Kroger&#x27;s near me, but I&#x27;ll be buying more of it whenever needed from Amazon. Best part? It works as a perfume spray! Spray up and walk through the fallout. You&#x27;ll smell just as good as your house!</li>
    <li> F&amp;M has a wonderful aroma but I wil only use it in the evening - it&#x27;s an exotic fragrance very sexy</li>
    <li> Will buy this again-LOVE IT! I want to try other sprays also-Thank you so much, Jennifer.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells wonderful! I will be buying more! Gotten a lot of compliments too. I may have to try some of the other Zum Mist varieties.</li>
    <li> Leaves your room, car, your body...anything smelling nice!</li>
    <li> I like what I purchased but do not like writing these stupid litte remarks. La La al lalal la la</li>
    <li> I love love this scent. I ordered several of these for Christmas for friends and family. This spray is highly concentrated and you only need one spray for a whole room- or on your body after a shower.... Everyone always asks what that wonderful scent is. I use it at home and in my car.</li>
    <li> Lovely strong scent that lasts and lasts.  One quick spray is all you need for room or body spray.  I love this!</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely lingering and brillian!  Divine is another word that comes to mind :)</li>
    <li> Excellent !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Cecil</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent of the spray even after reading tons of great reviews about it. My personal taste, that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller to get a Return Authorization, instead she responded promptly but telling me she was sorry I didn&#x27;t like the smell, as it is one of her hottest sellers and that she would be more than happy to issue me a full refund for the product, no RA or return necessary. Customer Satisfaction was her first priority, that was apparent. I would most definitely do business with this seller again. I have an infant at home so having to go through the whole rigamarole of getting the spray together and then dropping it off to be shipped would have been a major hassle. So, thank you so very much for your great service, Lilith from Quality Goods Etc.</li>
    <li> The smell is too overpowering, heavy and far from refreshing. Although the product did not meet my expectations, I was even more disappointed of the seller -- VitaCafe. They refused to consider a refund or exchange. As you will notice if you do a little research, there is no contact information listed -- phone # or email. How convenient for them -- sell you a product and end of story! Make sure to check VitaCafe&#x27;s policies before ordering from them -- you are in for a big surprise!</li>
    <li> This is long lasting scent that I use to spray my towels in the bathroom, and a little goes a long way.  Good value for the money</li>
    <li> I just bought it from Akme store here on a whim. I did test the scent as testers were available. It has such a pleasant smell that I feel calm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am into naturopathy, I do not know if Frankincense or Myrrh have any therapeutic properties like Eucalyptus does. So I am going to have to look it up. Till then I will feel good about the smell.</li>
    <li> this is a marvelous fragrance you use sparingly but especially around Christmas!  Wonderful price with quick shipping.  Terrydould</li>
    <li> not what I meant to order, need Frankincense &amp; Myrrh for Neuropathy....</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this mist- it lingers on you and is really inexpensive. It is a tad strong, but that isn&#x27;t a problem if you really love the smell!</li>
    <li> This natural blend smells very much like \\&quot;Opium\\&quot; perfume.  It is rich and warm, and not a \\&quot;light\\&quot; scent.  It lasts - and I often spray it over my bedding.  Since it is a natural blend, it needs to be shaken before using.  It is an unusual combo, not easy to find.</li>
    <li> I am am avid shopper on Amazon, however I purchased the Zum mist locally. I just want to say it did not disappoint. All the Zum products are stellar and make from good ingredients.</li>
    <li> A little TOO lemony, but I have grown to like it, nonetheless. I&#x27;ve received compliments wearing it and not when I&#x27;ve worn certain designer colognes, so that showed me that this is a quality product.</li>
</ol>
