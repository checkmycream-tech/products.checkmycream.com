<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent twice as much over the years for flat irons. I have thick, long, curly hair and this flat iron works perfect for me at a fraction of the cost.  Product arrived within days of purchase.  :)</li>
    <li> A friend of mine straightened my hair with this straightening iron and I immediately ordered one for myself! Wonderful wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I am a very low maintenance girl. Not into spending a long time getting ready, especially in the morning before work. I used to have a flat iron but I threw it away because it was so much work to accomplish anything close to desirable results. Really glad I did my research and discovered this flat iron. Who knew that it was possible to obtain (for a completely reasonable cost) a styling tool which would not have me breaking a sweat in the bathroom for an hour, but would, in fact, allow me to achieve desirable results in about ten minutes without even so much as a fatigued muscle?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is worth every penny I paid. It is sleek to look at and handle, turns on and off with an easy touch, heats up super fast, and does a bangup job in no time. Definitely life-changing.</li>
    <li> This iron is great - heats up quickly and has digital settings which makes it nice.</li>
    <li> I really liked how soft this iron made my hair. It was perfect! I used it for 2 weeks, dropped it on my carpet in the bedroom and it wouldnt turn on anymore. :( Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Only straightener I have ever found to keep my hair board straight all day and shiny as ever.</li>
    <li> this straightener is the best. i have purchased the other one with slim plates that is nano but not ionic and it did not perform as well.  I use this on all different hair types and it seals in the hair very well.  definitely works better than much more expensive brands.  all of my friends that use this have asked over and over to borrow it even though they have their own. definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> Had to return this. The plates didn&#x27;t touch at all except at the very end of the flat iron. It was clunky and awkward to hold. Not impressed with it at all.</li>
    <li> This is my second straightener by this brand and I love both of them. I had my other one for at least 5 years with no problem (including when my dog chewed through the wire and I put it back together with duct tape right after I bought it.) It started going out and not working every time, so I decided to buy this one. It shipped super quick and gets hot really quick, it works great. The only issue is the outside gets very hot. My other one got hot but this one burns to the touch. So be very careful!</li>
    <li> I have had this flat iron for 9 years and its time for a new one only because I burnt the cord. Best iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. (I have thick, relaxed/permed hair, just beyond my shoulders)</li>
    <li> The best I have ever used</li>
    <li> One of my girlfriends used to work as a stylist and quit when she moved and got married. She gave me her jilbere flat iron when she got rid of all her salon products and it is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very long thick hair that is also color treated so I try to run my flat iron through as little as possible and this does the trick. It heats up instantly but as other review said, it can get very hot even on the exterior. Mine had the same issue after about 4 years that it started to only get hot every few times I used it, but I&#x27;m replacing it with an identical model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only recently received the iron but so far so good! If anything changes I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> Amazing results! This is the only brand ive ever used for straighteners but none have ever compares to thia one</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how quickly it is hot and ready to use.  Gently on my hair.  Love the temperature adjustments.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a straightener that makes my hair silky smooth while also gripping well and straightening larger sections as I have long, super thick hair.  This one does both SO well.  It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair either and feels so much more durable than the popular thin, rounded edge straighteners out these days.  I have yet to NOT love a jilbere product!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Sally&#x27;s for $75 and have had it for 5 years now! I will never purchase anything different. The other flat irons I&#x27;ve tried prior to this one would last a year at max. The plates have never chipped, came apart, nothing.</li>
    <li> The most amazing straightener ever, it was too heavy for my moms friend so she gave it to me. It works so fast and so well, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything else, this is the best! It was a bit old and the out let piece broke off in the outlet so I will be purchasing another one</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron from sallys about 7 plus years ago and it still works great. This far in my only complaint is that the handle seems to gather build up but is easily cleaned with a little baking soda and water. Through the years my hair has seen some rough days by over-processing or frequent color changes and because this iron has several heat settings to choose from I can judge the actual heat needed. Love love this product. Would absolutely purchase again if I ever need to.. this brand was recommended to me by a spa owner who would put it above every high flatner shes ever used. Even with commercial use hers at the time was 3 yrs in and had already exceeded Chi brands by 2 yrs. U gotta try it!!!</li>
    <li> I have have my Jilbere flat iron for at least 6 years! I love it. It is used 4-5 days a week every week and still does wonderful. My hair is thick, wavy, fluffy, and frizzy; this flat iron is def worth it. I think I paid about $120 when I first purchased it.</li>
    <li> Good product...heats up fast...operates easily</li>
    <li> Okay so not sure where to begin but:&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING HAIR STRAIGHTENER!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of girl with \\&quot;long...dry... Kinda coarse...\\&quot; Hair. I used hair straighteners from the stands at the mall to the Nume hair straightener which claimed to be \\&quot;so amazing\\&quot; (still good for curling though) but I would STILL have to wash my hair in order to make it look healthy and shiny. But with this straightener, perfect plate thickness to do a large section, even without my hair washed in 3-4 days, it added shiny (not crazy shine) and softtttttness!!! That \\&quot;look\\&quot; when u just come from the hair salon?? THAT PRETTY!!! I couldnt wait to write a review because I know many girls out there have the same issue with their hair and finding a good straightener. My bangs get kinda curly after</li>
    <li> This is my third straightener.  The first two broke because of travels to Europe, but this is a product that works better than any other straightener I&#x27;ve used. Very pleased once again by the quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned many hair straighteners and Jilbere&#x27;s is the best. It does get very hot and I recommend setting it on a towel so it doesn&#x27;t discolor your countertops. I also recommend using a heat protectant. My go-to is the Hot Spray by Kenra. The combination is so stellar...your hair will be amazing! My frizzy mess always looks beautiful after. Ugh...love this. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
    <li> I had the Jibere Nano Flat Iron for 9 years. Love, love, loved it.  Today, sadly, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I didn&#x27;t bother even looking at any other irons - I just ordered a new one.  I hope the new one is as amazing and long-lasting as the prior model!</li>
    <li> As of recently I was in desperate need of a new flat iron.  Although this particular flat iron would not have been my first choice to purchase (mainly because I didn&#x27;t know about it) but when my anniversary rolled around my husband did some shopping and was told this was a very good choice and thoughtfully bought me one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in, tried it, and fell in love with the Jilbere De Paris Nano Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron!  It worked wonderfully even on my dry, frizz prone, naturally wavy-curly hair.  It straightens in one stroke so I don&#x27;t have go over and over the same piece of hair like with my old flat iron which causes damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jilbere Nano Ceramic has nice slick 1.25&amp;#34; ceramic plates that are silver in color and slide effortlessly through the hair.  It has a very ample 108&amp;#34; (9&#x27;) swivel cord and 5 heat settings: 300, 340, 375, 410, and 450 degrees with an on and off switch and digital read out screen.  The instructions it comes with tell you exactly what heat setting to use for your own hair type taking the guess work out of it! I can&#x27;t forget to mention how pretty it is too with it&#x27;s white pearl type outer surface which also wipes down easily.  It weighs 12.6 oz and is 10&amp;#34; in total length. This flat iron will cost you between $65-$75 making it a really good deal for the salon quality performance it offers you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that the website says it has natural antibacterial properties helping to keep a healthy scalp as well as hair!  The Jilbere De Paris Nano Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron has made straightening my hair a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different flat irons and nano is the best and this particular one its awesome. Straightenes my hair so quickly. And with long thick hair you need an iron like this:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Nano!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flat iron of all times! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and I work with this tool everyday I also drop it almost everyday because I am clumsy! This is my second one of these the first one I had for 9 years which really says a lot for the amount of use and abuse it went through! Would HIGHLY recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> These are some amazing flatirons. I used to use my friends and they worked so good, had to buy my own. Good buy, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Works just as good as a $150-$200 straightener.  It doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and the 1 1/4&amp;#34; allows you to straighten more hair at once.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this flat iron. It is all metal and not the cheap plastic like other flat irons. The first time that you go down the hair it is straight. It work great on all hair types. I like the dynamics of it. It is a little heavier at the plates, not only does it get hot, but the extra weight also presses well. Lighted temperature control, solid ceramic plates, and swivel cord that moves with you and doesn&#x27;t tangle up. I sell many of these at a beauty supply store that I work at. They never get returned. It is that great of an iron.I Would recommend it for everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so in love with it. I purchased mine from Sally&#x27;s beauty for 75 nd was a bit iffy about my purchase on the way home. I have very thick nd curly natural hair that hadn&#x27;t been flat ironed in over 6 mnths. Well anywho I heated this baby up at 450 and put it to wrk,  fell in love with it nd now Im looking like a million bucks...magic!  I recommend this product nd back it 100%.</li>
    <li> Gets real hot and does a good job of straightening hair. My daughter likes it and it is fairly priced</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this and it is a great flat iron.  It has adjustable temperatures, heats up quickly, cools down quickly and does the job perfectly!  A great product.</li>
    <li> I will never ever buy any other flat iron BESIDES THIS ONE. It does an absolute excellent job at straightening my hair. Love love love it. You can also curl or bump your ends because it has curved edges. This is well worth the money. I bought the ion flat iron with argan oil steam plates and don&#x27;t even use it because I don&#x27;t get the same results as this jibere gives me and the ion cost more lol....love this jilbere. The plates do get hot but that is no issue for me. You will love it too.</li>
    <li> exactly as i planed, perfect delivery and perfect conditions, works out great. best iron i have ever used, my friend has had it for more than 3 years and still works like the 1st day.!:D</li>
    <li> Love Jilbere products and this flat iron is the perfect size for medium thickness hair. Heats up quickly and isn&#x27;t too bulky or heavy. Replaced my previous Jilbere Nano after several years of using it. Hoping this one lasts just as long.</li>
    <li> I recently bought mine in Sally for 65... Best choice I ever made in my life .. I used to have the royals hair straightener (the one they sell at the mall) but the nano is by far the best ever !!! My hair is frizzy free</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago at sally, at the time I was pleased but I noticed it was damaging my hair. I cost me around $70. The results were not the best. I&#x27;m a latina with curly kinda coarse hair but very manageable. I used it and the hair was straight but not shiny or &#x27;salon result&#x27;. After using it I noticed that my hair would break and saw my hair on my vanity :( and each time I would brush my hair it would break. I don&#x27;t use it often because of this. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair and have always used a flatiron. This is the best flatiron ever. I usually use a chi and go over my hair twice. This one makes my hair smooth and soft the first time.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I have no complaints. I love the digital settings, the length of the cord, and the color. The heat temps work well for all types of hair.</li>
    <li> my favorite straightener. Heats up so quickly and doesnt fry your hair like other straighteners. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> This iron gets very hot and does a great job. You don&#x27;t have to worry about getting lots of dents if you hold it in place for too long. I think I should have gotten the bigger one but this one is good.</li>
    <li> 5 years of daily use and it finally died!  I consider that an incredible purchase!  I have very thick, curly hair and this flat iron did an amazing job of straightening my unruly mess.  I did my research and it led me right back to purchasing another Jilbere Nano Ceramic.  Forget the others, this is a great quality purchase.</li>
    <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair and have gone through so many straighteners. My college roommate had this one and after using it one time, I went out and bought my own. Once my best friend tried mine, SHE went and bought her own. Once her mother tried hers, she also went and bought one, etc. etc. Literally anyone who I&#x27;ve let use this straightener heads right out and buys it. I had an Ultra Chi that lasted half as long and worked half as well. I&#x27;ve had my current Jilbere Nano for 5 years and it still works great!</li>
    <li> Just excellent, great gift and great women&#x27;s accessory. My hair looks great every time I use it and the effect last long time!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron nine years ago... yes, NINE! They were blue back then but the design is exactly the same otherwise. I&#x27;ve used it almost daily for years, through all my different hairstyles from short, choppy bobs to long, wavy hair. I can get my very curly hair pin straight but I can also roll the flat iron as I go and it creates beautiful waves, both in about 5 minutes total. After all these years, it still heats evenly which is amazing and it&#x27;s in great shape. Best styling tool I have ever bought! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after my first one broke.  It lasted several years (while I cannot recall the exact #, I want to say somewhere around 4-5 years at least).  The size is perfect and I have lots of thick, coarse hair!  The temperature, etc. also is plenty to handle my hair.  The price is a little high when compared to cheap makes, but when you think about how long it lasts, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  Love the white color as well.  No complaints!  Will definitely keep buying Jilbere products (I have a curling iron from Jilbere that I love as well!)</li>
    <li> I am the wife of the guy in Northern Mi.  I have baby fine hair that has thinned through the years.  I bought mine at a rummage sale for $2.00 and thought what the heck.  This tool is supreme compared to other flat irons.  I set mine on number 25, (range is 1-50) and use Redken Hot Sets.  I get big beautiful poof and waves when I go straight up and arch the tool.  I then comb with a wide tooth comb and use aerosol hair spray.  I look great and no one would know how thin my hair is.  I get lots of compliments too.  I will gladly rebuy this at full price when it stops working.</li>
    <li> I got my straitner in a set (straitner, barrel curling iron, and blow drier) and i am sill to this day using them all! it has been the best flat iron, and in my opinion it beats the chi, it heats up super fast can adjust the temp easy and its over all last a longgg time!!! im looking to get on for my sister because i kept the one we were sharing when she went to collage. Over all best flat iron out there!!(:</li>
    <li> It was a gift at Christmas and she loves it, &#x27;nuf said, right?</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron at Sally Beauty Supply, almost a month ago to substitute a \\&quot;Sedu\\&quot; that I had for about 4 years. I was not sure that it was going to do the job, because of the price. It was really cheap compared to the one I got before. While I got my Sedu for over a $100.00, this flat Iron and the Jilbere Nano Silver Curling Iron were on sale for only $75.00. The only reason why I got it was because my sister said she got one, and it was really good(my sister has long thick hair/and a lot of it), so I thought I could at least try it. The flat iron and the curling iron are just great. They do the job in less time and the results are as good as the results I got with my Sedu. I also bought Blow Dry Addict, and flat Iron Addict(also on sale)and to finish my job I put a little bit of Macadamia Oil Hair Serum. My hair is naturally curly, long , colored and very thin. Try it, you will love it.</li>
    <li> So far this is a great flat iron- I was able to achieve a professional look in less than 30 minutes!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has the same straightener and I bought it because I loved hers. It left my hair straight and shiny; however, the one I purchased didn&#x27;t give me the same result. I&#x27;m disappointed. It&#x27;s good, but not reaching my expectations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble getting my frizzy hair as straight and thin as I want it. I bought this flat iron after getting tired of the cheaper ones that don&#x27;t get as hot or work as well. This one is amazing. It does the job very well and my hair has never looked this straight. It also takes a lot less time to straighten my hair than it used to. I&#x27;ve had it since about November and it still works great.</li>
    <li> I bought a Jilbere Nano back in 2004. It&#x27;s white just like this one... I&#x27;m sure this is an upgraded look to the one I bought, but I LOVE it. Again, I bought it in 2004... that&#x27;s 11 years ago... and I&#x27;m just now going to replace it with this one AGAIN! I love it that much. The price is right compared to all the other ones on the market. 11 years... that is 11 years of DAILY use... and I&#x27;ve taken it with me on trips, thrown in my bag, etc. Now, I&#x27;m replacing my flat iron... not because it has completely quit working. I&#x27;m replacing it because I have extra money and I&#x27;d rather buy one now while it&#x27;s on sale at Sally&#x27;s. After 11 years when I plug it in, it still heats.. I sometimes have to turn the heat down and then back up to get it to raise to higher temps, but that&#x27;s it... and that just started happening.  If you are on the fence with flat irons... let me tell you... this one will NOT disappoint. I used it with hair down to the middle of my back, I&#x27;ve used it with medium length hair, and now I have short crop style. It works... I have really think wirey hair... no problems.</li>
    <li> LOVE this straightener! I would recommend this product to anyone. I bought this straightener in 2009 and it has been kicking until today. Six years and I will be buying the exact one today. It gets very hot and you do not have to go over the same piece a few times. It keeps the hair smooth and shiny. My hair is very thick and long and it does great!</li>
    <li> I bought mine at Sally&#x27;s House of Beauty two weeks ago as of today (2/27) and I would say this hair iron is a keeper. I didnt know what brand to get but the sales lady recommended Jilbere Nano Ceramic Ionic Flat Iron for one reason - she has been using hers for almost 6 years and still it does a fabulous job.&lt;br /&gt;I think I got a perfect Iron for my thick hair (not so) straight hair. I highly recommend this product for whatever type of hair you have.</li>
