      <li>But I didnt buy it to mix it with something else to be effective.  </li>
      <li>the smell is not to pleasant at all, as far as the lotion it was very good.</li>
      <li>it lotion goes on smooth and has a great fragrance love love love EOS and all their products</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great help in keeping my legs happy when shaving daily during the summer, and the scent is summery too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; smells very refreshing...</li>
      <li>Its very light.</li>
      <li>VERY LIGHT.</li>
      <li>I have used EOS Body Lotion before and love it.</li>
      <li>I love lotions, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
      <li>My daughter in law went nuts over the lovely fragrance of this one</li>
      <li>I love the eos lip balm and shave cream and was looking forward to using the body lotion, too.</li>
      <li>A lot better than just the trial sizes.</li>
      <li>deserve price, lovely smell and color.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this lotion, but when I ordered this two pack, one smelled wonderful, and the other one smelled like someone switched out the lotion for a &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34; smelling one.</li>
      <li>Now I have 2 full bottles sitting in my bathroom and have no idea what to do with them!</li>
      <li>strongly recommendation to friends and families.&lt;br /&gt;can be as a gift.</li>
      <li>And its probably not a bad thing for most people.  </li>
      <li>It smells like a honeydew melon which would have been fine if it was noted on the product&#x27;s description, but it isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>A nice light lotion for the summer time but certainly will keep your skin moisturized during the cooler months.</li>
      <li>lotion goes on smooth, and it&#x27;s not sticky or clumpy at all.  </li>
      <li>When I first got this, I was so excited because I love EOS lip balms.</li>
      <li>EOS is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>For the price, it&#x27;s not bad considering you receive two bottles.</li>
      <li>Nice big size.</li>
      <li>I was also surprised that it was 2 bottles :).</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t as big as I would have liked, but I am still finishing off the first bottle</li>
      <li>I have experienced many other body lotions throughout my life and this one has a long lasting effect of silky smooth skin without any sticky feeling after, it also goes on easily</li>
      <li>of the most pleasant things about this lotion is its fresh cucumber scent; I&#x27;m not sure why this isn&#x27;t clearly indicated on the package, but it&#x27;s delightful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light and soft and not greasy.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a paraben-free lotion, I highly recommend the St. Ives brand.</li>
      <li>Now I absolutely love it and use it everyday!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a skin product that doesn&#x27;t irritate me one way or another, which often leads to me having dry skin because of my reluctance to use lotion, but this product has changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was searching for a somewhat natural lotion (no mineral oil, parabens, etc.) and came across this.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and not strong.  </li>
      <li>Raw Shea butter has a distinct smell.  </li>

    <li> I have used EOS Body Lotion before and love it. Found it surprisingly at Wal-Mart. But, not anymore. I was so happy to find it on-line. Glad I got the 2 pack!</li>
    <li> I was purchasing this product in local stores, but it seemed to disappear from the shelf.  I was so happy to find it here, on Amazon.  It is light and soft and not greasy.  I love lotions, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I have been using EOS for over two years and I am not changing my body lotion anytime soon. I have experienced many other body lotions throughout my life and this one has a long lasting effect of silky smooth skin without any sticky feeling after, it also goes on easily and it also smells good!</li>
    <li> i have buying this for awhile now. Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and lotion is the best. Will buy again and again</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this product in the stores.  Amazon rocks!  A lot better than just the trial sizes.</li>
    <li> the smell is not to pleasant at all, as far as the lotion it was very good. si if smell is not important to you you should consider this product</li>
    <li> I ordered this lotion along with the one which says &amp;#34;Nourish&amp;#34; on the bottle.  My daughter in law went nuts over the lovely fragrance of this one so I ordered her one!  Makes you smell sooo good all over!!</li>

I love it!</li>

    <li> I use this lotion constantly. The smell is wonderful without being overpowering.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily and is great on the hands and nails.  I was also surprised that it was 2 bottles :). I will use this lotion only for now on. I recommend it to everyone.</li>

Great smell and consistency.</li>

It smells like cucumbers, but it also smells like raw something.  I think it may be the shea butter. Raw Shea butter has a distinct smell.  Anyway, the lotion is great if I mix it with Sunflower oil. But I didnt buy it to mix it with something else to be effective.  But otherwise, I wouldnt buy this again.</li>
