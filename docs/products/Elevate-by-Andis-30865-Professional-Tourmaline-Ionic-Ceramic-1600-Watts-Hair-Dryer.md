      <li>/&gt;Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good buy in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Not a miracle worker, but reliability is sometimes more important than miracles :)</li>
      <li>So, if it&#x27;s ok with her, it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
      <li>I have had this for more than a few months now, and can say it works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  </li>
      <li>The dryer worked fine</li>
      <li>My hair is medium length and fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quiet and has great power.</li>
      <li>And it has a more reasonable airflow than most of the dryers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, has the right temps and air volumes and most of.....</li>
      <li>Bulky, and no cold shot!</li>
      <li>Features a low/high speed cool setting which is slightly warm, and a low/high speed high heat setting - which I have rarely used -</li>
      <li>I like this dryer because of the cool air button.  </li>
      <li>Bought it as a replacement to a similar earlier Andis model ... perfect!</li>
      <li>Quickly dries hair giving it body and volume.</li>
      <li>and it was a super hairdryer.</li>
      <li>Dries my medium-length hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
      <li>My hair is long and fine and breaks easily is the reason I got it since ionic lower wattage dryers are suppose to be better for my hair type.</li>
      <li>Much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers.</li>
      <li>I love the look of this dryer; the red is so cool!  </li>
      <li>The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great.</li>
      <li>This dryer is attractive, appears well-made, and is fairly small; it would be a good dryer for those limited in space and for travel.  </li>
      <li>But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  </li>
      <li>It did make an airplane trip right before this happened, so it could have been bumped around a bit.  </li>
      <li>so I ended up getting this one since the price was right.</li>
      <li>Nice long cord.</li>
      <li>Item came when expected, love how it handles!</li>
      <li>Lightweight and works fine so far.  </li>
      <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I&#x27;m sure they would function well if you need them.</li>
      <li>My hair dries pretty fast with it.  </li>
      <li>Heats up really fast &amp; on high is probably too hot for some.</li>
      <li>I have not noticed, personally, and huge difference because of the tourmaline ions, but that isn&#x27;t to say that there isn&#x27;t any.  </li>
      <li>I have pretty normal hair, and it has stayed pretty normal.  </li>
      <li>We purchased this sporty, red model - and, so far, have been pleased with its performance.  </li>
      <li>I have fragile curly hair that breaks easily with high heat.  </li>
      <li>the cool setting is enough for us.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a dryer that would blow constant cool air and</li>
      <li>I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok.  </li>
      <li>It still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one.</li>
      <li>It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don&#x27;t complain about that).</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
      <li>heats up quickly and dried my hair really fast</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say that the ionic action it&#x27;s supposed to do does much for my hair, since I usually use both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  </li>
      <li>We try not to use the high heat in general.</li>
      <li>My wife loves it, much easier to handle than her old 1850 Watt hair dryer, and doesn&#x27;t pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 20 years.</li>
      <li>I like this dryer lightweight and not as loud as my old dryer.</li>
      <li>Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I like that there are different controls for heat &amp; fan speed but on high heat</li>
      <li>And the hot setting is not very hot.</li>
      <li>The only con is that it weighs more than my previous dryer... but not enough to make me send it back.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need that much force, just enough to get my hair dry.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as I also groom for a few other owners.</li>
<li> The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.&lt;br</li>
<li> But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. My wife loves it. It&#x27;s quiet and has great power. We like the paint job too.</li>
    <li> I was iffy after I ordered this product with all the horrible things that were said about it, but I really like this hair dryer.  I only use the cold settings to dry my hair in general.  I am already using it for a few months and I love it.  Don&#x27;t depend on what people have to say unless you try it.  Unless of course it is all bad.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast &amp; on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I&#x27;m sure they would function well if you need them. Can&#x27;t say enough about the color lol!</li>
    <li> heats up quickly and dried my hair really fast</li>
    <li> Bought it as a replacement to a similar earlier Andis model ... perfect!</li>
    <li> We had been using a Windmere hair dryer, which my husband owned prior to our marriage twelve years ago, that finally bit the dust.  My husband was looking for a hair dryer with side vents vs the rear vent.  We purchased this sporty, red model - and, so far, have been pleased with its performance.  Features a low/high speed cool setting which is slightly warm, and a low/high speed high heat setting - which I have rarely used - the cool setting is enough for us.  The only improvement we would suggest is in the way the switches are set up. Dries my medium-length hair quickly.  I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I love the look of this dryer; the red is so cool!  And it has a more reasonable airflow than most of the dryers I&#x27;ve tried.  I don&#x27;t need that much force, just enough to get my hair dry.  It also lets you pick from several different combos of heat/air flow force.  The only con is that it weighs more than my previous dryer... but not enough to make me send it back.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I looked at all the reviews to find the perfect hair dryer but nothing looked like a sure win so I ended up getting this one since the price was right. I like that there are different controls for heat &amp; fan speed but on high heat, I can smell something burning... not sure if it&#x27;s because this is new or what...    ***update*** After consistently using this every day for a month, the weird burning smell is ALMOST gone. We try not to use the high heat in general.</li>
    <li> This dryer is attractive, appears well-made, and is fairly small; it would be a good dryer for those limited in space and for travel.  Pros: heat and speed options, moderately quiet motor.  Con: no cool shot button.  If you like this style of dryer, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Bulky, and no cold shot!</li>
    <li> I liked the hair dryer it. It is like the ones at the hair salon.</li>
    <li> My old 1500 watt dryer gave up after 10 years of extreme use; I was working at that time so it got daily use and it was a super hairdryer. I looked for another one just like it but to no avail.  I found this 1600 watt one and since the low wattage in this style with the long barrel are difficult to find, I purchased 2. I no longer work outside the home and only use this every 2 days, (and my hair is shorter) SO I expected it to last longer than 9 months. Today when I turned on the unit and dried my hair all was okay but when I went to turn off the unit, the on/off switch locked up and then smoke came billowing out of that area. I quickly unplugged it and tossed it out the door should flames start coming out of the unit. Now I am apprehensive on using the second one I purchased. For 25.00 each, I would have expected it to last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for drying my hair, it was a good hair dryer.</li>
    <li> After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don&#x27;t complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.</li>
    <li> I have used this, along with another dryer a few times, and it seems ok.  I really can&#x27;t say that the ionic action it&#x27;s supposed to do does much for my hair, since I usually use both together--I got two different shapes so they can both fit in my hand, together.  My dog wasn&#x27;t terrified by it when I used it to help dry her.  So, if it&#x27;s ok with her, it&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
    <li> Hairdryer itself does it&#x27;s job but the two pieces that attach to it the straightening comb and the concentrator both keep flying off of the hairdryer and hitting me in the head or falling on the floor.  Very disappointed with this since the main thing I use is the straightening comb.  Wish I would have just stuck with getting another Conair Blackbird never had any of these issues with that one.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it, much easier to handle than her old 1850 Watt hair dryer, and doesn&#x27;t pop our circuit breaker as it draws only 15 amps.</li>
    <li> The dryer worked fine and I loved it for the first 10 months.  Then it sparked, burned up and died.  It did make an airplane trip right before this happened, so it could have been bumped around a bit.  I usually don&#x27;t travel with this blow dryer, but didn&#x27;t swap it out with my old dryer for this trip.</li>
    <li> I bought this for drying my Miniature Schnauzer furnishings at home and at shows. I picked this one because it has air coming in from both sides for maximum air flow. It works great. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 2 years and use it often as I also groom for a few other owners. It still looks like new and all the switches work just like day one. I will buy again if this one ever goes out. I will also buy another one if my personal hair dryer (different brand) ever goes out. I&#x27;ve had it for nearly 20 years. LOL</li>
    <li> Just got it, used on clients for one day. Now let&#x27;s see how long the motor holds out. Nice long cord.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because of the cool air button.  I have fragile curly hair that breaks easily with high heat.  I was looking for a dryer that would blow constant cool air and this dryer does that.  This dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle and pik attachment which I like.  I like this blow dryer better than my Conair Styler with comb attachments.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 3 months.</li>
    <li> I have had this for more than a few months now, and can say it works wonderfully.  I have not noticed, personally, and huge difference because of the tourmaline ions, but that isn&#x27;t to say that there isn&#x27;t any.  I have pretty normal hair, and it has stayed pretty normal.  I will say that this system seems to dry my hair a bit faster and it does not get that brittle feel to it when I actually use it to \\&quot;style\\&quot; my hair as well.  Good product, good price.  Not a miracle worker, but reliability is sometimes more important than miracles :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I needed the come that it came with but as it turns out this blow dryer has blown my mind. It&#x27;s fantastic! !</li>
    <li> Bought thid for my girlfriend... she liked it</li>
    <li> Love this dryer.  I have been looking for this old-style dryer like my aunt used when she was a stylist.  Always loved it great to find one works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, not heavy and dries the hair quick.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed that I can&#x27;t return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Almost perfect. It&#x27;s light, has the right temps and air volumes and most of.....it&#x27;s QUIET. Compared to the inline fan hair dryers that the wife uses, this thing is at least half as loud. Save your ears and get one.</li>
    <li> Item came when expected, love how it handles!</li>
    <li> Christmas present. Wife is pleased. What more can I say? It seems like a well made quality item. Nuff&#x27; said.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer lightweight and not as loud as my old dryer. I like that is has the diiferent heat settings. Quickly dries hair giving it body and volume. I will reccommend this dryer.</li>
    <li> Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  The color is a plus.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer.  Much easier on my hair and much better than higher heat dryers.</li>
    <li> Got this hairdryer a few days ago. I had to go with a lower watt dryer otherwise I&#x27;d be flipping breakers every 5 minutes. It&#x27;s very pretty. I dig the red.  It took a couple days to get used to holding it as it&#x27;s a bit bulky. But to be fair my other one had a shorter nozzel and was lighter.  The placement of the setting switches is not optimal. I can&#x27;t easily switch from low to high and back to low without looking at what I&#x27;m doing.  And the hot setting is not very hot. Which, I guess, my hair is thankful for.  But boy does she have great blowing power! It&#x27;s like being in a wind tunnel. My hair dries in half the time now which is great!  I have used both attachments that came along with it too. I was afraid due to the force of the blowing it would blow those little gadgets right off and smack me upside the head but they stayed put.  The blow dryer is a little louder than I am used to but not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with the product. I can overcome the negatives. Hope it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW EDITED SEPT 2013 &#x3D;  And there she blows...out!  The heating element died already. I am very disappointed this hairdryer did not last as long as I expected it to. I understand....you get what you pay for....but it should have been longer than this. And I do not have long thick hair to where I am using and abusing the hairdryer. My hair is medium length and fine. It didn&#x27;t have to work that hard!  I&#x27;m disappointed today and back on Amazon to shop for yet another hairdryer.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer I ever used!</li>
    <li> It appears to still be working after 3 months. I have not heard any complaints from my wife...that must be a good product.</li>
    <li> i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.</li>
    <li> Wonderful dryer and your service was so great.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and works fine so far.  I&#x27;ve had it about a week now.  Longer barrel than the one I had before it.  No cool shot button, only high heat and low heat, which is a little cooler but not much than the high heat.  My hair dries pretty fast with it.  It&#x27;s a pretty good buy in my opinion.  My hair is long and fine and breaks easily is the reason I got it since ionic lower wattage dryers are suppose to be better for my hair type.</li>
</ol>
