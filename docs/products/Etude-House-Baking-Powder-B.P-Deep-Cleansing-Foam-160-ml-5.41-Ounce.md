      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and she was so happy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product for a good price.</li>
      <li>Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
      <li>Very good, leaves face clean.</li>
      <li>Smooth on skin, makes it feel great.</li>
      <li>and it smells nice a lot like oranges.</li>
      <li>but it does have a very light orange/citrus smell to it which I LOVE!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s mild and leaves your face feels great.</li>
      <li>: this is the most effective make-up removal product I have ever used.</li>
      <li>Mildly abrasive (baking powder) which makes it a good exfoliating wash.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Refreshing after-feeling.</li>
      <li>(I bought both :-) )</li>
      <li>happy to have found this here in Amazon, and so reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Gosh, I love this face wash.</li>
      <li>so pleased.</li>
      <li>Nice, clean smell.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t not expect this face wash to be any good much less great</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and it works well for me, though I don&#x27;t believe this would be very good for those with dry skin.</li>
      <li>and I suggest googling it to precisely how pH plays a role when it comes to skin.</li>
      <li>It does leave your face squeaky-clean without drying it unecessarily, smells delicious, and the tub lasts around 5-6 months (with everyday use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>pH is extremely important when finding a cleanser</li>
      <li>It really clean your face.</li>
      <li>Leave my face squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>squeaky clean</li>
      <li>smell is still sweet and like lemon and the makeup and oil just melts off my face.</li>
      <li>Amongst other items, I brought this cleansing foam back, and it was surely - surely - one of my best</li>
      <li>Mildly exfoliating and non drying with a mild citrus smell.</li>
      <li>It mildly exfoliates, keep blemishes at bay and evens your complexion.</li>
      <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t strip my skin so I don&#x27;t wind up with retaliation in the form of super oily face.</li>
      <li>This face wash is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Permanent part of my beauty routine, helps keep everything in line without over drying and the exfoliation is just the right amount.</li>
      <li>After just the first wash, I could feel my skin get flushed out</li>
      <li>i really like how foamy it is!</li>
      <li>so I recommend not suing anything higher.</li>
      <li>The packaging is really pretty too.</li>
      <li>I love Korean skin care products, which I discovered in a recent trip to Seul.</li>
      <li>My face feels super clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Very simular to the Etude House Baking Powder Pore Cleansing Foam</li>
      <li>A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great value because a little more than a pea size amount will do your whole face and part of your neck too if you so choose to use it there.</li>
      <li>Not harsh on skin, very soothing.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this as my normal face wash</li>
      <li>You only need less than a dime size to get that rich foam + beads for the enjoyable latter on your face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon while searching for something to tame my oily spots without drying my face.</li>
      <li>I was using the normal Baking Power Etude House wash before, and the only difference I can tell between that one and this one made for B.B deep cleansing is that this one is more coarse for exfoliation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have baking soda beads, so if you have sensitive skin, I would be cautious of using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Most facial cleansers are harsh and strip the oil off my skin which makes my skin retaliate by making extra sebum and my skin is already oily to begin with.</li>
      <li>I needed a cleanser that really cleaned my dry face.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE (5/31/16): To clarify, high pH cleansers are extremely damaging to your skin&#x27;s moisture barrier.</li>

    <li> Mildly abrasive (baking powder) which makes it a good exfoliating wash. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn like some facial cleansers. A little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s a great value because a little more than a pea size amount will do your whole face and part of your neck too if you so choose to use it there. Most facial cleansers are harsh and strip the oil off my skin which makes my skin retaliate by making extra sebum and my skin is already oily to begin with. This stuff doesn&#x27;t strip my skin so I don&#x27;t wind up with retaliation in the form of super oily face. It&#x27;s great. This one is a keeper. I would definitely buy again. But a word or warning...don&#x27;t get it in your eye or you&#x27;ll be sorry X_x</li>
    <li> i really like how foamy it is! it says non scented but it does have a very light orange/citrus smell to it which I LOVE!</li>
    <li> Smooth on skin, makes it feel great. Not harsh on skin, very soothing. Refreshing after-feeling. Nice, clean smell. Faster shipping than expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my face from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t not expect this face wash to be any good much less great but it is just that this is a wonderful product. Its so foamy all you need is a little bit lather it up on your hands and wash it gets your face squeaky clean literally you can hear It squeak it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin tho and it smells nice a lot like oranges. my face has cleared up and it has a bit of a glow this is the only face I will buy from now on oh its a lot like estee lauders foam wash but cost much less. Im so pleased.</li>
    <li> Very good, leaves face clean.</li>
    <li> When they say deep cleaning, they mean deep cleaning! After just the first wash, I could feel my skin get flushed out and it felt awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It does have baking soda beads, so if you have sensitive skin, I would be cautious of using it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Mildly exfoliating and non drying with a mild citrus smell. It&#x27;s a great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I like it, I use it with a scrubber in the mornings. Leave my face squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve never had anything like this before. I needed a cleanser that really cleaned my dry face. You only need less than a dime size to get that rich foam + beads for the enjoyable latter on your face. It smells lemony! The packaging is really pretty too. I&#x27;m sick of spending so much for makeup removal towels and brand-named face washes. This face wash is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Permanent part of my beauty routine, helps keep everything in line without over drying and the exfoliation is just the right amount.</li>

I&#x27;ve become faithful to this product.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this as my normal face wash and well, it&#x27;s great- leaves me skin feeling great and refreshed!</li>
    <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! Just discovered that the pH of this cleanser is 8. You want to use a cleanser than has a pH of 5.5!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (5/31/16): To clarify, high pH cleansers are extremely damaging to your skin&#x27;s moisture barrier. Your skin&#x27;s pH is around 5.5 so I recommend not suing anything higher. pH is extremely important when finding a cleanser and I suggest googling it to precisely how pH plays a role when it comes to skin. Not only is it a high pH cleanser, it also uses baking soda which is also a terrible ingredient for your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this to get rid of the BB Cream makeup I have. It&#x27;s the only face wash that makes me feel like the BB Cream is fully removed.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It really clean your face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just truly incredible! It&#x27;s mild and leaves your face feels great. It mildly exfoliates, keep blemishes at bay and evens your complexion. I&#x27;m glad I stumbled upon while searching for something to tame my oily spots without drying my face. It&#x27;s now my only go to!!</li>
    <li> Very simular to the Etude House Baking Powder Pore Cleansing Foam (I bought both :-) ) Works great. My face feels super clean but not dry.</li>
    <li> Gosh, I love this face wash.
