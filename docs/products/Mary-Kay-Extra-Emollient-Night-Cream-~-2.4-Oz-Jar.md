    <li> I was so happy to be able to get the product I love without having to wait for a consultant to accumulate enough orders to fill my request.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several jars of this and at 57 years I have no fine lines.  Recently, I moved to Arizona and it still does the job in this dry climate.  It has never blocked pores or caused any breakouts.</li>

    <li> Perfect product! I have very dry skin and this helps me perfectly!  Love it.  Came very quickly as well.</li>
    <li> I use to have dry skin &amp; bad hangnails but then I started using this every day in the morning &amp; before bed.  With continual use especially in the winter time my hands are moisturised and hangnail free.  I will definitely order more from Oranges to Dollars when this jar gets low since they have the best price and the delivery was pretty quick too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night cream since it came out. Me and my friends used to call it Mary Kay&#x27;s &amp;#34;pink vasoline&amp;#34;. I use it on my eyes, it&#x27;s great for chapped lips. Of course, it&#x27;s great for the night cream its designed for, if you put it on and apply a hot moist wash rag to your face, so it absorbs into your skin. If you &amp;#34;steam&amp;#34; into your skin, like they used to tell you to, it keep your skin from feeling oily and it&#x27;s supposed to keep wrinkles away forever.  So far its doing a pretty good job.  This stuff is really hard to find because I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore and I don&#x27;t know why because I believe it was the part of the &amp;#34;core&amp;#34; of their line.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but I know I paid to much for it, when I added in shipping and everything. Will get from my local mary kay consultant.</li>
    <li> The product came in very short time and was just as advertised. A great price. For years I&#x27;ve been looking for the product in the jar rather than a tube. I was well pleased with this product and vendor.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past for very dry skin.  Am very pleased with the results of the product.  Would recommend for anyone who experiences very dry skin.  I really do love this product.</li>
