<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these, they are small enough to fit between my teeth and they get a lot of stuff that the toothbrush and floss miss</li>
    <li> Works  as advertised . No complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect for making sure to get to all the between the teeth tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I originally purchased a larger size, but they did not fit between my teeth.  These &amp;#34;ULTRA TIGHT&amp;#34; size ones fit between and clean even the tightest gaps (even gaps that I cannot get floss into).</li>
    <li> Good item and I will recommond it to other</li>
    <li> Very good product. Cleans between gaps in conjunction with daily flossing.</li>
    <li> This really clean out those hard to floss places</li>
    <li> Just what the doctor gave me at office. Same handle &amp; flex tip, works Great for those tight spaces. I also have the wide for the back. Even AFTER rinsing then flossing these get out what the floss doesn&#x27;t. I was shocked!  Keeps your gums clear of tartar and bacteria. A Definite Keeper in my house from now on! I use these twice a day and the disposable Soft-picks from GUM after lunch. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have written this review.</li>
    <li> I WANT THE LARGER BRUSH I GET FROM MY DENTIST. I THINK THEY ARE NAMED THE &amp;#34;TRAVEL PRO.&amp;#34; THAT HAVE A BLUE COVER&lt;br /&gt;AND I HAVE ONLY ONE LEFT FROM MY DENTIST.  THE ONES YOU SENT ARE VERY SMALL BRUSHES, OK? IF YOU COULD SEND&lt;br /&gt;A SAMPLE, I WILL NOT REQUEST A REFUND, JUST GET SHIPPED TO ME AND BILL ME THAT HAVE A BLUE TOP AND WHITE&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM TO HOLD WITH A BLUE TOP THAT COMES OFF, OK?</li>
    <li> I love these, they are a great size for me.  I have had nothing but good dental check ups since I started using them, and I rarely floss.  VP</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m handicapped. I liked product!</li>
    <li> I love these ultratight brushes.  I have bridgework and a permanent retainer that make flossing nearly impossible. Local stores only carry the regular brushes which are OK but can irritate the gums in tight spaces. When I saw these online I had to try them.  Glad I did.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this after my last dentist. I was very skeptical but they work. They fit between most teeth and they feel so clean when you use. They come with a cap so you can take them  with you. I keep one in my purse, my car, my desk and my gym bag. You can get multiple uses out of each one.</li>
    <li> Helps me keep that dentist clean feel.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;ve got tightly spaced teeth, this helps keep your mouth clean-- Let&#x27;s face it: a clean mouth is your best bet for good general health, especially as we age so, this is a terrific aid that makes your mouth feel good. Not only general health is improved by keeping your mouth clean (my dentist told me at least 2 actions daily: brushing morning and night with either rinsing/gargling with mouthwash or salt water or a Neti pot sinus rinse and alternatively flossing) so these little helpers make flossing more effective. I find a clean mouth feels fantastic and help keep a generally sweet taste going, especially while I sleep.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  I am very pleased and would highly reccomend</li>
    <li> If you have braces, which I do, or just don&#x27;t have time to floss, these are great.  I love them.  My dental hygienist gave me a couple, and I then purchased these.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love them they get what flossing does not...</li>
    <li> Awesome cleaners!  they do the trick, even on hard to reach areas!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t find ultratight in stores.  Works so well I don&#x27;t know how I managed before.</li>
    <li> I love these. I got ultra tight but will just get tight next time. Read some reviews that said they break easily but I have not found that to be the case. Great for work since I don&#x27;t have much time for brushing.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really cleans between teeth. Make sure you buy the right size, though. I have a small mouth with cramped conditions between teeth; any size larger than &amp;#34;Ultratight&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t do the job. I would recommend this product to anyone who has teeth!</li>
    <li> Very effective prooduct.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Only size that fits for me.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These work well to clean in between tightly-spaced teeth.  This size, however, does not last long because it is so thin.  The next size up (green size) is a little bit thicker and last longer.  It depends on how tight the spaces between your teeth are.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended and I love it!!</li>
    <li> Greatest invention since the toothpick and floss! Really gets into the areas in where tooth meets gum lines to remove food (great for when you go out to eat and can&#x27;t floss) But along with this, floss, and my Sonicare, my teeth are healthier than they&#x27;ve ever been. I no longer dread the dentist.</li>
