      <li>I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
      <li>i have tried so so many items....</li>
      <li>However, it does not burn now and my skin tone is more even.</li>
      <li>NeoStrata is much better but cost a lot more.</li>
      <li>This is not an original product!.  </li>
      <li>When alternating with the exfoliating cleanser and applying the antioxidant serum, it will clear up and reveal beautiful, smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Love this cleanser never to drying my dermatologist said my face look fantastic</li>
      <li>The whole product line is really good.</li>
      <li>Easy to dispense and generous sized bottle.</li>
      <li>It leaves a nice finish, almost like you used a scrub, but a lot more gentle.  </li>

      <li>This facial wash is a great price and works well.</li>

      <li>You have to use the entire Vivite system to get optimum results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good daily cleaner.</li>
      <li>It really is one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>Along with the other products in the Vivite lineup, my skin is looking better and better!</li>
      <li>I used in conjunction with Differin, which left my skin incredibly flaky but too sensitive for mechanical exfoliation (with say St. Ives); I could feel the flakes coming off in the cleanser</li>
      <li>and it was super pricey</li>
      <li>I still have challenges but not like before and see quick cleansing that reduces my OCD moments.</li>
      <li>I sincerely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased it from my dermatologist at a higher price.</li>
      <li>This is a really good product that exfoliates really well but does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>The cleanser is a great everyday scrub</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>It does tingle when applied to freshly scrubbed skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived a week or so after I ordered it.</li>
    <li> I really like the Vivite line of skin care products.  I don&#x27;t know how the vendor manages to sell the daily cleanser so much cheaper than a Medical Spa, but it is the very same product at a fraction of the cost.  Brand new &amp; shipped fast!</li>
    <li> I  love this product. It leaves my face clean and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I ahve used this product for years. Really keeps my skin in check and improves the texture and clarity.</li>
    <li> I received the item on time. Great price too. This product works for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the real deal.  There is a lot of snake oil out there when it comes to skin care, but this stuff works without the B.S.  I used proactiv for years.  It only worked moderately well and I still suffered from break outs.  I also had to put up with lousy customer service, unwanted \\&quot;refill\\&quot; shipments and charges and high prices.  When Proactiv switched to its \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; formula that cost more and came in bottles that were literally half the size, I said enough.    Vivite was recommended by my dermatologist.  Within a week, I noticed that my skin was less red and irritated.  Though I still have a few pimples here and there, by and large my skin is much softer, even and clear.  I also like that it cleans make up off thoroughly.  With proactiv, I had to use several cotton swabs of toner to remove all the make up from my skin.  With vivete, my skin is actually clean.</li>
    <li> Seems to work great. I have been using this product for years and I have zero complaints.</li>
    <li> Prescribed by my dermatologist, great wash!</li>
    <li> The Vivite Daily Facial Cleanser really makes your face cleaner feeling.  It actually smooths out your skin as well.  I had a bump on my forehead and it is completely gone.  I noticed my skin looks younger immediately because it removes the dead skin cells.  I was very impressed. This is probably going to be the product line I stay with for a long time.  It took a long time to find something that works this well.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this wash when I asked him what he personnally used.  It is AMAZING.  I have used it for 6 months and can see remarkable differences in the quality of my skin.  It has softened scars, tightened pores, lightened pigment / spots, and imparted a healthy overall \\&quot;glow!\\&quot; I honestly think my skin looks better now than it did years ago.  The wash is a cream; and it doesn&#x27;t lather up.  Use 1-2 pumps and rinse, twice a day.  It&#x27;s like a mini-peel every time you use it, but it doesn&#x27;t irritate or tingle at all.  I keep one bottle at the sink for my face plus one in the shower to use on my face and neck.  I wish I had found this 20 years ago.  I sincerely love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years and usually love it.  However, I don&#x27;t know if it was this particular vendor, or a bad batch but the consistency is all wrong.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is cleaning my face at all.</li>
    <li> This product is good and very light, but I like a cleaner that foams a bit and makes your face feel clean afterward. The Revision All Skin Types cleanser is one of the best. If you cannot find it online, you probably can pick it up at a local medspa. It really is one of my favorite. The Vivite is just okay.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash</li>
    <li> This cleanser works very well. You have to use the entire Vivite system to get optimum results. At first, you might notice break outs because it really deep cleans the skin. When alternating with the exfoliating cleanser and applying the antioxidant serum, it will clear up and reveal beautiful, smooth skin. It improves the texture and takes away makeup effortlessly. I highly recommend this entire line of skincare.</li>
    <li> VIVITE Daily Cleanser is a hit in our house, we use it in the shower daily. It is very gentle and cleans really good, breaking down makeup and grime. It is unscented, I have extremely sensitive skin and it does not bother me or have any allergic effects.Your face feels good after using it. Now the same company makes a \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; daily facial cleanser as well, but that one has a chemical smell I don&#x27;t like and is very hard to rinse off. We were using another brand before switching to Vivete last year, that is just as good but had gotten too expensive for us. This product is cheaper here than it is at our dermatologist.</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser.  Works without being greasy and takes off even eye make up.  Too bad it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> This great face cleanser lasted for 5-6 months as it only takes such a small amount.  Try it!  You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> Skin has improved significantly. I still have challenges but not like before and see quick cleansing that reduces my OCD moments.</li>
    <li> Regretting not knowing about this product earlier on. I have been religiously using Proactiv for 6 years now and though less frequent than before, I still had some acne breakouts, blackheads and so my face still had some dark spots and acne scars. Not too long ago, my mom had surgery done on her face to remove a cancerous cell clusters on her nose and her doctor recommended Vivite skincare line to help diminish scarring on her face. I was asked by my mom to buy Vivite products online, so I decided to buy some for myself too. I bought both the daily cleanser and the exfoliating cleanser at a pleasant price of 1 small Proactiv cleanser bottle. I tried them for several days and I am soooo excited with the results so far. The crusty patches where acne were are all gone, my pores were minimized and I can almost not see blackheads anymore, and my face feels soft the entire day. My face is not as oily at the end of the day as it was when I was using Proactiv also. This is a product I will be using for a looong time. I simply love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash in all of the land...10 years of being a makup artist and working with skin care! I used to sell this ay my old work. I try everything so I know whats best! you will be a happy girl with this...email me for any help with skin care and makeup. annalisa.post@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I purchased this cleanser after visiting my dermatologist; she highly recommends Vivite products. It&#x27;s a good daily cleaner. I like to use it with the Vivite exfoliant. Good priding will def purchase again.</li>
    <li> Not sure this product really works since I&#x27;ve had no noticeable difference.  NeoStrata is much better but cost a lot more.</li>
    <li> This product helped clear up some minor blemishes right away. When I first started using it, it seemed like it burned a little. However, it does not burn now and my skin tone is more even.</li>
    <li> at the age of 43 i have tried so so many items....i have finally found something that I might never stop..I use the entire line and am so happy...my skin is incredible.</li>
    <li> I like the hydrating facial cleanser better because I can get some suds with that. This one, I could not produce any suds. How do I know its cleaning if I don&#x27;t see any lather? It lasts a long time, but I probably will get the kind I like next time.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product that exfoliates really well but does not dry out my skin. It also evened out skin tone..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year, along with the rest of the vivite products. I just love the results, I couldn&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
    <li> The Vivite products have done more for my skin than all the multitudes of products I have tried and $$$$ I have spent. Every product in this line I have tried is worth every cent. My skin is very dry and sensitive and this cleanser cleans thoroughly without drying or irritation. I follow this with the moisturizer with glycolic acid for night or with the SPF30 day version. My sisters are using this product now and they love it!

    <li> Fast shipping. Love the product.</li>
    <li> My wife swears this is the only cleanser that she will use. She loves it!!!!!! I have no idea what it is.</li>
    <li> People, BEWARE!!  This is not an original product!.  I have been using Vivitae Daily Facial Cleanser for a couple years.  This stuff has no glycolic acid in it!  The REAL bottle back is completely different.  The real product states that the product has Glycolic Acid (12% compound Salicylic Acid) in it.  It has NO OTHER ingredients listed on the bottle.  The bottle from Forever Young on the outside as well as the box is not like the original true box.  I am returning my products.  No wonder the price is so cheap.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  If you tried the real thing, you would know.  It even smells different.  I&#x27;m a licensed Aesthetician.</li>
    <li> I use all the vivite products and they are all wonderful - this is a gentle cleanser and can be used alternately with the exfoliating cleanser - they both work well and are not at all irritating to my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s the only face wash that has helped my acne yet doesn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
    <li> The product is fine - I&#x27;ve used it before &amp; order it here because it&#x27;s a good buy.  The bottle itself might have a little bit of an issue; the pump isn&#x27;t working smoothly so I end up manueving the pump to get the 2nd pump out.</li>
    <li> I spent so much time looking for a cleanser for my oily acne-prone skin. At the same time, although Iam still pretty young, I wanted something to start preventing agin skin. Well, this cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. No other cleanser had left my skin feeling so soft and clean. At first I was a little confused becuase the cream doesn&#x27;t really foam up at all but it still takes everything you have one and leaves such a clean feeling. This cleanser has also helped nwith my ance in combination with other stronger ance products. I just really love this cleanser and I think I am sticking to using it for a very long time. I even want to try the exfoliator from the same brand. It probably works as great as this one.</li>
    <li> Use the daily cleaner and exfoliating alternately. Keeps the skin clean and soft. Most days I use little or no make up and my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and I love it.  Along with the other products in the Vivite lineup, my skin is looking better and better!</li>
    <li> I wish I could post pics of the changes since using this product.  I use this twice daily with the eye cream and night face cream and i now look like I&#x27;m twenty five again.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This facial wash is a great price and works well. It does not dry out skin. It does tingle when applied to freshly scrubbed skin. I&#x27;m assuming its because of the salicylic acid &amp; glycolic acid in it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the product, met my expectations.</li>
    <li> This is a soft and gentle cleanser that deeply cleanses your skin. I have used it for almost a year, and absolutely love it! A woman with the most beautiful skin whom I met a couple of years ago told me about Vivite products. It definitely works!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser never to drying my dermatologist said my face look fantastic</li>
    <li> I prefer MD Forte cleanser but have been unable to get it, this product doesn&#x27;t work as well but is a good cleanser.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to product after laser hair removal. Product was not over drying and works well without out other supporting products.</li>
    <li> Product as described. The best skin care product I have used.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. It leaves a nice finish, almost like you used a scrub, but a lot more gentle.  You can use it once per day. Usually I use it to take off makeup and sometimes with a clarisonic brush.  Nicely prepped skin for creams and prescriptions.</li>
    <li> I really like Vivite products and have been using for about a year.  The cleanser is a great everyday scrub and I use it in conjunction with the moisturizer and serum--glycolic acid is good for your skin and Amazon  has the best pricing for Vivite (that I&#x27;ve found), not to mention the convenience of ordering here (I am a big fan of one-stop shopping).</li>
    <li> I love the Vivite line of skin care products. I first started using them upon the suggestion of my dermatologist. I pay much less for Vivite products on Amazon. I have very dry, sensitive, aging skin with rosacea and find Vivite and Eminence two product lines that are gentle and effective. I add a vitamin C serum in the morning, on the suggestion of my dermatologist, and wear a good sunscreen. (I only wish SPF sunscreens and SPF clothing had been available when I was growing up.)</li>
    <li> Cleans well but does not overly dry skin.  I have oily skin, however some products have dried my skin too much.  I am pleased with the results from using Vivite Daily Facial Cleanser.</li>
    <li> my dermatologist recommended the cleaner and I bought it for double the price in her office. I use it daily with the ClearSonic and it is really nice!</li>
    <li> Very effective moisturizer especially when used with the other Vivite products.  The glycolic acid exfoliates the skin and like that it contains a sunscreen too.  Try it!</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser. Was recommended by my dermatologist. It  gently cleans and exfoliates your skin without damaging it. I would recommend it .</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the best cleanser for removing make-up!  I will be purchasing this wonderful product again.</li>
    <li> originally got this from my dermatologist office. like it with my clarisonic mia 2. no noticeable scent. leaves your face clean. has glycolic acid i think so helps slough dead skin.</li>
    <li> Wife keeps buying it at a great price.  Good product.</li>
    <li> love this stuff. I originally purchased it from my dermatologist at a higher price. I will continue to order it :-)</li>
    <li> Thoroughly cleanses &amp; exfoliates without stripping your skin. Easy to dispense and generous sized bottle. High SPF protection! I find it is lightening my sun spots over time.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my skin clear and clean. I havent had any acne breakouts since I started using it 6 mos ago.It also seems to help keep down moles and dark spots. I will continue using it and I do recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I order this cleanser every time. It works great and keeps face clean. The whole product line is really good. My dermatologist reccomended it</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product from a salon and it was super pricey so I never bought it again. When I saw it for this price, I knew I had to order it again. I really recommend this face cleanser.</li>
    <li> This produce works well on my acne without drying out my skin. It also has glycolic acid which is good for aging skin.</li>
    <li> This is ok for a cleanser but I did not see any other benefits and for the price there should be more you get out of it.</li>
    <li> My adult acne and sensitivity to perfumes causes me to be picky for products.  I am very happy with this product.  It&#x27;s gentle and I&#x27;ve notices less drying of my skin.  I take meds for Acne, and dry skin is a problem.  This product seems to be a good fit for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I use it everyday and makes my skin soft. It lasts for a long time. You only need a little bit because it lathers up very nice.</li>
    <li> This is one of those products where a little dab will do ya.  Cleans and refreshes, but still seems pricey to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few years now. The product I received has turned yellow - when it should be white - and is clearly extremely expired. The label on the back says this is from 2006. The best part is there is a sticker on the front of the bottle that says &amp;#34;Staff Use. Not for Sale.&amp;#34; This is clearly some bootlegged crap that someone held onto for years.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery, exactly what I wanted!  Thanks</li>
    <li> I first saw this product in my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I bought it here in April 2012 and it really worked wonders. I used in conjunction with Differin, which left my skin incredibly flaky but too sensitive for mechanical exfoliation (with say St. Ives); I could feel the flakes coming off in the cleanser and my pores looked virtually invisible, especially on my nose. I bought a second bottle in June 2012 but didn&#x27;t see the same effect. I noticed another reviewer checking the dates on the box; I didn&#x27;t bother because it worked so well the first time but I suspect I got an expired batch. Luck of the draw I guess. For my third attempt, I went to drugstore.com ($24 total, shipping included). Regardless, I definitely recommend this product; glycolic acid is an excellent natural exfoliant. Just make sure you&#x27;re not getting expired product. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Leaves the face clean and controls my oily summer skin acne.  My skin gets drier in the winter so use it less then.  Love it!</li>
    <li> An esthetician recommended this cleanser to me. It&#x27;s okay, but not life changing. I know the ingredients are good for my oily, acne-prone skin. Rhonda Allison&#x27;s glycolic herbal wash has the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor this cleanser is missing. RA&#x27;s cleanser leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft and I notice a visible difference in my blemishes. The thing is, you can only use that one a few times a week because it&#x27;s so strong. I&#x27;m not sure Vivite&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser is much better than what you can get at the drugstore. Probably won&#x27;t buy again for the price.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and suffer from adult acne. This was suggested to me at my last visit to the dermatologist. They sold this for about $42 but good old Amazon had it for a great price!!! This is the only face wash that I have used that does not make my face feel tight and dry. I use this day and night along with the spf lotion in the day time and the replenishing cream at night. My face feels so much smoother and my acne is clearing up fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vivite for over a year now and it has completely cleared up my adult acne.  I usually use the facial cleanser with the SPF lotion.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very good have  to get used to the oder.</li>
    <li> my favorite cleanser ever, love the cleanser and love the pump!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is rich and creamy.  My skin always feels moisturized after I use it.  Never dry or tight.  It does an excellent job cleaning too.  It even removes my mascara.</li>
    <li> Works well &amp; is very gentle for an exfoliant.  Price is little high, but half the cost I paid at plastic surgeon office.</li>
    <li> Awesome Facial Cleanser</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...why did they discontinue?!!!</li>
    <li> This product is a fake please beware. I usual buy Vivite product from a place call american skin care but i saw this one much cheaper so i purchased.  when it arrived the casing is totally different and also it has a little sun logo at the middle of the bottle.  i kept my empty old bottle of vivite daily facial cleanser to compare but I saw no similarity in the two. I took this product to american skin care (were you can buy the real thing) and they said this was not one of the Vivite products. I still tried it out since i paid for it but no results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used vivite before, love this gentle daily cleanser. The smell is the only thing left to be desired.Insane buy for the price!</li>
    <li> I was using Jan Marini before trying Vivite. I wanted to try a different cleanser just to see the difference. After about four days my neck became itchy and red. After about a week I started having a rash on my jaw line and around my eyes. One of my eyes was completely swollen one morning. I was shocked. I will be going back to using jan marini bioglycolic cleanser Forever..</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years and love it!!  It was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
