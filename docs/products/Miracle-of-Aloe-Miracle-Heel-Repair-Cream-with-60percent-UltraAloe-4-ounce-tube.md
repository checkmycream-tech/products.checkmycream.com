    <li> Works very well. Not perfect, but probably the best out there over the counter.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble keeping heel calluses away when I discovered this product. It did the job extremely well in keeping my heels soft and smooth. . .. really keeping them presentable and saving me money on new hosiery too.</li>
    <li> SOOO... this the 4th time around..and at this point I buy (2) at a time, I have noticed a HUGE difference and us this now once a day and put on fluffy socks after..my heels look great, healthy, and I do not have to be like a roadrunner to get a pedicure anymore, I can go 4-6 weeks without a pedicure and no need to pay extra for the callous remover!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product the first time some 5 years ago while on a business trip to the States. The first two lasted until sometime early this year. One of the few products that actually came up with the results it promises. I am very happy to have found somebody who ships overseas, the company mentioned on the original package did not want to ship outside the US or Canada. Amazon came up with the right supplier</li>
    <li> This stuff works like a dream for softening up hardened feet, buy it now!!!! Much better than the straight Foot Repair, the Heel Repair won&#x27;t make you smell like an old lady ;o)</li>
    <li> After only two days of using this, once in the morning and once at night, I can tell a difference in my heels!  It&#x27;s great.  Is not greasy, pleasant non-strong odor.  Best foot cream for my heels that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best product out there for dry feet and cracked heels.  I use on knees and hands and elbows too.  Absolutely love it and order two tubes at a time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the glowing reviews I read.  Sure enough, it&#x27;s as miraculous at the other reviewers claim.  My feet went from cracked and dry to supple and lovely in less than 3 days.  I use the cream every night after a shower and I sleep with socks to seal in the moisture.  I cannot believe the difference.</li>
    <li> Good product, work great!</li>
    <li> I bought this after trying everything else I could find for cracked heels. I was very skeptical about whether this would work, but after only a couple of days I could see(and feel) a big improvement.</li>
    <li> I never had an issue with my heels but the day came when my heel skin cracked and it&#x27;s not comfortable. I used this product and the first use worked, completely took the ouch pain away and now my heels are back to normal. Great Product and will buy again!</li>
    <li> For a reasonable price, a well made and effective heel cream. Apply daily to keep your heels from drying out and cracking. Does the job.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible. My heels were dried up and cracked - they hooked and rasped on fabric they were so bad. I have tried various cracked heel creams to little benefit. This cream truly is &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using this cream a few months and my heels are rejuvenated. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t seen and felt it for myself.</li>
    <li> I use this foot repair cream daily as a preventive medicine, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have used the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products for years.  My problem has always been dry cracked heels and this cream is the exact thing I have been looking for.  It keeps your feet soft and supple.</li>
    <li> No more rough feet when you use this easy to apply cream.  Use daily and you will feel the smoothness in your feet.</li>
    <li> Very good cream, work great</li>
    <li> NOTHING!  This product has not done thing for my heals.  They are just as dried and cracked as they were before the lotion.  Don&#x27;t waste the money!!!</li>
    <li> It just works. We live in the high Sonoran desert in Arizona.  My wife has been using it for years as she goes barefoot (in home or around the community pool) most of the time. Dry cracked heels are a constant problem.  Nothing solves her problem like this and I do think she has tried everything.  Just use it religiously every night before you go to bed and give it a few days.  And I think she sands her heels a few times a week.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  Not greasy or smelly like most products and does give the results you need.  A must have for summer wardrobe but also great for winter dry feet.</li>
    <li> Low odor cream with excellent penetrating properties soothes feet, and, incidentally, hands just as well. Definitely worth trying. An excellent product.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Fast delivery too!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
    <li> This truly is a miracle cream it works within a few hours I put a little more on my went to bed my feet look healthy and happy. I am now not embarrassed to wear sandals the summer</li>
