    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos for gray hair and Blondme is far superior to anything out there.  I use it every shampoo and my hair is soft, hydrated and shiny.  I love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Not much difference actually it makes my hair darker and believe or not  it does not remove the yellow</li>
    <li> I have only used this product since going gray, so I have nothing for a comparison, but I love the color of my hair and my hair dresser believes the great silvery tones are directly related to the use of this product.</li>
    <li> i used to use Shimmer Lights but found that it actually turned my hair purple.  i use this shampoo everyday and it makes such a difference with my highlights without turning my very blonde strands purple.  i highly recommend it to anyone with blonde hair that is highlighted!</li>
    <li> The best blonding Shampoo I have ever used. I am natural dark brown and my hair gets brassy fast. I use this once a week and it keeps my blonde looking fresh like I just left the salon.</li>
    <li> Decent shampoo for blondes but didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference in cutting the brass out or brightening effects on my platinum hair. It&#x27;s more hydrating than most purple shampoos and smells great though, wasn&#x27;t too good or too bad, just ok 4me</li>

    <li> Left my hair feeling brassy, dry and dull. There are many great reviews so it must work for others. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I figured I would go through the whole bottle before reviewing. This did not cleanse my hair, nor did it tone down any brassiness in my platinum hair. In fact, it left my hair in worse condition. I switched to Redken Blonde Idol and I&#x27;m very happy thus far.</li>
    <li> I have dark hair underneath that used to be blonde; blonde highlights and my hair has been graying quite a bit on the sides. I looked like I had 3 different colors of hair and nothing was blending nicely. This Cool Ice was the answer to my prayers.  I used it as directed and within 2-3 uses, my gray hair was blended in with the blonde and I had so much shine and sheen to my highlights, it was amazing.  I will never be without this product again!</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my blonde hair. I really wanted to like this product. But after using it four times and seeing no results... kind of a let down. The redken one did a much better job.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this shampoo, she has platinum blonde highlights, and this keeps them very bright and stops any yellow tinge creeping into the color.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it!!</li>
    <li> I have overprocessed my hair to the point of losing quite a bit of it due to breakage.  I have tried EVERYTHING to get my hair in better shape, many promise to help with breakage, what I found was either they were too heavy and made my hair look like a grease ball or they did nothing.  Time for a change, Schwarzkopf has found the secret.  This makes my hair almost like it was before bleaching.  I will never do without this.  I ordered 6 containers last week and see many more in my future.  You can&#x27;t use too much of this.  It is fabulous.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF I TELL YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive an non expensive but this stuff is miraculous! Have yellowing problems? I highly recomend this..</li>
    <li> I had a few brassy spots in my light blonde hair that I thought this product would tone down, boy was I mistaken. After using this product last night with high hopes, my hair is now brassy all over. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair a bit brassy, mixed feelings about this shampoo. Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again..  Ships quick though</li>
    <li> After bleaching my hair way too yellowy blonde I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am young but have a lot of white hair.&lt;br /&gt;It blended nicely and brought a lot of brightness without brass to my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was as advertised.  This shampoo is nice for colored hair and lathers quickly. Cannot seem to find it easily elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was recommended by my stylist.  I just use a dime size so a bottle a long time!  I have highlighted, blonde curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Helps keep the blonde tone.  Smells good and my hair feels great.  Got the leave-in conditioner too and they keep my hair looking vibrant and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great smell, leaves hair clean, strips the brassy color and leaves a bright blonde. Best purple shampoo I&#x27;ve found. Yeah!</li>
