      <li>It is wonderful!</li>
      <li>I always get compliments on it and it is especially suitable for the office because it isn&#x27;t perfume-ish.  </li>

      <li>A very light floral scent without overpowering you.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m a huge philosophy fan, but I would recommend spraying this on and walking around the store to see how you like the way it diffuses before purchasing!</li>
      <li>Awesome product for an amazingly low price.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Clean and fresh for a quick refresher.  Doesn&#x27;t stay w you so carry the bottle in your purse</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for a family member and the perfume was received quickly.  Was able to get the item for less than at the store.</li>
    <li> I wore Amazing Grace for years, loved it&#x27;s uniquely clean scent, and always received many compliments on it. Sad to say, the bottle of the eau de parfum spray I bought last month is definitely not the same as all the others I used over the years. It seems to be cheapened with alcohol or something else, and does not have the same fragrance at all. If it hadn&#x27;t come directly from Macy&#x27;s, I would have suspected a knock-off. Check all the similar comments on H. Swanson&#x27;s review, which contends that the recipe changed with the ownership of Philosophy. I&#x27;ll be throwing my bottle away and giving up on Philosophy.</li>
    <li> To say that I&#x27;m picky about my fragance is an understatement.  I used the same scent (Bill Blass) for 20 years, not because I was still in love with it, but because I couldn&#x27;t find anything else I liked.  I would go to the department store counters and tell the clerks that I wanted something clean and light, and that I didn&#x27;t like woodsy, spicy, and heavy sweet fragrances.  Inevitably they would steer me towards something overly sweet and heavily floral.  Or, I&#x27;d find something I liked, but the scent would \\&quot;turn\\&quot; on me after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept hearing people rave about the Philosphy \\&quot;Grace\\&quot; series and so I finally ordered a sampler that included Baby Grace, Pure Grace, and Amazing Grace. Because the description for Pure Grace was \\&quot;soap and water clean\\&quot; I thought that would be the one I love, but I didn&#x27;t care for it, nor for the Baby Grace.  But the Amazing Grace is absolutely lovely and I get so many compliments from people, both young and old.  It&#x27;s a light, clean floral scent with a touch of jasmine and light musk.  It has rose it in (not my favorite) and maybe it&#x27;s my body chemistry, but I don&#x27;t smell the rose on me at all. The scents in the lotions are true to the perfume, unlike many other brands.  One note, stick with the parfume, not what Philosophy refers to as the \\&quot;fragance\\&quot; aka cologne.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same staying power at all.</li>
    <li> Definitely my new favorite perfume.  Now I want the lotion.</li>
    <li> Lovely scent but don&#x27;t buy from marketplace seller. Nothing but troubles.</li>
    <li> Great price that met the needs.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent -- il&#x27;s fresh, clean and I have found nothing quite like it. Unfortunately, it just doesn&#x27;t last... You have to apply too much of it and even then, the scent is gone within a few hours. Considering the many comments about this problem one has to wonder about the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;philosophy&amp;#34;... Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents, it smells tender, sweet and clean. Love it! Thanks amazon for the amazing price with subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this, when someone gets near me they comment on it.  The only other perfume I&#x27;ve gotten these types of comments on is Tova Signature, but they changed the formulation so I don&#x27;t buy it anymore.  Until I found Amazing Grace, Tova was all i could wear because perfume makes my eyes water.  Amazing Grace does not.  When you spray it on, be sure and spray some on the back of your neck so it gets in your hair near your neck. It will be noticeable all day, but not to you, to those around you.  Don&#x27;t you all know that when you&#x27;re around a scent too long you stop noticing it? If you can smell your perfume all day long, it&#x27;s overwhelming to others. The Eau de Parfum is the one to get, not the Eau de Toilett. It has more fragrance oils.</li>
    <li> Am so disappointed, fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger.  Since Coty now owns Philosophy, am reluctant to order any Philosophy fragrances ever again!</li>
    <li> smells good but doesn&#x27;t last long - total loss of money will not purchase again- very disappointed- philosophy needs to do a better job.</li>
    <li> I first noticed the fragrance on a coworker.  She received numerous compliments.  I orderd my own bottle.  It is wonderful!</li>
    <li> This product can not be called perfume. It is just a water mixed with alcohol. I am so disappointed. Really,this is just bad joke that some people make a money from it.</li>
    <li> This product appeared used, covered in thick messy finger prints and wrapped in a bag (not a box). Amazon should not allow this individual to do business on their site. A big pain! The only good thing I can say is that I got a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years. I love it very much</li>
    <li> Ever wish that &amp;#34;just stepped out of the shower&amp;#34; fragrance would follow you all day long? Then this is what you have been waiting for. I spray a little on my wrists and rub some on my neck and that fresh scrubbed smell takes me through at least 2 pm. I can reactivate it by rubbing on it again and make it through the day. Incredible. It does take on some of your own musk or smell on the second round due to your oil content, but it still smells better than deodorant. I and those who stand close to me during the day appreciate it. Oh, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering like some fragrances where people choke and put up signs in their cubicles to keep you away. It is light and airy by comparison. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> i love them but i think i was over charged</li>
    <li> Amazing Grace is a soft scent that can be worn day or night. I like to layer it with shower gel and body creme.  Having the perfume is great as the scent lasts longer.</li>
    <li> after testing this parfum spray In the department store I liked it because it had a fresh sense  but after ordering it , the product was not the same there was no  fragrance in  I could not smell anything and no one else could</li>
    <li> This is one of the purest and cleanest scents that I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I absolutely love it and this will be my scent from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d never had the opportunity to smell this until I bought for a Christmas present for my daughter. She had requested it, saying she loved the scent. I sniffed it after she opened it, and loved the clean, flowery scent.</li>
    <li> I have used Amazing Grace for years, but now since Cody bought Co., I want be buying this again...the beautiful fragrance is gone! (And so am I)</li>
    <li> Amazing Grace by Philosophy is my all time favorite parfum. I get many complements on how lovely and soft the scent is. I do have to spray a little extra but it&#x27;s worth it because the scent is so soft and not over powering. I have been using it for many years and I also purchase the shampoo and body wash. Philosophy products are very high quality and you know you&#x27;re getting some of the best products out on the market.</li>
    <li> Fresh, light perfume! I had tried many kind of scents before! But no one made me happy until I try this perfume. I love it. Thanks.</li>
    <li> One of the freshest most amazing scents. Have used it for years and I am a repeat buyer whn I run out.</li>
    <li> This parfum is absolutely lovely! I have received many compliments on it and it is a scent that is subtle.</li>
    <li> I got this on the recommendation of how much I liked the Amazing Grace Shower Gel.  Boy was I disappointed by the almost immediate disappearing fragrance!!!  With Amazon I have no complaints....extremely fast shipping as always!  I hope with enough reviews like this that maybe Philosophy will get the message and change back to the original fragrance!!</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed in this.  I love the scent on others but the scent seems to dissipate on me in seconds.  I like something that will linger most of the day.  Only because it does not seem to stay with me I will not be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on how people thought the scent was less potent and I&#x27;ll have to say...I agree.  I spray it on and leave the room and I can&#x27;t smell it after that.  People used to comment on how good I smell...now nothing.  I still love the scent, but it just doesn&#x27;t last like it used to. It&#x27;s somewhat expensive too. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> the bottle was very old looking and had scratches all over it ......almost felt it was a knock off.  thought i was purchasing a new product.  scent does not last long either</li>
    <li> The scent is clean and fresh and it never fails to get me compliments.  I get &amp;#34;Gee - you smell good&amp;#34; all the time!  It is not a heavy scent and tends to fade as the day goes on, but I still love it!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Unfortunately, the scent does not last very long at all. When ordering, do not mix amazing grace up with any other grace product. They smell radically different.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume as a birthday gift and I really love the scent. It is not cloying or too musky, which makes it perfect for work, dates, or everyday use. My biggest problem with it and why it can&#x27;t get more than 3 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all. I can smell it faintly on my clothes but that crisp, clean smell won&#x27;t last through the whole day. This is a great perfume for people who have an allergic reaction to or experience irritation with super floral perfumes. Anyway, I&#x27;m a huge philosophy fan, but I would recommend spraying this on and walking around the store to see how you like the way it diffuses before purchasing!</li>
    <li> this is a fresh perfume that lingers long after i can smell it on myself; i gave this to my mother and she loves it too</li>
    <li> A gift for my daughtrer, she loves it and I am happy with my purchase.  Not crazy about these reviews but know they have a good purpose.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell last all day and it wonderful.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fresh, clean and sexy too.  I also purchased the body lotion (love it) to enhance the scent.  I just wish it were a little stronger...doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I have used this beautiful scent for years, but ever since philosophy sold to coty, it has no scent. It&#x27;s incredibly disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please!&lt;br /&gt;Please !&lt;br /&gt;Put the trademark scent back as it was.&lt;br /&gt;Please!</li>
    <li> I was given the Eau De Toilette spray (the lightest form of a scent) as a gift and loved it. Needing to apply it a few times a day as the scent dissapated within a few hours, I decided to buy the strongest Eau De Parfum Spray. The first time I used this it was so strong that I had to wash it off quite a few times to decrease the strength.  (I was surprised it gave me nausea.)  The next time I sprayed a bit on my fingertips and then touched them to my neck and wrists and it seemed to have taken on a completely different scent, one not as pleasant as the Toilette spray.  I think Philosphy either changed the formula or my body chemistry changed to that of a vampire within a month:)  I&#x27;ll either return it or give it away.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted amazing grace perfume but never found it so affordable before! Awesome product for an amazingly low price.  It does not come with a box, but you&#x27;re going to throw that away anyway.  Very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is a clean, soft and fresh scent.  I get compliments on it when I wear it.  Not too overpowering as some perfume can be.  I layer it with the body spray and it has a great smell.  Packaged appropriately and arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Amazing Grace Eau De Parfum Spray is perfect if you like to smell fresh and clean, but not overwhelming.  The fragrance is not &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; -- just fresh and clean.  I always get compliments on it and it is especially suitable for the office because it isn&#x27;t perfume-ish.  Most any woman would enjoy wearing this fragrance.  It sets you apart from the floral, sweet, rather loud fragrances that are all too popular these days.</li>
    <li> My husband always compliments me when i have this on</li>
    <li> Dissapointed- tried a sample in the store and loved it. This spray is very way too subtle. I almost feel like it might be a knockoff.</li>
    <li> I purchased Amazing Grace by mistake.  It&#x27;s an okay scent, but PURE grace is really a beautiful, clean scent.  I do still wear Amazing Grace, but it&#x27;s not my fave.</li>
    <li> Perhaps I bought an old bottle of this eau de parfum because there is barely a scent.  Use it in my final clothing rinse.</li>
    <li> This is such a partner with the Pure Grace scent-they are both such a breath of fresh air, light, fresh out of the bath soapy smell.  I have received  many compliments for this cologne.</li>
    <li> This is the best fragrance out there - I just love it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume!  It&#x27;s my new favorite!  Have tried some others by Philosophy, but this scent definitely stands out, beyond the others.  Will definitely keep purchasing!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife for her birthday.  She said it was one of the best gifts.  She loves it, it is her favorite and she cann&#x27;t thank me enough.</li>
    <li> Philosophy is one of my favorite brands for skin care and fragrance.  However, I have noticed the fragrances don&#x27;t have much staying power.  So lovely when first put on, but fades very quickly, and that is a shame.  The price for this bottle was very reasonable, and I would recommend this seller to anyone.  Very fast shipping as well, which is always a plus.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely , clean fragrance . I gave it only 3 stars because the fragrance lasts only for  a couple of hours. I will still buy it again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for the person who doesn&#x27;t wear perfume but likes fresh scents!</li>
    <li> I love it. Received a lot of nice complement like you smell really nice.</li>
    <li> Every time I wear this perfume, I get compliments.  It is a scent that changes throughout the day.  It never feels too heavy or &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and it gets better with time.</li>
    <li> It is my very favorite perfume . It beat my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love Amazing Grace scent &amp; get many compliments when I wear it. Company has changed formula so scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to. However, it still is a wonderful, clean-smelling scent.</li>
    <li> When philosophy was sold out to a different company 2 years or so ago, a major change was noticed in the Amazing Grace line. I no longer smell the wonderful, bright, strong Grace scent. It is now primarily alcohol! The scent that does stay is extremely faint, almost like a body spray. This is using the EDP, and I bought it from a reputable seller so I know it&#x27;s not a fake. Everyone else has been reporting this as well! I have a hunch that the way to go if you want the old formula is to buy a tester. It seems that whenever I ask for samples from the testers at the counter, they give me the old formula!! Testers are made separately just for testing by customers by the company. So, is philosophy trying to reel you in with the samples, then sell you an inferior product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe Philosophy would do this any of this to their dedicated customers! &gt;:(  PHILOSOPHY BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA OR YOU&#x27;VE LOST A GREAT CUSTOMER!!!</li>
    <li> I was sent the wrong item,not happy with the roll on version of this item, will purchase at the store next time.</li>
    <li> All of thr Graces fromPhilosophy have such a clean,soft scent I am a Philosophy Girl.  this product arrived quickly, and was just as ordered.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance!  but thought the Eau De Parfum fragrance would linger much longer.  I like that it&#x27;s not overpowering but I would be happier if it was a bit stronger or longer lasting.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I was a bit scared to order from Amazon, but the product smells exactly like the ones in the department store.</li>
    <li> I think this smells just like the beach - (minus the fish!).  I&#x27;m very picky about perfume - I detest anything sweet, flowery, too musky, or anything strong.  I  want to smell clean, not like a fruit salad.  I love this one -it&#x27;s very unique.  I&#x27;ve smelled a lot of perfumes, but never anything quite like this.  It&#x27;s great for everyday scent - subtle and fresh and clean - it&#x27;s especially perfect for summer.  It does fade very quickly, so I also spray a little on my clothes to make it last throughout the day.</li>
    <li> A very light floral scent without overpowering you. I get so many compliments on this perfume. Love it. try it</li>
    <li> They were very prompt in delivery. Love the fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I have smelled this scent on two of my associates and loved it.  Never gave much thought to the fact that perfume smells differently on people.  Now I believe it.  Did nothing for me.  Tried from 2 vendors and returned each for a refund.  Will try sampler at store and see if any difference.  There was no problem with the refund except being out the return postage.</li>
    <li> Love it....but like everyone has said...it doesn&#x27;t linger...even tho I use the lotion, spritz oil and parfum.</li>
    <li> Not too strong, which is good....but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
    <li> it idid not smell the real amazing grace that I ordered from QVC. I returned it. Do not waste your money. As soon as you layer it with the lotion the smell should be very good and pretty powerful. This did not smell like the real deal.</li>
    <li> I have read the reviews about changes to this perfume but I have not noticed that. It has always been a subtle fragrance -- the main reason for its appeal. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Amazing Grace soap/cream - the cream actually has firming effects.  The perfume is the same fragrance but is light - doesn&#x27;t last all day.  Still worth the money especially if you layer like I do with the same fragrance soap/cream/perfume. It&#x27;s very fresh smelling - not over powering at all.</li>
    <li> It is my all time favorite - the only thing I wear. I love Amazing Grace.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, clean, and different than anything out there....</li>
