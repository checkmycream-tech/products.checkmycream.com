<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have not used them yet but I know they are good. In Venezuela it is not posible to find shaving cream since last December.</li>
    <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
    <li> I figured I would be using these eventually so I went ahead and bought a pack of 6. The shaving gel is fine, no issues. Same as the ones bought in the store. The only real benefit is that instead of paying $3.50 to $4 at the store per can I get enough to last me for a long time and just store in the bathroom for easy access when I run out. No more worrying about running out of gel for a long time. Plus I save a few bucks down the road. Win win.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the item</li>
    <li> No itchiness or burns or rashes using this gel. It soothes my skin and allows me to get a close shave. I like that the dispenser is big and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using edge shave gel for years and really like it.  Thought I might save a little buying in bulk.  However on my next trip to the Big Blue Discount Store, I found that it was 20% less expensive there than even the subscribe and save price.  Cancelled the S&amp;S.</li>
    <li> It is a shaving cream, people. It is pretty good. The one huge reason to buy it over Gillette is that the can does not rust. The Gillette can rusts immediately in your shower and ruins anything it stands on. This thing never does.</li>
    <li> Wonderful and soothing!</li>
    <li> Good enough. When I&#x27;m done shaving, there are a lot blue gel globs in the sink. I liked Nivea better.</li>
    <li> Good every day shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;  Seems to penetrate stibble growth well. Better than barbasol and similar creams.  Good deal at this pricw</li>
    <li> I bought two boxes in 2012 and still have my cans left.  For the price (I always used Edge before but bought individually from a retail store outlet) I figured I could not go wrong and I have not.</li>
    <li> Makes shaving easier with out blood letting</li>
    <li> I have been using Edge shave gel for years and love it.  For me it eliminates the skin irritation from shaving.</li>
    <li> Actually really like the Edge product but was looking for the TSA allowed size - 4oz. - My fault for not checking the size closer but I thought asking for air travel size would get me what I needed.</li>
    <li> Took a few weeks to arrive, but great deal</li>
    <li> The smell and feel is what I like!</li>
    <li> The box they came in had a date of Dec.,2014 and I received it in Jan.,2015. But the gel worked good!</li>
    <li> good to stock up, can be left in packaging for easy storage.</li>
    <li> 5 stars. I have used the product before and have been happy with it.  I&#x27;m sure I will be equally happy with this batch.</li>
    <li> This and a good razor should give you you shave your looking for</li>
    <li> Great value, convenient size</li>
    <li> no better product especially for the price</li>
    <li> Cheap, gives smooth shave and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Decent price, compared to store cost.  Recommended way to buy&lt;br /&gt;Good product for shaving with</li>
    <li> I bought these for my hubby, I love the fact that there are this many for this price. I think it&#x27;s a great deal for something he already knows he likes. Came very fast and is exactly as described!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> If there are better products out there, I wouldn&#x27;t know about them. I got started on Edge by using their travel size can on trips.</li>
    <li> I used to use this in past and have been using multiple brands. Currently using Gillette comfort advantage shaving gel, and will try the Gillette Fusion Hydra Gel Shave Gel, Moisturizing, 7-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 6) next. The lathering was not as good and it was not bubbly enough for me. Hence I stopped using Edge brand.</li>
    <li> seems to be my brother in laws favorite!&lt;br /&gt;good product for a close shave&lt;br /&gt;good price and 6 cans should last about year!</li>
    <li> I used to use this when they carried it at Costco, they don&#x27;t anymore so I bought it here.  I like how it comes out a little slower, so you don&#x27;t waste it.  You don&#x27;t need very much for your face.  Also it&#x27;s comfortable and gives a good shave.  I am glad to have found it here and for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great product - use it every day</li>
    <li> Keeps my face smooth and my shave comfortable.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Edge for over 20 years and it does the job for me.  Of course, I&#x27;m a plugger whose razor still has two edges as in the double edged blades of yesteryear!  Unlike my two grown boys (now men), a wet shave with a razor is my only way to get a good shave.</li>
    <li> This is one of absolute favorite shaving gels.  At times I&#x27;ll be cheap and buy some of the no name generic shaving creams but they just don&#x27;t compare to the comfort and closeness I get with a good shaving gel like Edge.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and tend to get razor burn, knicks and cuts easily if I don&#x27;t use the right shaving products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want a comfortable smooth shave I go back to using Edge Sensitive Skin Shaving gel. The 7 Ounce can may look a little smaller than those 10 ounce cans of cheap white garbage but I find it lasts longer because I use less. Just a small shot of this shaving gel can be worked into a rich lather that serves its purpose without being a bulky airy mess on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with cheap (yes I&#x27;m on a budget) double edged razor blades in a classic double edge safety razor for a clean and close shave that leaves my face feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Unlike with the cheap white shaving creams, I don&#x27;t feel like I need any aftershave creams or moisturizers. I just shave with Edge, rinse and go on with my day feeling refreshed and cleanly shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the mild clean scent of Edge and find it doesn&#x27;t linger or hang with you the rest of the day like some of the more over powering scents out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend checking prices locally before purchasing this online. . . especially if you&#x27;re buying from any seller other than Amazon. A great shaving gel that I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Edge gel works as advertised.  I don&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.  I never noticed a horrible smell, or any negative side effects.  i would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and think that the product is great. One can lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
    <li> This product arrived as promised and as advetised...GREAT price!! Would recommend to any one that uses Edge sensitive skin shave gel to purchase here...I had a hard time finding it in stores...</li>
    <li> Edge is the standard-bearer in gel shaving, and I like having it by the case because running out of shaving gel stinks. Decent price on Amazon vs grocery store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from \\&quot;amazon\\&quot; because of the great price ! in nyc they sell 7oz for $3.49 , this  is 8.4 oz  which is 20% more for only $2.44 so basically its a 40% discount to the store price . very good deal, highly recommend ! I like \\&quot;edge\\&quot; gel and use it most of the time</li>
    <li> Had used it in the past. Nothing to dislike. It is nice to have a spare in the house so I ordered 6.</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace the regular foam type I&#x27;ve used for quite some time as I have pretty sensitive skin and just got tired of dealing with that &#x27;razor burn&#x27; feeling, these have proven to much better in dealing with that so I&#x27;m pretty happy now.  A little more expensive but I have to shave every day so well worth it for a quality of life improvement.</li>
    <li> Really good for shaving. Terrible on ice-cream. Had to knock off two stars for that since you could substitute for Coolwhip and probably come out ahead. (Depending on how much shaving and/or ice cream you&#x27;re into.)</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving cream I use on my face, underarms and sensitive parts.  It is the best product shaving cream I have ever used and the only one I consistently use.</li>
    <li> the only shaving cream I need! thanks for this!</li>
    <li> im supplied for awhile @2 lower/can.  i have been buying this one,  elsewhere. @ 4/can.  i have saved lots of money.</li>
    <li> use this product all the time and it works for me. nice smooth save and helps keep the razor burn down on my face for i have a tough beard and very tender skin.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed - it didn&#x27;t create the light show as indicated on the canister.</li>
    <li> This is the best sensitive skin shaving gel that money can buy. I use this to shave every single day. If you have sensitive skin I would highly recommend that you purchase this.</li>
    <li> Accept no substitute. Hands down the best shave gel ever.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product Great Shaving Cream that really works very well in just about any shaving need that one might have</li>
    <li> Bought this pack of 6 very convenient and price is also very reasonable would recommend highly to anyone looking to buy in bulk</li>
    <li> I use Edge regularly.  I like the product and I like the way my skin feels after shaving.  I have never ordered it from Amazon before but am very happy with the pricing and the quick delivery.  Will continue to use this product and order it the same way again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I recently started paying attention to how much shaving supplies were costing me, so I decided to check out pricing at Amazon.  No surprise: the price on this product was $1 less per can than my local supermarket, which is generally as cheap as a certain Arkansas-based big-box chain on items like this.</li>
    <li> I love it. No irritation after shaving, get a closer shave, just works better than the rest. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s edge shaving gel (I&#x27;ve been using it for decades). The product was very sturdily packaged and arrived clean, dry, undented and promptly.</li>
    <li> Edge sensitive Skin Shave Gel.  I have been using it for years!! Love it, MOM uses it too!!</li>
    <li> Good value for a product I&#x27;ve used for years.</li>
    <li> Good product and quick delivery. I didn.t realize this gel would foam so much. So, I use less than expected. My order is going to last a very long time.</li>
    <li> better than i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I’m posting this same review for two of my recently purchased products:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032ANCUU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4 and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUW8WM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad always, ALWAYS used an electric shaver.  Ever since I was a child I could not stand the rough stubble feel and vowed I would never, EVER use an electric shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m nearing 60 years old.  I have tested and tried many various razors and shave creams/gels.  In my some 45 years of shaving I have never, ever found a better, closer, more comfortable shave than by using the two products linked above.&lt;br /&gt;____&lt;br /&gt;Additional….  Daily, I listen to a lot of talk radio.  Due to incessant advertising I decided to spend ten bucks testing “Harry’s” introduction offer.  A waste of $10.</li>
    <li> How much can you really say about a shaving gel? Let&#x27;s see… It provides a nice lather with little effort and has a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; feel to it (like many other gels). In regard to it being for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; as the packaging states, I&#x27;m not really quite sure what makes a shaving gel for sensitive skin or not, as I have used other types of shaving gels/creams that do not say for sensitive skin and they worked just as well — with no noticeable difference. In my opinion, just seems to be a bit of marketing involved. Overall, it has continuously does the job well and I have been using this specific shaving gel for many years now. The price is also reasonable along the lines of other brands with similar popularity, but of course there is cheaper…</li>
    <li> great deal, I will reorder and tell my friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Edge Fragrance-Free for a number of years.  It was a great product--no fragrance, no odor.  Now they have the \\&quot;New, Improved\\&quot;.  The only thing new that I can detect that is new is a strong chemical odor.  They should have followed the old adage, \\&quot; if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;.  Unfortunately, I am now a former customer.</li>
    <li> I have used Edge for years.  Now it doesn&#x27;t lubricate the skin as well.  Also at least one can of the six had air bubbles in it which made the gel white instead of the expected aqua color.  This is just my opinion but looks like Edge is trying to increase profit by cutting quality.  Too bad, it was a great product.</li>
    <li> I got a six pack recently switch over from Gillette Fusion hydra gel, and the comparison is clear.&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion gel builds up better and hold more cleanly then the Edge gel. Half way through the shave, the Edge gel foam has collapsed making for a thin layer as compared to Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line try before getting a six pack. I&#x27;d definitely recommend Gillette Fusion too but I think you should try to see which works better for you</li>
    <li> My husband has used Edge Sensitive Skin Shave Gel for years.  Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save price is comparable to other sources, but you need not leave home to shop.</li>
    <li> Edge constantly produces quality shave cream.  It come out in a gel, but turns into foam.  My husband loves this product &amp; he has sensitive skin, it sooths &amp; gives him a great shave..</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite gel. It goes a long way and is very soothing to his sensitive skin. Makes shaving a breeze for him. We received bonus cans with 20% more in them so that made the purchase even better. Will buy again, but these six cans are going to last awhile. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> Exceptional product.  I have extra-sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts, so this is what I use.  Purchased in bulk to get the extra savings...why not, you gotta shave anyway---</li>
    <li> Awesome product....Exactly as I was looking for &amp; expected.</li>
    <li> very happy with my purchase, recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Edge shave gel, ever since I tried it in college.  It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t have excessive foam that inevitably ends up all over my clothes.  The super saving pack will serve me for a while, and probably came at a cost of a single container at my local Walgreens.</li>
    <li> It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.</li>
    <li> This is about the only shaving cream I can use. I have very sensitive skin, and get constant shaving bumps, and it seems all other gels except Aveeno cause me grief, but at the price, this can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaving gel for folks with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since 1970 and have had no reason to change.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes shaving so much easier!!!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer heading into this review: i&#x27;m prone to nostalgia and Edge is the brand my parents bought me when i first started shaving in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I evaluate shaving gels based on six criteria:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use: A little bit of gel lathers up to cover pretty well.  Doesn&#x27;t need any \\&quot;touching up\\&quot; during the shave, which i&#x27;ve HEARD can happen with others, like Barbasol.  I bet a can would last a month even shaving every day, but don&#x27;t know for sure yet.  Rinses off easily.  Only spray a little into your hand, it comes out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cuts/Nicks: I tend to have one or two very small cuts per shave with this, which corresponds with pre-existing bumps so i&#x27;m not surprised.  Bleeding is so minimal i don&#x27;t need to do anything about it, usually the only really visible blood is on the cream in the razor after the pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Razor Burn: None that i&#x27;ve noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Closeness: One or two days until stubble is noticeable at a distance.  After the shave, passing my hand with the grain feels baby smooth, passing against the grain i can feel a little roughness.  This is ideal for me.  It can be hard to get this close on my neck, but it could be my technique or the razor and not the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smell: Here&#x27;s where nostalgia may set in, i like the smell of Edge shaving gel.  It&#x27;s not a strong odor and wears off fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Impact on Razor: By this i mean how clogging/messy it is on the razor.  A strong blast of hot water and using a toothbrush a bit is needed to clean off the blades at the end, with some hot water during the shave.</li>
    <li> My husband is alway running ou and I purchased the 6 so he would have them on hand.  I am handy capped and not able to shop for him.</li>
    <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
    <li> it is my favorite brand of shaving cream it cools your skin and makes shaving very pleasant</li>
    <li> Great product. Thanks for having this great shaving gel.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion for folks with sensitive skin, I use it every other day and my face feels great.  Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Why does it seam like you always run out of shaving cream while you are in the shower? I buy the 6 pack because it is more cost effective and I&#x27;m not running out. I like the edge it is a good product.</li>
    <li> My husband was thrilled to have all these available. He runs out and I forget to buy it, so this was great.</li>
    <li> Fantastic price for these, saved me from having to drive to the bulk store for this type of deal. These are a little on the small size so it&#x27;s perfect for fitting into a to go bag or a small bathroom.</li>
    <li> Item is easy to order online than going to a big box store.  Good quality and no issues, arrives right to the front stoop.  Buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> This Edge gel works great and the price was very good when I bought these.  I shave my head and face and this gel goes a long way.  I bought a pack of six of these and still have five left.  I just discarded my first one and started using another one.  The six of these may last me all year.</li>
    <li> There is absolutely no fragrance. I don&#x27;t know what the other people are talking about. And my first can (at least) works perfectly. Maybe I&#x27;m the lucky ones or maybe it&#x27;s been reformulated.  But it&#x27;s a great buy and a fine product.</li>
    <li> Been using Edge shaving cream for years. Gel much more comfortable than cream Great price on a 6 pack of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Nice to buy in volume; beats the prices at the local stores and will last for awhile.  Would buy this item again.</li>
    <li> I have used edge before but couldn&#x27;t find it at SAMs Club. It is a smooth shave cream that I have used for years.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly and as promised</li>
    <li> NO ODOR.  Just like you buy in the store.  Great price!</li>
    <li> its what i needed and more i love the product and they way it came packaged to the way the product gives me a smooth shave</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Easy to use and smooth on the skin this is quality shaving gel. A good product!</li>
    <li> The shave gel arrived on time, undamaged and clean. There was no issue with the product but I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the can size. I normally order the larger can 9.5 ozs.  This can is the smaller 7 oz size so the price was not as great as it seemed.</li>
    <li> I find this to be the best product of it&#x27;s type (gel) on the market. This was a good price so I ordered 6 and I am set for awhile</li>
    <li> Very good product, lasts a long time and the price was right....... leaves skin soft and I use as well as my husband......... mild scent.......... quality item..........</li>
    <li> I have had excellent results with this product.</li>
    <li> The product itself is basic but what I love is the fact that the the metal of the can is of great quality and does not rust in the shower. Other brands have but this one is awesome.</li>
    <li> Used to buy Edge at Costco but they changed to Gillette.  It was OK but I noticed the can always seemed to run out sooner.  Then I noticed the empty can always seemed to have some left but couldn&#x27;t get it out without waiting for 5 min holding the button down.  Bought a can of Edge for my travel kit and what a difference!  The can seemed to last a lot longer and I travel a LOT.  I used a lot less at a time and it was always a richer feeling gel with a better shave.  I&#x27;m back to Edge and still using the original can after more than a month!</li>
    <li> Just fine, thank you.</li>
    <li> I just used up the last of the older Edge For Sensitive and opened a can of the so called new and improved version. I can definitely say that the new version is not fragrance free. I can smell the eucalyptus oil enough that it burns my nostrils. When will companies learn they shouldn&#x27;t change a successful product? Looks like I will have to find another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It looks like the manufacturer got the message. I was in a big box store the other day and noticed a bunch of can&#x27;s that said Original Formula on them with a copyright date of 2013. Reading the ingredients it did appear to be the original formula.</li>
    <li> Good stuff for the money.</li>
    <li> Seller was fine.  Deal was fine.  But this regular Edge leaves a bit to be desired in regards to a good shave gel.  The more upscale versions work better, and provide a better shave with less skin irritation.</li>
    <li> This is the exact shave cream I&#x27;ve used for many years, but I saved money by buying a 6 pack from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Standard shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price and comes in a six-back, probably enough to last a year. I love Edge brand gel for wet/dry shaving. I wet shave with my electric shaver (previously Norelco rotary blade shaver) and now my new Panasonic shaver. It works super well at providing the lube for shaving without getting skin rash or irritation. Getting a 6-pak for a great price just means I don&#x27;t have to shop for this for a long while.</li>
    <li> Staple products at value price</li>
    <li> this is not quality edge, it has air bubbles and turns white before you rub it on. I will not buy  this product from amazon again. Sometimes are better bought at drug store.</li>
