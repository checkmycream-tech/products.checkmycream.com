      <li>Would recommend .&amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>Nice little nippers.</li>
      <li>I received 3 nippers for only  $1.78 and free shipping.  </li>
      <li>Not fully stainless steal so will rust with time but</li>
      <li>I do a lot of nail art and they are perfect for cutting striping tape, etc.  </li>

      <li>They arrived fairly quickly and are working properly.</li>

      <li>These Nippers are shipped direct from Hong Kong, but come in a package marked \\&quot;Solingen</li>
      <li>They are not sharp at all.</li>
      <li>It is not sharp at all.</li>
      <li>These are inexpensively made and probably won&#x27;t last as long as my originals, but hey for less than a buck I think they&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
      <li>These clippers are not sharp enough to trim cuticles.  </li>
      <li>It does feel a little less substantial in the hand vs the Revlon or other drugstore brands, but they are super sharp, does what it&#x27;s intended for, cuts cuticles cleanly, and have lasted over 6 months for me so far.  </li>
      <li>Work very well an sharp too!</li>

<li> A little too &amp;#34;hardy&amp;#34; should be more delicate for cuticles, as I am using the old ones, unfortunately hard to find these.</li>
<li> The jaws are not thinned out so it is difficult to make precise nips.</li>
<li> i got them 3 weeks earlier than expected</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t have the same experience other reviewers had with misalignment.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t expect much , but these are Very dull nippers.</li>
<li> Not strong enough for toenails.</li>
<li> Sharp and aligned.  </li>
<li> The sharp edges didn&#x27;t even close in together</li>
<li> Nevertheless, they seem well made and very sharp.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> i just dont like the size i find it too small.</li>
<li> Ordered two, neither one had the edges properly ground or aligned, making them useless.</li>
<li> The inner hing doesn&#x27;t stay connected, useless garbage.</li>

<li> Since cuticle trimming is their only purpose, they are useless.  </li>
<li> Nippers arrived dull and unusable.  </li>
<li> It is very small, so it is hard to handle.</li>
<li> Not good at all.</li>
<li> I needed a bigger one and was horribly disappointed when it came.</li>
<li> Very dull blade.</li>
<li> These cuticle clippers work as well as the expensive ones at a fraction of the cost.</li>
<li> Five out of five were misaligned and unable to clip anything.</li>
<li> It just kept ripping my cuticles rather than cutting them.</li>
<li> They quict cutting after o my a couple of week.</li>
<li> Pulls cuticle skin rather than cutting it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that bad</li>
<li> My advice to prospective buyers:  you won&#x27;t save any money by buying these inexpensive, but worthless cuticle trimmers.  </li>
<li> Horrible quality.</li>
<li> Worst purchase ever.</li>
<li> Piece of crap!</li>
<li> This thing is terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A little too &amp;#34;hardy&amp;#34; should be more delicate for cuticles, as I am using the old ones, unfortunately hard to find these.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  Sharp and aligned.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are way better than any of the ones that ive paid three times more for at a brick &amp; mortar store. These were an amazing low price and qquality. Im very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, Thank you</li>
    <li> great stuff for the price... will cut anything</li>
    <li> Open the package n try them n it does not work, want a refund</li>
    <li> These clippers are not sharp enough to trim cuticles.  Since cuticle trimming is their only purpose, they are useless.  I would like to return them for a refund, but doing so will require that I pay for their return shipping to China.  Since returning them will cost more than I paid for them, I&#x27;m obviously not going to do that.  My advice to prospective buyers:  you won&#x27;t save any money by buying these inexpensive, but worthless cuticle trimmers.  Buy another pair instead.</li>
    <li> Ordered two, neither one had the edges properly ground or aligned, making them useless. Finish was good except where the edges were ground.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth returning.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Very sharp n easy to use</li>
    <li> Good product. No comments either way.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed......</li>
    <li> It does feel a little less substantial in the hand vs the Revlon or other drugstore brands, but they are super sharp, does what it&#x27;s intended for, cuts cuticles cleanly, and have lasted over 6 months for me so far.  At this price, even if it breaks after 1 yr I&#x27;d reorder this one again.</li>
    <li> Lasted about a month before the middle broke off</li>
    <li> For everyday clippers these work great for me.  I didn&#x27;t have the same experience other reviewers had with misalignment.  Only negative is the shipping time took a bit but the price and the product were great for me.</li>
    <li> These Nippers are shipped direct from Hong Kong, but come in a package marked \\&quot;Solingen Germany\\&quot; - not the item itself, but the cardboard backing of the packaging.  Some German printing on the package too.  Somehow I think they came from China.  Nevertheless, they seem well made and very sharp.  Well worth the under three dollar cost. Note: these were sold by \\&quot;More Things\\&quot;, not the current listed supplier.</li>
    <li> Maybe i get what i pay for. It&#x27;s not that bad i just dont like the size i find it too small.</li>
    <li> Sure look like the real thing! I don&#x27;t know but they work terrific! I will see  if they last but for now I love them</li>
    <li> First time using it.&lt;br /&gt;This Clipper does a neat job. Nice value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this clipper to others.</li>
    <li> This Cuticle Nippers, Works very well and last longer, and they arrived pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Very good cuticle nippers...will buy more !</li>
    <li> This thing is terrible. It is very small, so it is hard to handle. It is not sharp at all. Do not buy.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality. The sharp edges didn&#x27;t even close in together and you can see the gap.</li>
    <li> They quict cutting after o my a couple of week. They are not sharp at all.</li>
    <li> Not fully stainless steal so will rust with time but all on all good for the price.</li>
    <li> These were very inexpensive and I was a bit leery of buying them.  But, all in all, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase  I received 3 nippers for only  $1.78 and free shipping.  The seller was Only Shop and the nippers were shipped from China.  These work as well as nippers I paid almost $15.00 for.  These are inexpensively made and probably won&#x27;t last as long as my originals, but hey for less than a buck I think they&#x27;ll work just fine.</li>
    <li> Piece of crap! Flimsy. Fell apart right away!</li>
    <li> These are fine for cuticle nippers.  Not strong enough for toenails. I got several because they were inexpensive - that way  can have one in my desk, in the bathroom and also in my purse.</li>
    <li> Tiny. I couldn&#x27;t tell how small it is in the picture. I needed a bigger one and was horribly disappointed when it came.</li>
    <li> Work very well an sharp too! Came very quick for delivery as well. Thnx. Would recommend .&amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> The jaws are not thinned out so it is difficult to make precise nips. I would say that these are to be used as practice nippers for tech that are still in school.</li>
    <li> i got them 3 weeks earlier than expected and im excited lol</li>
    <li> This work well and are multipurpose</li>
    <li> Price is right, but the cut was uneven so mostly unusable.</li>
    <li> Nice little nippers. V type spring keeps them close together great for clipping nails. Would have liked then a bit sharper. Overal good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much , but these are Very dull nippers. Very cheap, but What can you expect for the price?</li>
    <li> Actually better than what I expected thanks :-)</li>
    <li> Definitely a cheap brand. The price was OK I guess.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, and incredibly cheap</li>
    <li> These clippers are cheap for a reason.Five out of five were misaligned and unable to clip anything. The inner hing doesn&#x27;t stay connected, useless garbage. Spend a little more, there&#x27;s no bargain here.</li>
    <li> Very dull blade. Pulls cuticle skin rather than cutting it.</li>
    <li> Nippers arrived dull and unusable.  DO NOT BUY THESE.</li>
    <li> Excellent for the price I paid.</li>
    <li> Work great. Thank you</li>
    <li> Good delivery Great Price</li>
    <li> I do a lot of nail art and they are perfect for cutting striping tape, etc.  will order again if needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 clippers.  They are sharp but on one the blades did not evenly touch along the edge making it hard to nip fine things.  The second one had problems with the spring brace in the middle staying aligned.  Workable but a nuisance.  You get what you pay for,.</li>
    <li> The product came faster than it said but my only problem is that mine don&#x27;t work because the blades don&#x27;t line up and it doesn&#x27;t catch the cuticle.</li>
    <li> These cuticle clippers work as well as the expensive ones at a fraction of the cost. They arrived fairly quickly and are working properly.</li>
    <li> These work great. Nice addition to my overflow of nail supplies</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Really good product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Worst purchase ever. The item appeared to be used as the packaging it came in was stapled back together. I sanitized it when I opened it. Figured for the price I paid, seemed legit that it would be used despite the description not saying that. It just kept ripping my cuticles rather than cutting them. Not good at all. And to avoid someone else getting the same thing if I returned them, I just tossed them in the trash. This falls into the &amp;#34;you get what you paid for&amp;#34; products. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Good quality. very cheap I&#x27;m happy.</li>
