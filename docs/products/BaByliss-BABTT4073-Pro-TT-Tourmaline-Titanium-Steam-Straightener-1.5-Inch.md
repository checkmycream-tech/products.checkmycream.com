<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I recieved this product for christmas last year and my daughter loves it so much she practically stole it. She has very curly frizzy hair and it take half the time for her to straiten and it makes her hair shinny and silky. I bought this one as a present for her since she loves it so much.&lt;br /&gt;TOOOOO bad this one doesnt work. The steam on this new one doesnt work at all :( Really sucks cause now it&#x27;s been way to long since I purchased and I dont know if they will replace this item. I will probably buy another one but I am not very happy, guess I should have taken the gift out of the box and checked to make sure it worked when I recieved it.</li>
    <li> It was a long time that I was looking for a steam hair iron, it&#x27;s really amazing, less damage, faster result and reasonable price</li>
    <li> I was very unsure of what to expect from a steam straightener but now after trying this product I have to say it is AWESOME!!! I am African- American and have coily, kinky, curly, bouncy , fluffy, red-fraggle hair.  This iron can flatten all of my bushy fluff in one pass.  The comb feature rocks and I really didn&#x27;t expect it to make a difference. I&#x27;m like WHOA about this tool.  The water is easy to put in and the iron becomes hot in about one second after hitting the power button.  The steam really does come out and smooth the hair.  I feel like I went to the salon but without the dryness.  My hair is sleek, moist and has a brilliant shine coming from it.  I am enjoying this healthy look to the max.  As far as the temperature  dial , I put mine on 35-40 and it did wonders.  I really like that the plates are really long as well as wide making it very easy for me to do large sections.  I love this product.  This is by far the best straightener I have ever encountered in my WHOLE life. It comes with a mat,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the straightener for a few days, but it is great! So easy to use, I&#x27;ve always had problems with others crimping my hair at roots or ends. No problem with this tool. Works great with or without the steam. Best straightener I ever had and it beats Chi any day.</li>
    <li> Was using a remington wet to straight flat iron before. That was a 45 minute production involving a very comfortable seat, calluses in my thumb, a trash can for the dropped hair and several scrunchies for sectioning. I have indian, waist-long, thick, wiry, unruly, wavy, dry hair. Bought the babyliss because of the reviews and I was desperate to stop wasting 45 minutes every time I shampooed. Same night I got the babyliss I decided to just do 2 passes  in one small section since several of the reviews had said it straightened in one pass. It worked! Im in love! It worked so well that I did two more passes in another small section and before I knew it, 20 minutes had passed and my whole head was straight! And I had just been standing in front the mirror and never even sectioned my hair! And there was no droppage! 20 minutes! I LOVE it! I love the steam feature (whole head was done on a single fill of the reservoir), love the retractable comb. I did my hair on 38 heat with high steam and high comb and no burns! (Just be careful the steam coming off your hair doesn&#x27;t hit ur skin). Thank you babyliss!</li>
    <li> Purchased for daughter for Christmas after she loved it when our hairdresser used it on her. Her hair had been severely damaged by T&amp;G when she was used for a photo shoot. This helps let he style her hair and not damage it as with the dry product. Her sister was so impressed that she purchased one for herself. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just used my new steam flat iron. I love it. So FAST- 1 pass on my hair and it was straight- curls and waves gone. I have been using high quality flat irons for many years and so far this is the best. I am replacing the Titanium Nano that I purchased a year or so ago, because I thought it got too hot and the shiny plates were burning my hair, and had hair falling out as I used it. I only had 3 strands come out with this one. Used the steam ( which is optional use) and the the optional comb teeth on it-  No pulling, no burning- soft and shiny AND NOT TOO flat. Have some body left in my hair- not plastered to my head.  I was worried with curly hair that instantly reacts to humidity that this steam flat iron would frizz my hair. Not so. Cord very long and swivels, iron comfortable in hand, Even comes with a silicon pad to rest the iron on in between passes- I love this, won&#x27;t burn my counter and don;t have to hunt for something to protect it.  This is a great price, too. I am going to order one for my niece for the holidays and give my old, expensive babyliss titanium nano flat iron to Goodwill.   Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry. Arrived quickly too.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this straightener.  She said to protect your hair, it is very important to have the addition of steam when straightening your hair.  My hair is almost straight so I use it just a bit but I can imagine how important this would be if your hair was curly!  I highly recommend this as it is easy to use and works well.  It is probably the best available.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find a straightener that wasn&#x27;t going to damage my hair or break my bank.  This straightener is AMAZING!!! It got my hair straight with only one pass.  It felt sooo soft and look soo shiny! This is what I have been searching for.  I had a Chi and a Babyliss Titanium Pro before and they either burnt my hair or took forever to straighten.  Not anymore! It used to take me 45 minutes or more to straighten my hair, now it only takes me 25 to 30.  If you are an African American with thick natural hair this is a must have! My hair is medium length, natural, and really thick.  People think I have a relaxer after using this, but I never use chemical on my hair.  A++++</li>
    <li> These are by far the best straight irons I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I&#x27;ve paid over $100 for other flat irons and they don&#x27;t even compare. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> The only problem with this straightener is that my hair, every once in a while, gets caught between the rubber pieces that release the steam. This rarely happens though and it works great. It takes no time at all to straighten my hair now. It came brand new in the box with all that it said it would come with. I recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> One of my sisters who already owns this loves it. She has ridiculously frizzy and curly hair (I&#x27;m not exaggerating), and it keeps her hair straight with ease. And apparently it doesn&#x27;t damage her hair like other straighteners. So the awesome brother that I am I bought my other sister one of these too for Christmas since she raved about the straightener when she used the one my other sister already had. We are all in college so it made sense both of them have their own instead of using the same one when we get together on holidays.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast. Was missing the DVD, but I didn&#x27;t care, b/c anyone could figure out how to use it. Follow the manual for the heat setting. Was skeptical at first. I have very thick, coarse hair and bad experiences w/ flat irons - they dry out my hair. What used to take me 30 min.+, now takes me about 10-15 min. - NO joke! I have been using this iron daily for the past month and my hair is soft and STRAIGHT. The steam seems to help keep hair soft. I have to refill the container before every use, but who cares - it works! I absolutely love this iron! This one&#x27;s a WINNER!!</li>
    <li> I am a caucasion female with very curly medium length hair. I have lost count of the number of straighteners I have tried over the years (including the chi) on my hair. This straightner is by far the best one I have ever used!! My hair is silky straight in about 20 minutes and stays straight all day. I will never use another brand of straightener again!</li>
    <li> I searched all the hair straighteners within my price range before deciding to go for this one. I am delighted with my purchase. It&#x27;s easy to use and I love the variable heat settings. It glides smoothly through my hair and doesn&#x27;t pull or break it at all. I would definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Great product. After trying very expensive Solia, Chi straightening irons with so-so results, I decided to try this steam straightener. I have fine, very dry, and very wavy hair that has a hard time getting that shiny smooth look. I can finally get the shiny smooth look with this steam straigthener. It gives your hair some moisture and humidity so that it doesn&#x27;t look fried from other irons.    The water chamber is a little frustrating to fill and it takes awhile to fill up. But I get a good 3-4 full head applications with it. I used distilled water to keep my investment from plugging up with mineral buildup.</li>
    <li> It does not work at once, twice or even thrice. I am not comfortable to run this over my hairs again and again so I am not sure how long it will take to really straighten my hairs. I am having normal hairs and whatever little effect it shows, it shows only at the highest temperature.     Water compartment is not very convinient for draining or refill.    I am giving it a 2* only for the price I paid but whatever price I pay, it will always be more if it does not do what it is meant for.</li>
    <li> Great way to straighten your hair without damage. The steam also adds shine and actually helps shorten the entire straightening process.</li>
    <li> This straightening iron is really good.  I thought it was the smaller one, but it turned out to be just as good.  The comb is in the middle instead of on the outside.  It works for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this straightener! The quality is definitely top notch! I have curly/wavy hair and this flat iron helps tame it. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results before my eyes. One swipe and that section of hair is straight! This is relieving for a person with natural curly hair. The steam actually helps it stay straighter longer. I like how it gives you guidelines on what degree for what type of hair. This flat iron is amazing! Best $70 well spent. Another thing I liked about it was how it came with a rubber heat pad so it doesn&#x27;t burn the counter! I give this straightener a 10/10!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and really love the steam function. The &amp;#34;instruction video&amp;#34; is just a 3 min. ad for the product and is not worth watching as it doesn&#x27;t give any tutorial on how to use it.</li>
    <li> LET&#x27;S JUST SAY THAT THIS BABYLISS STEAM FLAT IRON IS ON THE HIGHER END IN COMPARISON TO SOMETHING LIKE A CONAIR. I ALWAYS BELIEVE IN GETTING YOUR MONEYS WORTH AND SO I DECIDED TO PUT THEM BOTH TO THE TEST.  I HAVE TO SAY THAT I&#x27;M NOT SURE WHO COPIED WHO FIRST BUT BOTH PRODUCTS AND THEIR FEATURES RESEMBLE EACH OTHER AT FIRST GLANCE.  LONG STORY SHORT, SURPRISINGLY CONAIR DID BETTER THAN BABYLISS.  BABYLISS DID WHAT IT NEEDED TO DO BUT LEFT MY HAIR FEELING HARD AND NOT SMOOTH AT ALL.  THAT IS THE MAIN REASON I RETURNED IT.  CONAIR&#x27;S STEAM IRON LEFT THE HAIR SOFT AND SHINY.  THE REASON FOR ME LOOKING INTO STEAM FLAT IRONS IS TO MAINTAIN A SOMEWHAT HEALTHY LOOK OF HAIR.  BABYLISS JUST IN RESULTS HAD ME QUESTIONING ALL THAT.</li>
    <li> Best hair product I ever purchased!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at the quality of this product!&lt;br /&gt;my wife has tried many different straightener but this device is different, is great!&lt;br /&gt;I think my wife has lost her strong curls  forever!&lt;br /&gt;when she washes her hair, the curls do not come back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I insist that this straightener is amazing! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. It leaks and does not do any more than a regular flat iron...I want my money back!!!</li>
    <li> This straightener works wonders on my dark curly hair. I love how it doesn&#x27;t take half the time I used to spend on straightening my hair. The only thing that irks me is the fact that if you have any sticky hair product on your hands when you hold it, all of it just transfers onto the straightener and STAYS ON ! I hate that, but am trying to find a way to get rid of it and keep it clean. Not sure how much good the steam is doing to my hair as the split end saga continues !&lt;br /&gt;Apart from that and the not-so-great smell as I fry my hair, it is a very, very good flat iron. It does what it is supposed to do: get my hair really, really straight.</li>
    <li> My hair is so thick. And pass my shoulders. This thing! THIS flat iron. Aaaaaaa mazing!!! Yes, never had I worn my natural hair so much. Weave was so convince. Easy to manage. Now, I can get my own hair luxious looking. Just by washing, dying and straighting. @MechelleHeart loving it. 5 stars all the way around. P.s. the letters on the top of the iron may come off. When iron is to hot. My did. Other than that had it since March 12, 2012 !!!</li>
    <li> Yes, it has steam, but my Sedu straightener works much better and I seem to have less fuzzies with it.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have never settled into the correct combination of products and tools for my fine, slightly wavy, course hair.  Shampoos, boars hair brushes, smoothing products and curling/flat irons.  I&#x27;ve read lots of reviews and finally picked this iron to try \\&quot;one more time\\&quot;.  Admittedly I have only used it once so far straight out of the box and today when I got my day started, my hair did need some additional styling, but the smoothness is still there after sleep and 12 hours passing since using the iron...I have to say, it&#x27;s the closest thing to when my stylist does her thing and I do like the steam option as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to log on and add additional praise now that I&#x27;ve had this wonderful iron for almost a month.  I continue to be amazed at how wonderful this iron performs and how my hair responds.  Every day I receive compliments from folks that know me and even people that have no idea I have a new \\&quot;do\\&quot;.  The other day the teller at the bank asked me what salon I go to for my professional blow-outs/treatments.  Wow!  I recommend this iron to any and all customers looking for a great solution to beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> This product was the best as compared to a JOICO which has a massive design flaw that causes it to short out after little use.   Also you use plain water instead of buying hair liquid to fill the unit.  I wish i would have found this first instead of the more expensive JOICO - i would have saved over $100.00  Written by my wife.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a hair saver. It gets the hair extremely silky and soft w/o needing products. Just use on freshly washed hair &amp; hair becomes smooth&amp; bouncy. Its not as damaging as regular flat irons and lasts alot longer. Couldn&#x27;t believe how good it straighten my roots b/c I&#x27;m natural.the steam can get really hot though but I haven&#x27;t seen damage even on the highest setting. I&#x27;m in love w/ this iron and might be selling my other ones b/c this is all I need, Excellent iron &amp; gets the job done in half the time.</li>
    <li> The flat iron really is as good as the reviews say and gets your hair straight quick with a awesome finish... However, just like the reviews say, the steam doesn&#x27;t work. I am returning it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter with curly hair and she straightens her hair every day.  When she used it the first time she told me she wanted to marry it, that is was amazing and worked very well and half the time she use to take to straighten her hair.  She still says it a month later.  This was recommended by our hair stylist that had previously used the Chi.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002NGMEVM BaByliss BABTT4073 Pro TT  Tourmaline Titanium Steam Straightener, 1.5 Inch]]....buy this product for a gift, then that was used for half an hour was damaged, I think it&#x27;s very bad quality, I think I lost my money on that. But good and evil is done.</li>
    <li> I just received my BaByliss last night and had to try it immediately. I have long ,wavy, course hair that is hard to straighten,and it did wonderfully! I am very satisfied with this iron and the steam feature. The part that I thought I probably wouldn&#x27;t like was the comb, but turns out that it is my favorite feature!!</li>
    <li> I dont know if mine was just bad, but I have used maxiglide and steam is great this one no. Not all the holes worked and no steam just pushing out water. It was new in box. So have to wonder if it just dont work right at all.</li>
    <li> Works well. I like the steam aspect and it leaves my hair feeling really smooth. Sometimes it pulls my hair while straightening. Just need to make sure when straightening that hair stays towards the end of the straightener so it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product on 1-19-10 and as of today, 2-25-10, the product has never arrived.  I am still waiting on my refund.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Babyliss Pro TT 1 1/2\\&quot; Steam Straightener on my transitioning African-American hair. I&#x27;m going natural but don&#x27;t want to big-chop. I find that when I&#x27;m not wearing a protective style and want to wear my hair out, keeping the same texture between my natural and relaxed hair is the best way to prevent breakage at the demarcation line, and this flat iron does the job with great results. I have a mix of hair types and use a setting of 5 (~265 degrees F) on my 3C hair and a setting of 10 (~280 degrees F) on my 4A hair to get relaxer-like straightness, without going bone-straight. I&#x27;m sure a slightly higher temp will easily give bone-straight hair -- temps go up to 465 degrees F at setting 40. I haven&#x27;t seen any breakage so far and am maintaining length (BSL). I attribute that to the steam providing needed moisture and to the low settings. I do blow dry my natural roots first using a ceramic dryer on the lowest temperature. This keeps me from needing higher temps when I flat iron, as opposed to air-drying and then using the flat iron. The iron is smooth, no snagging of hair at all. I don&#x27;t use the retractable teeth since I deep condition &amp; detangle before blow-drying and ironing, and use a heat protectant. The steam function seems to work best when the iron is angled vertically, iron end down. Reversion is minimal unless my hair gets wet. I think I&#x27;d cave in to the creamy crack during this transition if not for this flat iron&#x27;s ability to turn three hair textures (relaxed, natural 3C, natural 4A) into one, without damaging my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently got this, like this week. I love it, I have thick hair and it&#x27;s very long, and curly and wavy. I had been using a chi and never experienced a good straight look because it would never last!!!! This straightner is also awesome because of its temperature it rises to. It is great for thick hair when it gets that hot. Be very careful with it, I would recommend getting heat resistent gloves for this one, and more so if you curl your hair with it so you can touch the straightener in areas and it wont hurt you. I love love love love love this, and I got compliments on my hair!! haha people were actually like wow your hair looks really pretty today, more than usual. It is this lovely piece of technology! LOVE it, get it, yes, get it!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great! It heats up really fast and has a dial so you can choose your temp settings. The steam comes out auotmatically (with my old one, you had to press a button every time). It takes me a very short amount of time to straighten my hair and my hair feels really soft when I&#x27;m done even without any styling products.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my flat iron because I&#x27;ve heard this brand is very good especially for naturals with kinky textured hair. I&#x27;ve only used it once and I&#x27;m not blown away yet becuz my hair started getting fuzzy and reverted after 1 day of flat ironing. The manual does tell u what temperature setting to use depending on whether u have fine hair, wavy hair, course hair etc. and I thought I had chosen the one that fit my hair best but apparently I was wrong. So maybe I just need to review the temperature setting for better results next time.</li>
    <li> Hello everyone!  I love this babyliss pro tt steam straightener! It works very well on curly hair like 3a-4a. I have enjoyed using it, my hair is straighter then when I used the Instyler. For me it&#x27;s one of the best straightener I have ever used. Be careful when refilling the water reservoir because it can break easily if your not careful. But it comes with two so you have backup. I LOVE IT &amp; I HOPE YOU DO TOO! :)</li>
    <li> The water runs out fast but I like the teeth and how it separates my hair (of course you still have to brush your hair though) It&#x27;s cuts the straightening down some. Thanks babybliss</li>
    <li> This straightener is great! I have extremely thick long hair that has a natural wave to it. It usually takes me a good 45 minutes to blow dry and straighten my hair. This straightener has cut down that time significantly! And I love the silicone pad it came with cause the outside of the straightener does seem to get a little warm. I do have one minor complaint. There is a ridge in the top plate so you have room for the detangling fins that pop up and sometimes if I leave it on one spot to long it will make a line in your hair where the ridge is. I can usually brush it out or just run the straightener over it one more time. Other than that this is definitly the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever had. It seems to leave my hair with a little more body also. It was a little pricey for me but definitly worth the money!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed...no steam ....as was advertised. Would not recommend to anyone.  Very disappointed . Watched the video, used distiller water still did not perform as was advertised.</li>
    <li> Words cannot express how much I love this flat iron.  After using flat irons that burned my hair, even with heat protection spray, I thought I would opt for more expensive ones.  I looked around and BaByliss was recommened as well as Chi, but I thought I would try this brand because someone said it was a little easier on the hair.  Also, someone else said to get nano titanium irons because theyre the new ceramic, and tourmaline is good for the hair, so I narrowed it down that way.  I decided to go steam because it sounded interesting, though it also sounded counterproductive to me haha.  I have African American 4c/4b mixed hair, so I thought it might make my hair frizzy, but on the contrary, my hair has never looked better!  I love this flat iron because it moisturizes and it locks it in from the heat.  I also like how the plates air long, so I can grab a lot of hair, and even in one pass they are straight.  I consciously limit myself to one pass because I dont want to damage my hair, but even if I didnt, I wouldnt need the 2nd pass.  The cord is really long, the water compartment loads easily, and all the buttons are well places so Im not turning anything on and off or moving things around.  This flat iron can get very hot, but I only go up to 35 because thats all it takes for my thick unruly African American hair.  Also, I use it without the steam for quick touch ups, which are really few and far between.  So far, Ive only flat ironed my hair twice a week, because theyre not lying when they say with the steam irons, the process lasts 30% longer.  I&#x27;m so happy with this flat iron, I dont see how the chi can do any better, but if I find it does, Id still recommend the steam irons, and specifically, this one!</li>
    <li> I have used several Flat Irons... including the CHI.  The Babyliss is the best I have used.  Love that you can control the amount of heat and steam.  I have really thick hair and the steam helps straighten it with just a few passes.  I always wash my hair at night and let it air dry and then straighten in the AM.  I need a great flatiron to straighten the morning bed head after sleeping on wet hair and this flat iron does a fantastic job!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron. The steam feature is great,it adds moisture and softness to the hair. It has a multitude of heat settings. I like that it can be used with or without the steam and the retractable comb. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is \\&quot;VERY\\&quot; difficult to get the roots with this flat iron and if there is any moisture or oil on your hands it smears the Babyliss name off and that makes it look ugly. Overall it does a good job straightening your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have pretty curly hair and this gets my hair straight quickly. The many heat settings and comb options work great. Don&#x27;t pass up this opportunity !</li>
    <li> I use this straightener every day. For the low price you get it at, it&#x27;s awesome. BaByliss has always been a trusted brand and this keeps that name going. After having it for at least 3 years, I&#x27;ve had no problems with it like I used to have with my Chi. I like how you can change the temperature to give you some customization to it.</li>
    <li> I love it! I can straighten my course thick curly hair pretty quickly, much better than any I have previously owned</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it. It seems to straighten faster with the steam, saves me a lot of time in the morning!</li>
    <li> Being half african american half white, it is difficult to find a straightener that doesnt burn my hair, or dry it out. the BaByliss is amazing!! I recommend this to anyone who has used a chi but needs several temperature buttons.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive my steam staight iron. When I opened the package, the water reservoir was broken, but there was a 2nd one in the box (this must be a common occurance) so I put the spare one on. I have not been able to get the steam to work properly. I read the instructions and watched the video, but have had no luck. I have been trying it for several weeks with no luck. I will be trying to return this product, and hopefully this will not be a problem.</li>
    <li> I have been straightening my hair for about 10 years now and have earned many straight irons. This is by far the BEST I have ever owned or used on my hair. My hair is long and think and I can do my whole head in a little less than 15 minutes. It is just amazing! I have aleady persuaded two my friends to order one, they were also impressed after I used it on their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading the reviews on this straightener for a while and finally decided to make the purchase.  I received my straightener Thursday and tried it right away.  My hair is long, course and has a variety of curl patterns that defy any and all attemps at taming.  Within 45 minutes I had a head of hair that was pin straight, glossy and smooth like silk.  In the last three days I have slept on it, brushed and finger combed, twisted, twirled and tied my hair up with a ponytail holder and it is STILL smooth and shiny.  It works so well and without damage to my hair.  I&#x27;m really really happy with this straightener and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good quality straightener.  I love the level of heat settings and the steam function is really nice.  Also, the retracting comb is a very useful feature too.  It is balanced and doesn&#x27;t tire the wrist, nor did I find the housing to get hot like some straighteners are known to do.  I really like that the iron comes with a silicone pad to put the iron on while you&#x27;re using it, and the bottle to fill the water reservior is a great little bonus as well as the additional water reservior included.  Overall its a great quality item for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Great steam straightener, the only downfall with this product is the small reservoir.  If you have long hair and are using the steam , you have to keep refilling it.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product, I even use it on my HUMAN HAIR hair pieces.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does the job....</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful Maxiglide Hair Straightener user for over 4 years. As much as I love Maxiglide, with 2 broken hair irons &amp; working on a tight budget, I&#x27;d finally had enough. Scanning through reviews here and Folica for something similar, BB seemed a good fit. It had almost the same features like steam &amp; comb, a must have for me. The price here on Amazon sounded too good to be true for what I would normally pay for MG . Now that I have been using BB for over a month &amp; if I were to break it down what got me hooked with Babybliss Vs Maxiglide;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very lightweight (MG is lot heavier on the hand)&lt;br /&gt;glides over hair easily and doesn&#x27;t pull hair with it (MG takes out a lot of hair )&lt;br /&gt;finish styling my long hair halfway down my back under 15 mins (with MG it would take longer because it&#x27;s heavier on the hand &amp; i have to go over several times to perfect it)&lt;br /&gt;ready in seconds, literally (MG flashes blue after a minute or so, not bad)&lt;br /&gt;less split ends (had tons with MG,even with Biosilk)&lt;br /&gt;shinier,smoother hair, lasts longer (frequent touch ups with MG)&lt;br /&gt;retractable comb,constant &amp; tolerable steam (MG needs to switch plates &amp; push button for steam, which i accidentally push &amp; burn myself)&lt;br /&gt;water reservoir is enough for two uses ( with MG I would refill with every use - not a bad feature though)&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean the plates,just wipe it down (MG comb plates gets messy with hair and stuff sticks to the root of the plate, I end up cleaning with a toothbrush.)&lt;br /&gt;costs much less $49.95 with Free S/H (MG is pricey! well over $100 plus shipping for XP model. need I say why I&#x27;m broke?)&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon fluctuate often, I would watch it and buy it at the lowest price for more savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone who&#x27;s been using Maxiglide for years, I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with BB, and would highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find comparable reviews on the two, so I wanted do it myself for someone else. If you were wondering why I took away a star, it gets really hot in seconds, you could feel the heat on your palms with 20-25 setting. so there&#x27;s always room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/24/12&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still very happy with my purchase , I just want to clarify about the retractable COMB feature. If you&#x27;re a Maxiglide user, you&#x27;re probably used to a switchable  comb plate with well defined teeth. Babybliss has a on/off switch which controls the retractable comb function. It does NOT have well defined teeth or narrow pointed teeth  as Maxiglide would but rather a row of round edged&lt;br /&gt;teeth running down middle of the plate. The lack of narrow pointed comb teeth has not been a big issue for me, I still love and use it on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 06/25/13&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a girl blessed with frizz prone hair at the slightest chance of humidity and getting it to behave to my standards especially in texas summer is a challenge itself. I wash hair with any regular (inexpensive) shampoo and follow up with infusium 23 conditioner and let air dry overnight. I would do my hair next morning with BB and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the same hair from the day before. I swear by it. For all the girls who left nice comments, I am just happy to help, thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 05/20/14&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong. A few drops of water escape from the reservoir at times but have had no effect on the overall functionality. Along with the regular use (every other day ), switching to coconut oil &amp; henna color have spared me split ends and a lot less frizz action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02/09/16&lt;br /&gt;after many years of careful regular use, the top plate got loose on one side and dangles when I pick it up. Although it still works just fine,  it now snags hair and so sadly I had to stop using it. waiting for it be in stock and price drop. wondering if I should pursue You Tube&#x27;s DIY repairs with heat resistance glue (JB Weld) in the mean time. keep you guys posted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02/12/16&lt;br /&gt;happy to report it&#x27;s back in business! glue actually held up really well and I see no difference in performance - works like new. phew saved me some money!</li>
    <li> Works great! Hot and fast to style. And it&#x27;s a pretty pearlized color too.  The steam makes all the difference.  A few times in the beginning, the steam function wouldn&#x27;t work until a few passes through the hair, but after several uses it seemed to have sorted itself out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but...I don&#x27;t believe that the item I got is brand new. I believe I got a used flat iron. There was not any packaging of any kind. Just the flat iron throw in a box.</li>
    <li> I believe this product is the best I have tried for achieving a \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; section straightening on very kinky hair. I&#x27;m utterly amazed at the quick heating and durable little retractable separating comb placed within the product.</li>
    <li> tried the product today - it&#x27;s good- not the best but better than the rest. I have purchased 3 other flat irons and this is the best of the group. Came with a dvd, heat mat, and extra water pack- this was a bonus in my eyes. I would endorse this product.</li>
    <li> I have owned a CHI for years, but my hairstylist tried this kind of flat iron on my hair and I just loved it!  I like that it has an option available to adjust the heat setting to fit the needs of your hair.  I also like that it has a little compartment to add water to help \\&quot;steam\\&quot; your hair as it straightening it.  I use this more and more now.  I usually do not have to blow dry my hair; instead I wake up the next morning, after I&#x27;ved washed my hair from the night before, and use the \\&quot;steam\\&quot; to help straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s been a great product!  Everyone in the house fights for this straightener and we have two other CHIs in my household.</li>
    <li> I got this Steam Straightener the same time I got the Babyliss hair dryer. I use it twice already... I love it... it is the best thing that is ever made!!! My hair turned out better than the Paul Mitchell hair straightener. My hair is so soft and I do not have to put it on the highest temperature at all. Everything about this straightener just works great!!! I again read all of your reviews and decided to buy it. I&#x27;m telling all you ladies out there that has very fuzzy hair this is the item for you.</li>
    <li> I have used some of the top brand, must have, to-die-for irons and this one is my favorite, hands down.  It does a great job, usually with just one pass.  Results are super-fast and seem to last longer.  You won&#x27;t be sorry with this one!</li>
    <li> I love babyliss steam straightener it is perfect for thick natural African American hair I&#x27;ve been using it on all my natural hair clients and it&#x27;s been a wonder leaving even the unruly hair straight for up to 3 weeks even those who sweat</li>
    <li> This iron is the best iron i have ever seen! works great and doesnt do much damage to hair. definately would reccomend this iron for anyone who is looking for a good iron!!</li>
    <li> Love it. My hair Stays straighten all day long and is in great shape. The idea of y swing humidity is great cause your hair leéis shining al the time!!</li>
    <li> I bought this BaByliss steam straightener because I had purchased the same brand of hair dryer on Amazon and I absolutely love it. I was not disappointed. It really is special: doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, gives me the option of steam or no steam, comb out or retracted, and it just leaves my hair looking more silky than other straighteners have done. That may be partly because I use the awesome BaByliss  hair dryer first, but they are both great products.</li>
    <li> These are the best flat irons on the market!  If you are a professional stylist, you will have to keep filling the reserve with water for each client.  These irons will replace  your curling irons and flat irons.</li>
    <li> A must have. I used to use a maxiglide but this is way better!!I have natrual AA hair and my hair came out relaxer straight with this iron. My hair stays straight for over a week as long as I dont wet it. The only thing is the steam chamber wont stay on anymore. I think its because I took it off when it was still hot .</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had! Wes up quickly and the steam feature is helping my hair not turn out so dry when using it. A great product!</li>
    <li> This flat iron gets your hair soo pin striaght it could almost be a bad thing for some people! i like my hair pin striaght but if you like a lot of body this is probably not for you! in my case, i love it. Ive been a hair stylist for over 10 years and this is the best flat iron i have ever used! ive never seen my hair as straight as it is right now ( this is the first time ive used it) . another thing is, the steam really does make your hair soft and not dry and brittle feeling like most flat irons do. i wouldnt recomment this for anything other than straightening, like waves or curls tho cuz it has flat plates. overall, i love it, if you have coarse or very curly hair, or even fine hair, and like it very striaght very quick, try this flat iron!!</li>
    <li> I want to love this steam iron. It makes my hair look amazing, not even my $150 chi made my hair look this well-styled and still healthy looking. But it also stinks like a clothes iron when I use the steam (which is every time i straighten) and it also makes this weird fan noise...I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t have a defective product? It does make my hair look great though, so **** is well deserved.</li>
    <li> After my strightening iron I had for 4 years broke  I was desperate to find a nicer, better iron. When i recieved  my babyliss I was very excited and used it the first day. My hair was soooo soft but i had to iron it every couple hours or it would start to become wavy again. The next day I went to use it again and every time I would clamp it shut the power would turn off.For someone that straightens their hair every day it was very upsetting that I had to return it and wait even longer in order to recieve my cash back and to get a new iron.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron the best one I have ever used.  Only bad part it broke the 2 month I had it.  The power button will not work anymore. I contacted the manufactor and they are going to replace it at no cost.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the suggestion of my hairdresser.  When I found it at a great price on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  It does a good job. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to work this way, but when I use the steam option, I seem to get rid of the frizz, but not the slight wave in my hair.  I like this staightener, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would have liked it for more money.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a birthday gift for my wife and my world had been great since replacing her old straightener. She loves this product and she loves me even more. Definitely recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my granddaughter. She really likes it. Works great on her hair. Treats her hair very gently.</li>
    <li> I acquired this for a hair-dresser friend  in Costa Rica.  She loves it. She&#x27;d buy it all over again.  Ta-dah!</li>
    <li> Brought this almost a month ago and I just used it last night. The flat iron gets really hot so be very careful not to burn your hand. I also notice the water for the steam started to bubble and burned my hand. Not what I expected from the steam straightener and the comb wasn&#x27;t long enough for my hair type, which is africian american.</li>
    <li> I really love the steam feature it leaves hair so soft and with a lot of volume and body.  The plate is a bit wide so getting a perfect turn to get crisp curly ends takes some time to master.  I am enjoying my Babyliss Pro.</li>
    <li> I had an original 2\\&quot; Maxiglide flatiron for several years and swore by it. I recommended it to everyone when the subject of flatironing came up. I was preaching the gospel, seriously. Perfect flatiron. Didn&#x27;t damage my hair, made it stick straight and glossy in one pass, I loved it. LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, about 4 years after I got mine I took it to Germany and despite using a voltage converter, fried it so hard it blew the circuit in the hotel bathroom. I was SO BUMMED. Within a day or two of coming back to the states I went to order a replacement only to find that they didn&#x27;t make the 2\\&quot; version anymore. :( Okay, so I bought the 1.5\\&quot; version. The swivel cord was great. I was happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year later, it stopped working; it would turn on, start to heat up, then turn off after about 15 seconds. Again, SO BUMMED. Went to the website to order another one and... what? Not available? And they&#x27;re how much on that other auction site? People asking hundreds of dollars for them? Huh? What?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few months, I just checked, and they are still not available. Not sure what the deal is, but if you want one, you&#x27;re S.O.L. as of this writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I did a lot of research and found that this came closest to the features of the Maxiglide. It has steam, it has a comb in the plate (sort of)... so I ordered it. It&#x27;s no Maxiglide, but it beats the hell out of the Chi I tried in the meantime. I have to have the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; all the way out, and it tends to spit water, but it will get my hair pretty straight in a fairly short amount of time. It&#x27;s the closest I could find to the Maxiglide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some day they&#x27;ll start production on that again but until then, this works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I chose this because it is by far the best straightener that I have ever purchased!  I don&#x27;t straighten all the time but this one has a water chamber for steam and with thick curly hair, it makes a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I could never get the steamer to work!!!! It straightens well but I could have bought something else ya know.</li>
    <li> The water tank does not working. The machine never uses water in the tank. It also does not straight hair thoroughly because of the grove in upper blade for water splasher holes. Comparing to my friends straighteners I do not like this straightener at all. It is not an effective one.</li>
    <li> It works great on my hair. The steam is less damaging than other straighteners. This is my second purchase of the BaByliss. The only reason being that my dog chewed the cord completely off of my previous one. I had my previous one for about five years and it was still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;This one was a great deal and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Damaging to hair- steam did not work properly.  Great idea - product did not deliver results expected! Poor quality product ---</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and have used a number of flat irons over the years. I love this straightener. It is the best flat iron I have ever used hands down!</li>
    <li> Best part of this flat iron is it will straighten hair well even when on thick sections of hair.  Steam ensures that hair does not dry out.  I can quickly straighten my grandchildren&#x27;s hair in just minutes; especially because it accomodates much thicker sections of hair.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Much better than my other straightener that I paid more than three times the price . . . Thank you!</li>
    <li> works 22 days and now no works correctly,and worst Christmas present was my wife, I&#x27;m really very unhappy with this product</li>
    <li> This item was not work.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this straightener! It cut down the time it takes me to straighten it also cut down the amount of frizz that was in my hair as well</li>
    <li> Love that it uses a steam option rather than a dry heat option. My hair does not smell &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; anymore and is shiny and lasts!!</li>
    <li> As a top hairstylist/make-up artist I want nothing but the best tools this industry has to offer. I have used some of the top brands for flat irons this one has been the best I&#x27;ve used in 9 years. I&#x27;m not one for writing reviews unless its something I feel strongly about so I just had to share my opinion! The Babyliss Pro TT products have not let me down yet!</li>
    <li> This baby is still going strong bought it over two years ago love it.</li>
    <li> THIS FLAT IRON IS THE BEST FLAT IRON FOR MY THREE YEAR NATURAL HAIR! ONE PASS AND I AM GOOD TO GO! THE STEAM PROTECTS MY HAIR FROM HEAT DAMAGE AS WELL. I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON SO MUCH I TOLD MY STYLIST I DIDN&#x27;T WANT HER USING HERS ON MY HAIR ANYMORE.  I BROUGHT MINE TO HER AND NOW SHE&#x27;S MAD THAT I DIDN&#x27;T TELL HER SOONER ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. **SO WORTH MY MONEY AND TIME** I LOVE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH I HAD TO WRITE THIS REVIEW IN ***ALL CAPS***</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this iron. I found it when I was looking for a replacement iron for my MaxiGlide as I owned two previous, those each lasted about 5 years. The last time I ordered one it was hard to find and when I did finally get it it was faulty. I ordered the BaByliss because of the steam and hair guides that are on the plates of the iron. I am very happy with the iron so far, and the size is just right. I like that I can also use this iron like a curling iron as well as a straightening iron. The feel of the coating is great and on/off controls aren&#x27;t in the way when I style my hair. The heat mat that comes with it is a great addition, I don&#x27;t need to worry about setting it down and possibly melting things.</li>
    <li> I purchased the babylis steam flatiron from amazon two years ago and it works like a charm. I have Afro textured hair and it leaves my hair super straight. I lost my flatiron and it needs to be replaced so I looked to purchase it here on Amazon. The above seller is selling it for $349 way overpriced!!! You can get it for $50-69 elsewhere! The above seller is trying to ripoff an unsuspecting person.</li>
    <li> My hair purposely find humidity in the air and absorbs it so that no matter how much I try I cannot keep it straight in the summer. These irons were amazing! Pin straight hair with one pass and it lasted for days! I have 3C/4a/4b hairtypes. Didn&#x27;t need oil or anything on my hair during straightening, the steam was plenty moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Honestly I was skeptical before I bought this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;I have been natural for 2 years now and had yet to put ANY heat on it for fear or breakage and heat damage but this has strengthened my faith in straightening my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have zero fear it will damage my hair ( I only use it at the 400 degree or less setting, as ALL hair burns at 451 degrees) so it completely has done its job plus more. It truly conditions the hair when use with a rich oil (or grease as I grew up calling it) Now I may have a much thicker mane than most but this does what a salon can only do for me normally or chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has body, movement and shine for days! And I am not one to want to play in my hair for very long, if sectioned off properly depending on your hair it takes maybe 45mins or a little more to get the results I like.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful bouncy lively hair and you will get constant compliments as it doesn&#x27;t give that dead dry lifeless fried look most irons give you ONLY after you have to use the highest settings for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;FYI I am a type 4A (tight springy/coily)</li>
    <li> I love this iron! It seals alot of moisture in with its tourmaline plates by infusing steam while flat ironing or curling the hair. It does wonders on natural hair! Leaving it soft and shiny with no heat damage. I&#x27;m 20 years licensed stylist!</li>
    <li> this is such a cool product and it really does what it says and works wonders on my hair. absolutely love</li>
    <li> The best straightener ever!! In half the time the results are silky smooth straight hair.  The steam makes all the difference and leaves my hair very shiny.  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas but will be making another purchase for myself.  It beats the Paul Mitchell and the CHI hands down.</li>
    <li> After my Stylist used it on my hair I had to have one!  I&#x27;ve tried several ceramic flations &amp; can&#x27;t compare to the babyliss!!  &amp; the steam is so much healthier for your hair than traditional heat</li>
    <li> Great straightener that doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair.  I have a lot of fine hair and it&#x27;s long, this baby takes only 30 seconds to heat up and 5 minutes to do my hair.</li>
    <li> I specifically purchased this because I&#x27;m trying to do less damage to my color-treated, frizzy blonde hair.  So far it seems less damaging than my other $100 HAI Elite Nano.  Once I have used it more than once, I will update my review to let your know what the ongoing damage factor is like - hopefully less than others!  Make sure to check overstock .com.

    <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to fiddle with hair appliances because curling irons never give me the results I want, blow dryers tend to wreak havoc on my hair no matter how gentle I am, and flat irons never give me that \\&quot;silky straight\\&quot; look I see on other people. It usually looks like I just blew it out out.    This straightens silky straight in one pass. It&#x27;s so good, and I don&#x27;t have to put the setting on a million to get a decent result. I actually am on the low end of temperatures. The results also last for a long time, too. It is easier to avoid reversion when I don&#x27;t want to wear my hair curly that day.     The packaging is great, too. You can keep it in the recloseable box if you don&#x27;t use it that often. They include a heat pad to put the iron on while you are waiting for it to cool off or when you are parting your hair, which is cool because trying to find a place to put a hot appliance in the bathroom while your hands are full is crazy, lol.</li>
    <li> This product worked GREAT for the first week, but after a week, it wouldn&#x27;t heat up right and the water would leak out burning me. So, it would just get warm and that&#x27;s it. If the product would have lasted more than a week, than I would have given it four and half stars. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I always look at reviews, but I seldom leave them.  I was so impressed with the value of this flat iron that I just had to leave one.  The steam setting really helps to make my hair smooth, and it lasts for up to 3 days without washing.  I usually wash my hair everyday.  This iron saves me so much time...5-10 minutes and I have a polished look without frizz.  Because of the high temperature capability, I can also use this for the Keratin Express treatment that I use at home.  I tried another iron for the treatment, but it did not get hot enough to be effective like this one is.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
    <li> excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BaByliss BABTT4073 Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium Steam Straightener, 1.5 Inch...&lt;br /&gt;Babyliss Pro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BaByliss BABTT4073 Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium Steam Straightener, 1.5 Inch...&lt;br /&gt;Babyliss Pro</li>
    <li> My headline says it all. Being that I am a huge American Idol fan I&#x27;ve been trying to go for the Adam Lambert look. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m looking more like Kate Gosselin before her beautiful hair extensions were added. I have removed this product from my bathroom and on into the kitchen. It works good for panini hotdogs. Also, when I&#x27;m in a rush and late for work and I forget to turn it off it does not turn off on it&#x27;s own. Luckily, I have not noticed my power bill going up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a natural African American girl with super kinky hair. After blowdrying this does wonders on my hair plus it healthy for my hair and it not completely getting fry it&#x27;s nice and shiny after a couple of passes threw the straightener and the price is right ladies and gents very reasonable</li>
    <li> This is just a great straightener that is so easy to use and just does a great job with straightening your hair. You can also add water to the unit which produces steam and makes straightening even easier. The steam also moisturizes the hair so that your hair will not dry out so fast and become brittle after repeated straightening&#x27;s. A great value for the money!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product -Babyliss Pro TT straightener.  It gets really Hot! but comes with a heat protective pad, I suggest you use it.</li>
    <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FLAT IRONS IN THE MARKET TODAY!!  THE STEAM LOCKED IN SHINE AND LOOSE ENDS FOR MY HAIR...  THIS FLAT IRON IS THE BEST!!  GLAD I HAD THE CHANCE TO FIND A GOOD DEAL ON AMAZON,, IT RETAILS AT $129.00.. IPAID 61.00 WHICH INCLUDED SHIPPING!!!  YOU CANT GET THAT DEAL ANYWHERE ELSE.. I STRONGLY ADVISE THIS FLAT IRON TO EVERYONE.. AFRICAN AMERICAN HAIR.. EUROPEAN HAIR,, CURLY HAIR,, EVEN HAIR WEAVE... LOVE YOU AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> I have very long course and wavy hair that is not easy to straighten to last for the entire day.  This little steam straightener does the job almost as well as a higher end professional salon one!  I love this item and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and needed a really good-working hair straightener for those customers who have curly hair and want to wear it straight.  This straightener works!  I use it with the steam, and it amazes me how it will straighten curly, frizzy hair in a matter of minutes.  The price was remarkable and I&#x27;m telling all the stylists at work to get them one.</li>
    <li> One of the best flat irons I have had. The only backdraw it is the fact the water reservoir is very delicate and break easyly. It heats evenly and doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair. My hair comes out shiny silky and zero frizz. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas, she used it the same day and it took her half the time that it usually takes to straighten her hair. She is going back to work soon from maternity leave and any time that she can save in the morning is a blessing for all of us. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have very thick course wavy hair. When  my other hair straightener of 5 years broke, I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find something that would work as good. I was a little skeptical of this straightener because of the great price, but decided to trust the reviews and try it.  It works great, as good or better than my other straightener!</li>
    <li> I love my steam straightener.  I do wish more steam would come out, but, all in all, it performs well.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new flat iron. I have been using the Chi for years. There is nothing wrong with my Chi, I just wanted something that I could use on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Her hair is real thick and she has a lot of it. I wanted something to be able to do her hair faster. I just got this and used it on my hair first. My hair is thin. It was ok, I will just have to make sure it is on the correct heat setting. However not even half way through my hair I noticed white spots on it. It started chipping already on the first use. Not worth it......</li>
    <li> The best of all worlds in one flat iron. It combs, provides moisture, and gets very hot. These three combinations make it the best flat iron out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for a couple years now and it&#x27;s decent enough. However, the steam function stopped working about a month after I got it. On occasion, the steam will actually work but it doesn&#x27;t last for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like that you can adjust the heat level and it&#x27;s got a nice long cord. It heats up quickly too.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after noticing the one at my hair salon had steam.  This is my 3rd flat iron and by far the best yet.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My bestfriend and my sister have one and I love theirs.  For some reason the steam doesn&#x27;t work well on mine.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get a steam straightener for a while, and this product does it well, and doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt the hair too much compare to the other non-steam straighteners.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist uses this iron on my hair and the results are amazing. I decided to purchase one to touch up my hair in between visits. Initially, I totally enjoyed the steamer, but after 2 weeks the steamer stopped working. I only used bottle water, per a previous review,and still NO steam. I&#x27;m frustrated because I received amazing results with this iron. It&#x27;s too late to return it and I&#x27;m stuck with an ordinary flat iron.......:-(</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron for my daughter and she loves it.  It works great.  My daughter is 15.  She uses it just about every morning before school.  I think her hair looks really good when she uses the flat iron.  The style holds until the next day it works so well.  I would recommend this flat iron to anyone who wants their her to look good and last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural (course) hair. I used this for the first time last night and my hair was shinier and softer than it has EVER been! I did not have any product other than a leave-in conditioner/heat protectant and yet my hair shined. I love this flat iron so much that if it broke, I&#x27;d buy the exact some one over again. For real.</li>
    <li> I found that this made a lot of static in my hair even though it provides steam action. It took a few more swipes to straighten my hair than other straighteners. Also it left a slight dent line in my hair where I started to straighten. And the steam that comes out of it is kind of scary at first. It makes the same hissing puff as a clothes iron. The steam that shoots out sometimes would splatter on my hand so I had to turn down the steam nozzle a little. It was a little heavy to hold but I&#x27;m sure you can get used to it. Overall, I don&#x27;t quite like the product and will keep it in storage as a back up straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this hoping it would be similar to the ones they use in Asian hair salons but not even close. I swear these salons have some kind of super awesome underground hair straighteners that are not sold in the public market. I&#x27;ve asked the hair stylists what straighteners they use on my hair but they refuse to tell me.. weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used the CHI original, Sedu Pro Ionic 1.5\\&quot;, Babyliss Pro Nano 1\\&quot; and I think the best out of them is the Sedu, lasted me about 3 yrs. So I think I&#x27;ll go back to my Sedu as my next straightener.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several straighteners in the past 10 years, and this was BY FAR the best one I&#x27;ve used! It cut my straightening time almost in half and my hair stayed smooth and shiney all day! However, it only lasted 9 months! I don&#x27;t expect them to last forever, and I know I didn&#x27;t pay a fortune for it, but $80 isn&#x27;t cheap, either! I expected it to last at least two years! But it got to where the water would drip out of the iron and burn the heck out of my neck or shoulders. I thought it was because it was stopped up, so I cleaned the blades, but I soon realized that it was because the iron wasn&#x27;t heating up enough to make steam. So, I quit using the steam and just used it as a basic straigtener, but then it stopped heating up enough for even that! I don&#x27;t feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth out of this iron at all!</li>
    <li> cool as my wife said.</li>
    <li> In the past I had used the Maxiglide and loved it.  After having it for several years, it just stopped working. I went online to purchase another one and found 1) the price had gone up considerably and 2) even with the price increase, I couldn&#x27;t find any in stock.  So in need of new iron, I chose this one.  I love the steam option, it works well, but does seem to need to be refilled rather frequently (like after 2 or 3 uses) which is much more frequent than my Maxiglide.  I like the fact that there is a switch so you can choose to use the &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; option or just the flat iron; however, there should be more teeth for the comb.  The heat settings are easy to read and use and if you have coarse, frizzy hair, this iron will definitely give you smooth, straight hair.  I have two teenage daughters and they often ask if they can use my iron (that should tell you something!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this iron and have recommended to my friends.</li>
    <li> muy buena la experiencia de compra, y una buena atencion, recomendado para cualquier comprador que deseee un producto de exelente calidad y buen servicio</li>
    <li> So far my flat iron is working well. The steam sometimes comes out in bursts and burns the scalp, but I guess that is to be expected. I previously went to a professional to have my hair done. Now I can do it at home myself, and save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I am in LOVE!! this is such a great flat iron. It is a beautiful tool, and leaves my hair soft and shiny! I am so happy with this purchase and recommend this flat iron to anyone. My hair is so full and curly and this flat iron gets it smooth and straight quickly, Babyliss really hit it out of the park with this one.</li>
    <li> It took a couple of uses for the steam to start working - not sure why, but it did.  Love it without the steam and love it more with the steam.  The &amp;#34;bed&amp;#34; of the iron is pretty long, so you can do a wider strip of hair.  The water &amp;#34;canister&amp;#34; for steam is large, so you don&#x27;t have to refill the well often.  Gets nice and hot so you don&#x27;t have to do too many passes.</li>
    <li> I liked it very much. Its so easy to use. My hair became beautifully soft and bright.&lt;br /&gt;I had just one little problem, I had to buy an adapter, because in my country the sockets are diffent.&lt;br /&gt;But was easy to find.</li>
    <li> Wife is impressed with it and does a good job with her long hair. She especially likes the ability it has to make steam and she only recommends those with that option. The only problem we had was turning it on because you have to hold the on button for a few seconds and close the straightener. Not sure if that is a problem or not</li>
    <li> For the price it should work a lot better.  I do like that my hair feels protected and not damaged after being straightened for 4 days in a row.  However, my sister has a conair and it works just as well, and faster! :-/  I would not reccomend this to friends</li>
    <li> I like it a lot more than my Chi knock-off from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. My hair looks shinier, healthier and this flatiron is bigger and flatirons my hair in half the time.</li>
    <li> i have been searching for the best flat iron i have curly hair which needs alot of heat to straighten and i can say that this flat iron is the best. it get your hair straight with one pass and it don&#x27;t burn your hair. this flat iron is compared to the RUSK an i love it. its a good price too. i would buy this over and over again. fast shipping and comes with a case,bottle and dvd!!   all the females in my family love my hair and wants to buy this flatiron its the best!</li>
    <li> Not too long ago, I&#x27;d purchased a Solia for $89.99 from Folica.com. My Solia isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not great either. When using it on it&#x27;s highest setting, it smells like it&#x27;s burning my hair. I have natural, AA, 4A/4B hair so I have to use high heat to get my hair as straight as possible. It also leaves a strange smell on my hair even days after I&#x27;ve straightened it. I ended up giving it away after only using it twice.. I was about to buy a Sedu until I came across this. This Babybliss straightener sells for $129 on Folica.com, but I brought it here for $39.95 with free shipping. That was a pretty amazing deal if you ask me. I&#x27;ve only used it once, just to test it out, on already straightened hair and so far, I love it! Left my hair feeling nice and soft. More so than the Solia.. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again to see it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
    <li> i live in miami the capital of frizz.  Using the steam setting works wonders i wish i would have known about this years ago. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this steam iron with crossed fingers.  I have curly natural hair and sustained heat damage in the past from flat irons, but I wanted to experiment with a straight look.  Initially, I was going to purchase a Maxiglide, but after some research, I decided on this straightener.  I could not have made a better choice.  I was concerned about using steam on blown out natural hair because I didn&#x27;t want my hair to revert, but there was absolutely no reversion - and the use of steam is optional.  With this straightener, I am finally able to get a salon look at home.  Add to that, the optional teeth on the iron make the comb chase method unnecessary - I section the hair, engage the teeth, and press.  And because I can adjust the temperature according to my hair type (the guide in the box will inform the user of the heat setting based on hair type) I am less likely to sustain heat damage to my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When and if I need to replace this iron, it will be with another Babyliss steam straightener.  I am a very happy customer.</li>
    <li> Twice I have bought this flat iron and the on switch stops working.  The second time I purchased this iron I only got to use it once before it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Love it when it works but I won&#x27;t get another one.</li>
    <li> Its ok.  Says it would get through tough hair but mine is only wavy and it still leaves a puff and wave to it after I straighten it</li>
    <li> Very good article, very good deal nice, very good price, item arrived on time, the packaging had an acceptable size</li>
    <li> It works great for the most part but it gets dirty pretty easily, I think because of the steam feature.</li>
    <li> It allows you to control the temperature which is great but the steam does not work that well in mine.</li>
    <li> African American 4B/4C hair  with severe shrinkage upon contact of of any liquid form.  This flat iron is Amazing! I was a Maxiglide  user and abuser for several years it finally broke down and the company no longer makes the XL addition ( large 2 inch plates). However, I considered this a blessing because I have discovered the flat irons of all flat irons  the Babyliss steam straightener. It work well on natural hair textures. This particular flat iron does not snag or pull on the hair strands. I do not write testimonials, but I thought it would be the right thing to do because many testimonials persuaded me to make this very needed purchase. Look guys if you don&#x27;t like it you can always return it! My daughter and I are very pleased with the results and the performance of this exceptional flat iron. Better than the Maxiglide by a mile.</li>
    <li> This steam feature lets me believe its doing something healthy to my hair. All I know is I get quality results like I do when I visit my stylist once a month. She uses the same brand but not the steam feature. Great product. Even though I am tempted to try the HSI products. But then I think, this is what 90% of black salon owners use in TN. So I think I should just stick with this one.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the Sonic Maxiglide before I ordered the  Babyliss. The Babyliss is much  better than the Maxiglide.  I have really thick long wavy hair and since using this flat iron the time spent to straighten my hair has decreased. Works great, easy to use and light weight.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a hair straigntener with steam and this one works well! It has 3 steam settings, and 3 &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; settings. The comb is really just small teeth that help guide the hair as it passes through the plates. This iron just seems to cause less damage to my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I really wanted my hair to grow, but I had to keep chopping it off because it was so dead. This makes such a difference. It is annoying to refill the water part before every use, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it. It comes with 1 spare \\&quot;water piece\\&quot; but I wish they would sell them separately...i feel like I will need more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9/23/13&lt;br /&gt;The thing stopped working on me. Won&#x27;t turn on- completely done. I wish I knew how to contact sellers to ask if they would replace since I only had it for 3 months. If anyone knows how please let me know.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these . 1 worked fine and the second one was defective . I didn&#x27;t return for an exchange bc if the hassle so I had someone fix it got me</li>
    <li> My wife loves it , has had it for a few years and still going</li>
    <li> excellent iron for hair, leaves it great .. is one of the top plates of the brand baby liss, I recommend</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many, irons and this one is so much better than all the others, straightens beautifully and fast.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron.  I use it 3 times a week or more, for about 15 minutes.  It was the best flat iron I&#x27;d ever owned until the power switch stopped working.  I have to fiddle with the switch for a minute before it comes on, and I have to unplug it to turn it off.  I bought this in April of 2011.  I&#x27;d give it all 5 stars, for performance, except for this problem.  I don&#x27;t know how long the switch is going to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The switch has now completely failed.  It will not turn on at all.  I&#x27;ll have to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> not sure why but this iron all the writing came off after 3 uses, i have used babyliss for the last year and they just went out no warning so i got these from amazon they heat up but for the writing to come off then the whole iron discolored, not happy at all.</li>
    <li> i warn all other consumers do not purchase this,  it no longer works after 2 mos. of using.  Very dissapointed</li>
    <li> The shipping was right on time and the product is amazing. I am an African American woman with naturally curly hair. I have had issues with heat damage when using ceramic and high heat flat irons. The temperature settings, titanium plates and steam feature made all the difference. My hair returned to its natural curl form after washing. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this again!</li>
    <li> Love this item!  Its a perfect size, works very well and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune!  I have recommended it to several friends.</li>
    <li> Was not quite the quality I expected, could of spent a third less on a remington.  If I had to do again I would try a different brand</li>
    <li> Baby - the buck stops here.  I have 4c afro kinky hair that doesn&#x27;t even have a true curl pattern--more of a z pattern.  I&#x27;m totally natural with about 7 inches of hair.  When it&#x27;s wet, it goes to about 1/2 to 3/4 inch, so major major shrinkage.  So I don&#x27;t speak lightly when I say this flatiron is the end all for me.  I get results as good or better than the Dominican Salon, and that&#x27;s no small feat.  Plus I get the added bonus of retouching when I sweat from workouts or hot muggy Georgia days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negatives.  Although I didn&#x27;t experience the broken water chambers as some, I can say my chamber doesn&#x27;t really empty.  Babyliss provides a spare so I even swapped chambers just to be sure.  If I want steam, I really just have to pump the inner button a few times each section of hair.  The steam really does make a difference in my hair&#x27;s pliability, but I don&#x27;t always remember to use it for every section.  I&#x27;ve used the iron ten different times without running out of water in the chamber.  I know that&#x27;s not good since the instructions indicate the chamber should empty in about 20 minutes on its own.  If it were a big deal, I&#x27;d return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coating seems to be peeling off one corner, and it seems a bit early for that.  We will see if it affects the outcome, but for now I am so wowed by results.  After people see my hair (or my daughter, niece or other recent client), they are slowly trying to adopt me as their new stylist.  Funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For max results with tightly curled or kinky hair, I use a double-sided brush (think alligator brush--on Amazon it&#x27;s the Scalpmaster ceramic thermal hair straightener) that clamps down on the hair.  After detangling a small section,  I clamp the alligator brush to add tension with my non-dominant hand, then chase the brush all the way down the strand with the flatiron, keeping tension all the way down.  This helps you avoid kinky or frizzy ends that are resistant to straighten. One to two passes on each section is more than enough.  Happy purchasing!section is more than enough.  Happy purchasing!</li>
    <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
    <li> I LOVE my BaByliss straightener! It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all (Chi, etc.)! The steam function straightens my hair without as much damage as any others. It&#x27;s also a pretty good value.</li>
    <li> This was bought as Christmas gift for my wife. Her old straightener had seen better&lt;br /&gt;days and so this was purchased as a replacement. To this date she is well pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the performance of this product.</li>
    <li> Resarch shown this to be a great straightener.  It is just ok.  The grove in the plates can add kinks to your hair if you don&#x27;t move the plates through your hair quickly enough.  Heating never appears hot enough with this unit.  It is a very heavy unit, even without adding the water to use the steam.  Additionally, made me lose a lot of hair.  I waited for many years to have true experience of using this unit to send in this review.  I since retired using this unit.</li>
    <li> I  have fine hair, but lots of it.  Typically, it&#x27;s got funky waves in the back (if I airdry).  With this product on a 25 setting (it goes up to 45), My hair can be straightened in about 5 minutes.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants a great finish, with no damage.</li>
    <li> No cubrio completamente mis expectativas debido a que con el vapor se supone que el friss tardaria mas en aparecer luego del planchado y en mi caso no a funcionado</li>
    <li> I really liked it and then the steam stopped working. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough for the steam to be an issue. If they fixed that it would be one of the best hair appliances out there.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of the steam function and the retractable combs don&#x27;t add much value. I do like the multiple heat options. I used this product for a few months, but decided to purchase a replacement.</li>
    <li> This does not work as advertised at all. It is no different than a regular flat iron, but much more expensive. I tried different settings for heat and steam, and they were all terrible. Very disapointed!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist and have been fond of this iron that steams , for years !!  Much less expensive on amazon than from my own distributors !  It&#x27;s a perfect iron to use for all hair , and even better for thick course and curly hair. A true tamer for the unmanageable hair of today.  A VERY GOOD BUT !</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged so I thought I would give this a try instead of my regular flat iron. Its awesome - works just like the old one except it has steam to help protect the hair. Love the retractable combs for doing waves and curls too!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Seller 100% responsible.</li>
    <li> I have natural curly African American hair. When my old flat iron went out, I decided to get babyliss because it was recommended to me. I get great steam action, but the retractable combs do snag my hair a bit; however, it works really well on my extensions.</li>
    <li> The only problem I had with this is sometimes hairs would get stuck in between the steam release button on the inside. It out performs my Chi--not by a mile. I love the steam function and the comb!! Allows me to let my hair dry naturally and I can still get the curls out later. I would highly recommend this straightener. It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that I like better than Chi.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! The best straightening iron ever! I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s kind of curly, so it was great for me!</li>
    <li> I am totally in luv with this flat iron so glad I decided to get this flat iron it makes my hair super duper straight and I don&#x27;t have a perm..&amp; I have really thick hair. So go ahead and order yours today u won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
