      <li>It turned out to be the best purchase I have made in a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous red - not too bright</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, they have free shipping days, and it&#x27;s guaranteed authentic.</li>
      <li>The lipstick also smells sweet!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just what I needed, it glides on easily and stays on my lips not on my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful red</li>
      <li>Smooth &amp; Sexxy...</li>
      <li>I love it, also the color made my face fresh.</li>
      <li>The lipstick won&#x27;t rub off and it looks absolutely fabulous...</li>
      <li>its not the original mac lipstick</li>
      <li>Color is great, but it doesn&#x27;t say for long</li>
      <li>so you have to reapply other than that the lipstick is so beautiful and rich and not drying.</li>
      <li>Yes, I agree its a GREAT shade---but, it is very very dry to put on.  </li>
      <li>I love the color and the matted look it brings into my whole look.</li>
      <li>I requested a refund from seller immediately because when I opened it the color was not that of the true Ruby Woo.  </li>
      <li>You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free.</li>
      <li>great color of red pairs well with milanni red lipliner</li>
      <li>I order the correct color from mac which i should have done in the first place.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty, just not what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>If you love red this is the lipstick for you</li>
      <li>I was nervous at first</li>
      <li>MAC on Amazon is a huge red flag, the company doesn&#x27;t distribute outside their own business.</li>
      <li>I love this shade of red.  </li>
      <li>The most incrediable red I ever tried!</li>
      <li>Lovely shade of red.</li>
      <li>However, its one of my personal favorite.</li>
      <li>The only thing I would prefer more if it would stay on longer.</li>
      <li>Love this red matte lipstick!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out if my tube of lipstick was old, or if that is the true texture of the product.  </li>
      <li>High quality!</li>
      <li>Very matte.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I ABSOLUTELY</li>
      <li>Very creamy for a matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I will go back to this seller, knowing as this product came fast, and as i can tell, unused and boxed in the original box.</li>
      <li>This is the only Mac product I have afforded myself and I&#x27;m so not disappointed in any way.  </li>
      <li>I totally love this colour and would definitely recommend that every one into red lipstick get one!</li>
      <li>The color is vibrant.</li>
      <li>my lipstick keeps falling out of the container if you push it up high....</li>
      <li>I love this color on my dark skin tone!</li>
      <li>love the color and how it long it last except when I frequently eat.</li>
      <li>This lipstick is very nice and long wearing, but was billed as a blue red and it really isn&#x27;t quite blue enough for me.</li>
      <li>Pretty red matte color</li>
      <li>Was completely smushed</li>
      <li>I am RubyWoo-n-LoOoVe&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this Product to any female thats wants to look</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m surprised to see it here -</li>
      <li>was old.</li>
      <li>Really good, delivery was a little slow</li>
      <li>I spent too much money on this lipstick.</li>
      <li>Absolutely not the real ruby woo from mac</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very creamy for a matte lipstick. Color is great, but it doesn&#x27;t say for long so there&#x27;s a lot of reapplication. I am very light skinned, but I think a lot of skin tones could wear this color. I bought five mac lipsticks and some were misses but I really liked this one.</li>
    <li> This lipstick.... Wow, I  have wanted it forever and finally broke down and spent the money.  It turned out to be the best purchase I have made in a long time. The lipstick won&#x27;t rub off and it looks absolutely fabulous... I love the matte finish it looks great no matter what your outfit is.  The lipstick also smells sweet!  I have little boys and I give them lots of kisses throughout the day and it doesn&#x27;t come off on their little faces, so it&#x27;s perfect for the affectionate mother lol!  This is the only Mac product I have afforded myself and I&#x27;m so not disappointed in any way.  10/10</li>
    <li> I like the color and product.  However the seller had fake or old lipsticks and when I took it in a MAC store to compare color and name on bottom of tube, it was TOTALLY different.  I requested a refund from seller immediately because when I opened it the color was not that of the true Ruby Woo.  Beware of these types of purchases.  Thankfully I&#x27;ve purchased it before and knew that this was a bad tube.</li>
    <li> I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Very prompt and was a great Christmas gift</li>
    <li> This is my first MAC lipstick and its really cute and looks really good. I am glad I bought it. I will be buying more MAC lipsticks. 😊😀😃😄</li>
    <li> Not for me - wrong color</li>
    <li> Really good, delivery was a little slow</li>
    <li> This products picture is slightly misleading, seeing as it shows 2 lipsticks, a matte red and a matte pink, you only recive one lipstick, the matte red. If you dont read the product description, you might assume that you get both. I will go back to this seller, knowing as this product came fast, and as i can tell, unused and boxed in the original box.</li>
    <li> i thought i ordered ruby woo, a matte red. instead i receive a brownish color.  it read retro instead of ruby woo. the package it came it was torn looked like it had been re used. I order the correct color from mac which i should have done in the first place.  overall horrible service. i have pictures but am not sure how to post.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Definately stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> The most incrediable red I ever tried! Awesome.</li>
    <li> The produce arrive on schedule but when I took the top off there was nothing in the tube.  The lipstick was stuck in the top.  Had to take a pin to get it out.  Not a good thing for the price.  Next time I will just go to the mall to buy my lipstick.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this lipstick! It goes on well and stays on good. I can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find out about it. Great price from seller, too!</li>
    <li> Love it but wayyyyyy to expensive</li>
    <li> Beautiful red BUT this is not RUBY WOO, this has an orange undertone. Misleading product.</li>
    <li> Bright color, tastes nice. Very matte. This shade of pinky red will make your teeth look a little bit whiter.</li>
    <li> Please do not buy ladies. You can get the real thing from Mac for 16 dollars and shipping is always free. You have been warned ladies.</li>
    <li> Missed this color...any chance of getting another discontinued, *Delish*...</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, excellent product! This is the only Mac product I actually use. Simple &amp; chic. A must have for on the go.</li>
    <li> Pretty red matte color and I usually have to reapply only once or twice during the night.  I only wear it for an evening out on the town.</li>
    <li> I love the color and the matted look it brings into my whole look. The only thing I would prefer more if it would stay on longer. However, its one of my personal favorite.</li>
    <li> I love it, also the color made my face fresh. It&#x27;s match with my daily outfit!!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOoOoOoVE IT... IS MATTE but not dry or rough ...Smooth &amp; Sexxy...I am RubyWoo-n-LoOoVe&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this Product to any female thats wants to look n feel supper Ruby Woo Sexxy....</li>
    <li> I wear Ruby Woo. And I&#x27;m surprised to see it here - because MAC doesn&#x27;t wholesale and only sells through their stores and website. MAC on Amazon is a huge red flag, the company doesn&#x27;t distribute outside their own business. There are a ton or MAC counterfeits out there too, it&#x27;s one of the most counterfeited items in the world. Literally. Why aren&#x27;t you all just buying it off the MAC site? It&#x27;s cheaper, they have free shipping days, and it&#x27;s guaranteed authentic. Sometimes you just need to go to the mall. Even $14 lipsticks should be tried on.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color! Part of my 3 favorite colors for fall video&lt;br /&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;AilvHavwrxo</li>
    <li> I have  seen better lipstick.</li>
    <li> love the color and how it long it last except when I frequently eat. thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this shade of red.  Ruby Woo is officially my go-to red lipstick!  However, this lipstick is only $17 on the MAC store.  I recommend you shop for it on their website or in store.</li>
    <li> I totally love this colour and would definitely recommend that every one into red lipstick get one! It&#x27;s a gorgeous red - not too bright and it lasts really long.</li>
    <li> I was nervous at first but I got it and I like it :) I&#x27;m happy no complaints I would but again</li>
    <li> my wife only uses this one  she loves it</li>
    <li> Excellent, the only thing I am disappointed about it is it&#x27;s way too easy to come off when you eat :( so you have to reapply other than that the lipstick is so beautiful and rich and not drying.</li>
    <li> great color of red pairs well with milanni red lipliner</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed, it glides on easily and stays on my lips not on my teeth.  Will recommend this product to those on the go.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE!!! Great color for brown skin girls! !!!!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is very nice and long wearing, but was billed as a blue red and it really isn&#x27;t quite blue enough for me.</li>
    <li> Love this red matte lipstick!</li>
    <li> Like the color but so matte and dry it is impossible to apply smoothly on lips. I will not be buying it again and need to apply it with another lipstick underneath! Ugh ! Waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> I spent too much money on this lipstick. Its too bright. I don&#x27;t really like the consistency of this lipstick.</li>
    <li> Recommend seller and love the color!</li>
    <li> Lovely shade of red. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Soooo beautiful! And also, it stays for hours and when I put my fingers on my lips it doesnt leave any lipstick on them. Mac is mac! High quality!</li>
    <li> great lipstick, stays on all day and love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this fake product..its not the original mac lipstick</li>
    <li> it wasn&#x27;t the shade i wanted, but i bought russian red and mix the two....it&#x27;s close...my lipstick keeps falling out of the container if you push it up high....i received it on time....i would recommend this color to ppl who are kind of medium tone...it&#x27;s pretty, just not what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> my favorite color!  last a long time if you are looking for that matte vintage look this is your color. I get so many compliments when I wear it</li>
    <li> I thought this was the riri woo rihanna red. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all with ruby woo not one bit!</li>
    <li> The perfect matte lipstick to complete your makeup. I lovvveeeee it ♥</li>
    <li> Was completely smushed</li>
    <li> 2 WORDS: YYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS HONEY! OVER PRICED ON AMAZON THOUGH.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will buy again. Stays on all day and has a beautiful pigment. If you love red this is the lipstick for you</li>
    <li> If you want that perfect turn heads red lipstick this is the one for you! Just get it! I love this color on my dark skin tone!</li>
    <li> The color is vibrant. I gave one star the because the lipstick was aplyable it was sticky hard to apply lipstick was old. Gave one star for shipping</li>
    <li> This lipstick is great and just as described... Reason for 4 stars and not 5 would be due to shipping speed and lack of communication.  Other then that great seller.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else, I love Ruby Woo.  I had heard about this color forever, so finally had to bite the bullet and buy it. It is a beautiful rich looking lipstick that looks excellent on my completion (golden tan).  It wears well and for hours with just a few touchups.  This is one of two go to red lipsticks, and will prob stay that way for a while.  Would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely not the real ruby woo from mac but I guess it will do for now</li>
    <li> Several people on pintrest suggested and bragged this was the ultimate red shade.  Yes, I agree its a GREAT shade---but, it is very very dry to put on.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out if my tube of lipstick was old, or if that is the true texture of the product.  After reading some reviews, I have come to the conclusion, the product is dry.  It feels like it &amp;#34;drags&amp;#34; across your lips.  I am disappointed in the lipstick--for the $$ paid, its not worth the money (in my opinion).</li>
