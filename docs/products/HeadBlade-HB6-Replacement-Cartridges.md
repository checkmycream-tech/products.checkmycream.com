      <li>Best head shave blades ever.  </li>
      <li>VERY GOOD!</li>
      <li>Great blades got a super close shave!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great blades.</li>
      <li>I is great for my bald head.</li>
      <li>This is a great product line if you shave your head.  </li>
      <li>Great blades....</li>
      <li>Six blades seems goofy-excessive but dang if it doesn&#x27;t work great.  </li>
      <li>This 6 bladed version of the replacement blade for the headblade system is a great addition to the line.  </li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the 3 blade for about 4 years now and it is great</li>
      <li>Works great and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I get a great, smooth shave from these blades.</li>
      <li>It does do a nice job however.</li>
      <li>I have an older HeadBlade model and the adapter included with this kit works perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed - this really makes the Headblade significantly better.</li>
      <li>and I have very strong hair.</li>
      <li>I honestly get a better shave with the 4 blade kit, but that is just my experience.</li>
      <li>Not any better then the four blade.</li>
      <li>but the 6 blade is much better.</li>
      <li>HB4 is an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>It is too many blades, closely placed together which stuffs the razors with more hair in my opinion.</li>
      <li>In the picture below you can see on the right a 4 blade after 1 month of usage (it is still in good shape).</li>
      <li>The shaves are nice and clean and close, and when I use the Clearhead afterwards, I don&#x27;t feel any nicks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes shaving my head easy and honestly quite fun</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll happily use these until they&#x27;re done, then switch back to the smaller size, but I&#x27;m still happy with my Headblade.</li>
      <li>about ten times lol).</li>
      <li>First off, I love my headblade razor.</li>
      <li>It appears a better steel could be used on their whole line.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re using this to shave with the grain and not just get super duper ultra close, go for it.  </li>
      <li>A very smooth shave so far.</li>
      <li>The head also flexes very well to fit around the contours of my head.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>I originally presumed that I would get a better shave with the 6 blade kit above, but I was incorrect.</li>
      <li>Will not be caught with a dull blade again!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased two packages, so we are good to go!</li>
      <li>It did fine, but not as well as my Gillette new version of their 5 blade.</li>
      <li>Got the product quickly, and the six Blades work very well on my scalp.</li>
      <li>At first, honestly, it was a little intimidating, because you have to put significantly more pressure on the front of the Headblade than you would normally do - and this is exactly how I&#x27;ve cut myself before.  </li>
      <li>Extra close shave for a smooth clean shaven head.</li>
      <li>HB6 will also lack in performance after the first shave.</li>
      <li>Worked great...........the first time.  </li>
      <li>It really does allow you to shave quickly and completely.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 4 basically because i can&#x27;t really tell a difference between HB&#x27;s 4 blade vs. 6 blade.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is much easier to rinse</li>
      <li>I really like this headblade system.  </li>
      <li>These work no different or better than a regular razor.</li>
      <li>Harder to clean than the four blade</li>
      <li>marked difference between these and the three or four blade ones.</li>
      <li>If you can find the 6 blades at the same price, absolutely use them.</li>
      <li>I had to replace it, because hairs are trapped in the blade and there is no way to keep it clean.</li>
      <li>I thought it would be closer, however I don&#x27;t see much difference from the other blades.  </li>
      <li>Last a long time, but truth be told, they dont operate any better or worse than the 4 blade model.</li>

<li> (haven&#x27;t had it long enough)</li>
<li> The edge does not last as a long as I would think that it would.</li>
<li> It appears you can&#x27;t clear the blades with water like previous versions.  </li>
<li> I wish I could get my money back, a complete waste.  </li>
<li> , I think I prefer the smaller number of blades for the simple reason of size/maneuverability: it&#x27;s harder to hit those tiny little pockets with a bigger set of blades, but the 4-bladed (or was it 3?)</li>
<li> that with the added blades it will last longer than the 3 bladed system (I usually go for 2 month+ of daily shaving before replacing the blades)</li>
<li> so I can easily get those tough to get spots like behind and above my ears.</li>
<li> I shave my head every other day</li>
<li> My only complaint is the head blade doesn&#x27;t have a finishing edge on the blade</li>
<li> Thumbs down.</li>
<li> On the left, you can see the very poor quality HB6 after only 3 shaves.</li>
<li> I wish they were a little cheaper</li>
<li> Subsequent shaves were almost useless and I had to follow-up with an electric shaver after showering.  </li>
<li> (The razor can be a little frustrating to mount the blades if you have it pop off when you have your glasses off).</li>
<li> So frustrating.  </li>
<li> Why would headblade make such a horrible blade?</li>
<li> These blades are absolutely awful compared to the HB4.</li>
<li> Horrible.</li>

    <li> I is great for my bald head.</li>
    <li> I only received one pack not 4 packs.</li>
    <li> Overpriced and over rated. The blades and the razor do not work at all. Thumbs down. Been head shaving for 15 years. Save your money.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD! WISH I HAD FOUND IT SOONER.</li>
    <li> I usually go over my head first with a regular straight razor and then finish things off with my headblade, but I had trouble finding the replacements around town, so I decided to order them with Amazon. I got the larger 6-blade this time, and while I like it and it does its job, I think I prefer the smaller number of blades for the simple reason of size/maneuverability: it&#x27;s harder to hit those tiny little pockets with a bigger set of blades, but the 4-bladed (or was it 3?) version got those spots just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this to shave with the grain and not just get super duper ultra close, go for it.  I&#x27;ll happily use these until they&#x27;re done, then switch back to the smaller size, but I&#x27;m still happy with my Headblade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Headblade for a long time, and have cut/peeled myself pretty badly a few times.  I thought that perhaps a different blade design would help with that - the 6 blade design uses a different suspension design, and the blades are closer together.  At first, honestly, it was a little intimidating, because you have to put significantly more pressure on the front of the Headblade than you would normally do - and this is exactly how I&#x27;ve cut myself before.  However, after using this for several months now, I have yet to cut myself (knock on wood).  The shaves are nice and clean and close, and when I use the Clearhead afterwards, I don&#x27;t feel any nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very impressed - this really makes the Headblade significantly better.</li>
    <li> Great blades. Last a long time, but truth be told, they dont operate any better or worse than the 4 blade model. For the money i would stick with the 4 blade. If you can find the 6 blades at the same price, absolutely use them.</li>
    <li> This is a great product line if you shave your head.  I get a great, smooth shave from these blades. I wish they were a little cheaper which is the only thing holding me back from rating them five stars.  (The razor can be a little frustrating to mount the blades if you have it pop off when you have your glasses off).</li>
    <li> Worked great...........the first time.  Subsequent shaves were almost useless and I had to follow-up with an electric shaver after showering.  It appears you can&#x27;t clear the blades with water like previous versions.  I&#x27;ll stick to the 4-blade model in the future.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be closer, however I don&#x27;t see much difference from the other blades.  It does do a nice job however.</li>
    <li> Got the product quickly, and the six Blades work very well on my scalp. My only complaint is the head blade doesn&#x27;t have a finishing edge on the blade so I can easily get those tough to get spots like behind and above my ears.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 basically because i can&#x27;t really tell a difference between HB&#x27;s 4 blade vs. 6 blade.&lt;br /&gt;To those who are considering a HeadBlade - do it.  It really does allow you to shave quickly and completely.</li>
    <li> Horrible. I tried it a couple times and went over and over and over my head in all different directions each time and it will not get all my hair.  So frustrating.  They don&#x27;t work at all.  I wish I could get my money back, a complete waste.  Why would headblade make such a horrible blade?</li>
    <li> Not any better then the four blade. It appears a better steel could be used on their whole line. The edge does not last as a long as I would think that it would. Harder to clean than the four blade so I&#x27;ll go back to the gour bladed one.</li>
    <li> Great blades.... Extra close shave for a smooth clean shaven head.</li>
    <li> First off, I love my headblade razor. It makes shaving my head easy and honestly quite fun lol. I originally presumed that I would get a better shave with the 6 blade kit above, but I was incorrect. It is too many blades, closely placed together which stuffs the razors with more hair in my opinion. I honestly get a better shave with the 4 blade kit, but that is just my experience.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy into the hype! These work no different or better than a regular razor.</li>
    <li> This 6 bladed version of the replacement blade for the headblade system is a great addition to the line.  I&#x27;ve been using this system for 3 years now and with addition of the 6 blade system it improves the system.  There is also a hope (haven&#x27;t had it long enough) that with the added blades it will last longer than the 3 bladed system (I usually go for 2 month+ of daily shaving before replacing the blades)</li>
    <li> I really like this headblade system.  Works great and is easy to use.  Wish I had it earlier</li>
    <li> SHAVE MY HEAD EVERY DAY . GREAT !!!!!!</li>
    <li> These blades are absolutely awful compared to the HB4. HB4 is an outstanding product. I shave my head every other day and I have very strong hair. In the picture below you can see on the right a 4 blade after 1 month of usage (it is still in good shape). On the left, you can see the very poor quality HB6 after only 3 shaves. I had to replace it, because hairs are trapped in the blade and there is no way to keep it clean. HB6 will also lack in performance after the first shave.</li>
    <li> if you use a head blade razor get the six blade cartridges. marked difference between these and the three or four blade ones.</li>
    <li> Great blades got a super close shave!!!!!</li>
    <li> Headblade is the best product for Shaved heads on the market!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 3 blade for about 4 years now and it is great but the 6 blade is much better. It is much easier to rinse and it last for about 10 shaves verses about 5-6. I have not cut myself at all unlike the 3 blade (opps! about ten times lol). The head also flexes very well to fit around the contours of my head. I will buy it again!!!!</li>
