      <li>it is so easy to use and great to apply with latisse</li>
      <li>The container is nice because it has a twist and dispense lid</li>

      <li>Fits nice on the hand and is easy to use to remove the eyelash extention</li>

      <li>but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.com</li>
      <li>I was a bit worried having to wash the brush repeatedly, so I gave in and purchased these lovely disposables.  </li>
      <li>Better than the brushes that come with the product.</li>
      <li>An eyeliner brush, even synthetic, couldn&#x27;t do a better job.  </li>
      <li>so you have to buy more.  </li>
      <li>I love this this product.</li>
      <li>Love these.</li>
      <li>but I thought these would work better for a detailed job.</li>
      <li>The brush tips are just the perfect size for delivering the product with minimal loss.  </li>
      <li>but I felt more comfortable with the dental quality close to my eyes ..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine if you want to use them for eyebrows.</li>
      <li>and it works just fine.  </li>
      <li>Great marketing ploy from Latisse to use such crappy brushes</li>
      <li>I received free shipping but they came from China</li>
      <li>I was willing to pay more for safety.  </li>
      <li>She is/was SOOOOO right!  </li>
      <li>I am serious, I will not use anything else to apply my drops ever again, because this is perfect.</li>
      <li>Love this product, it makes removing lash extensions way easier, thanks so so much!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>package is comfortable keeps the micro brushes sterile which is very important especially when used on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>these are just right.  </li>
      <li>that they came super fast so 1 star for that.</li>
      <li>and it seems pretty sanitary.  </li>
      <li>REALLY saving quantity of product being used!  </li>
      <li>Very easy use and cleanup for someone like me who wants to spend minimal time performing nighttime ablutions.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Since several other reviewers commented that they use these for applying Latisse, I ordered them for the same purpose, and they work great!  </li>
      <li>if you need a certain size you should mention it while placing your order.</li>
      <li>I bought these to use with Latisse and true to the reviews from other users, it is better at applying (better precision) and uses less of the solution as it doesn&#x27;t suck it all up like the Latisse brushes tend to do.  </li>
      <li>This allows you to apply right against the lid margin and not waste a lot of the drop on the skin!</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re able to get right along the lash line, with no dripping or mess.</li>
      <li>I really like the container it comes in</li>
      <li>I think they are much easier to use than the brushes that come with Latisse.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
      <li>With the big brushes I would get Latisse all over my eyelids but with these I can make a precise line.</li>
      <li>I thought they would be a gentle way to brush my eyelash extensions without pulling them out</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Too much solution saturates the tip and it makes it drip in your eye when you apply.</li>
      <li>and i must say it works really well.  </li>
      <li>I am still able to use them but everything else is pink in my salon.</li>
      <li>Better result, no mess, I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
      <li>my lashes are long and my product is stil going strong</li>
      <li>Will definitely be back for more future purchases</li>
      <li>It allows you to use just enough of the medication without wasting most of it on the BIG brush that comes with Latisse bottles</li>
      <li>I bought these for latisse, I highly recommend these for that product.</li>
      <li>These are way better for applying Latisse to your eyelash line and you use way less product!</li>
      <li>being careful to have clean hands ..</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY outstanding solution to the problem of waste when using the Latisse eyelash prescription product!  </li>
      <li>Very useful for tight spots</li>
      <li>i use these to make my latisse last longer the brushes that come with it uses too much product.</li>
      <li>makes it last so much longer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are small and easy to apply to your lashes.</li>
      <li>The original Latisse brushes waste a lot of product.</li>
      <li>I usually use one swab to do both eyes, flipping it over so that a fresh side of it is on each eye, and they work really well that way.  </li>
      <li>If you try and do two drops, one for each eye, it is really too much and just a waste.</li>
      <li>Awesome price for 100 applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these because I hate the big brushes that come with Latisse (eyelash growth solution).</li>
      <li>I have to say, I was a little skeptical about buying these, since so many people recommend that you simply use an eyeliner brush (of which I already have many).  </li>
      <li>Well worth the cost amount, shipping is high but next time I will order a few packs at the same time now</li>
      <li>Because of the reviews indicating a sponge end that frequently fell off .. I decided to do further research.  </li>
      <li>only thing is I can&#x27;t tell if the micro tip is a tiny brush like my current ones which I really like .. or what.  </li>
      <li>First of all I ordered pink and got blue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply the product in a thin line on your eyelid with these micro applicators.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are prefect for using with Latisse. It allows you to use just enough of the medication without wasting most of it on the BIG brush that comes with Latisse bottles</li>
    <li> Poor poor quality.....  Not worth saving a few dollars!!!! Micro brush tip comes off not a good thing when using close to eye area!!!!! Will stick to my other supplier</li>
    <li> Two months later I finally received them. I had forgotten I even ordered them. They should mention that prior to purchasing. Not great for Latisse application which is why I purchased them. Too much solution saturates the tip and it makes it drip in your eye when you apply.</li>
    <li> First of all I ordered pink and got blue. Second, they are so thin they really serve no purpose. I thought they would be a gentle way to brush my eyelash extensions without pulling them out but they are useless. I did like that they came super fast so 1 star for that.</li>
    <li> I can say that I am completely satisfied with my purchase! I bought these to apply eyelash dye to my see-through eyelashes. I was looking for disposable mascara wands when I found these but I thought these would work better for a detailed job. They are small enough to get to the defiant lashes in the corner without issue. They soak up the perfect amount of solution too. I have used them with mascara as well and they are perfect for that too. The container is nice because it has a twist and dispense lid so you get no contamination.</li>
    <li> work great but the pink have tiny tips</li>
    <li> Shipping was took a bit long but overall the product is what I expected it to be.</li>
    <li> bought these to apply Careprost eyelash enhancer - they are nice for the use I bought them for. They have a tiny sponge on the tip which was not what I expected but they work.</li>
    <li> This might be the best Latisse applicator but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.com</li>
    <li> it is so easy to use and great to apply with latisse</li>
    <li> I received these and they are much larger than the ones sold by Windmax.  I used them anyways for Careprost eyelash stuff but felt like it was too big and can&#x27;t get precision spots. It&#x27;s fine if you want to use them for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> The container was broken unfortunately. I was able to put the applicators in my qtip jar but certainly not ideally packaged/shipped!</li>
    <li> package is comfortable keeps the micro brushes sterile which is very important especially when used on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;When i received the product the package revealed there are 3 different sizes which they didn&#x27;t mention.&lt;br /&gt;So if you need a certain size you should mention it while placing your order.</li>
    <li> use these for Latisse and they work great! Better than the brushes that come with the product.</li>
    <li> i bought these to prolong my Latisse bottle and decided for $6, I&#x27;d just throw them away if they didn&#x27;t work out. They worked GREAT! I think they are much easier to use than the brushes that come with Latisse. I received free shipping but they came from China so it took a while to get them (maybe a week or just over?). The ones I received were blue. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect for use with Latisse</li>
    <li> Works well for eyelash treatment.</li>
    <li> perfect. makes it last so much longer.I had been putting it on my finger.</li>
    <li> Because of the reviews indicating a sponge end that frequently fell off .. I decided to do further research.  I found a sterile dental quality that has a micro brush on the end .. a bit more expensive $6.66 for 100 .. but I felt more comfortable with the dental quality close to my eyes .. we only get two eyes per lifetime!  Since I just use one per day .. I was willing to pay more for safety.  Below is the product link and review I wrote:  100 Micro Applicator Micro applicators Microbrush  .. GREAT APPLICATORS!  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:  ABSOLUTELY outstanding solution to the problem of waste when using the Latisse eyelash prescription product!  I saw these at my doctor&#x27;s office .. gave it some thought .. spoke to someone who is currently cutting down the brushes that come with the Latisse prescription.  A laborious effort .. she even said she was SURE they made the brushes so thick and said to use a 2nd one for the 2nd eye .. JUST to waste the prescription .. AND increase their profits!  She is/was SOOOOO right!  These work WONDERFULLY!  Being sterile is very important .. but I use just one for both eyes .. being careful to have clean hands .. this is just perfect for the Latisse application .. thank you!  REALLY saving quantity of product being used!  (A tip .. my friend said after the initial 6 week period of getting the eyelashes started .. she now only does it every other night and it works just fine.  Saving on product AND time!)&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I just found on Amazon a cheaper product .. only thing is I can&#x27;t tell if the micro tip is a tiny brush like my current ones which I really like .. or what.  BUT when I run out of my current ones .. I may order these . 400 for $7.99 :  [[ASIN:B00EE1OK0W Dental Disposable Micro Applicator Bendable]]</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product, it was just expensive because of the shipping. I used this to apply on my eyeline for Latisse. I really like the container it comes in and it seems pretty sanitary.  Probably isn&#x27;t the most environmentally friendly product, but for Latisse I don&#x27;t know if reusing a brush is the best idea. Anyway, it&#x27;s nice but I wish I could buy it in a local store instead of purchasing it online.</li>
    <li> Love these. Excellent for crafts people as well!</li>
    <li> Awesome price for 100 applicators!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these because I hate the big brushes that come with Latisse (eyelash growth solution). These are way better for applying Latisse to your eyelash line and you use way less product! With the big brushes I would get Latisse all over my eyelids but with these I can make a precise line.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for applying for to paper craft projects.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and prevents overuse of product.  Would recommend this for anything that requires very small or intricate tool.</li>
    <li> These were on the same page at the Latisse knock off. I thought they were brushes to apply that product. They weren&#x27;t</li>
    <li> the price was great. but when the tip gets wet it it comes off.i have to use alot of them for a small project.i paint with ink so these won&#x27;t work for me.thanks</li>
    <li> So much better than those silly paint brushes for Latisse!</li>
    <li> Works great for Latisse.</li>
    <li> Very useful for tight spots</li>
    <li> perfect for applying Latisse. The original Latisse brushes waste a lot of product.</li>
    <li> The ad said they were pink however when they arrived they were blue. I am still able to use them but everything else is pink in my salon. I should have sent them back but I needed them.</li>
    <li> Great price and came in a nice package. . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Since several other reviewers commented that they use these for applying Latisse, I ordered them for the same purpose, and they work great!  I usually use one swab to do both eyes, flipping it over so that a fresh side of it is on each eye, and they work really well that way.  You&#x27;re able to get right along the lash line, with no dripping or mess.</li>
    <li> I bought this to apply my Latisse drops and this is the best applicator ever, even better than Latisse&#x27;s original applicator! I am serious, I will not use anything else to apply my drops ever again, because this is perfect. This allows you to apply right against the lid margin and not waste a lot of the drop on the skin! Definitely a great buy!</li>
    <li> excellent price for and excellent product i use these to make my latisse last longer the brushes that come with it uses too much product. these are just right.  my lashes are long and my product is stil going strong</li>
    <li> Despite the reviews I read, I did not find that the applicator worked well. The brushes are very hard.</li>
    <li> Purchased this item specifically for my eyelashes.  Now that I have it, I use for a bunch of other little things around the house.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these for latisse, I highly recommend these for that product. The brushes that come with latisse are hard to use and waste a lot of product.&lt;br /&gt;These are small and easy to apply to your lashes.</li>
    <li> These are awesome Latisse applicators!! Totally recommend these and will continue to order them! They work much better than the applicator brushes that come with Latisse!</li>
    <li> I bought a product to apply to my lashes to thicken and I thought these were actual brushes that I could use with the other product.</li>
    <li> Works well to apply Careprost.  I wish the tips were just slightly bigger though - they are so tiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use with Latisse and i must say it works really well.  I use one brush for both eyes.  Doing it this way saves brushes AND the Latisse, because the sponge tip is so small using one drop coats each lash line thoroughly.  If you try and do two drops, one for each eye, it is really too much and just a waste.</li>
    <li> These micro applicators are perfect for applying Latisse--I like them better than the brushes that come in the Latisse package.  If you buy a generic for Latisse, no brushes are included and you&#x27;ll definitely need to purchase appplicators. It&#x27;s easy to apply the product in a thin line on your eyelid with these micro applicators.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this this product. Fits nice on the hand and is easy to use to remove the eyelash extention</li>
    <li> I have to say, I was a little skeptical about buying these, since so many people recommend that you simply use an eyeliner brush (of which I already have many).  I was a bit worried having to wash the brush repeatedly, so I gave in and purchased these lovely disposables.  Have to say, awesome decision.  Very easy use and cleanup for someone like me who wants to spend minimal time performing nighttime ablutions.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for those using Latisse: I am well into my second month of a 3 ml bottle and there is still a LOT of product left in the bottle.  The brush tips are just the perfect size for delivering the product with minimal loss.  An eyeliner brush, even synthetic, couldn&#x27;t do a better job.  Will continue to use these while I am using Latisse.</li>
    <li> I use these for dermal piercing cleaning there perfect since q tips are just too big</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Works perfectly with Latisse.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it makes removing lash extensions way easier, thanks so so much! Will definitely be back for more future purchases</li>
    <li> These are awesome there are no words. I hate the brush that originally comes with Latisse, it is so stiff and kind of thick and makes it difficult to apply Latisse precisely to your lash line. This brush is a game changer, purchase this you won&#x27;t regret it! I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and I can see that my eyelashes are growing longer and thicker. Better result, no mess, I&#x27;d definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use with Latisse and true to the reviews from other users, it is better at applying (better precision) and uses less of the solution as it doesn&#x27;t suck it all up like the Latisse brushes tend to do.  Great marketing ploy from Latisse to use such crappy brushes so you have to buy more.  Well worth the cost amount, shipping is high but next time I will order a few packs at the same time now that I know this is the product for me.</li>
