<li> The color is saturated and stays put for a long time without drying out.  </li>
<li> and although its a dark shade I can still wear it to work as it is not as dark as the bruised color from the same brand.</li>
<li> It is not quite as dark as I thought it would be, but I would still make the purchase knowing what I know.</li>
<li> The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the weird smell</li>
<li> IT SERIOUSLY FEEL SO CREAMY ON YOUR LIPS</li>
<li> Needless to say it is unuseable.</li>
<li> When I received this lipstick it was hard, sticky, and had a terrible spell.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t rub off too badly.</li>
<li> Very disappointing...</li>

    <li> This color is sooooo pretty! Had to use a lip liner with it though. It would look best on darker girls or really pale girls. It&#x27;s a beautiful purple burgundy with some shimmer. The only thing i didn&#x27;t like was the weird smell but i got over it. Got alot of compliments !</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous color for those who want a deep and rich burgundy lipstick.  The color is saturated and stays put for a long time without drying out.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>

    <li> It is darker than pictured, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. The fact that it&#x27;s kind of matalitic with glitter in it caught me off guard since you don&#x27;t see it in the picture. It came on the third day after it was shipped and it looks really good on. I actually like it.</li>
    <li> This color is darker in person but goes on very sheer. Still love it! Definitely a must have.</li>
