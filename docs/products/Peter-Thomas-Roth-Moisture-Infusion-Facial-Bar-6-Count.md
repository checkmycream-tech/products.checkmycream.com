<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very light feeling, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with adult acne for about a year now and I&#x27;m finding that a regiment of using this at night, along with some benzoyl peroxide treatment and bi monthly facials have done the trick.  My skin is looking amazing.  I discovered this in a Hilton Hotel (thank you, Hilton!) and thought, EH may as well because nothing else was working.  This has really played a part in naturally clearing my skin.  What I like about the product is that, while it is a small bar, it lasts a long time.  Also, all the strange &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; sounding ingredients are all naturally occurring extractions, so you aren&#x27;t putting nasty crap all over your face.  This product works.  Make sure to really rinse after using it because the soap can get stuck in pores and it will stay there.  Just make sure the rinse rinse rinse and you should be fine.  Follow up with a natural moisturizer and you&#x27;re golden!</li>
    <li> It does not dry my skin, excellent soap</li>
    <li> My Grandson&#x27;s face cleared up with these soaps .They do a good job on teenager face</li>
    <li> soaps are good but too smallgood fit</li>
    <li> My wife is the one that enjoys the moisture infusion Facial Bar.  They are costly but anything that is good normally cost.  She says her skin feels so refreshed when she uses the product and doesn&#x27;t feel dry on completion.  What ever it takes to look and feel good is a great investment at any cost.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I encountered this item at a Hamilton Hotel and works great with the face, getting rid of those annoying white heads and other atrocities that mess up your looks! Just clean simple skin!</li>
    <li> I love this soap, silky and very romantic fragnance</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s creamy, smells wonderful and lasts for ever!!! First used the soap at the Hilton Hotel in Bellevue Washington - it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> The cleanest and best.  Skin feels absolutely wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is very creamy, and soft on your skin.</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel soft and look great. Shipping was fast!!!</li>
    <li> great soap, priced correctly , smaller soap bars than normal</li>
    <li> I am allergic to soap,so this find has been the best discovery!!! Have been using it for a month and will never switch to another brand again.It&#x27;s a shame that  I had to wait 60 years to find an answer that was not available or offered by any Doctor.I went to a family wedding and stayed at a Hilton Hotel and that is how I solved my problem with soap.  This was the brand used at the hotel and I fell in love with it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Cleans well and leaves skin pleasantly moist, not greasy or slippery. There is no obnoxious scent, just a very mild smell.</li>
    <li> Great product  , Facial cleaning well , smell good ,quick delivery , would definite recommend to friends</li>
    <li> This has been my facial bar for a couple months now. I first used it when I stayed at the Hilton Hotel in Anaheim, California. I have always struggled to keep my skin acne clean because I have oily skin. When I was staying at the Hilton with my friend, the hotel placed products from Peter Thomas Roth in our bathroom for us to use. I tried the facial bar and I loved what it did for my skin. After only using it for a couple days my skin cleared up. I took two facial bars home and continued using them. I&#x27;ve been using this facial bar for about four months now and am very satisfied with the results. My skin feels soft, is visibly clear and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I highly recommend this facial bar for it has done wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Me too I used it at hilton suite in phoenix AZ and they provide this brand of the soup and shampoos etc. not only the smell is great also it made my skin look super clean with moisture. I also can feel very good and comfortable on my skin. I highly recommend this facial bar to anyone</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t realize how small they are, but they are very creamy and work wonderful.......</li>
    <li> First used this soap at the Hilton in Chicago and fell in love with it.  It&#x27;s easy on the tender facial skin, isn&#x27;t drying or oily, and I intend to use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Great smell and feel, but there should be cheaper options.</li>
    <li> These soaps are awesome. Make the best B.O. dissipate like &amp;#34;it never ever happened.&amp;#34;  Love this smell.</li>
    <li> I liked this bar soap, however it smells like the hotel soaps and this brand has many more facial soaps that are better.  If you want something extremely gentle that will definitely not dry your skin out get the unwrinkled cleanser.  If you have normal skin that just needs a good clean, get the gentle foam cleanser.</li>
    <li> Great product! I really like this product and consider it worthwhile as a possible Christmas gift for family and friends.</li>
    <li> I, too, got this at a hotel.  Bets soap ever.  Cleared up my adult acne.  I can&#x27;t believe a hotel soap cleared up my acne - I can&#x27;t believe it was this simple.</li>
    <li> I started using this face soap while in NYC for work staying at the Hilton Hotel.  I was using the peel pads at the time but not the face soap.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is great....never leaves my skin feeling too dry....a must have in the cold New England winters.  Great for older skin!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and am also sensitive to many fragrances.  This soap smells wonderful and leaves my skin feeling so soft I use it all over, not just on my face.  I only wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> The bars are very small and will only last 5 days. Expensive for their size but will buy the larger size in the future.</li>
    <li> Peter Thomas Roth makes some of my favorite products.  I used to use Dove in the winter when my skin gets dry and I thought it was o.k.  Then I tried this and I was amazed how hydrated my skin felt after using this facial bar.  I became a believer.  These bars are small but each one lasts for weeks and they really do make your skin feel soft and smooth.  And that&#x27;s not easy to say about 55 year- old skin!</li>
    <li> This product is the best of its type I have found.  I am just really dissappointed that more products in this range cannot be shipped to Australia.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a mild bar soap for my face, one that wouldn&#x27;t be drying and I have found it.  These bars aren&#x27;t huge and you do have to be careful to keep them dry between uses.  However, they are wonderful!  Luxurious feeling, they cleanse gently but thoroughly and feel very rich.  My skin is doing very well using this soap.  I prefer bar soap, I don&#x27;t invest a ton of money into various facial cleansers.  My routine is very simple but this soap makes me feel I&#x27;m investing in my skin.</li>
    <li> I love my Peter Thomas Roth Moisture Infusion Facial Bar</li>
    <li> love the smell of the soap. great for the face too</li>
    <li> My husband and I first got to try this soap at a luxury hotel in San Antonio while on vacation.  We decided that when we got home, we would order some.  We did, and we love it!  We feel no tightness to our skin after drying off, and it has a pleasant aroma.</li>
    <li> I had been using the PTR Buffing Beads on my face for a while now, for god knows what reason. First time using this bar left my face smooth, clean, moisturized, you name it. It also made my skin brighter and clearer than the buffing beads, less drying too!</li>
    <li> Nice compact packaging and the soap works well.</li>
    <li> My skin is really sensitive and I have rosacea. Many cleansers irritate my skin. I tried those for the first time as guest in a Hilton hotel and fell in love with this facial bar. I have combination skin and it worked perfectly. Not dry or oily. I especially recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> came in perfect shape and quickly! I loce this clean smelling, not too fragrant soap. Thanks so much for the good product and service.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and have constant  acne prone skin. I have to be strict about what I use on my face. I was at my sisters and forgot my facial cleanser. She gave me what looked like hotel soap, when I saw the brand I felt better.  I never expected bar soap would be okay for my face. My pores look magical. My skin looks great. It even cleared up and healed the existing breakout that I had. it&#x27;s been over a month. With cold water you can see it bead up and roll down face keeping skin moist. After 4 weeks No Acne from this product * I use it most of the time.  * I do use proactive for 2 evenings a month for PMS. * I use Purpose for my eye makeup. × Tip To make bar soap last longer keep it dry -with a raised soap dish also -remove from the packaging to &#x27;prime&#x27; it.</li>
    <li> The soap is for the face because its says so and the size and cost!  I use it all over the body!  It is costly, but feels creamy and does not clog my pores!  Wish they would make a big bar of it at a better price that last longer!  The soap doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in the water or on you!  I feel clean and soft all over after using it in the tub!  I just bought it again! It does take 7 days and free shipping when you buy 2!  You can try it at a Hilton when travelling!  That&#x27;s when I discovered it small box in your bathroom from Peter Roth!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my face when cleaning.  This product is great!!!</li>
    <li> Best facial soap in the world.  I stay at Hilton&#x27;s a lot and discovered them there.  Introduced to my daughter who had horrible skin and had tried everything possible for her skin.  The only product to clear her skin.  A single bar lasts a long time and puts the right amount of moisture in the skin.  I have used nothing else for the last two years. I came down with a bad case of shingles this month and it was the only thing I could use on my face that cleansed but also moisturized without irritating during this dry season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
    <li> I love this soap!  Seller delivered as promised</li>
