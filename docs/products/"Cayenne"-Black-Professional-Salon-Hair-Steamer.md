<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product. I received it 2 days after ordering it. It works really well. I have been natural for 1 year and have 4c hair.. I have a lot of shrinkage and my hair soaks up moisture. The steamer gives me less shrinkage and more moisture. I&#x27;ve used the steamer for the third time this morning and will continue to use it. I have already told my sister and co-worker it is worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that the back of my hair doesn&#x27;t get steamed as well as the front unless I put it up in ponytail and puts it to the top of my head</li>
    <li> I like how hot it gets but it leaks in my clients!</li>
    <li> Cord too short and can&#x27;t use an extension</li>
    <li> terrible product. Ordered two. Neither one worked. The customer service was great. They refunded my purchases immediately</li>
    <li> Very unsatisfied with this product!! Not a professional steamer!! Tried to send it back. Could not send back because it cost 55.00 dollars to send back. Salon guys will not give a free ship return and then there&#x27;s a 20% restocking fee so by the time I return it it would cost what I paid for it. So I&#x27;m stuck with this plastic no good steamer!!! If u are a hair stylist DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Had to give a star to submit, I would give it 0 stars!!</li>
    <li> Love this steamer! Don&#x27;t know how I survived without it. Be cautious as with many steamers the steam build up turns to water while using the steamer and will drip which burns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for less than a week and have used it once. The assembly wasn&#x27;t hard but there wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;fill here mark&amp;#34; on the container like the instructions said so I just filled water almost to the top. It does drip from the hood but placing a towel around your neck will solve that problem. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My first unit quit working after about 2 months.  Power could not be switched on.  I was dumb enough to buy a second unit, because as soon as I turned it on, I heard a spark at the power switch and subsequently only the Low power switch indicated power but no heat was generated.  Very un-reliable or just bad luck??</li>
    <li> leaked all over the floor, water drained out immediately, returned it..</li>
    <li> I love it at first. However, I started to notice the hot condensation will drop from the steamer onto your skin. It&#x27;s really hot and if you&#x27;re not careful, it will burn you.</li>
    <li> ThIs is horrible!  It doesn&#x27;t work when I plugged it in the on switch sparked and made a loud noise. All the pieces are hard plastic.  It never came on.</li>
    <li> Attention! You can only use distilled water! Google cleaning instructions for steamers. So your steamer do not burned out!</li>
    <li> wonderful product. My hair feels softer and glows.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this product it is actually, what it is suppose to be good reasonable price, came in a timely manor. I will be purchasing more.  I love it</li>
    <li> I had a generic steamer that looked like the huetiful steamer. It recently broke down so I decided to replace it. I believe the huetiful steamer is 60-80 dollars so I opted to get this one instead. Why not just get a professional steamer? It&#x27;s really nice quality and I love the versatility of it being on a stand unlike the huetiful. I&#x27;m sitting under it right now and writing this review while watching TV. :) Great investment for your hair. Especially if you have curly hair.</li>
    <li> It was all I expect it to be, I am very please with my Hair Steamer</li>
    <li> use it for mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair with a conditioner.  hair is so soft and well-conditioned after using.  worked really well, easy to put together</li>
    <li> I have had this steamer for about 3 months. I like it so far. It produces a good amount of steam. It is easy to put together. Very sturdy base. Good quality for a cheap price!! Only draw back leaks a little from hood when put all the way down. Nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.</li>
    <li> I have only used my steamer a few times but I am loving it! It is operating as promised by the description. I think it is all worth the investment. I was referred to this streamer by a friend that has enjoyed her&#x27;s about a year...</li>
    <li> Easy assembly, easy instructions, perfect steamer! Nothing else to be said about this great, awesome product. So thankful I purchased it!</li>
    <li> It makes my hair softer, I had a heutiful steamer before it broke and I purchased this one.  The heufitful puts off more steam, I liked it much better took a chance on the Cayenne, it does the job, could be better though</li>
    <li> I am really made up I came across this steamer. I feel like I am the luckiest girl lol... Used it twice so far... hope it last a long time. And it was a very, very reasonable price. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like this steamer thus far. I have used it every week for the past five weeks and my below shoulder length natural hair has been transformed. I discovered I had low porosity hair (For those interested, you can informally test this yourself by plucking a strand of hair from your hair and placing it in a glass of water. If it floats, your hair is low porosity and has trouble receiving and maintaining moisture. Again, this is informal, I have no empirical data to back this up BUT I can tell you what the discovery and my subsequent remedy has done for my hair). As a result of this discovery and my research, I found that steaming made my hair not only moisturized, but my hair experienced no shrinkage or that day or two after dryness that often accompanies natural hair and shampooing. This result has been consistent each and every time I used my steamer.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first steamer purchase and it was relatively easy to assemble and use. It took me give or take ten minutes to attach all of the pieces. The only issue I had was the attachment of the roller wheels to the pole of dryer. They did not stay on and I remedied this by using gorilla glue along the areas in which the wheels and the pole attached. The only caveat is that I won&#x27;t be able to remove them for transport; but I will work around that. This is also the reason I gave the product three stars.&lt;br /&gt;The basins which hold the water that condenses into steam are located behind the hood of the dryer and underneath the hood of the dryer. Although there is no fill line, I fill the containers almost to the brim, and they attach with no difficulty. I turn the timer to about 25 minutes (five minutes to warm up), where I also turn on both the high and low setting. After about five minutes I sit under the dryer,for the remaining 20 minutes on the low setting only. I only utilize the steamer for 20 minutes as my research has found that anything beyond that is counterproductive and possibly damaging to your hair. I do not wear a plastic cap, I simply gather my hair into a loose ponytail at the top of my hair. This assures that the ends of my hair receive the moisture producing benefits of the steam. The back of my hair is steamed with no problem as well. Should the steam become too hot, there is a vent in the front of the dryer that can be opened or closed with ease, to allow for additional airflow.&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, as this steamer is in use, you will experience water dripping from the condensation. It does not burn, andI simply put a towel around my neck to solve this problem. I also use distilled or purified water in my steamer. I live in an area where the tap water is just NASTY, I certainly don&#x27;t want those sediments being steamed in my hair (yes I know I wash and rinse my hair with it, but you know what I&#x27;m saying). If you find purchasing water to pricey, you can also boil your tap water. I also try to use conditioner that has as many natural ingredients as possible, to which I add my own natural oils and shea butter.&lt;br /&gt;Again, this product has revolutionized my hair, eliminating shrinkage, retaining moisture and most importantly length. I don&#x27;t have to use as much moisture producing products as I used to as the steam and the conditioner literally for lack of better wording, is \\&quot;baked\\&quot; into my hair. My hair now is completely different from the hair I had prior to this purchase.

    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once but it seems to work just fine. Feels nice to steam my scalp. Gets very hot though so the low setting is best. Mine didn&#x27;t drip at all.</li>
    <li> Works awesome...super easy to put together...still needs a max fill line on the bottle though!!! Great value for the price</li>
    <li> I use the hair steamer and an hour later my hair still was not dry.&lt;br /&gt;Did I do something wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about sending the hair steamer back, I decided to try&lt;br /&gt;it for a second time next week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you Know how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Betty Wilson</li>
    <li> I like it easy to symbol delivery was on timeThe only thing is the water sometimes drips when it starts getting really steamy but it is easy to fix it I just wrap a towel around me or turn the heat down our open up the little vent thing</li>
    <li> My clients are exited about a new service. It is easy to assemble, and move around.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed improvement on the natural hair. Hope it can last a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;www.naturalhairjourney.com</li>
    <li> LOVE IT, WOULD HAVE GOTTEN 5 STARS IF THE HOT STEAM DID NOT DRIP ON SKIN</li>
    <li> love the convenience of having a steamer but the wheels don&#x27;t move smoothly- it appears like a cheap plastic. Other than that so far so good. Good price</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she LOVES IT!</li>
    <li> My wife just loves her Cayenne&amp;#34; Black Professional Salon Hair, since she when natural..</li>
    <li> My only issue was a little leaking. But now its not leaking anymore</li>
    <li> It leaks hot water all over you its so annoying. How dare this steamer be over $100 and burn you the way it does. If I had any sense I would have returned it and purchased another one.</li>
    <li> I Previously owned a huetiful, but after my move I could not take it with me, so decided to upgrade to this steamer and i love it. No leaking on my neck and no awkwardly placing the huetiful to fit my head. this does it. It also reaches all of my hair with ease (APL natural) I also have a video where I show how I use it and incorporate it into my wash day   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;vrwA9I8ZGyc</li>
    <li> I love my steamer, it works really well and leaves hair really soft. My first one had issues, so i called and they immediately sent me another. the only problem is that the instructions should be more detailed.</li>
