      <li>product is amazing</li>
      <li>Still loving it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>it is the best, my mother who was a Vogue model and 89 years old is still using it...</li>
      <li>This is the perfect makeup for those blessed  with beautiful skin and those needing some coverage as it can be applied lightly or more heavily and look spectacular.</li>
      <li>I am delighted to be able to find it so easily.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully will be able to find it again.</li>
      <li>love this product.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
      <li>Just as I remember for so many years.</li>
      <li>She has been so pleased that it is still available--</li>
      <li>Covers amazing, but it takes some getting used to at first.  </li>
      <li>CONTRARY to the reviews, you may apply this makeup as lightly as you like.  </li>
      <li>People often comment on how nice my skin is, (for an old lady), and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this make-up.  </li>
      <li>Goes on cool and smooth with water.  </li>
      <li>Since Max Factor&#x27;s Pan-Cake was first introduced it has always been my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Also,it&#x27;s good for moderate oily skin!</li>
      <li>Now my big decision...should I get a couple more just to be on the safe side?  </li>
      <li>and I recently bought her Ben Nye Color Cake Foundation in the color Cine Fair, and she said it was the same, and is pleased with it</li>
      <li>Right after application, my face looks a bit over powdered and chalky.</li>
      <li>Make sure you match the color to your natural complexion and if you have a seasonal tan, you will obviously need to keep more than one color on hand.</li>
      <li>only place that I was able to find it was here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I first was introduced to this item when I was</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>It takes the extra off and leaves my skin unbelievably even and perfect.  </li>
      <li>It is great because it has no oils or anything that makes my acne worse.  </li>
      <li>It covers well, and has a uniform appearance, all while being gentle on all types of skin.  </li>
      <li>When I heard that it was no longer available in my local stores</li>
      <li>Cost to much.  </li>
      <li>Are you for real???</li>
      <li>It has become very pricy.</li>
      <li>Thanks Max Factor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure you can find a match with the other colors they offer if you need it as well.</li>
      <li>I have used this makeup since I was in high school</li>
      <li>so I will be finding a new make up.</li>
      <li>You MUST SIMPLY use a large natural silk sponge.  </li>
      <li>Pankace Tan #1 is Max Factor&#x27;s professional makeup.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my mother in law, as she has used it all her life and has found it increasingly hard to fine.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve only purchased one of them.  </li>
      <li>and you will find it for about $8.99 ( a very common online drugstore carries it) and has free shipping if you spend $50.  </li>

<li> great product but outrageously overpriced...</li>
<li> I have tried other foundations to no avail.</li>
<li> Too bad it is becoming so hard to find and so expensive...don&#x27;t know what to use as a foundation...</li>
<li> but.... If you have never used it.....picking your shade will be a little tuff.</li>
<li> For my surprise I did find it not easy though so far&lt;br /&gt;the</li>

<li> Then, as usual, Amazon came to my rescue.  </li>
<li> So I hope this review helps out the die hard PANCAKE MAKE UP fans like myself.</li>
<li> /&gt;Overall at least I have one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arlene</li>
<li> I bought this for the past 45 years and now I will have to find another product because it is to expensive to use.</li>
<li> Very hard to find.  </li>
<li> I spray mine with water and use my fingers to apply it as a thin liquid makeup.  </li>
<li> You can go thin or continue to layer.  </li>
<li> I paid no more than $12.00 dollars when you could buy it in the store!!!!</li>
<li> but the price now on this is way too expensive</li>
<li> You know the one I mean!!!  </li>
<li> The asking prices for it now is ridiculous!!!</li>
<li> I got this horrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> In my estimation amazon is #1.  The order was filled immediately and the product - Max Factor Pan-Cake Makeup - is great.  Just as I remember for so many years.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother in law, as she has used it all her life and has found it increasingly hard to fine.  She has been so pleased that it is still available--kudos to Amazon!--and says it is the best make up she has ever used.  I am delighted to be able to find it so easily.  It covers well, and has a uniform appearance, all while being gentle on all types of skin.  A great product!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s with that price???? Are they kidding??? I paid no more than $12.00 dollars when you could buy it in the store!!!! But GOOD NEWS!!!! I found one that&#x27;s comparable to MAX FACTOR ..... It&#x27;s called PALLIDO and you can purchase it at SALLY BEAUTY SUPPLY FOR $10.99. Cheaper if you have their member card. Amazon sells the brand.. but.... If you have never used it.....picking your shade will be a little tuff. So I hope this review helps out the die hard PANCAKE MAKE UP fans like myself. Also,it&#x27;s good for moderate oily skin!</li>
    <li> My mother is 82 and used the Max Factor Pan Cake in Tan No.1 for 50 years and I recently bought her Ben Nye Color Cake Foundation in the color Cine Fair, and she said it was the same, and is pleased with it and it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. Don&#x27;t let people rip you off anymore with this discontinued product. I&#x27;m sure you can find a match with the other colors they offer if you need it as well.</li>
    <li> Cost to much.  I bought this for the past 45 years and now I will have to find another product because it is to expensive to use.</li>
    <li> great product but outrageously overpriced...</li>
    <li> have been using this makeup for 54 years.  my skin is perfect and and it doesn&#x27;t clog pores like some of the liquid makeup.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I have used it for years.  I&#x27;m happy I can get this great makeup on Amazon.  It has flawless coverage.  It is water based so no need to worry about an unattractive oily finish.  I love it.  Thanks Max Factor.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Amazon to the Rescue!\\&quot;    Pan-cake makeup has been a \\&quot;staple\\&quot; in my home for close to 60 years.  Since Max Factor&#x27;s Pan-Cake was first introduced it has always been my favorite.  People often comment on how nice my skin is, (for an old lady), and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because of this make-up.  When I heard that it was no longer available in my local stores I got this horrible sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.  You know the one I mean!!!  Then, as usual, Amazon came to my rescue.  I love you \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;!  So far I&#x27;ve only purchased one of them.  Now my big decision...should I get a couple more just to be on the safe side?  What do you think?</li>
    <li> Excellent makeup - Can I purchase it at a lower price ?</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and now can&#x27;t find it in stores but the price now on this is way too expensive so I will be finding a new make up.</li>
    <li> Are you for real??? At that price I&#x27;ll go without!!!</li>
    <li> Pankace Tan #1 is Max Factor&#x27;s professional makeup.  It covers my face beautifully, and I always get compliments on my looks.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot do without Max Factor&#x27;s Tan #1.</li>
    <li> My mother was a model and this is the only makeup she used her entire life.  This is the only makeup I have ever used. CONTRARY to the reviews, you may apply this makeup as lightly as you like.  You MUST SIMPLY use a large natural silk sponge.  Soak the sponge in tap water, squeeze it out, and apply the makeup. It blends to perfection into your hairline and neck area.  Make sure you match the color to your natural complexion and if you have a seasonal tan, you will obviously need to keep more than one color on hand. This is the perfect makeup for those blessed  with beautiful skin and those needing some coverage as it can be applied lightly or more heavily and look spectacular.</li>
    <li> it is the best, my mother who was a Vogue model and 89 years old is still using it...I am 57 and been wearing it since I was 16..I have tried other foundations to no avail. This gives the best coverage and looks great. Too bad it is becoming so hard to find and so expensive...don&#x27;t know what to use as a foundation...anything out there similar...suggestions please??</li>
    <li> I love this makeup.  Goes on cool and smooth with water.  You can go thin or continue to layer.  Covers anything and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I first was introduced to this item when I was a teenager 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and continue using it for years until one day I just couldn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;ind it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Few months ago my youngest daughter said to me why don&#x27;t you try&lt;br /&gt;to get it online.  For my surprise I did find it not easy though so far&lt;br /&gt;the only place that I was able to find it was here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing it covers every detail in your face and you&lt;br /&gt;look like you don&#x27;t have any make up on at all ....Still loving it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain will be too expensive $$$$ for a product this old.&lt;br /&gt;And why none of the stores sells it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall at least I have one now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arlene</li>
    <li> love this product. It has become very pricy. It does last a long time</li>
    <li> Covers amazing, but it takes some getting used to at first.  I spray mine with water and use my fingers to apply it as a thin liquid makeup.  Right after application, my face looks a bit over powdered and chalky. I give it a minute to dry and rub my dry hands over my face as if I am rubbing it off.  It takes the extra off and leaves my skin unbelievably even and perfect.  It is great because it has no oils or anything that makes my acne worse.  The closest comparison for me is the look of airbrushed makeup. This is NOT the place to buy it.  Do your homework shopping online and you will find it for about $8.99 ( a very common online drugstore carries it) and has free shipping if you spend $50.  Don&#x27;t buy it here unless you want to be ripped off.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for.  Very hard to find.  Hopefully will be able to find it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this makeup since I was in high school and it was maybe 4.99.  The asking prices for it now is ridiculous!!!</li>
