<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These hairpins were a little hard to stay in hair, very pretty though.</li>
    <li> A really cute, albeit expensive, addition to Princess Elsa&#x27;s beautiful wig we bought.</li>
    <li> Icing on her costume.</li>
    <li> These are great! We wear them in a wig and we wear them in our hair. Great quality; they sparkle and look fantastic!</li>
    <li> These were absolutely wonderful. I didn&#x27;t even realize that Elsa, the character had these clips.</li>
    <li> These are very cute hair pins my daughter will love.</li>
    <li> These were really pretty in person. They looked great in my niece&#x27;s braided Elsa wig.</li>
    <li> Great to go with the Elsa wig I purchased for my great niece. Can&#x27;t wait to see her all dressed up and singing. It came in time for Christmas.. All Frozen stuff wiped off the counters locally. I appreciate the product being available online and at a good price.</li>
    <li> These hair clip are beautiful and are going to go great with my daughter outfit. Completes the whole outfit and appears very well made and I know my daughter is going to love these</li>
    <li> this is a nice wig, but it&#x27;s too small for my 7 years old, we had to return it.</li>
    <li> Very cute, but fragile.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and good quality.</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Stays in hair nicely.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these hairpins!!! these hairpins came in 11 days earlier than they were expected and they were in great condition! Like others have said, the picture does not show how beautiful these truly are! I would buy these again!!!! if you are wanting to get an Elsa costume I would recommend these, I may not have the whole costume yet but they are a great start! They do take a while to come in, since they are imported from China, but they are worth the wait!</li>
    <li> These were perfect and are a little bigger than I thought they would be.</li>
    <li> looked great in the wig and my daughter still wears them.</li>
    <li> If you know someone that is a frozen fan they will love this. These are beautiful and sparkly</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVES these hair clips. They are very sturdy. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very thin and these hold well in her hair.</li>
    <li> nice but had one pin that was defective</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheesy costume wigs in stores. This wig takes the cake. Everyone likes it and asks where we got it. The childrens costume wig went into the trsh can when this arrived as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I love these hair clips! They are strong and stay in place in my daughter&#x27;s hair all day keeping the bangs out of her eyes. They match perfectly with the dress I bought her for Christmas with Elsa on it.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if these would stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair, but they do!  They looked beautiful!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my costume! They turned out to be better quality than I expected, a huge plus. Perfect size to be noticeable, but not garish. I&#x27;m terribly pleased.</li>
    <li> Nice for an Elsa costume works but the gems fell out after wearing a couple times.</li>
    <li> Very nice good quality. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Love love love these for Elsa wig gave the perfect finishing touches to my daughters wig and overall costume</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for. Sparkly and pretty!</li>
    <li> Pretty, but several gems came loose during shipment. Little super glue fixed it right up.</li>
    <li> Frozen Priincess Snow Queen Elsa hairpins BREAK REAL EASY VERY DISAPPIONTING</li>
    <li> Beautiful pins. Arrived in good condition, appearance as expected.</li>
    <li> My grandaughter loved this.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, but broke the first time wearing them</li>
    <li> The product is well made and looks great but doesn&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
    <li> Cute, but cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Lovely, very durable, exactly what I was expecting. The bobby pins are  tight and will take wear to loosen then up a bit, but they hold in my hair wonderfully. I added some close up photos just to show details.</li>
    <li> My daughter&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve these as do I</li>
    <li> We were excited when they arrived but they broke after first wear.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy with the quality at all.</li>
    <li> These were delivered as expected. Pretty and inexpensive, perfect for a 2 year old.</li>
    <li> Love it! My daughter got them for part of her Halloween costume and has been wearing them ever since then. They hold up well and not cheap or flimsy looking</li>
    <li> My niece loved these.  The only thing is that the bobby pins are really tight and can pull out hair, so just place them in the braid without putting the hair in the middle.  The barett is fine.</li>
    <li> daughter was happy with these</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use and look so beautiful in my daughters hair. She simply loves them and so do I. She can wear them for a whole day and they won&#x27;t fall out so secure nicely. She is two years old and very very active. I&#x27;m super happy with them.</li>
    <li> These are pretty but several of the stones fell out as I was simply removing the clips from the packaging. Don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
    <li> These clips are awesome and look really good.  Great find for a good price!</li>
    <li> Perfect addition for any princess being Elsa for a day :-) My daughter loved them for her Elsa Halloween costume and still puts them in her hair when she plays dress up. Great quality, not cheapo. Pretty accurate color blue that matches Elsa&#x27;s dress.</li>
    <li> Very nice hairpins and clip - arrived in time for Christmas!</li>
    <li> These pins are awesome!  We put them in my daughter&#x27;s wig that went with her Elsa dress for 2014 Halloween and we received lots of compliments on the snowflake pins.  A great touch to her costume!</li>
    <li> The small hair pins are great. Disappointed that the big hair clip had 2 loose gems that fell off before I even got to use it in my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> The piece of hair/braid did not stay on the head of our 6 yr. old grand daughter and she was quite frustrated by this.&lt;br /&gt;She won&#x27;t be able to wear it.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> So far these seem to be pretty sturdy. The metal on the bobby pins are rugged, and the snowflakes seem to be on there pretty well. I am expecting the little gems to fall out over time, which is normal, but overall they are really cute in person, they&#x27;re not too tiny, and it came with so many that I can give a couple to my niece and keep a couple for myself :)</li>
    <li> Pretty, but heavy. Hopefully not too heavy for the young girl I&#x27;m buying them for. Also, they are not a Disney product so I am wondering how they can use that in their title. It doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the product, but when you are buying them as a gift for a 5-year old, it could matter.</li>
    <li> These Hair clips are beautiful, just like the picture. Would recommend these to anyone. Thank you for such a great product at a good price</li>
    <li> Got these for my Dauther&#x27;s Elsa costume. They stayed in her braid all night through a rainy Trick-Or-Treating adventure. They&#x27;ll be just as cute with her Christmas dress!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about how gorgeous this wig is. We got it for my daughter to dress up as Elsa and it&#x27;s so perfect. So soft like real hair. Unlike the plastic feeling wigs u can buy at the stores. Only down side is waiting for it to arrive from China. Took about 3 weeks but we&#x27;ll worth the wait. Beautiful wig!</li>
    <li> At first glance you may think these are cheap plastic hair pieces, but you would be incorrect. Metal and the blue is a beautiful bright color.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and just as beautiful as they are in the picture.</li>
    <li> Very nice hair clips just what was needed for the final touch to my daughters elsa costume.  Price was right and would recommend!!</li>
    <li> These hair pins are very beautiful!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed if you order them.  They are even prettier than the picture.</li>
    <li> I love the large snowflake - it retains hair so well. The smaller bobby pin snowflakes are hard to spread apart and keep the two ends apart to put in hair. It seems the smaller snowflake pins just are thicker than regular pins, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> These hairpins are beautiful, as well as heavy duty!  They look look just like the one Elsa has in her hair in Frozen, I bought them to go with the Anangel wig for my daughter for Halloween.  They are highly polished and the blue stones are beautiful.  The big snowflake is a clasp clip, but there are a lot of metal teeth in the main piece of the hairpin so it actually holds  my daughter&#x27;s very fine hair back if she wears it.  The smaller hairpins are equally beautiful, but for us, they will only work in the wig, because if you have fine hair, they won&#x27;t stay.  Obviously not a deal breaker though because we bought these for dress up purpose and it&#x27;s a bonus that she can use one in every day life!</li>
    <li> Lovely hairpins and clip are just the perfect accessory for my daughter&#x27;s Elsa costume!!  She loves them!</li>
    <li> Very cute hair pieces. The reason i only gave it 2 stars is because one of them was missing a blue rhinestone.</li>
    <li> Very cute and looks just as pictured and stayed put in my daughters hair for her frozen party.</li>
    <li> Hair pins are beautiful.  Just as described.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re gorgeous andi was so excited to put them in my hair, but just as I opened the large clip, it broke. The saudering to hold the clip part failed, so I can&#x27;t pin it in my hair now. Still pretty satisfied with the little bobby pins though.</li>
    <li> They look great, fun add to the white wig.  The grandkids enjoy, I like them.  Shipped quick, not damaged, holds up well so far.</li>
    <li> They are so beautiful and I get so many compliments!</li>
    <li> Very cute for the price.</li>
    <li> Arrived JUST in time for my costume party. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for an Elsa costume.  These would be great for cosplay too!</li>
    <li> Cute and reasonable price. Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s Elsa costume.  Product arrived in less than two weeks.</li>
    <li> Product as promised and super fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> received well ahead of schedule and they are perfectly beautiful!</li>
    <li> Was much better looking than I expected.</li>
    <li> I received the hairpins with a missing rhinestone on one of them and was not happy about it. I looked for the gem in the bag before I even opened it so I could glue it back on, but was not even shipped with it. Makes me wonder how long the other rhinestone will stay on for. Not worth your $8.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves them..she wares the hair pins without the wigas well.</li>
    <li> It looks nice. It doesn&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
    <li> It was a perfect touch on the Elsa wig I bought for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!  Grandbaby feels like a princess!</li>
    <li> I loved them would recommend them to others</li>
    <li> love the hair clips!!</li>
    <li> Much nicer then expected, well worth the money. Shipping was fast to.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Product was a showstopper! A must buy!</li>
    <li> Very cute for holloween costume!  Will stay on.  Watch out when taking them off.  Could take some hair with it if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Nice sparkle! Lovely pieces!</li>
    <li> Received very fast just as described a perfect addition to any Elsa costume.</li>
    <li> Very pretty addition to the wig.</li>
    <li> Received several compliments when our daughter wore these for Halloween dressed as Elsa.</li>
    <li> the clips were great, but they were bobby pin clips which were hard to get into the hair and the end clip wouldnt clip on the end of the pony tail, the clip was too small. but we made them work and once in the hair looked great.</li>
    <li> Very pretty &amp; sparkly!!!</li>
    <li> Many of the jewels had fallen out of the structure when product was received.</li>
    <li> Looks great! Thanks! Check out my page! :) www.facebook.com/facepaintdesigns</li>
    <li> They are somewhat i didnt expect. I should&#x27;ve payed attention better when seeing the pictures. Now i think. The price is to high for what i got.</li>
    <li> These really compliment the blonde wig.  We love them and they arrived much quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> not as picture fits too small,I purchase this for my 4yr old</li>
    <li> Perfect to top off the Elsa costume. :)</li>
    <li> We purchased this product for our daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  After wearing the larger hair clip twice, the clip broke.  One side of the snowflake clip completely broke off while I was trying to put it into her hair.  Basically, the metal is flimsy and pushing on it to &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; the clip into her hair caused it to bend and then just break off.  Very weak metal and poor design for a hair clip.  They are very pretty though.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful but I had to glue a ton of the stones back on the big pin which was very difficult cause they are tiny and then I lost a few.</li>
    <li> Delivery was estimated at thirty fays, arrived in about ten. Beautiful, well crafted, excellent quality hair pins! They are heavy and sturdy and look like they will stand years of wear. I bought this to complete my daughter&#x27;s Elsa costume, it&#x27;s perfect and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d my package today after a long wait and turns out to be wrong item.  I rec&#x27;d a wig (assuming one in picture) with no hair pins.</li>
    <li> Luvd this, got them in time! Very happy with this purchase...</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I wore them  in my braid for my Halloween costume . They looked just like Elsa .</li>
    <li> These hair pins are absolutely adorable. I bought them to go with a dress for my Winter Formal. The theme is &amp;#34;Frozen In Time&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m going for an Elsa look and these pins complete the look! I would HIGHLY recommend getting these!</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of hairpins. Only received one set and contacted the company. They were so nice and apologized for the mistake. Sent me another set, including an extra large pin and a scarf for the error. These are so beautiful and the girls loved them. I would recommend this company for their products!!</li>
