      <li>What good is that??  </li>

      <li>They&#x27;re also good for flossing, &amp; my family &amp; friends like them .</li>
      <li>love them, they are much  better than wood, and are great on the mouth</li>

      <li>Love them and share them with friends.</li>
      <li>Love this product</li>
      <li>my family love these picks.</li>
      <li>So glad I found them..</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
      <li>Great product, thanks for your site.</li>
      <li>We and all our guests love it.</li>
      <li>We use this product for many years.</li>
      <li>Great for cleaning teeth when no floss is handy, these flat picks easily get between the teeth.</li>
      <li>Glad they are available online.</li>
      <li>They break EXTREMELY easily and there is no mint scent/flavor/taste at ALL.</li>
      <li>that said they were still strong and basically just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I pay.&lt;br /&gt;The size and shape of these picks seem just fine to me, I&#x27;ve used the beige colored ones for years and nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I hope it will be available in any supermarket soon as used to be.</li>
      <li>The angle is what makes these unique.  </li>
      <li>good quality as expected</li>
      <li>But for me they are just right</li>
      <li>This is what I was shopping for but it does not work as good as the old ones I had years earlier.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re better than the wooden toothpicks.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve looked all over for them because I could not recall where I had first bought them.</li>
      <li>This was unexpected and fantastic.</li>
      <li>It works but not my first choice.</li>
      <li>These toothpicks are hollow and very cheap.</li>
      <li>, I think they hold up very well.</li>
      <li>They are just as effective, but I LOVE the DARK GREEN picks.</li>
      <li>They are much better than wood and other plastic brush type picks.</li>
      <li>they were a very light green...</li>
      <li>Too Loud!!</li>
      <li>These new ones are nylon?</li>
      <li>Durable, thick but not too thick, curve is perfect.</li>
      <li>Also, we can accept returns on Health care products.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Though the second phrase contradicts the first, they did not send me a return label.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Call me picky (pardon the pun), but I LOVED the old style DARK GREEN MicroPicks, like seen in the picture.</li>
      <li>The old ones seemed to be of a plastic&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really thinking about sending them all back for a refund.  </li>
      <li>I hate it when a good company goes cheap.  </li>
      <li>types are of different material then older style.</li>
      <li>, it makes it easy to get at hard to reach areas.</li>
      <li>My original shipment was lost in the post office, they immediately replaced the missing items and added extra bonus ones to compensate.  </li>

<li> My original shipment was lost in the post office, they immediately replaced the missing items and added extra bonus ones to compensate.  </li>
<li> Also some of the very tips of the tooth picks were black!</li>
<li> They sent me a strange note: &amp;#34;The toothpicks are NOT unbreakable.</li>
<li> but I don&#x27;t like that they have a sharp piece of plastic right where you put you fingers to grip it, plus they could round them up a little bit</li>
<li> , they are sort of hard to get between your teeth, will try a different brand next time</li>
<li> These were all that I expected them to be.</li>
<li> These picks used to be thin enough to actually work.  </li>
<li> Also the Amazon shipping charge was way less than the shipping on the Armonds website.</li>
<li> (dark green</li>
<li> they also had a little abrasive feel on your teeth that made</li>
<li> I bought both styles of these, the green are suppose to be anti-Microbial</li>
<li> The ones I get when ordered now, are some NEON GREEN color.</li>
<li> A few things to comment on...</li>
<li> I found it impossible to find these picks in any local stores so if these specific picks are what you need your gonna have to get</li>
<li> The pick is a little too thick to get in between some teeth.</li>
<li> Unavailable in our small town.</li>
<li> hate having to pay so much for tooth picks</li>
<li> hate to think that customer compromise is the new norm and that you should never expect to receive what is specifically advertised but all and all</li>
<li> The picks now bend when you use them and are so thick you can&#x27;t get inbetween your teeth!  </li>
<li> My comment to the company was: &amp;#34;The quality is poor, not the way it used to be, breaks in two pieces&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This new order of picks are terrible.  </li>
<li> weird.</li>
<li> and had very thin ends</li>
<li> Really, really disappointed.</li>
<li> The product has changed to a flimsy, horribly produced product.  </li>

    <li> Have been looking for these for years.  They just don&#x27;t have them in stores anymore.  Great for that quick pick when you don&#x27;t have time to floss.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MicroPicks for years and loved them.  This new order of picks are terrible.  The product has changed to a flimsy, horribly produced product.  The picks now bend when you use them and are so thick you can&#x27;t get inbetween your teeth!  What good is that??  I hate it when a good company goes cheap.  I&#x27;m really thinking about sending them all back for a refund.  Really, really disappointed.</li>
    <li> thank goodness we found these!!! These are the best toothpicks out there!</li>
    <li> My comment to the company was: &amp;#34;The quality is poor, not the way it used to be, breaks in two pieces&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it.&lt;br /&gt;But Armonds Manufacturing, Inc. refused. They sent me a strange note: &amp;#34;The toothpicks are NOT unbreakable. Also, we can accept returns on Health care products.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Though the second phrase contradicts the first, they did not send me a return label.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not big money, I will survive. But will not buy anything from these guys.</li>
    <li> These picks used to be thin enough to actually work.  The overall design is the same but the thickness won&#x27;t work for me anymore.  This was my favorite pick.  Not anymore.</li>
    <li> Call me picky (pardon the pun), but I LOVED the old style DARK GREEN MicroPicks, like seen in the picture. The ones I get when ordered now, are some NEON GREEN color. Too Loud!! They are just as effective, but I LOVE the DARK GREEN picks. Any chance of bringing that color back? Your star rating is guaranteed to go UP one, if you bring it back.</li>
    <li> These were all that I expected them to be. Another reviewer thought that they were too flexible. But for me they are just right, I think they hold up very well. I especially like the angled tip on one end, it makes it easy to get at hard to reach areas. They are much better than wood and other plastic brush type picks. I will purchase these again. Also the Amazon shipping charge was way less than the shipping on the Armonds website.</li>
    <li> They are fairly good but I don&#x27;t like that they have a sharp piece of plastic right where you put you fingers to grip it, plus they could round them up a little bit, they are sort of hard to get between your teeth, will try a different brand next time</li>
    <li> Great product, thanks for your site.</li>
    <li> good quality as expected</li>
    <li> Glad to find these.  Unavailable in our small town. Glad they are available online. Durable, thick but not too thick, curve is perfect.</li>
    <li> A few things to comment on...&lt;br /&gt;First of all I found it impossible to find these picks in any local stores so if these specific picks are what you need your gonna have to get em online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate having to pay so much for tooth picks but I haven&#x27;t found anything like these anywhere else so I pay.&lt;br /&gt;The size and shape of these picks seem just fine to me, I&#x27;ve used the beige colored ones for years and nothing else comes close.&lt;br /&gt;When I received my picks they weren&#x27;t the color that they are in this picture (dark green I&#x27;m told) they were a very light green...weird. Also some of the very tips of the tooth picks were black! They looked like they had been burned! It seems to be some sort of defect, it doesn&#x27;t scratch off or anything it&#x27;s just odd.&lt;br /&gt;All that said they were still strong and basically just what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to think that customer compromise is the new norm and that you should never expect to receive what is specifically advertised but all and all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Work perfect! We and all our guests love it. We use this product for many years. I hope it will be available in any supermarket soon as used to be.</li>
    <li> These toothpicks are hollow and very cheap. They break EXTREMELY easily and there is no mint scent/flavor/taste at ALL. I had a box of the white ones years ago and I absolutely LOVED them! We could never find them in a store and I was so happy when I found them online...go back to making them the way your USED to please!</li>
    <li> love them, they are much  better than wood, and are great on the mouth</li>
    <li> The angle is what makes these unique.  Everyone should have these; they do a great job!  Love them and share them with friends.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere else.  great</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning teeth when no floss is handy, these flat picks easily get between the teeth.</li>
    <li> This is what I was shopping for but it does not work as good as the old ones I had years earlier.  The pick is a little too thick to get in between some teeth. It works but not my first choice.</li>
    <li> I bought both styles of these, the green are suppose to be anti-Microbial I can&#x27;t verify that.&lt;br /&gt;Both types are of different material then older style. The old ones seemed to be of a plastic&lt;br /&gt;material and had very thin ends they also had a little abrasive feel on your teeth that made&lt;br /&gt;them feel they were doing a good job. These new ones are nylon? and glide like waxed dental&lt;br /&gt;floss (which I don&#x27;t like). I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Love this product</li>
    <li> Yes, I have been looking for these for several years.. my family love these picks. So glad I found them..</li>
    <li> My husband loves these and I&#x27;ve looked all over for them because I could not recall where I had first bought them. He is very happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them before.  They&#x27;re better than the wooden toothpicks.  They don&#x27;t break.  They&#x27;re also good for flossing, &amp; my family &amp; friends like them .</li>
    <li> Armonds Manufacturing, Inc. was excellent to deal with.  My original shipment was lost in the post office, they immediately replaced the missing items and added extra bonus ones to compensate.  This was unexpected and fantastic.</li>
    <li> These are great reusable pics and highly satisfied with this produce, will recommend to friends and re-order! Thanks Armonds Manufacturing, INC. for a wonderful product.</li>
