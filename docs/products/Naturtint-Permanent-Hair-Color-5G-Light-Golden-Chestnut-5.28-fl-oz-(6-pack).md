      <li>Love this hair color.</li>
      <li>I had pictures taken of the boxes and they kept asking for more information and it went on for over a month.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>and I get many compliments about the color (from hairdressers, too)</li>
      <li>The color is better than before I started greying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My hair is as healthy as ever and is not damaged at all.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied with this order.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally i find the right  product for good price.</li>
      <li>It covers most of 98% greys but some stubborn ones near my ears (I guess you would call them sideburns, lol)</li>
      <li>Good make my hair feel soft an nice</li>
      <li>Free from ammonia, your hair will love the tender care.  </li>
      <li>it covers my gray, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t fade and it&#x27;s the healthiest hair color I can find.</li>
      <li>wife says that Naturtint works good for her and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>It seems more effective to apply it when it is still clear, before the dye has oxidized,&lt;br /</li>
      <li>This will smooth out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap buy multi-pack in one time.</li>
      <li>It is NOT Lt. Golden Chestnut (2-3 shades darker), but I still love it.</li>
      <li>Permanent hair color 5G from NATURTINT, light golden&lt;</li>
      <li>It is shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>This will smooth out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All SLS free shampoos do this.  </li>
      <li>but I am not 100% happy with the results on my grey hair around my temples (color is brassy and doesn&#x27;t take well).  </li>
      <li>Thanks for fast shipping and good product.</li>
      <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair ...</li>
      <li>I have been using this hair dye for a couple of years now in 5G Light Golden Chesnut.  </li>
      <li>It is the most non toxic of its kind...made in Italy and covers and lasts really well.</li>
      <li>It is more gentle</li>
      <li>The color is true to the box.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I searched around for a more practical alternative that was still pretty good for my hair and, after trying several demis and semis that faded super fast, I found this.  </li>
      <li>I started greying very young and until 30, they were concentrated into two interesting streaks on the sides of my head.  </li>
      <li>I am so glad that I can purchase directly from the manufacturer for 50% off.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is worth buying this 6 pack.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this for years, and I really like the rich color.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s ok with me since I had come to accept that I would need to go with a more conventional permanent hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product easy to use cover my roots and the color is exactly like I choose&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love Naturtint permanent hair color, because it hasnt peroxyde, and care your hair, you will have softer hair and the color its right, the same you look in the picture of the box.</li>
      <li>Use some extra moisturizing conditioner if you need more</li>
      <li>In recent years, the greys started spreading around my temples and become more furious.</li>
      <li>It covers grey pretty well most of the time&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most people have no idea I color unless they knew me before when I had my grey</li>
      <li>The color is very nice and natural looking, especially on brown hair as described above.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than going to the salon</li>
      <li>I really value access to this product and have been using it for a couple years.</li>
      <li>but I do use a whole bottle.  </li>
      <li>and I always color around my hairline and temples first so those are really being processed almost 1.5 hours since it takes nearly 30 minutes to apply.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have to leave it on for over an hour to get full grey coverage consistently</li>
      <li>than most conventional permanent hair dye being ammonia and sodium lauryl sulfate free&lt;</li>
      <li>It is brassy and too light on the grey hairs.  </li>
      <li>So for the healthy aspects I don&#x27;t mind one less week.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff, it colors my hair well and keeps it shiny and healthy, BUT the time before when it was delivered  two of the boxes were leaking when I got it and it was unreasonably difficult to get my refund.  </li>
      <li>The color is vibrant and as pictured on the box.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Also, I think my hair grows faster than normal</li>
      <li>It is Ammonia free and lacks certain other troublesome chemicals but, as others have noted, it is NOT all natural.  </li>
      <li>hope this helps anyone trying to do the exhaustive research I had to do when looking for a new hair dye.</li>
      <li>hope this helps anyone trying to do the exhaustive research I had to do when looking for a new hair dye.</li>
      <li>My wife bought this for herself, and she says that the  color is very natural.</li>
      <li>In addition, the results were a little intense on the multiplying greys (deep cherry red), although I got tons of compliments even from hairdressers who were surprised that I could get such good deep color from henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is permanent tint with natural coloring.</li>
      <li>I use dark golden blond.</li>
      <li>I add 1/3 of it to the dark golden blond (1/2) to use on roots only, for the rest of my hair</li>
      <li>I bought this color before from Whole Food store for 18.99$ and furtunately found it in Amazon for half a price.</li>
      <li>It is gentle but it still smells a bit chemically and it stings slightly like all permanent hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife bought this for herself, and she says that the  color is very natural. She likes the fact that there is not Chemical involved. However, the color doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> arrived on time - the quality of the product is very good</li>
    <li> almost half-price compared to retail outlets in Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;My wife says that Naturtint works good for her and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase. I really value access to this product and have been using it for a couple years. The color is vibrant and as pictured on the box. I am a naturalista with coarse hair and Naturtint conditions as it colors--my hair luvs it in all respects. There is no comparison in my opinion. The pricing here on Amazon was irresistible. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best hair color out there that has no irritating ingredients and color that truly lasts!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for about a year.  Covers well and lasts about 5 weeks for me.  Other chemical based products last about 6 weeks for me.  So for the healthy aspects I don&#x27;t mind one less week.</li>
    <li> I like this product for its lack of chemicals toxic or otherwise. However, it does not last as long as I would like. I have to apply every 2 weeks. I find the conditioner to be great for smoothing and conditioning.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this order.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s health natural way to change my hair color, and works very good on me, I love the smells good,too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap buy multi-pack in one time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, it colors my hair well and keeps it shiny and healthy, BUT the time before when it was delivered  two of the boxes were leaking when I got it and it was unreasonably difficult to get my refund.  I had pictures taken of the boxes and they kept asking for more information and it went on for over a month.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair dye for a couple of years now in 5G Light Golden Chesnut.  I color every 3-4 weeks. I have very long hair and I just do a root touch up but I do use a whole bottle.  I could probably economize and use just half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the color:  This color may be a little too red for some people, especially those with grey or graying hair.  It looks beautiful on brown hair and I get many compliments about the color (from hairdressers, too) but I am not 100% happy with the results on my grey hair around my temples (color is brassy and doesn&#x27;t take well).  Naturtint suggests mixing with an N color to fix that, which I plan on trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this, I was using henna to add dimension and color to my hair and to cover greys.  I started greying very young and until 30, they were concentrated into two interesting streaks on the sides of my head.  In recent years, the greys started spreading around my temples and become more furious. Two kids later and the henna was way too much effort (searching for hours to find the best quality henna online for a good price, mixing it with special formulas one day ahead of time, adding \\&quot;terps\\&quot;, leaving it in my hair for 4 hours).  In addition, the results were a little intense on the multiplying greys (deep cherry red), although I got tons of compliments even from hairdressers who were surprised that I could get such good deep color from henna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I searched around for a more practical alternative that was still pretty good for my hair and, after trying several demis and semis that faded super fast, I found this.  It is Ammonia free and lacks certain other troublesome chemicals but, as others have noted, it is NOT all natural.  That&#x27;s ok with me since I had come to accept that I would need to go with a more conventional permanent hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is more gentle than most conventional permanent hair dye being ammonia and sodium lauryl sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;* It covers grey pretty well most of the time&lt;br /&gt;* The color is very nice and natural looking, especially on brown hair as described above. The color is better than before I started greying.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair is as healthy as ever and is not damaged at all.  It is shiny and smooth.  Most people have no idea I color unless they knew me before when I had my grey streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Results can be inconsistent.  One time I colored and the color did not take at all.  I might as well have done nothing.  I still don&#x27;t know what happened but I think I may have waited to long to apply it after mixing.  It seems more effective to apply it when it is still clear, before the dye has oxidized,&lt;br /&gt;* It covers most of 98% greys but some stubborn ones near my ears (I guess you would call them sideburns, lol) do not color. It is very few and not even noticeable to anyone besides me but I find it annoying.  I am going to try the 5N color to see if that fixes the problem next time.&lt;br /&gt;* It is brassy and too light on the grey hairs.  Hopefully, the N color will fix that.&lt;br /&gt;* It fades faster than I&#x27;d like.  Again, I am hoping the 5N color will fix that. Also, I think my hair grows faster than normal so it is hard to tell if fading or new growth is the problem.&lt;br /&gt;*  I have to leave it on for over an hour to get full grey coverage consistently and I always color around my hairline and temples first so those are really being processed almost 1.5 hours since it takes nearly 30 minutes to apply.&lt;br /&gt;* It is gentle but it still smells a bit chemically and it stings slightly like all permanent hair dyes.&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t seem to lighten at all.  It says you can go two shades lighter but this did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note that your hair will feel like straw after you shampoo.  All SLS free shampoos do this.  Use the conditioner liberally (I use ALL of it) and let it sit.  Use some extra moisturizing conditioner if you need more (Ilike Aussie 3 minute miracle).  This will smooth out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone trying to do the exhaustive research I had to do when looking for a new hair dye. Good luck!like Aussie 3 minute miracle).  This will smooth out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps anyone trying to do the exhaustive research I had to do when looking for a new hair dye. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> It is NOT Lt. Golden Chestnut (2-3 shades darker), but I still love it. I add 1/3 of it to the dark golden blond (1/2) to use on roots only, for the rest of my hair I use dark golden blond. My roots never look lighter then the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint for years. It is much less expensive than in Wholefoods.</li>
    <li> Good make my hair feel soft an nice</li>
    <li> I love Naturtint permanent hair color, because it hasnt peroxyde, and care your hair, you will have softer hair and the color its right, the same you look in the picture of the box.</li>

    <li> Great product and price.I use this brand for many years and very happy with the result.I bought this color before from Whole Food store for 18.99$ and furtunately found it in Amazon for half a price.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like... it covers my gray, it&#x27;s easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t fade and it&#x27;s the healthiest hair color I can find.</li>
    <li> My wife had been using this product for years, but this was a excellent deal.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a while now. I love it, turns out perfect every time. Much cheaper than going to the salon and no one can tell the difference. My roots need to be done every 3-4 weeks and there&#x27;s no fade between coloring and my hair is healthy.  Glad I found it here for  at least 1/2 what I was paying at the health stores.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years, and I really like the rich color.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money with this multipack!  Free from ammonia, your hair will love the tender care.  The color is true to the box.</li>

    <li> Love this hair color. It is the most non toxic of its kind...made in Italy and covers and lasts really well. I only touch up roots. Lasts like permanent color.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years  buying it from my local health store ($19 ea).  But, I am so glad I found this on amazon.  Great price.  Yes, it is worth buying this 6 pack.  Covers gray, long lasting color, doesn&#x27;t fade.  Sometimes delivery is a little slow from this vendor, so order ahead of time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and paid retail price at the store. I am so glad that I can purchase directly from the manufacturer for 50% off. This is a good deal. Be careful of the hair coloring with ammonia and other toxic chemicals. They cause cancer. This is permanent tint with natural coloring. I recommend this product. It makes my hair thick and shine too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 8 years now, good for everyone, no bad stuff in it!&lt;br /&gt;I got lot of compliment for the color and shine!</li>
    <li> I bought the color for my mom and she likes the shade. The price is good.</li>
    <li> This awesome hair color is the reason that I don&#x27;t go to salons for hair color anymore, unless I want to add some highlights and lowlights.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair ... beautiful color!</li>
