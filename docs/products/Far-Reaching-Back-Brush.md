<li> i should have measured but when the ad said far-reaching I thought it would be long enough.</li>
<li> Long enough to reach everywhere.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m over 6&#x27; and the handle is long enough -</li>
<li> I ama six foot male with a wide back and average lenght arms</li>

<li> I would like a brush with slightly stiffer bristles for both my back and my feet.  </li>
<li> I hang it in the same place as all the other brushes I&#x27;ve had, but no others have ever turned black.</li>
<li> I have used this brush for 2 months, and the center of the brush is already wearing out (I use it on my feet, too).  </li>
<li> Of course it&#x27;s an individual thing, but my wife found the bristles on this brush too stiff and harsh to use on her back.</li>
<li> Only complaint I have is that the brush head cracked after one week, still usable though.</li>
<li> The brush is firm enough to do the brushing but not so hard it hurts or damages the skin  </li>
<li> Also turning black where the bristles attach to the brush.</li>
<li> But the wood in the head of the brush is turning black with mold.</li>
<li> Brush BROKE IN HALF within 6- weeks.</li>
<li> a heads up that others might find the brush too stiff to use.</li>
<li> not sure if it was mold or not.</li>
<li> Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this DANGEROUS wooden edged product again.</li>
<li> I am 6&#x27;3\\&quot; (and have a small shower :( )</li>

    <li> Of course it&#x27;s an individual thing, but my wife found the bristles on this brush too stiff and harsh to use on her back. I bought the brush for her at her request. I never use these things myself, so I cannot comment personally. On the palm of my hand the bristles seem soft enough. She needed a replacement for a similar brush no longer made. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just a heads up that others might find the brush too stiff to use. I gave the brush 4 stars because otherwise it seems like a good product. But the harshness is, of course, a deal breaker.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s going to buy a brush at a store so she can check the bristles first hand -- probably a good idea for anyone.</li>
    <li> Only complaint I have is that the brush head cracked after one week, still usable though. Long enough to reach everywhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to hold and long enough reach. This was my first one so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but whenever I need another one I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many back brushes over the years. This one is very nice and has very soft bristles. But the wood in the head of the brush is turning black with mold. Also turning black where the bristles attach to the brush. Gross. I&#x27;ve only had it about a month. I hang it in the same place as all the other brushes I&#x27;ve had, but no others have ever turned black.</li>
    <li> Great scrubber for your back, Just remember to keep it dry mine started to get dark since I take showers about twice a day not sure if it was mold or not.</li>
    <li> This body brush has a nice long handle with good rubber grip. Like was mentioned in other reviews, mine cracked quite quickly but isn&#x27;t that expected with a wood brush? To avid it cracking I would say not to leave it in the shower and make sure its dried off after use. Even though mine is cracked it still works great and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Im shore its nice when I use it I will let you know how it is</li>
    <li> the brush is not long enough to reach the middle of my back, never mind the ergonomic handle. i get pain in the wrists trying to reach the middle of my back. the brush bristles are fine;they hold soap. i should have measured but when the ad said far-reaching I thought it would be long enough. I ama six foot male with a wide back and average lenght arms so I would say the brush needs to be another 3\\&quot; to 4\\&quot; longer.</li>
    <li> The name really says it all, nice long handle with non slip grip, natural bristles, top quality.  Maybe you could spend more, but I doubt you would get a better brush.  Buy with confidence.  Trust Me</li>
    <li> After years of searching, I ended my quest with the help of Amazon.  I knew my son didn&#x27;t have one of these because he always wanted to use mine when he visited me.  Wouldn&#x27;t you know?  Amazon had a choice of many fine bath brushes and my son loves the one I chose for him.    I also very much appreciate the friendly help I receive when I shop at Amazon.  I&#x27;m learning that I can find just about anything I need and have it at my door in a few days at most.  For those of us who live in the country, this is a miracle!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at the quality of this back brush. The bristles are soft and it is very easy to reach the difficult areas on your back. Great value for the money!!!!</li>

    <li> Very soft bristles that hold lather well.  The extra long handle with comfort grip works well to hit the entire back area without extensive reaching.</li>
    <li> Purchased Far Reaching\\&quot; Back Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle . Brush BROKE IN HALF within 6- weeks. Only used it about 9- times. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase this DANGEROUS wooden edged product again.</li>
    <li> I never knew how fabulous a brush like this was while taking a bath or shower.  Not to hard... not to soft... just fabulous. That says it all. I would have ordered one years ago had I known.  Eric</li>
