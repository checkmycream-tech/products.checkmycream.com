      <li>First provide your own battery.</li>

      <li>Overall great Invention.</li>
      <li>(it actually feels so nice!)</li>
      <li>I had to spend most of the time trying to figure out the perfect pressure so it would actually work and not turn off at the same time.</li>
      <li>It removes the dead skin I have yet to try out the course roller because the basic roller does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>Way for effective than the standard PedEgg After much use, still have not had to replace the batteries.</li>
      <li>The bottom back of my feet are very smooth.  </li>
      <li>but so much quicker than a pumice stone!</li>
      <li>really does work!</li>
      <li>I just came back to purchase 2 more.  </li>
      <li>This product seems to be a winner, with free Prime shipping no less.</li>
      <li>Just wish this tool was a little more powerful.  </li>
      <li>It works very well.  </li>
      <li>All you need to do is gently apply the shaver to your feet and it does the job.  </li>

      <li>My feet are so much softer.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it comes with double AA batteries (unlike most of the similar products) was the deal sealer.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly,if not better than advertised, and easy to use!</li>
      <li>I have brand new feet.  </li>
      <li>The only thing is that I wish it had some kind of catch basin for the dead skin cells.</li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>Maybe I have super rough feet or something, but this doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>

<li> As hard as it had to work on his very callused neglected feet it worked on mine as well without being harsh or  abrasive feeling .&lt;br</li>
<li> but I guess I expected quicker results.</li>
<li> It is not very powerful at all, in fact if you push on it at all it will stop working....</li>
<li> Other than that the product worked as described.</li>
<li> Does not have enough power to buff heels with thick calluses.</li>
<li> With this shaver you don&#x27;t have to apply hard pressure.  </li>
<li> I have bunion on my foot and a hard calluse underneath the bunion.</li>
<li> In fact if you press the shaver too hard on your feet the shaver stops.</li>
<li> yet my feet are still hard on the bottom.</li>
<li> Definitely invest in one of these you wont be disappointed.</li>
<li> My calluses are rather tough</li>
<li> I have bad calluses and I&#x27;ve used this thing 3 times</li>
<li> you will not be disappointed</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> A very light duty callus remover, it works but will take good amount of time to do the job comparing with the callus shaver.  Wish it will last but doubt it.</li>
    <li> Order arrived on time, intact. Does a good job for an fair price. Use when feet are dry.</li>
    <li> for battery operated it does the job</li>
    <li> This thing didn&#x27;t work. I spent 6.99 on new batteries and still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Does a great job!  My calluses are rather tough so it takes some time but so much quicker than a pumice stone!</li>
    <li> Maybe I have super rough feet or something, but this doesn&#x27;t work that well. It is not very powerful at all, in fact if you push on it at all it will stop working....I had to spend most of the time trying to figure out the perfect pressure so it would actually work and not turn off at the same time. I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t more of a hassle to do so. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who is used to a real pedicure with a grater or anyone who has rough cracked feet. Its definitely for people who have already smooth feet.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Works great.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great! I have calluses on my heels and I used this shaver.  WOW!  I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of calluses this shaver took off of my heels.  After using this shaver I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my heels felt and looked.  My feet are so much softer.  I used coconut oil on feet after the shaving.  I have brand new feet.  With this shaver you don&#x27;t have to apply hard pressure.  In fact if you press the shaver too hard on your feet the shaver stops. All you need to do is gently apply the shaver to your feet and it does the job.  I am very pleased with this shaver and I recommend it to any person who&#x27;s looking for an effective callus remover.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> works really good,  Thanks a bunch!</li>
    <li> Great price for this product, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This little gadget is totally awesome. I have been looking for something like this for years, and&lt;br /&gt;now I can do it myself--take of my feet that is. Totally awesome.</li>
    <li> It works great! The fact that it comes with double AA batteries (unlike most of the similar products) was the deal sealer. It removes the dead skin I have yet to try out the course roller because the basic roller does the job perfectly. When you need to purchase more batteries It is imperative that you use powerful batteries for this item because the more powerful your batteries are the better it works. It removes calluses and it&#x27;s safe to use on hands. After only 10 minutes of use once a week I can wear heels all day with out my feet feeling sore. It is also safe, gentle and effective to use on people with diabetic foot problems so I purchased one for my mother. Just follow the directions of the enclosed booklet and you will see results within a short time. I recommended it for any person that have problems with hard spots , calluses, or just want their feet to be smooth.</li>
    <li> Great product, sure beats my prior handheld method!  Highly recommend.  Follow the directions and don&#x27;t PUSH, but let it glide.</li>
    <li> Does not have enough power to buff heels with thick calluses.</li>
    <li> This is a great callous remover.  It works fine all the time.</li>
    <li> Love this item saves me time and money.  Saves my back to.  Works great!</li>
    <li> I have bad calluses and I&#x27;ve used this thing 3 times yet my feet are still hard on the bottom. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll take some time and my feet are definitely improved, but I guess I expected quicker results. I do like the fact that it comes with a replacement roller but you need to get your own batteries before using it.</li>
    <li> used this as soon as it arrived, did the  job it said it would, easy, light to handle. my feet feel and look good. looking forward to summer and wearing sandals/flip flops.</li>
    <li> Way for effective than the standard PedEgg After much use, still have not had to replace the batteries. Will recommend to friends that use a PedEgg</li>
    <li> love it would buy this as gifts for my friends and family my picture speaks for it self buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> Works good and does smooth your heals out.</li>
    <li> I just came back to purchase 2 more.  My wife received one as a gift from a friend.  Wife and our 2 daughters have all tried it and all  of them fell in love with it.  Now I&#x27;m getting both of my daughters one; hoping to get an early start on father of the year points.  This product seems to be a winner, with free Prime shipping no less.</li>
    <li> Construction is a bit light</li>
    <li> So totally happy with this shaver. Works exactly,if not better than advertised, and easy to use!</li>
    <li> Yes I give this Product 4 Stars.  It works very well.  The bottom back of my feet are very smooth.  Just wish this tool was a little more powerful.  Overall great Invention.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, works great on my feet and have preformed nothing short of miracles on my guy&#x27;s feet as well! As hard as it had to work on his very callused neglected feet it worked on mine as well without being harsh or  abrasive feeling .&lt;br /&gt;. .  (it actually feels so nice!)</li>
    <li> Great product! First provide your own battery. For best results apply light pressure while using ,too much pressure and it stops.You may have to use on the area several times ,over time,to get the results you want .It really does work!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Within 2 days my toe was as comfortable as when I have the callus shaved. Will save me $350 in medical deductibles every year.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> This works very nicely. I have bunion on my foot and a hard calluse underneath the bunion. This removed my callus completely and left my skin feeling soft. Definitely invest in one of these you wont be disappointed. The only thing is that I wish it had some kind of catch basin for the dead skin cells. I let them fall on the floor and swept it up when I was done. Other than that the product worked as described.</li>
    <li> Is more than I expected for this price, is great value and works wonderfully.</li>
