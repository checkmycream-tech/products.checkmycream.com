      <li>well these are lovely!</li>
      <li>he loved it he told me is strong to hold his hair</li>
      <li>Its my favorite elastics</li>
      <li>I got these by accident, but I like them much better.  </li>
      <li>I needed something a lot more stretchable and durable.</li>
      <li>(so you don&#x27;t have to wrap it around your hair as many times for a secure hold, thus not squeezing your hair to death!)</li>
      <li>these do :)</li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to get these in stores like CVS or Walgreens, but I can&#x27;t find them anymore</li>
      <li>Most importantly, there is no pull on my hair</li>
      <li>Which is good for people with really think hair, and</li>
      <li>She says they are the best she has ever used and blow all other scrunchies away.</li>
      <li>They are really strong.</li>
      <li>Luckily they are cheap, but over the years, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s added up.      </li>
      <li>Scunci makes the best for strong thick hair it holds my hair and supports the weight I love it</li>
      <li>These bands fit that description.</li>
      <li>I pull it up into a pony tail or a messy bun all the time, and these are the bands that work the best.</li>
      <li>These hair ties are nice because they are larger in diameter than most.  </li>
      <li>These are the best bands for thick hair.</li>
      <li>Held up well, didn&#x27;t pull or hurt, just a good, standard hair band.  </li>
      <li>Good product and they last for a while.</li>
      <li>I have thick frizzy hair and these hairbands are the BEST!  </li>
      <li>Most hair ties you can pick up at the store pull on my hair and hurts with too much movement.</li>
      <li>I love letting my hair flow down, but on windy days it is a good idea to wear a hair tie.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this brand over a more popular and heavily advertised brand.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the jelly bands would be good for people with fine hair, but if you have thick hair, they are way better than these.</li>
      <li>, so they last pretty good.</li>
      <li>They withstand a fair amount of wear and tear and don&#x27;t loose their elasticity!</li>
      <li>They do the job of keeping my hair from tangling while I sleep and pull right out when I want to remove them.</li>
      <li>lol I&#x27;m Egyptian/Indian on my dad&#x27;s side and Mexican Native American on mom&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>will either break with time, or snap the first time I attempt to use it.</li>
      <li>The first one out of the package broke as I was pulling it off the cardboard.</li>
      <li>Nice as expected.</li>
      <li>And when taking the first one off the cardboard it broke at the seam of the band.  </li>
      <li>and im still on my first one</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>The ties are awesome for thick long hair and does not slip.</li>
      <li>If you have hair like mine most pony tails slide right down.</li>
      <li>These retract comfortably as it takes little effort to stretch, thus letting it sit comfortably.     </li>
      <li>My boyfriend has very thick, kind of wavy, smooth hair.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed them stretching out or losing their elasticity more than expected.  </li>
      <li>SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE! </li>
      <li>Very heft...</li>
      <li>No metal part but not poorly glued together.</li>
      <li>but hey, I am very picky.</li>
      <li>(there&#x27;s a lot of it) but silky straight.</li>
      <li>These hair ties don&#x27;t have as much elasticity as what I&#x27;m used to</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t seem very durable but time will tell.</li>
      <li>They seem much stronger than any others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Colors may vary]] which are just as good holding my thick hair, but also hold their shape, use after use.  </li>
      <li>The bands themselves are great, but I ordered them along with a bunch of other stuff and was under the impression that they were part of Amazon&#x27;s program that makes it affordable to order low-priced items bundled with higher-priced items to keep the cost down.</li>
      <li>They have better grip and do less damage to my hair.  </li>
      <li>They last and don&#x27;t snap quick.</li>
      <li>i have long, thick hair and these definitely work best.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>Very thick with good elasticity.</li>
      <li>Nice thick hair bands.</li>
      <li>I have very thin, easy tangle, straight hair, that damages easily.</li>
      <li>The regular scuncii&#x27;s don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t turn the amount of times I need for my hair to be secure.</li>
      <li>So far, these elastics have worked.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>They stretch out after a while, but it really takes a long time for that to happen.</li>
      <li>I am constantly breaking normal size elastics.</li>
      <li>You can get ones that tear your hair or pull too tight or don&#x27;t go around the right number of times ...</li>
      <li>and I barely notice it.</li>
      <li>Best for thick, thick, hair!!!</li>
      <li>Last a long time, thick and sturdy elastic, what more can you ask for?</li>
      <li>I have very thick hair and expect a hair tie to last for more than one use.</li>
      <li>Much larger than expected, but still decent.  </li>
      <li>But they don&#x27;t stay tight on my girls large ponytails.  </li>
      <li>I like to use two to hold a pony tail because my hair is very long, and it keeps my hair far enough away from my back</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> they hold my hair, they are hair ties...kinda hard to mess that type of product up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t seem to find the ones for thick hair in stores. I have what they call the thick Irish mane! I have long hair and an awful lot of it. I am constantly breaking normal size elastics. These work perfect for me!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and a lot of it. Every hair elastic I buy will either break with time, or snap the first time I attempt to use it. I needed something a lot more stretchable and durable. So far, these elastics have worked. Pleasantly surprised. They don&#x27;t seem very durable but time will tell. I will keep searching for the perfect elastic and rate it a 5 star product..Hopefully it exists.</li>
    <li> If you have hair like mine most pony tails slide right down. These seem to hold my hair in place and no metal closure to scratch or catch on my hair. yay!</li>
    <li> These are the best bands for thick hair. My hair is thick (there&#x27;s a lot of it) but silky straight. I pull it up into a pony tail or a messy bun all the time, and these are the bands that work the best. They are really strong. Other hair bands pop because they are too small, but these don&#x27;t pop often at all. They stretch out after a while, but it really takes a long time for that to happen. I used to be able to get these in stores like CVS or Walgreens, but I can&#x27;t find them anymore so I was really happy to find them again online. Thanks!</li>
    <li> These hair ties don&#x27;t have as much elasticity as what I&#x27;m used to and they break quite a bit on me. I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> My daughter in law has long hair so she purchased these, and they&#x27;re great, however they smell horribly of chemicals, even after washing you can smell it.  And when taking the first one off the cardboard it broke at the seam of the band.  But they hold the hair well.</li>
    <li> HOLDS HAIR AND NO BREAKAGE AT ALL --- THE THINNER ONES BREAKS MY HAIR NOT THESE&lt;br /&gt;SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been doing everything I can to combat my hair thinning out and getting damaged (I&#x27;m trying to grow it out), and I was in dire of some scrunchies that wouldn&#x27;t pull my hair out every time I had to remove them. I&#x27;ve heard the no-damage gimmick before, but since these were on sale, I decided I would buy a pack. These scrunchies for thick hair really do the trick! Not only are the scrunchies bigger (so you don&#x27;t have to wrap it around your hair as many times for a secure hold, thus not squeezing your hair to death!) but the actual band is thicker, meaning it&#x27;s hard for individual hairs to get wrapped/tangled around it. They&#x27;re perfect for pony tails, braids, whatever. I like to use two to hold a pony tail because my hair is very long, and it keeps my hair far enough away from my back so it doesn&#x27;t get tangled and frizzy while I&#x27;m moving around during the day. Great buy!</li>
    <li> Do not overstretch them</li>
    <li> I have curly hair. After wearing these bands a few times I start to see hair wrapped around the band when I remove it. I am very careful when I take it out. Which means the band is pulling some hairs out. I cannot afford any hair loss at my age!</li>
    <li> I like these a lot. I always used to buy my hair ties at the dollar store and would have to replace them often. My boyfriend grew his hair and became frustrated with the poorly made ones so I read reviews on these. They didn&#x27;t have 5 starts which made me skeptical, but I bought them. I have very thin, easy tangle, straight hair, that damages easily. My boyfriend has very thick, kind of wavy, smooth hair. these work great for us both. No metal part but not poorly glued together. Big enough for thick hair yet doesn&#x27;t damage thin hair or knot it at all. I can tell the elastic will stretch out and these will have to be replaced eventually but I would definitely buy them again!</li>
    <li> The ties are awesome for thick long hair and does not slip.</li>
    <li> Not much to say when it comes to just Scrunci for hair but hey, I am very picky. You can get ones that tear your hair or pull too tight or don&#x27;t go around the right number of times ... well these are lovely! I use them when I cycle and workout and yoga - and it&#x27;s PERFECT. It&#x27;s as great as a scrunci gets, I suppose :)!</li>
    <li> I always have problems with my fat hair. lol I&#x27;m Egyptian/Indian on my dad&#x27;s side and Mexican Native American on mom&#x27;s. so as you might imagine... MY HAIR IS THICK AND  COARSE. I have actually cried over my stupid head of hair many times before because no one has the right products for me. But these rubber bands are great. I was so skeptical because even products that say \\&quot;for thick hair\\&quot; wont hold my poor hair. these do :) I love them. I break a pack of rubber bands within 2 months usually. so frustrating! and costly. I was just leaving my hair down because of it. But being in az, I can&#x27;t in summer. I&#x27;ll pass out lol SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE! </li>
    <li> Nice thick hair bands. They come out without pulling out the hair.</li>
    <li> Nice as expected. Tick and durable</li>
    <li> Finally a hair tie that will hold all of my hair. Will loose its shape after a week or so.</li>
    <li> I hate the ponytail holders that have the metal because they always pull my hair out.  These are perfect.  I have to wear my hair up all the time, and I finally found something that works for me!</li>
    <li> The bands themselves are great, but I ordered them along with a bunch of other stuff and was under the impression that they were part of Amazon&#x27;s program that makes it affordable to order low-priced items bundled with higher-priced items to keep the cost down. For some reason Amazon shipped these separately from the rest of my order and charged me $4 for shipping and handling, which doubled the price of the bands. Definitely not worth it to buy these from Amazon, just go to your nearest store.</li>
    <li> This is not as elastic as I expected it to be. Since it&#x27;s not as elastic, I always pull it and now it&#x27;s completely stretched out. I guess it works, but I didn&#x27;t expect the band to be less elastic as my old ones.  The band is a bit thicker in diameter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair. I love letting my hair flow down, but on windy days it is a good idea to wear a hair tie. Most hair ties you can pick up at the store pull on my hair and hurts with too much movement. Not to mention they feel way too tight. These retract comfortably as it takes little effort to stretch, thus letting it sit comfortably.     Most importantly, there is no pull on my hair and I barely notice it. No pain, no damage!       I am unsure how durable these things are though as I have only had them for one day. They seem about average in that department.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife who has very long, thick hair. She says they are the best she has ever used and blow all other scrunchies away.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are nice because they are larger in diameter than most.  But they don&#x27;t stay tight on my girls large ponytails.  They slowly creep down, so it is required to tighten the ponytail over and over again.</li>
    <li> They do the job of keeping my hair from tangling while I sleep and pull right out when I want to remove them. They are a bit too big though, and several of them have immediately broken at the seam.</li>
    <li> My other bands kept breaking, then I realized it must be because of how thick my hair has gotten, got these and haven&#x27;t had one of them break yet and they hold great!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and these are some of the only elastic that are big enough to handle it.  They do stretch out after a bit, but they last as long as you&#x27;d expect hair elastics to last.</li>
    <li> I got these by accident, but I like them much better.  They have better grip and do less damage to my hair.  These are definitely beter if you have long thick hair.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my thick curly hair.  They seem much stronger than any others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Excellent price matched by excellent quality. They withstand a fair amount of wear and tear and don&#x27;t loose their elasticity! Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> These used to be my go-to hairband.  They work well for thick hair, which I have.  Held up well, didn&#x27;t pull or hurt, just a good, standard hair band.  My only complaint is that after a few uses, they would stretch out, and lose their elasticity - which is pretty standard for this type of elastic hair band (scunci or any other brand).  Once this happened, they became useless and I had to throw them away.  Luckily they are cheap, but over the years, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s added up.      I have since found [[ASIN:B003DKO83E Scunci No-slip Grip Evolution Bright Jelly Ponytailers, 14-Count, Colors may vary]] which are just as good holding my thick hair, but also hold their shape, use after use.  HOORAY!!!!  I don&#x27;t think the jelly bands would be good for people with fine hair, but if you have thick hair, they are way better than these.</li>
    <li> Good but they are too big. Which is good for people with really think hair, and I mean really think. They are too big for my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my wife... Very heft... The black wrapping around the rubber band gives out at times, but they have yet to break.</li>
    <li> They work well and never snag.</li>
    <li> These work as intended.  Haven&#x27;t noticed them stretching out or losing their elasticity more than expected.  Nice and thick caliber will hold thick hair.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair but I have A LOT! The regular scuncii&#x27;s don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t turn the amount of times I need for my hair to be secure. These get the job done and last forever.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and expect a hair tie to last for more than one use. These bands fit that description. I strongly recommend this brand over a more popular and heavily advertised brand.</li>
    <li> Much larger than expected, but still decent.  Because of that, there is no in-between hold - my hair either ends up too loose or way too tight (as in headache inducing tight).  Overall though, it will depend on the thickness of your hair.</li>
    <li> I have really thick hair and basically snap any type of hairband I use. I used to buy these at the store but for some reason they stopped selling them. I tried the goody brand ones for thick hair and they were too big and then stretched out anyways? Found these online and immediately bought them. Good product and they last for a while. Also shipping wasn&#x27;t bad, arrived a little early.</li>
    <li> Your basic hair bands. My wife is always looking for these. I seem to find plenty in the vacuum cleaner. Good quantity with this purchase should keep her in business for a while longer.</li>
    <li> Good hairbands. Its been a month and im still on my first one, so they last pretty good.</li>
    <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t pull on my hair when it is tight.  Long lasting, I&#x27;ve been using the first one out of the package for at least a month.</li>
    <li> i have long, thick hair and these definitely work best. i can never find these in stores!</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought the Scunci brand instead of the Goody brand of the no-metal thick elastics. The first one out of the package broke as I was pulling it off the cardboard. The second one has been in my hair for six hours now and it is already very loose. So either I got a really poor quality batch or these are really not meant for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and only recently grew my hair out long. I now require alot of products that I only knew about from growing up in a house with three women. I have thick frizzy hair and these hairbands are the BEST!  Last a long time, thick and sturdy elastic, what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> Its my favorite elastics Scunci makes the best for strong thick hair it holds my hair and supports the weight I love it</li>
    <li> It is what it looks like on the picture.</li>
    <li> Thicker than expected. But does job overall.</li>
    <li> this was for a friend in christmas. he loved it he told me is strong to hold his hair so i believe is good.</li>
    <li> Good scruncis!  Very thick with good elasticity. Good product!</li>
    <li> Best for thick, thick, hair!!! They last and don&#x27;t snap quick.</li>
