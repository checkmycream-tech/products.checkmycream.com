      <li>It needs to stay on 12 - 14 hours, so it&#x27;s very high quality that stays.</li>
      <li>The service from this company was really fast, too.  </li>

      <li>highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This cleanser is gentle, removes makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>

      <li>/&gt;it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Helps with my breakouts cleans off make-up really well</li>
      <li>very gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product,(even though it is for all skin types) particularly to people with oily skin, it will help to balance the oil production.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find fragrance-free facial cleansers that really work in removing makeup, but this one&#x27;s non-irritating and does a good job.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and love it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use most acne treatments because the salicylic acid is too harsh and dries me out.</li>
      <li>If you have normal skin or acne prone skin</li>
      <li>My skin is oily in the t-zone and normal in the rest.</li>
      <li>It also lasted me a few more months than I thought.</li>
      <li>But for me, and I have very sensitive skin,&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you suffer from acne and have sensitive skin, with oily areas and normal areas</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin as soft as the anti-aging cleanser gel.  </li>
      <li>I wish the seller would&#x27;ve told me it was an old item that was on the shelf for awhile or something.</li>
      <li>My husband has really sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I used to use a similar gentle foaming cleanser from Cosmedicine that Sephora was carrying, however they discontinued it, and suggested this product.</li>
      <li>I tried going natural for a while</li>
      <li>I just got an old it that doesn&#x27;t foam well and smells &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I love it for foaming well even when a small amount is used; for not smelling like rubber like a lot of scent-free products do; for not irritating my skin and not leaving a dry film (living in the driest state</li>
      <li>; organic stuff, then got fed up and decided to just stop everything and just use Dove soap for sensitive skin and water, big mistake!.</li>
      <li>For someone who has problematic skin, it makes it difficult to choose a product that will effectively work for my face.</li>
      <li>The only downside is the &amp;#34;un scented&amp;#34; is not terrible but not pleasant.</li>
      <li>Not only did this bad boy have my skin looking refreshed, it rejuvenated my skintone and it most importantly it didn&#x27;t strip my skin or dry it out.</li>
      <li>It tends to be a little sensitive and breaks out frequently.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best cleanser EVER. PERIOD. I&#x27;ve tried them all. I have SUPER sensitive skin. Love PTR products!</li>
    <li> Foaming dispenser works well, is able to remove most eye makeup.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the skin as soft as the anti-aging cleanser gel.  Won&#x27;t be buying it again, but it is a cleansing product that is easily used.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin cleaned and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Too bad it is getting hard to find at Sephora.  My husband has really sensitive skin and this does not aggravate his rosacea.</li>
    <li> One of the best products out there! I used to use a similar gentle foaming cleanser from Cosmedicine that Sephora was carrying, however they discontinued it, and suggested this product. This product has the vitamins that improved my skin tone, and you can see the difference within 3-4 uses in my opinion. It also lasted me a few more months than I thought. Also the cost on Amazon saved me at least $11.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cleanser. It cleans away even the waterproof liner I use without having to scrub. I use the glycolic wash every oth day and it can be drying, so this foaming cleanser is a perfect adjunct to my routine. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  The sunscreen was recommended to me by a girl at Sephora.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and love it. I decided to give this a try and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> This face wash is fantastic at removing all makeup! I&#x27;m so happy I finally found something that removes even eye make up. I&#x27;ll have the occasional eyeliner smudged underneath the lower lash line but very minimal so I&#x27;ll wash the eyes again and usually gets it off. And I have to add that I wear eye primer, concealer and shadow primer and it removes all of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash and will never buy another. I am thirty and was still suffering from acne until I went to a facial event at sephora and was introduced to this face wash. I have been buying it every since, and now I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation!</li>
    <li> I have tried every single cleanser for acne prone skin from neutrogena to derma e, and peter thomas roth has the best stuff out there. My skin is oily in the t-zone and normal in the rest. It tends to be a little sensitive and breaks out frequently. This cleanser is gentle, removes makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It removes dirt, oil and my spf makeup. This cleanser coupled with PTR&#x27;s unwrinkle peel pads have transformed my skin. It doesn&#x27;t break out as often and my skin is super smooth! highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best cleanser ever. If you suffer from acne and have sensitive skin, with oily areas and normal areas this the best! I have tried everything and this one cleanses without leaving skin tight. it is great for people using Bha and BP. I tried going natural for a while and my face broke out like crazy; organic stuff, then got fed up and decided to just stop everything and just use Dove soap for sensitive skin and water, big mistake!. I researched and researched and this is really the best. It is pricey but it is worth it! now I&#x27;m on a quest for the perfect moisturizer that moisturizes over BP without burning.</li>
    <li> I use this product because it&#x27;s easy and creamy and high quality.  Love the price on Amazon!  Thus brand delivers.</li>
    <li> It was 50% off. I thought I was getting a deal. It was too good to be true. I just got an old it that doesn&#x27;t foam well and smells &amp;#34;different&amp;#34;. I wish the seller would&#x27;ve told me it was an old item that was on the shelf for awhile or something.</li>
    <li> Cleanser is okay, cleans makeup off well, but for the price would not buy again.  There are a lot better cleanser out there, will go back to Fresh Soy Face Cleanser or even Aveeno.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I tried this product. Although it is labeled as &amp;#34; fragrance -free&amp;#34;, it still has a smell like medicine to me. It does not foam well either. I had to pump for 5-6 times to clean my whole face and didn&#x27;t even feel clean.</li>
    <li> In my 60 years, and after trying hundreds of cleansers and products for my combination skin (very oily T zone), with rosacea and sensitivity to most chemicals, this cleanser is effective, gentle, decreases my redness, does not irritate, removes makeup and leaves my skin soft and clean with no dryness or tightness.  This is the best cleanser I have used.  One note, this price is EXTREMELY low for this product compared to 4 other websites that carry Peter Thomas. Roth and I have to wonder why.</li>
    <li> Have been using this face wash for years,it is wonderful,it takes off your eye makeup,lipstick,you need nothing else.And it last a long time,I wash my face twice a day,you don&#x27;t need alot to do the job.</li>
    <li> Arrived unsealed. Every other time I&#x27;ve ordered this product it&#x27;s come sealed. This concerns me...</li>
    <li> This is excellent for removing dirt and makeup.  If you have normal skin or acne prone skin this is great.  I have very dry skin so I use this in the PM and the gentler PTR unwrinkled cream cleanser in the morning.</li>
    <li> Helps with my breakouts cleans off make-up really well</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for my face I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t remove all the oil from my skin, drying it out. I hate it when that happens,&lt;br /&gt;esp during the freezing cold winter.&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried a few other brands, but these things are too expensive for random experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;So, I stick with this stuff. Been using it now for a few years, and it really does make my face feel and look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a small blob, maybe quarter size, in the palm of your hand. Then, work it into the face and neck. Rinse with slightly warm&lt;br /&gt;water, pat dry with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your skin type, you may see a difference right away, or maybe never. But for me, and I have very sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant attest to any of the exotic ingredients, I&#x27;m a skeptic about stuff which has no scientific evidence, so much of it may be&lt;br /&gt;total BS. All I can tell you is, it works great for me, and it makes my skin feel and look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;They have to be doing something right :)</li>
    <li> my bottle was half empty so I couldn&#x27;t really get to try the whole bottle and determine if it is good or not.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering it. I love it for foaming well even when a small amount is used; for not smelling like rubber like a lot of scent-free products do; for not irritating my skin and not leaving a dry film (living in the driest state it&#x27;s hard to find smth that cleans well but doesn&#x27;t dehydrate); for an awesome cleansing job while being so gentle; for lasting for 3 months. Sticking to it for a while.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I always have a spare on hand so I don&#x27;t run out! Amazon has the best prices.</li>
    <li> I have been using this wash for the past 6 years and it is still my preferred brand. Gentle and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> very gentle cleanser for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> I used to love this product for my oily/ combination skin. It cleans my pores out so very well. But lately I started using the Cosmetic Database by ewg.org and realize Vitamin A palmitate used in lots of cosmetics causes cancer tumor in animal studies at LOW doses. So im scared now. Find the link to the website here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/705545/RETINYL_PALMITATE_%28VITAMIN_A_PALMITATE%29/</li>
    <li> For someone who has problematic skin, it makes it difficult to choose a product that will effectively work for my face. Between the oily skin and acne breakouts I am always fighting the next breakout without over-drying my skin with harsh acne products. I meticulously researched a facial cleanser that was gentle, included antioxidants and had very few chemicals in it. I&#x27;m convinced that Peter Thomas Roth Gentle Foaming Cleanser is one of the wonders of the world, because its amazing what it has done for my face in the 2 washes I&#x27;ve used it for since receiving it. Not only did this bad boy have my skin looking refreshed, it rejuvenated my skintone and it most importantly it didn&#x27;t strip my skin or dry it out. After washing my face I do use a toner on my face to ensure cleanliness, I found with using other facial cleaners the toner did have to remove the rest of the dirt off my face. With PTR, all the day&#x27;s make-up along with nars and urban decay primer the toner picked up nothing, PTR removed my heaviest make-up all in one wash. I highly recommend this product,(even though it is for all skin types) particularly to people with oily skin, it will help to balance the oil production.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice cleanser for your face.  It removes makeup, even stubborn eye makeup! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use serious make up daily for my job. It needs to stay on 12 - 14 hours, so it&#x27;s very high quality that stays. I have spent hundreds and and hundreds of dollars on make up remover.  Finally found one  that actually removes all of the make up. This works. Quickly and easily exactly as the directions say. Does not dry the skin and does not require excessive rubbing.</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and I have had good results with this products. It also last a long time, you only need one pump per wash.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser, because it&#x27;s so gentle on your skin. I can&#x27;t use most acne treatments because the salicylic acid is too harsh and dries me out. This works wonders!</li>
    <li> Meh. I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting. I give four stars because I don&#x27;t break out, it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting, and it does in fact take off my makeup. But it&#x27;s not amazing or anything. Will probably just buy drugstore next time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s hard to find fragrance-free facial cleansers that really work in removing makeup, but this one&#x27;s non-irritating and does a good job.  The service from this company was really fast, too.  I had my item within 5 days of placing my order.  Good job.</li>
    <li> the smell is too bad.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used a little pricey but worth it. so silky and smooth it&#x27;s great for sensitive and dry skin.</li>
