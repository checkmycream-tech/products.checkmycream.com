<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Worked ok.  Not completely satisfied with my results though.</li>
    <li> I like this combination after brushing my teeth.  Latest dental check up very good.  Actually reversed a gum issue I was having between 2 back teeth.</li>
    <li> I used this stuff for the first time, yesterday. I didn&#x27;t use any mouthwash, like it says not to do, and it WORKS!!! My mouth never felt better. I suffer from dry mouth and it kept my mouth from getting dry and kept my breath fresh!! I LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> At the time of my most recent dental checkup, I had used Periactil for about five months. Usually my gums bleed during checkups, but not this time. Also, there was no indication of cavities starting! Wonderful! My dentist was thrilled! By contrast, my partner (who has not used the product) had gum disease requiring antibiotics. I use Periactil whenever I remember, so around 2-3 times per week. Even without daily use, this improvement was significant. Usually I&#x27;ve had problematic gums and \\&quot;let&#x27;s monitor this so it doesn&#x27;t become a cavity\\&quot; -- what a difference! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I thought this would help my first cavity and tooth pain that came along with it, but I can&#x27;t say for sure it helped. It was annoying to apply it, and tasted funky. I also felt more tooth pain after finishing the 2 bottles, and I followed the instructions to the T. The ingredients are also not something I want to be ingesting on a daily basis. Definitely overpriced and not worth the price for me. I didn&#x27;t notice any extra whitening effect, and in fact, adding fermented skate liver oil, vitamin D3 &amp; K2, Calcium/Magnesium/Zinc to my diet and using an Ayurvedic fluoride free toothpaste with Peelu has helped immensely. I hardly feel any tooth pain anymore nowadays. As long as I brush my teeth at least twice a day and don&#x27;t eat sugar as well. But this product was not really worth it to me and I wouldn&#x27;t even take a free bottle of it.</li>
    <li> Went through the entire product in several months, did not see ANY improvement by either myself NOR dentist.  Not worth the $$$.  Tried but didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> After having my two babies my teeth always bleed so much everytime I would brush my teeth. Sometimes they would just bleed out of nowhere. I have been using this stuff for about 2 weeks now and only have a tiny amount of bleeding when I brush. My gums look really pink and healthy also. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have really bad teeth; several cavities, chipped teeth, occasional bleeding gums when brushing, etc.  I do not have the funds to have my needed dental care taken care of, and so I have searched for something in the line of a product that will help counteract the poor health of my teeth - and the Periactil Precondition Kit is - for me - the next best thing to being able to go to a Dentist and have my teeth taken care of!  I have been using this product faithfully for over a year, and I now do not want to go a day without it; I feel that the health of my teeth and gums depend on it. :)</li>
    <li> My gums have stopped bleeding.. When I use to brush my teeth my gums would bleed. Gums no longer bleed when they are brush. My teeth are whiter and shiner. When I go back to the dentist in December I&#x27;ll then know if the Dentist sees an improvement with my Perio Dental Disease. I&#x27;ll keep you posted with my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product. It did the job. I went back to the dentist and they say that my mouth looks great! My mouth feels fine, and I&#x27;m more than happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love Periactil.  I have problems with my gums no matter how well I care for them.  Since using this product for about 4 months, I have experienced better oral health. Way less bleeding gums.  I am 5 months pregnant and even with the pregnancy my gums and teeth seem to be in great shape.</li>
    <li> Jury is out but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love Periactil!  It has improved my gum health and overall oral health so much!  It also helps with bad breath.  I have purchased Periactil twice and will again!  With the easy 2 step process, it&#x27;s pretty simple.  I would definitely recommend this to friends.  Thank you for making a product that has truly helped me without having to pay hundreds to a dentist to do the same thing!</li>
    <li> I hate reviewing things but this stuff is worth it. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and I am seeing MAJOR improvement in my gums/ teeth. I&#x27;m definitely reordering this product and I recommend it to anyone looking for better oral health!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier then expected. Works great, heals any problems with teeth after using for a week, improves any problems there my be, and definitely got a better report from my dentist, even after not going to the dentist for a year. Love this stuff, will order over and over again.</li>
    <li> Zero results. Nothing. Not expecting a earth shaking product here or anything like that but I could not see or feel anything at all with use of this product. Save your cash for the dentist.</li>
    <li> I like these both cos it makes my mouth nt dry and I have fresher breath after using these. Thanks!</li>
    <li> It didnt work at all for me.  I tried it over a month and I didnt notice any difference in my swollen gums.  I am going to the dentist (I am scared).</li>
    <li> TOO EXPENSIVE, I FOUND A PRODUCT JUST AS GOOD OR BETTER FOR A LOT LESS... I RECOMMEND EPIC SPEARMINT TOOTHPASTE WITH 31 % XYLITOL. THE EPIC PRODUCT WILL REMINERALISE TEETH JUST LIKE THIS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE PERIACTIL</li>
    <li> Periactil is awesome! I used to have lots of plaque in between my six months dentist visits, I no longer have even a tenth of what I used to have. My gingivitis has also really been cured and that came with a fresher breath. I used to have bad breath, but now that is a thing of the past. I would recommend to try it! It worked and continues to work for me.</li>
    <li> product arrived on time and packaged  well with instructions. love that it has no taste also very easy to use. Leaves mouth fresh, still using product unsure if will reorder until finished product completely. So far i like kit.</li>
    <li> it did not clean as expected</li>
    <li> Use this everyday and seen improvement. I&#x27;m 42 and was devastated by the diagnosis of advanced gum disease due to genetics. I have never had a cavity, no tartar or plague buildup. I have always been complimented on my beautiful smile. First time in my life I get a toothache and now I&#x27;m facing loss of several teeth due to severe bone loss ;not from decay. Two days after use, my gums stopped bleeding and my hygienist commented that my gums are getting healthier.</li>
    <li> I have had problems with my gums and have always used Cordysol, being in the States I thought I would give this a go and are truley pleased with results, my dentist actually said my gums have improved. Nice taste, easy to use will definetly continue using</li>
    <li> I was having a lot of problems with my teeth being sore, bleeding, loose teeth and receding gums etc... I hate the dentist. So after much much prayer as to what to do, I believe I was led to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Immediate results! I fell in love with it the first day. It made my mouth feel so clean, but what else would it do? After 2 days I noticed the bleeding has lessened. After a few more days, the bleeding had stopped completely. Note: I&#x27;ve had bleeding gums for YEARS!!! So after a few more days I noticed where my tongue would always feel the exposed teeth back by my wisdom tooth, was starting to feel gum again. I was absolutely shocked. I read that this couldn&#x27;t happen. But it did. It was actually growing the gum back around my exposed teeth. And then I noticed the 2 loosed teeth I had at the bottom were becoming more stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my condition was a lot worse than most. I probably should have gone to the dentist to get a good cleaning first, but if you can catch it before it gets to bad, this product will absolutely do it. Oh and to add, NO MORE BAD BREATH. WOW! And without mouthwash. I&#x27;m on my third tube now and I ran out a couple of days before it came and my teeth did not feel the same clean. I am an absolute fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is I wish they had bigger tubes so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order so often. But Thank you so much for such a awesome product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 5 months ago and was very skeptical. I was wearing a splint 24/7 on my top teeth and my gums were constantly sore and bleeding so I decided to give it a shot. I was very impressed! Immediately, my gums looked and felt much better. No more bleeding! Now my splint has been replaced by braces and this is the only product that makes my mouth feel squeaky clean. If I go a night without using it I can definitely feel it! My routine consists of brushing with regular toothpaste, flossing, using a waterpik to get in the nook and crannies of my braces, and then use the periactil. I can literally feel my teeth squeak as I brush them with the periactil, they are so clean. In fact, when I got my braces put on I asked my dentist if he could clean my teeth first and he said it wasn&#x27;t necessary, my teeth were already remarkably clean! Another thing, this product is definitely lasts a long time if you use is sparingly. I am just now going to place my second order (after 5 months!) and that is only because I am running low on the precondition gel. This is a great investment that I totally recommend if you are as motivated to keep your teeth and mouth healthy as I am.</li>
    <li> I rated this 4 stars, because not being a professional in the dentistry field, I don&#x27;t know if it really does anything or not, but it can&#x27;t hurt to try it. I do notice that my teeth feel cleaner and that is a good thing. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have any abrasive ingredients.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a difference and I don&#x27;t like the two  step process.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the pre and after brushing creams. I can buy other products with Xylitol that are more efficient without the fuss! One dental cream would have been better. I did not get too much gum disease fighting power with it. I can get better results with oral rinses with Xylitol.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product to help me with my extremely sensitive teeth and gums and this product definately helps.  My gums get very sensitive when I eat certain acidic foods and fruits and so I use this product after eating and instantly my gums will feel better.  One thing I love about Amazon is that you can find products like these that you would never even know existed if you just had to rely on just what you can find at your local grocery store!</li>
    <li> I started using this about one year ago. I found by using this product twice per day for about six months my lower teeth which were&lt;br /&gt;becoming loose in my mouth are no longer loose. I had receding gums and they have regenerated. This product is amazing in its ability to heal gums.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to strengthen and rebuild my enamel.  My teeth look much stronger now, actually they appear thicker.  My teeth used to absorb stains from coffee and wine very easily.  That is not the case anymore.  They stay much whiter.  I am really happy with the results and I will definitely keep using this.  Also, I have no bleeding or gum sensitivity.  My gums are very strong and beautiful now.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> These two  Periactil products in the kit: precondition gel and conditioner are amazing. Using consistently,  I have almost no  bleeding gums unlike in the past where my gums bled all the time.  I like that their products are fluoride-free.  The conditioner freshens the breath.  My gums looks healthier and the plaque is removed making my teeth look better and improved.  I&#x27;ve purchased several times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I am using the Precondition Kit now for 4 weeks and did realize a big improvement in my gum. My gum was bleeding, swollen and red and I made a lot of research about how to get a healthy gum.&lt;br /&gt;It really works very good. It needs some time and you have to use it at least twice a day.</li>
    <li> I use both of these tubes according to directions at least twice a day and never get stains on my teeth any more.  The dentist always says my gums are in great condition.  The Precondition Kit helps to keep my mouth in an alkalized state which prevents tooth decay and helps keeps bacteria from growing.  My daughter with braces complained about a sensitive place on her teeth and has been using the precondition kit.  She says that the tooth is not a problem any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had gum and tooth problems my whole life (many fillings in my teeth, a bridge and a couple of root canals) and have very receded gums.  My teeth used to be extremely sensitive.  I have done a lot of research and tried a lot of conventional and alternative products, but this is the one I can continue to use because it&#x27;s so effective and doesn&#x27;t cost too much.  This product is the main reason my teeth are so healthy now and only a little sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use flouride toothpaste and am vegetarian.  If you look up Xylitol, you will find that it helps to keep the good bacteria flourishing in the digestive tract and keeps the harmful bacteria from growing.  The Precondition Gel (tube with red label) has a Biofilm Blasting Action that stops bacteria from proliferating by stopping bacteria from creating a shield to hide under.  I will continue to use this product because it is saving my teeth.</li>
    <li> Feels like you just left the dentist</li>
    <li> Before I buy ANYTHING on amazon, I always read through all of the reviews. I read reviews on how wonderful it was but was still a little uneasy about spending $15 on TOOTHPASTE. Finally after looking at this product for over a month I finally caved in and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this in the mail i was overwhelmed. Two tubes and I have to brush with normal toothpaste first. That&#x27;s 2 times in one sitting (for someone who has not had the best brushing habits in the past, it seemed like overkill.) I was, however, determined to try to get my teeth healthy again. I read the instructions about 4 times and then decided to give it a whorl. I have been using this product for about a week, and I would recommend this product to everyone I know. I really love the feeling it leaves. I actually feel like my teeth are clean. I plan on buying another toothpaste on here that was recommended by another reviewer to use in addition to this product. I didn&#x27;t buy it at the time because i didn&#x27;t understand that you bush with normal toothpaste before you use this product. The first time I used it i felt like I was brushing like I do before I go to the dentist. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommended you do a few things before using this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Invest in a nice toothbrush. You are now going to be brushing your teeth 2 times in the morning and 2 times at night. Buy a good toothbrush so you don&#x27;t tear up your gums like i did. :(&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy a good toothpaste to start with. You will be brushing with a basic toothpaste before using this one, so double up on the benefits that other toothpastes can offer (like whitening). I have been using Arm and Hammer whitening and I really like it although i would like to get results faster and a reviewer has recommended a toothpaste you can buy on here(its $$$$). :)&lt;br /&gt;3. Buy the floss with the plastic pick on the end. It saves sooooo much time when going through this routine.&lt;br /&gt;4. Dump out your mouthwash now. Get it out of your routine.Its a hard habit to break. :)</li>
    <li> Kids do no like the taste and will not use it. Says it does not make their mouth taste minty fresh. Been fighting them to use it day one of buying it.  We used Dr Foster earlier and had no problem with them using it.</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks, my gums are healthier then ever!</li>
    <li> Worked well for me but I noticed I started having side pains.  I looked it up and it turns out this stuff can be toxic to your kidney&#x27;s.  So the directions say its ok to swallow but I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does remove all the crud that seems otherwise permanent.  My dentist was really impressed at the health and hygiene of my teeth and gums when I went in recently.  I do floss twice daily and practice oil-pulling.  But when after a couple weeks of using this twice daily I noticed a great improvement in my oral hygiene level.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and have noticed a major improvement, no more bleeding gums or cavities. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> WATCH OUT IF YOU HAVEN&#x27;T HAD YOUR TEETH CLEANED!  If your teeth haven&#x27;t been cleaned then all of the bacteria in your mouth will be turned brown very quickly with this product.  I would not use this product until all fillings have been filled and a good cleaning... then start to use it.... xylitol will turn the bacteria brown....as I figured out from a bit of research you might have to trade in a healthly mouth for stained teeth... I need to try it again now that I&#x27;ve done that but they Should warn you about that issue. It will happen quickly as the bacteria dies.  the staining is the dead bacteria sticking to the teeth as they die. if you do a search under \\&quot;xylitol teeth staining\\&quot; you can find some information about this.  it apparently is something you just have to work thru.  I would you use this product only after your teeth have been repaired.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really rate this product since I haven&#x27;t been to a dentist yet.  But I can say that since I&#x27;ve been using it my gum aren&#x27;t sensitive and painful so I am hopeful that when I see my dentist in two weeks that it has improved.</li>
    <li> I like the combination. Don&#x27;t use every day, but was good addition when gums were irritated. Would recommend for those taking care of their mouth.</li>
    <li> I like the performance of the product. Gives your mouth a fresh feeling. Works within a week. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> This really helps. Gums are much better.</li>
    <li> If you suffer from gingivitis or perio, nothing is going to work before you go to a dentist and ask for the deep cleaning and laser treatment.&lt;br /&gt;After that, you can buy this kind of products.&lt;br /&gt;It wont work at all if you have plaque or bacteria inside your gums.</li>
    <li> If you explained what it tasted like I would have never bought this! Open 1 time, took a little gel and almost choked. Taste like Ben Gay.  Sorry just being honest.</li>
    <li> I love the periactil kit.  Both of the gels form a barrier and the next time you brush your teeth, any stain from coffee, tea, other foods come right off.  It also protects your teeth from decay.  Your teeth feel so clean and stay looking brighter.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;J.Brown</li>
    <li> Got this to attempt to combat sensitivity from receding gums. Used the entire tubes, nothing happened. What DID help was diligent brushing (with regular toothpaste), flossing, and rinsing twice a day. People, there are no miracle cures out there!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product off and on for many years, and I&#x27;ve shared them with many friends as well, and I&#x27;ve never heard of one single problem, everyone of them thanked me from referring them to this company. My wife used to have a problem with bleeding, tender gums to the point where some of her teeth were getting a little bit loose. After using this for several weeks, the bleeding went away as did her tenderness and slightly loosened teeth.</li>
    <li> Love the product after years at the dentist with peridental disease my gums are finally pink and not bleeding will buy again</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. My gums are in much better shape and have stopped bleeding. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> We have sentive teeth, but sometime we get mouth ulcers and canker soars,  we use these two products to increase healing of the sore.  We also had someone who had a mouth injury and cut  and it almost healed over night.  Ramsey Hunt can also appear inside the mouth , not just the ears and this help in the healing also.  It just strenght our teeth also and no more senstive teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Within a few days use my gums stop bleeding.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 3 months and my teeth and gums never look better. It is helping me reverse my gum disease. My dentist could not beileve how clean my teeth was, he ask me if I was using anything special, I smile and said no.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and I find no difference in my gums or periodontal disease.  It does seem to keep the plaque at bay and make my teeth feel cleaner, longer.  The taste of it is awful.</li>
    <li> I tried to get some medicine for my wife&#x27;tooth causing her jaw to swell so I looked on Amazon and it worked great within in about three days we could see an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie Kelly</li>
    <li> ok. So I just ordered this on ebay! But I didn&#x27;t know it was on amazon so I am going to post a 3 month review timeline which this one is not included because this is not a verified purchase here. I have gum disease. I look forward to following the directions exactly and posting results! Month by month as I order a new supply! And I will post photos eww right. no lets see how this works!</li>
    <li> I had sore gums from a lot of dental work that I had done.  I kept going back to the dentist for the soreness, but nothing he did helped.  I ordered this product after reading the reviews about it.  Almost immediately after using this product, the soreness went away.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> good for teeth, helps with dental problems</li>
    <li> I was having problems with gum disease and since starting to use this product it has really made a difference. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> My dentist was impressed with the condition of my gum. Weeks earlier he thought he would have to send me to have my gums lift and cleaned. After three weeks he said what did you do your gums look good. I&#x27;m ordering my second supply.</li>
    <li> This kit is a must have in your oral hygiene. I was looking for something on my sensitive gums and overall cavity fighting. I have great oral health as in brushing, flossing and using mouthwash every single day  but tend to get cavities because of soft teeth. So when I read that the main ingredient is Xylitol to help in oral issues I was curios and jumped to buy it.  2 yrs later of using this awesome kit i have yet to have one cavity pop up! My dentist doesn&#x27;t sit there and scrape my teeth before cleaning either. My visit now goes quick. Also since I have a few fillings when brushing I get sensitive and my dentist would coat my teeth with the clear gel to help for a while. I was using sensadine but that stopped working. But this kit has help that issue and my teeth are happy. It has no fluoride for some people that don&#x27;t care for that but I&#x27;m ok either way. The tubes are not that big  so in order to make it last longer I brush with the precondition at night after I use my regular toothpaste. But the trick is I don&#x27;t rinse my mouth out that way the precondition stays on my teeth. I use the gel mouth wash in the morning and at night too. The only two things I wish they would mabye consider at some point is make the tubes a bit bigger and since the tubes are metal sometimes at the end it&#x27;s hard to squeeze to get the gel out so I have to cut the bottom to try and get the remaining out. I think if they changed it to plastic tubes it might be better. But in any case I&#x27;m never without this! Love!</li>
    <li> This product does work, if you brush with it everyday it dramatically improves the health of your gums. I was in pain and my gums were bleeding daily, I brushed my teeth with this stuff twice a day, and after about 2 weeks of using this my gums were not swollen anymore and in pain, and when brushing my teeth there was very little bleeding, soon afterward the bleeding stopped completely, and once it does, you can just use regular toothpaste on a regular basis to maintain your gum health. I recommend this product to anyone that is having bleeding issues with their gums.</li>
    <li> I had a bridge which was bleeding and sore and was about to confront my dentist. I found this item online, which I never heard of, and was glad I did. It actually shrank the gum tissue and stopped the bleeding. It even worked on another problem area that was bleeding after flossing. The secret is this: if the gum bleeds after flossing don&#x27;t shy away from that area. Use your fingers and force out as much blood as possible and than put the gel on. Repeat the process and the area should stop bleeding altogether. You do not have to worry about swallowing any of this product as it is harmless and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I had one tooth that was starting to hurt and was sensitive to cold things. After using this for less than a week (seriously, maybe 4 days using it before bed), the pain went away. I thought I would have to use the entire tube, but I just had to use a very little bit for my tooth to feel better. It&#x27;s back to normal and now my husband is using it for his gums. It has a very refreshing taste and left my mouth feeling very clean. It&#x27;s also great that this is not harmful if swallowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this kit for almost two years now and it still works great. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times because that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve needed to use it. Whenever I start getting a tooth ache, I use it before bed and the next day, the pain is gone. I would say that I have mild aches and sensitive spots though. If someone has a heavier or more painful ache, I can&#x27;t say whether it would work or not because I&#x27;ve never experienced that. For me, with my mild aches and sensitivities, it works great.</li>
    <li> Not a good product, tried it for a long while and no improvements! The gum situation did not change one bit.</li>
    <li> great product! Definitely minimizes bleeding of gums.</li>
    <li> Its hard to tell I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks but I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change . I have braces so I bought this to help keep my mouth healthy as its hard to get everything sometimes with all this hardware in the way</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because my gums not only bled a little when I brushed my teeth, they were sensitive and hurting.  As I did research on the symptoms, a diet change can cause gum soreness. A month prior I started taking mega doses of supplements and also started on herbal supplements and changed my diet to extremely healthy and 50% raw vegetables, which someone informed me could be the cause of my gums hurting. Nonetheless, I was still concerned about my gum sensitivity, therefore I was on a mission to find the potential cure.  When this product arrived and I immediately started using it as directed not missing one day for 2 weeks and today I just discovered it strengthened my gums so that when I brush my teeth, its not so sensitive it bleeds.!!! I am absolutely amazed!  I expected this to work after a month or two and has surpassed my expectations.  I love this product and ordered 2 more to keep this as part of my daily hygiene.  This is a great preventative maintenance product with Xylitol, a powerful cavity fighter.</li>
    <li> I tried this hoping to find a solution for my swollen gums. I&#x27;m hooked! It&#x27;s so easy to use, and my mouth feels so clean after using it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;1) brush &amp; floss as normal (rinse)&lt;br /&gt;2) brush with precondition gel (rinse)&lt;br /&gt;3) place a dab of periactil on your tongue, swipe around your mouth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fabulous product &amp; I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and everyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I have receding gums and a lot of sensitive areas along with a dozen crowns. This product really keeps the gumline/everything clean. I had not been to the dentist for five years when I broke a tooth. I had been using periactil for a few months when I showed up at my dentist. I told him: skip the cleaning and x-rays, just put a crown on the broken tooth, then we will talk. After the permanent crown was finished I talked him into one more x-ray and inspection that normally takes place only AFTER the cleaning and hygienist$$ are done with me. He said ok but, if you need cleaning, I am going to charge you for two inspections. I said go for it. So he did, like never before. After getting a double inspection, he was amazed. He wanted to know how this was possible. I told him that I use my top of the line waterpik/waterpik toothbrush and then my periactil once or twice a day. Your peria...what??? Periactil, the miracle tooth/mouth care product that I found on amazon. Before the periactil, I had lots of tarter buildup, pain, fuzzy feeling teeth, you know. After days/weeks of using the periactil, WOW. CRAZY CLEAN teeth, gumlines, mouth. My mouth/teeth/gumline all feel as clean or cleaner than coming from the dentist without all the trama/drama/cost. Removed alot of old stains that I never dreamed possible, I REALLY never expected any improvement there! I could go on forever about how much I love this product! After 56 years of dental products and problems, periactil is the best news ever! I have bought several loved ones periactil and the results have all been life changing for them also. The tubes are not very big but they last a long time. Use a small amount, does not take much. The kit lasts me three months using it twice a day. Be careful with the pre condition, it is clear and you can easily use to much and run out before the periactil gel. A HUGE thanks to makers/dealers of periactil for a truly amazing product. If I only could of had periactil from the start........</li>
    <li> I just got these-and used them 3 times already.&lt;br /&gt;I brush 1st with my regular toothpaste.  Than-once a day before I go to bed. I use the kit.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel very squeeky clean and my breathe is fresh -even in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work on cavities?  I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This is much better than any other fluoride toothpaste out there (although this one does not use fluoride). No cavities so far after changing to these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 08/26/2014&lt;br /&gt;This duo is very effective in preventing cavities. When used properly, there is no chance for any cavity to build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 03/30/2016&lt;br /&gt;After more than two years of using this product, teeth are still healthy.</li>
    <li> I like the taste and it really cleans well. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the need to brush twice, once with my regular toothpaste then again with the Periactil. That seems a little over-kill. Still, I suppose the important thing is that it has really improved my gum health and I&#x27;m grateful for that.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this at first.  My gums seems to lose ground when I stopped using the mouthwash (as directed).  However, they also lost ground when I stopped using this.  So, I started using the mouthwash after breakfast and lunch, and this at night before bed.  What a difference!  I am making real headway now.  This stuff is pricey, but not as pricey as new teeth.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have periodontal disease and was told I needed expensive periodontal surgery. I started using this with Perio-therapy and my gums do not bleed anymore. I can even say when i stop using this product my gums start bleeding again. This is a great alternative to expensive gum surgery</li>
    <li> I had a situation of intense pain in upper and lower back teeth when eating either cold or hot food/liquids. A dentist gave me treatment for this, but to no avail. I found the Periactil Precondition on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Before the first week of use had ended I felt great relief. By the end of the second week all problems were gone. I haven&#x27;t heard of any product that can achieve such wonderful results and do recommend it dearly. It is really a breakthrough! From now on this product will be for ever present in my household.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Periactil kit for several months, and I&#x27;m generally pleased with the results. I have rather chronic gum issues, and I would estimate that I have experienced a 50% reduction in overall symptoms. Also, flare-ups occur less frequently with reduced severity. This is quite significant for me personally, as this is the only product that has proven consistantly effective over time. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure, there are limiitations to what can be expected from a topical application, since it can&#x27;t penetrate very far below gum line. But, I have have seen a noticeable improvement in my condition, for which I am grateful. It also seems to improve halitosis symptoms. This is a legitimate product, a rarity these days...</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I am petrified of the dentist.  Even walking into an office and smelling the dentist smell makes my stomach revolt and I run for the bathroom.  I can&#x27;t even take my kids anymore.  I have always had bad gums that bleed.  I have gum recession too and I have had root planing done to combat this, but it only worked for a year or two.  My gums were getting worse and worse.  They were red and swollen and I could wiggle them in between my teeth with my tongue.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do (except go to the dentist and do the root planing again and I just can&#x27;t get in the door).  I bought this product and have used it for about 6 weeks.  I am well aware I still need the dentist, but my gums are now pink, not swollen, they seem to have reattached to my teeth.  They no longer wiggle, they no longer bleed and all I have left is a still slightly tender spot next to one tooth that is crooked and I can&#x27;t brush well next to it.  I am so excited to see pink healthy looking gums and I am smiling a lot more.  I will definitely buy this product and keep using it.  I&#x27;d like to know why the three different dentists I had over a 20 year period never recommended something like this to combat my gum problem.</li>
    <li> this product has regrown gum tissue around my teeth ,,something oral surgeans have failed to do in the last five years ,,thank you .I love this stuff Dave</li>
    <li> I suffer from terrible TMJ and many years of grinding have done a number on my teeth.  My gums were bleeding, the enamel on my teeth was worn down at the gum line, my teeth incredibly sensitive and the cavities were non-stop.  My dental hygienist made some recommendations for Xylitol toothpaste and Recaldent or Novamin.  So I started ordering several different brands until I found the right combo for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with Restore toothpaste, leaving it in my mouth for several minutes and then finish with Periactil every night.  These products contain different ingredients which is why I use both. Restore is a bit harsher, my tongue gets temporarily puckered and sore, so I finish with Periactil, which is especially kind and calming to my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums no longer bleed, my teeth are no longer sensitive and most unbelievably, the gaping dents where the enamel was worn off at my gum line have been completely filled in. Every night after brushing I feel like they&#x27;ve just been cleaned by the dentist. No exaggeration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that filling the dents did not fill in overnight. It took several weeks of this routine before I noticed they had filled in, however, the sensitivity and bleeding gums improved much quicker.  It is also important to note that I don&#x27;t just brush quickly then rinse.  I leave the product in my mouth for several minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough about this product, I now feel confident that my teeth can age gracefully into old age!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I have mild gingivitis and tartar problems, so I was hoping to see some improvement with this product. I&#x27;ve been using the product as directed (no mouthwash even though I&#x27;m a Listerine addict).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel in the green tube tastes lovely. It instantly makes your mouth feel really fresh. Sometimes if I need a freshening but don&#x27;t have time to brush my teeth I&#x27;ll just dab a little on my tongue and run it around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not, however, seeing any of the miraculous results that other people are claiming to see. My gums still look and feel the same and I&#x27;ve actually gotten a couple of canker sores, which I rarely get, even though the product says you should see a reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if some of the people getting results are getting them since they&#x27;re essentially brushing their teeth twice (once with regular toothpaste and once with the precondition gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, my mouth does feel really fresh after I use the products, which definitely feels nice. I&#x27;m going to keep using the product just in case my gums are being stubborn.</li>
    <li> i bought this with a little skeptisism as i have been batteling bleeding gum issues for years..but was excited to find it started working right away..i will be buying more when i run out</li>
    <li> I Love this product and have recommended it to all my family and friends, I had gum disease and was going to spend lots of money at the dentist, I used Periactil for 3 months and by the time I went back to the dentist my gum disease was gone. I can&#x27;t say enough about it, it&#x27;s great and it works.</li>
    <li> I started using this product last month and was hesitant about brushing so many times. I have advanced gum disease with deep pockets and my gums would bleed and was very sore after brushing. After using this product my gums which once were black are now pink and the swelling has gone down a lot. I can now floss without pain or bleeding and looking forward to my dentist visit soon. My next order is on the way and I will continue using this product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Satisfied Customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The product does not cure dental issues but has helped</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had discomfort or pain for a couple of years - bleeding gums, deep pockets (4&#x27;s, 5&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s). It was definitely getting worse. Now, after a month of using the Periactil kit per the directions, my mouth feels great, my gums look good and don&#x27;t bleed.  I was, of course, very skeptical, but after a week I noticed that food was no longer getting into my biggest problem spots. A few days later there was no bleeding while flossing. I can&#x27;t imagine how I could be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> After paying hundreds of dollars for dental cleanings after I was told I had periodontal disease, I started shopping around to find a home treatment kit. I have been very happy with the results from this product.  My gums have not bleed since I started using periactil about 8 months ago.</li>
    <li> 3 WEEKS....GUMS A LITTLE BETTER.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product numerous times and will continue to use it! and get this: I even used the green periactil on a cut I had with a bandaid and it cleared up better than the anti-biotic cream I was using! That&#x27;s why it works so well on my gums.</li>
    <li> Immediate results! Even my dentist commented on the results of this product. My gum are pink and tarter has been reduced. Use it twice daily and you will see why</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three times.  Easy to use.  You must not use mouthwash when using these products.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product only for a little over a week but liking the results so far. Something to be aware of is that this product does not work correctly while using mouthwash as well. This is the customer support email exchange I found very helpful:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Thank you for your inquiry.  There is a more serious reason not to use mouthwash (before or after using the Periactil Precondition Kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Preconditioner (white tube) is a super cleaner which prepares the mouth so that Periactil (green tube) can work at its full potential.  Periactil kills harmful bacteria by allowing the beneficial microbes which normally thrive in the mouth to prosper and do their natural job of killing the harmful microbes.  This is the way Mother Nature normally handles bacteria in a healthy mouth.  When the beneficial microbes are allowed to do their normal job, the benefits last for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash will KILL the beneficial microbes along with the harmful bacteria.  Thus eliminating the benefit of Periactil almost entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the beneficial microbes are allowed to thrive, there are many rewards ... cavity reduction, gum health, faster healing of any sores, fresher breath and, perhaps the most important, a reduction in periodontal pouches ... those little areas between the teeth and gums where harmful bacteria can invade the whole body and impact overall health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While mouthwash does provide the benefit of killing harmful bacteria, its impact is very limited and can only work until both good and bad microbes begin to reproduce in the mouth.  So what mouthwash does for a few minutes, Periactil does for a much longer period of time and results in a much healthier, fresher mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, with Periactil mouthwash is totally unnecessary ... Periactil does the good things that mouthwash does however Periactil doesn&#x27;t do the bad things that mouthwash does.  If you use the Precondition Kit as instructed, I believe you will find thatyour mouth will feel absolutely clean and fresh without mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t hesitate to ask if you have additional questions.  We are truly here to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owner / Manager&lt;br /&gt;MED-ACTIL, LLC\\&quot;</li>
    <li> After a disappointing dental visit, and the threat of gum flap surgery, I decided to attempt healing my gums and below gumline tartar at home.  I discarded all previous mouthwash and toothpaste, made my own tooth powder and dental rinse, then power brushed and waterflossed twice a day.  At bedtime, I use the Periactil kit.  It feels wonderful and soothing, after all that brush and floss, and the menthol in the gum rub helps me breathe better, so my mouth stays closed during sleep.  This is a wonderful product, and I intend to keep using it.  My teeth and gums look and feel much better, and I think I have avoided expensive and painful dental intervention.  UPDATE:  I have been using the product for some months now, and my gums have improved a lot.  A discolored area over a front tooth is now nice and pink again.  The gums are so tight I can no longer get the flosser pik tip under them, and one tooth that was a bit loose is now more firm.  I continue to powerbrush and waterfloss, but only once a day.  I use the periactil combination twice a day, before afternoon nap and nightly before (actually in) bed.  I love to read and snack in bed, so keep the periactil and a toothbrush on a bedside table and do a brush and gum rub just before turning out the light. Great product and great results.</li>
    <li> I had big expectation about these products,I always read review before buying things online.The reviews are very good for what these can really achieved.</li>
    <li> I been buying this for a while it works, it helps my teeth, an it does kill bad breath, my gums know longer bleed since I have been using this product, I use to have space an between my teeth an over time it got smaller,my teeth have got stronger, since I have been using this I haven been back to the dentist since...still works 4 year user... an I dont work for these ppl</li>
    <li> I love it.  It does what it&#x27;s suppose too.  I can&#x27;t complain.  I like that there is not a strong taste or smell.  My teeth doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  That&#x27;s a big plus.  I need to use it longer to see real results first though.  I&#x27;ll be going the dentist soon for my check up in a month.  I&#x27;ll update later.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product my teeth and mouth felt like I had just had them cleaned at the dentist.  I really noticed the difference when I forgot it while gone for a few days. I was so glad to get back and start using it again. Will update after a couple of months</li>
