### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>THE GREAT QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!</li>
      <li>Very good durable scissors!  </li>
      <li>the scissors work great, if i could get my fingers in the holes.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a good reason they had to put rubber pads.</li>
      <li>These scissors should be ideal for most adults.</li>
      <li>Although I find the quality of these scissors very good they have a huge flaw regarding the finger holes.</li>
      <li>The blades are more curved than others I&#x27;ve owned, which helps.</li>
      <li>I love these scissors.</li>
      <li>I was very excited.  </li>
      <li>Not bad!</li>
      <li>Strong and look durable, I like them.</li>
      <li>My wife can use it just fine</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t fit my fingers in the hole.</li>
      <li>I lost my old pair and hadn&#x27;t been able to find a replacement pair that I liked and I searched and found them on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>This would be a great product if they did some testing on male humans first.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell much from the photo, but was pleased when I got them.</li>
      <li>However, the rubber grips in the holes (although a good idea because it makes it more comfortable to hold) make the opening to small for my finger to fit through.</li>
      <li>The red rubber inlays can be taken off easily adding more room</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, keep looking b/c these aren&#x27;t worth getting.</li>
      <li>You might have a better experience if you get sent better scissors as other reviewers seem to have.</li>
      <li>it is exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>If it makes you feel better, the back of the package clarifies that Revlon guarantees the nail scissor against defects in materials or workmanship.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty much exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These scissors and not particularly sharp or functional, and are not all that comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>but my fingers are too large</li>
      <li>This handy little scissor feels sturdy in my hand, but I do think that the blades should be thinner for maximum usability, hence the loss of one star.</li>
      <li>only a child&#x27;s fingers would fit.  </li>
      <li>They cut very well</li>
      <li>great for a little Money; I love the red Rings , but to small for my hands ; so I removed it</li>
      <li>i will be looking for another pair which I will most likely buy locally</li>
      <li>so I can make sure the tip is narrow.</li>
      <li>Based on the price I expected these to be better than something you would buy for a couple of bucks at your local discount or drug store.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have had much better fingernail scissors and will continue to look for a quality replacement for my old ones which have a bit too worn and dull.</li>
      <li>could have just easily found a similar pair for about half the cost, or spend a little more for something higher quality which is what I&#x27;ll probably ultimately do.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber grips on the inside of the scissors were nice, but they did not make up for the poor cutting functionality.</li>

<li> I have been looking for these for a long time.  </li>

<li> This product was what I expected.</li>

<li> it&#x27;s not worth complaining or going through a return.&lt;br</li>
<li> They are EXTREMELY stiff.</li>

<li> Suppose for price these are marginally acceptable, however I am not pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
<li> AND the blades are dull and cut poorly.</li>
<li> It is impossible to use the scissors without the rubber rings because the metal edges inside the finger grips are too sharp and hurt your fingers.</li>
<li> When cutting my nails with my non-dominant hand I might as well have been trying to to peel the nail off with pliers.</li>
<li> Like another reviewer mentioned, when cutting with your non-dominant hand it&#x27;s practically impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> but if you do that, they become very uncomfortable because of the bad ergonomics of the metal base.</li>
<li> These scissors are the worst piece of junk I ever purchased.  </li>

    <li> This handy little scissor feels sturdy in my hand, but I do think that the blades should be thinner for maximum usability, hence the loss of one star. If it makes you feel better, the back of the package clarifies that Revlon guarantees the nail scissor against defects in materials or workmanship. Not bad!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell much from the photo, but was pleased when I got them. They&#x27;re pretty much exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re sturdy enough to last and plenty sharp. The blades are more curved than others I&#x27;ve owned, which helps. These scissors should be ideal for most adults.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t fit my fingers in the hole.</li>
    <li> The scissor cuts well and seems durable. However, the rubber grips in the holes (although a good idea because it makes it more comfortable to hold) make the opening to small for my finger to fit through. My wife can use it just fine but my fingers are too large and I end up taking the rubber out and putting it back in after I&#x27;m done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note, I&#x27;m not a giant. I&#x27;m 6 feet tall and 165lbs.</li>
    <li> Based on the price I expected these to be better than something you would buy for a couple of bucks at your local discount or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;That was not the case. These scissors and not particularly sharp or functional, and are not all that comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;I could have just easily found a similar pair for about half the cost, or spend a little more for something higher quality which is what I&#x27;ll probably ultimately do.&lt;br /&gt;The rubber grips on the inside of the scissors were nice, but they did not make up for the poor cutting functionality.</li>
    <li> Very good durable scissors!  These scissors have the grip on the handles so my fingers don&#x27;t slip.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these for a long time.  I lost my old pair and hadn&#x27;t been able to find a replacement pair that I liked and I searched and found them on Amazon.  I was very excited.  I love these scissors.</li>
    <li> Although I find the quality of these scissors very good they have a huge flaw regarding the finger holes. They cut very well but they are just too small for a guy, even for an avg/small guy like me. The red rubber inlays can be taken off easily adding more room but if you do that, they become very uncomfortable because of the bad ergonomics of the metal base. There&#x27;s a good reason they had to put rubber pads. This would be a great product if they did some testing on male humans first.</li>
    <li> Suppose for price these are marginally acceptable, however I am not pleased with them.&lt;br /&gt;They are not very sharp, other than the point.  The shearing blades are not properly alined and leave a ragged fingernail.  I have had much better fingernail scissors and will continue to look for a quality replacement for my old ones which have a bit too worn and dull.</li>
    <li> Issue 1: I did not get the product shown but for $3 it&#x27;s not worth complaining or going through a return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issue 2: These scissors don&#x27;t open or close well. They are EXTREMELY stiff. Like another reviewer mentioned, when cutting with your non-dominant hand it&#x27;s practically impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, keep looking b/c these aren&#x27;t worth getting. i will be looking for another pair which I will most likely buy locally so I can make sure the tip is narrow.</li>
    <li> My scissors came without the red grip softeners. When cutting my nails with my non-dominant hand I might as well have been trying to to peel the nail off with pliers. You might have a better experience if you get sent better scissors as other reviewers seem to have.</li>
    <li> finger holes too small.  only a child&#x27;s fingers would fit.  the scissors work great, if i could get my fingers in the holes.</li>
    <li> These scissors are the worst piece of junk I ever purchased.  The little red rubber rings will not stay put in the finger grips and continually fall out. It is impossible to use the scissors without the rubber rings because the metal edges inside the finger grips are too sharp and hurt your fingers. AND the blades are dull and cut poorly.</li>
    <li> Sharp and nice size, but annoying as the rubber rings inside the handles always come off when I use them.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t cut as well as I would like them to. They will be workable but wish they were smaller.</li>
    <li> This product was what I expected. I would recommend it at this price to anyone. it is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> great for a little Money; I love the red Rings , but to small for my hands ; so I removed it</li>
    <li> MY WIFE USE IT FOR CUT ALL FAMILY  NAILS&lt;br /&gt;CHILDREN AN ADULTS ARE THE PRINCIPAL USERS.&lt;br /&gt;I ADVISE FOR THE GREAT QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Strong and look durable, I like them.</li>
