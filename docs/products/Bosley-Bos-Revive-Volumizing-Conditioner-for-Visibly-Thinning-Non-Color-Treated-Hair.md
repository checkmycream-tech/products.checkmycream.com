### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great hair conditioner!</li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>This is a very good Conditioner.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the product has a pleasant fragrance, almost like a peppermint/menthol mix.  </li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really good.</li>
      <li>I started searching for something else and read good reviews of the Bosley products, so decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Good price</li>
      <li>Your hair smells good and it does look and feel thicker with continued use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve lost more hair than ever!</li>
      <li>I love all Bosley products!</li>
      <li>but I liked the way my hair felt after using this.</li>
      <li>Just a heads-up, it probably won&#x27;t regrow your hair, but as far as things that minimize hair loss and help thicken up the appearance, this is the best I&#x27;ve found in 6+ years.</li>
      <li>sure you buy twice the amount of conditioner than shampoo.</li>
      <li>Could have kept more hair</li>
      <li>I am 52 and have been losing hair for many years.</li>
      <li>The tingling sensation most people feel might have something to do with the menthol products, but I could be mistaken.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve given it two months now, but have lost more hair than ever.  </li>
      <li>Excellent Product...use it almost daily...</li>
      <li>I love the cool minty sensation it gives my scalp after each shower, it will literally put you to sleep.  </li>
      <li>Some conditioner brands bother my scalp, but this one is fine for me.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Your hair is getting cleaned and volumized, but you can buy products that are significantly cheaper</li>
      <li>I kept that up until a couple of months ago, after noticing that the Nioxin seemed not to be as effective as it had been (many reviews on Amazon made the same conclusion.)</li>
      <li>They are the right stuff!</li>
      <li>I have a full head of hair</li>
      <li>my brush is no longer full of hair.</li>
      <li>Have used a log of different products, this one seems to do better than most.</li>
      <li>I think the results from using Bosley  Volumizing Conditioner is just adequate.</li>
      <li>It is actually quite enjoyable to use!  </li>
      <li>I can easily run my fingers through my hair (even after it has dried) and it feels good.</li>
      <li>I leave it in my hair for 5 minutes, as the directions say, and when I get out of the shower my hair feels very silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>Delivery time was right on schedule,can&#x27;t wait to try this product</li>
      <li>The product works very well and has a pleasant fragrance, compared to other hair restoration products.</li>
      <li>I gave that 4 weeks and lost WAY to much hair!</li>
      <li>the price I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>This product is my favorite now since they stopped making the American Crew Revitalizing products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how many I lost each time I used the Bosley products, but judging by the volume of the hair, it had to have been 350-400 (about 4 to 5 times more than tonight.)</li>
      <li>but I had several people tell me that this stuff is much better.</li>
      <li>It feels slightly cool on the head, which is a satisfying feeling to give the impression it is actively working.  </li>
      <li>The product lathers slightly, which is nice for coverage.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Really does appear to thicken my hair.</li>
      <li>I can even see through to my scalp again, much like after trying the Rogaine.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much my hair has grown since.  </li>
      <li>If there are other products in the market that will produce better results in hair growth coupled with the volumizing effect for visibly thinning hair, I would try it.</li>
      <li>My hair is left feeling very clean, and there is no apparent residue or flakes that I&#x27;ve noticed in using this product.  </li>
      <li>Some hair still falls and that&#x27;s normal, but my hair is shinier and it feels thicker and healthier than when I started the treatment.</li>
      <li>The instructions said to expect more hair loss than normal for a few weeks.</li>
      <li>Purchased 2 bottles, but did not see any new hair growth.</li>
      <li>I was growing new hair with the shampoo</li>
      <li>If you need a new shampoo and conditioner that really works, then look no further.</li>
      <li>I know that hair loss is a complex issue with many variables.</li>
      <li>I am Hispanic and I have naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>Not so much that I had any balding, but enough that my hair continues getting thinner and thinner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually doing anything to my hair in terms of the thinning, but I am glad to see that there are ingredients such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), biotin, and Nettle in it to help prevent hair from falling out</li>
      <li>and I go through a small palm full of conditioner with each shower.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product works very well and has a pleasant fragrance, compared to other hair restoration products.</li>
    <li> I am 26 and have been slowly balding since I was 18 with an ever growing bald spot.  I have been using this product for about 3-4 months now and have noticed no change in my hair.  The bottles are very big and last a long time, but I didn&#x27;t notice any help with the bald spot.</li>
    <li> I think the results from using Bosley  Volumizing Conditioner is just adequate. If there are other products in the market that will produce better results in hair growth coupled with the volumizing effect for visibly thinning hair, I would try it. For now, I will continue using Bosley.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 months and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much my hair has grown since.  I love the cool minty sensation it gives my scalp after each shower, it will literally put you to sleep.  Friends and family have also noticed the difference in my hair.  If you need a new shampoo and conditioner that really works, then look no further.</li>
    <li> Delivery time was right on schedule,can&#x27;t wait to try this product will keep you updated on how it works .excited to try it since my hair is very thin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read previous reviews of this product where people proclaim &amp;#34;I can feel it tingling, so it must be working!&amp;#34; This is much further from the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase this product thinking that it&#x27;s going to re-grow your hair. All it does is add volume. The tingling sensation most people feel might have something to do with the menthol products, but I could be mistaken. It feels like Head &amp; Shoulders or Selsun Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I wouldn&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s worth the hassle. Your hair is getting cleaned and volumized, but you can buy products that are significantly cheaper that do the same thing. Just ask yourself if you&#x27;re buying this product because it&#x27;s made by Bosley,  or to cope with hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy twice the amount of conditioner than shampoo. I&#x27;m a man with (shoulder length) long hair and I go through a small palm full of conditioner with each shower.</li>
    <li> Where the thick hair?</li>
    <li> Great product!  I don&#x27;t have worry about remebering to put on extra foam during the day because the hairloss treatment is already in this shampoo and conditioner. Works the same as rogain</li>
    <li> Great product.  Really does appear to thicken my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months after the shampoo.  the shampoo was actually working for me so bought this to add to the shampoo. it does ad volume  to the hair and I like the tingle on my scalp.  I was growing new hair with the shampoo so can&#x27;t say if this helped that process but I liked the way my hair felt after using this.</li>
    <li> My hair has stopped falling out!!!  No more clumps of hair and my brush is no longer full of hair.</li>
    <li> This product is my favorite now since they stopped making the American Crew Revitalizing products.Started using Bosley because of how bad Nioxin was for my already falling out hair. Massive amounts of hair loss using Nioxin, did not always do this to my hair, seems they moved manufacturing to Mexico...there lies the answer in why terrible now. Bosley is keeping the little hair I have on my head where it belongs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost more hair than ever! A little history of my hair loss journey...  I am 52 and have been losing hair for many years. Not so much that I had any balding, but enough that my hair continues getting thinner and thinner. A couple of years ago, I decided to try Rogaine for women. The instructions said to expect more hair loss than normal for a few weeks. I gave that 4 weeks and lost WAY to much hair! Now my hair was extremely thin with scalp showing through at the part, so I stopped that. I had used Nioxin in the past, so I started that again. I did notice renewed hair growth and a slowing down of the hair loss. I kept that up until a couple of months ago, after noticing that the Nioxin seemed not to be as effective as it had been (many reviews on Amazon made the same conclusion.) I started searching for something else and read good reviews of the Bosley products, so decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve given it two months now, but have lost more hair than ever.  I can even see through to my scalp again, much like after trying the Rogaine. I stopped using the Bosely shampoo and conditioner about a week ago and the hair loss is slowing down. I actually counted lost hairs aftering showering and combing tonight. About 80 hairs. I&#x27;m not sure how many I lost each time I used the Bosley products, but judging by the volume of the hair, it had to have been 350-400 (about 4 to 5 times more than tonight.) I&#x27;m not sure why this hasn&#x27;t worked for me. I know that hair loss is a complex issue with many variables. I just wish I could find something that works.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this formula. I&#x27;ve tried various &amp;#34;specialty&amp;#34; conditioners for thinning hair, and some of them feel and smell awful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was not the case with Bosley&#x27;s conditioner. It is actually quite enjoyable to use!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually doing anything to my hair in terms of the thinning, but I am glad to see that there are ingredients such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), biotin, and Nettle in it to help prevent hair from falling out prematurely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the product has a pleasant fragrance, almost like a peppermint/menthol mix.  It feels slightly cool on the head, which is a satisfying feeling to give the impression it is actively working.  The product lathers slightly, which is nice for coverage.  My hair is left feeling very clean, and there is no apparent residue or flakes that I&#x27;ve noticed in using this product.  I recommend it, and I&#x27;m also going to look for the Bosley shampoo as soon as I&#x27;m done writing this review.</li>
    <li> this product along with the shampoo has helped reduce the thinning of my hair.</li>
    <li> Been using for months now .  It works .  Will be using it for lifetime.  No need for other shampoos. Wished I knew about it sooner.  Could have kept more hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a great conditioner for someone with long hair.  Used it on my scalp, but had to use another conditioner on the ends.  Purchased 2 bottles, but did not see any new hair growth.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good. I used to use Nioxin but I had several people tell me that this stuff is much better. So far so good. Thanks</li>
    <li> Just a heads-up, it probably won&#x27;t regrow your hair, but as far as things that minimize hair loss and help thicken up the appearance, this is the best I&#x27;ve found in 6+ years.</li>
    <li> Made my head itch and soar.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product...use it almost daily...You can see the results in a couple of weeks...I have a full head of hair&lt;br /&gt;Richard</li>
    <li> Great product. Good quality. Good price</li>
    <li> Have used a log of different products, this one seems to do better than most. My hair felt noticeably thicker after using it. \</li>
    <li> This is a very good Conditioner. It&#x27;s extremely difficult to get my hair to look and feel decent, and this really helps. I leave it in my hair for 5 minutes, as the directions say, and when I get out of the shower my hair feels very silky and smooth. I can easily run my fingers through my hair (even after it has dried) and it feels good. Some conditioner brands bother my scalp, but this one is fine for me.</li>
    <li> It adds lots of volume to hair, but not sure it does anything to regrow it. My husband uses it but I think it is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since December 2013. I am Hispanic and I have naturally curly hair. After childbirth and hitting my 30&#x27; the hair is starting to thin visibly. I don&#x27;t believe that it has helped regrow the hair, but it has stopped the hair from falling at an alarming rate. Some hair still falls and that&#x27;s normal, but my hair is shinier and it feels thicker and healthier than when I started the treatment.</li>
    <li> Great hair conditioner! I love all Bosley products! They are the right stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for thinning hair.  Your hair smells good and it does look and feel thicker with continued use.</li>
