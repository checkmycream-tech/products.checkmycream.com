<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 4 stars because my thoughts were mislead and I probably didnt read the product dimensions because this beauty blender is small than expected, its about 3&amp;#34; but nonetheless it serves in purpose and frankly might be better than larger one since it can better move into creases and corners</li>
    <li> I watched so many YouTube reviews and had to have it and finally I broke down and purchased and must say it is worth all the hype. It gives a nice flawless coverage the only downfall is the sponge does get some staining but doesn&#x27;t affect the make up application</li>
    <li> This is an amazing makeup applicator. The beauty blender is truly a unique item. I have tried it with liquid foundations, a BB cream, concealer, and a cream foundation. I don&#x27;t like the beauty blender for all things, but I do like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle: because you don&#x27;t use buffing motions, the beauty blender is ideal for sensitive skin. My skin is very prone to irritation acne break-outs that can be caused by buffing motions or brush bristles, so this is a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: Cleans very easily. Use baby shampoo or baby bath soap and warm water. I dab some Ponds cold cream on stubborn makeup spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: The beauty blender does an amazing job of blending and providing an even makeup coverage without irritating skin. The contoured point allows for maneuvering around under eyes and the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cream foundation: The beauty blender does an amazing job with cream foundations; I&#x27;ll never use anything else ever again. My makeup looks just like skin. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty blender does not work well with all products and is on the pricey side; that&#x27;s why I give it a four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending: I first tried this with the Covergirl TruBlend liquid foundation and was disappointed. I find the foundation to be one of the thicker more troublesome foundations I&#x27;ve used and it takes a lot of blending and working for it to sheer out to the look I prefer. The beauty blender does not work well with sheering out a product like a brush does; it focuses more on providing an even coverage of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponge: This is a problem shared by all sponges; it&#x27;s hard to tell how much product you actually have on the sponge until you apply it to the face. This takes some adapting, particularly when using a liquid foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Point: The tip of the beauty blender is not as pointed as other sponges, like the Real Techniques sponge. This makes it very hard to use is for spot concealer, like for acne, scars, or small birth marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dye: The first time I wet the beauty blender and gave it a squeeze, it released a torrent of neon pink water into my sink. I thought that was weird, but it didn&#x27;t do it after that. Until I washed it the first time. Then the same thing happened. I&#x27;m rather nervous about the amount of dye the sponge is releasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: The sponge has a very felt or velvet like texture and feels very delicate. After my first week of using, I noticed a small divot that turned into a small tear. I fear this is a product I will have to replace on a semi-regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty blender is capable of giving a beautiful finish if paired with the right foundation. There is a bit of a learning curve to using it, but even though it was expensive, I&#x27;m glad I bought the beauty blender.r acne, scars, or small birth marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dye: The first time I wet the beauty blender and gave it a squeeze, it released a torrent of neon pink water into my sink.

    <li> Easy to use and super blendable.  It gives you a light, dewy finish with your foundation.  I love to use it for concealer application.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender does just what its name implies.....blends makeup evenly and smoothly. Just a few drops of my liquid makeup&lt;br /&gt;does the whole job without looking &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;,  I used to use a tissue and wipe off most of the makeup after applying with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;No need to do this any longer.  It is great.  I store it in the little stand it came packaged in so it airs out after rinsing thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every cent!!!</li>
    <li> Love this sponge, it gives you better foundation finish than a brush or hands</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with this product. I bought it because of a YouTube video but honestly I&#x27;ve seen knockoffs in stores for much less. Now I have a$15 sponge that sits in my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> I know everybody is raving about this blender but its not really doing it for me. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my previous blenders.</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge. Really good for concealers and covering up blemishes. Leaves a flawless finish and I am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I like the sponge for what it is used for, but I cannot get the makeup out of it. I bought the cleaner, and tried other ways to clean it, and it is stained.  Will still use it, but don&#x27;t think I will buy another one.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the Beautyblender.  I use to apply concealer under the eyes and it goes on beautifully. I don&#x27;t get creases.</li>
    <li> This is thee sponge to get. The egg shape it perfect for applying makeup to every part of the face. The beautyblender applies makeup so well. It doesn&#x27;t soak up your foundation like other sponges do and it gives you an airbrushed look. I would definitely recommend this to others and buy again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I saw a lot of youtubers raving about the product so I was stoked to get it.Once it arrived I waited a few days to try it out and it did not do any better than a less expensive cosmetic sponge that you could get from any local drugstore or walmart.</li>
    <li> I used to think that my foundation (Bobbi Brown) was maybe not the right fit for me, but after buying this little applicator, I know it was due to the wrong applicator. Wet or dry, this sponge helps distribute foundation evenly on your face. LOVE</li>
    <li> The one I purchased from Sephora had a different texture to it. I prefer the one I purchased from Sephora. This one applied my makeup a little different but I don&#x27;t regret buying it. It&#x27;s not horrible. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the original beautyblender however it&#x27;s an ok dupe. It&#x27;s definitely not worth the price. Go to Sephora.com and buy The Original Beautyblender it gives you almost an airbrushed effect when you use it damp to apply your foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> So expensive for such a tiny thing but I Saul all over YouTube so hope it works</li>
    <li> I lover the shape. The point  on the top is perfect to blend concealer around the eyes. It does exactly what it is suppose to do.,  a little pricey but worth it.&lt;br /&gt; Easy to clean.  When the time comes I will get another one.</li>
    <li> The blender is actually very small. The picture is quite deceiving. This is definitely not worth the price. I feel ripped off!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used beauty blender bought from sephora for the past 6 months and buy my third one from amazon.com for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;The bounciness and fine consistency of the sponge felt very different from the one I had before. Don&#x27;t know if the company change the product to the much worse material or I received the FAKE one from amazon. It felt very rough and not bouncy though the color  look real. Too bad, I coudn&#x27;t return this as it already open and I bought the 2 sponge pack. Still don&#x27;t know what to do with them. Does amazon sell fake stuff or anybody has the same problem as me?</li>
    <li> I will never use a makeup brush again... beauty blender is the way to go!</li>
    <li> The best blender ever hope price will go dpwn</li>
    <li> My beauty blender came used! So upset :(</li>
    <li> This sponge is the best one I have ever used. It is great for blending concealer, and especially for blending around areas like your nose or eyes. I originally read about it in a magazine, and pre-ordered it from amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. The price point is a little intimidating, but after having used it for a few months, I believe the excellent quality makes it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes about using the cleanser - it doesn&#x27;t come with this particular item, but is offered by amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is dispensed from the bottle by gently pushing the sponge down on the pedestal (exactly like the picture, you just push down and a small amount of cleanser is dispensed directly on to the sponge. Although generally I wouldn&#x27;t buy cleanser this expensive, I am happy that I have it. It has a very light lavender fragrance and is gentle and soy-based. You don&#x27;t need very much (about the size of a dime, which is what is dispensed if you use the bottle as directed) if you are cleaning your sponge on a regular basis. If you haven&#x27;t cleaned it in a few days you might need to repeat a few times, but eventually the makeup will all come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this sponge and will be buying more as gifts for friends and family. I would recommend buying the 2-pack if purchasing from amazon, as it&#x27;s a better value, and you&#x27;ll have an extra one for travel, or to alternate between the sponges if you don&#x27;t feel like cleaning them all the time! I did notice that the beautyblender website sells this sponge &amp; cleanser combination for a lower price than amazon (plus shipping though), so you may also want to shop around a bit before making this small investment!</li>
    <li> Your best makeup tool</li>
    <li> I debated buying this makeup sponge because it is a bit pricey.  It&#x27;s a wonderful makeup sponge.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing! It&#x27;s hard to believe a sponge could make such a difference to how your makeup looks. It gives you an airbrushed look. It is pricey for a sponge, but it is well worth your money. You don&#x27;t need to use as much foundation as you would normally when you use this sponge. It works just as it promises and it is reusable for a long long time, especially if you know how to take care of it and wash it with it&#x27;s cleanser, which is so gentle by the way, and smells wonderful. Another good thing about this sponge is that it is recyclable. If you want to throw yours away, you can send it back to the company and they will recycle it.</li>
    <li> Not the original beauty blender &amp;#62;.&amp;#62; its a waste of money !! I had to go to the store to buy the genuine original beauty blender</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works beautifully to blend foundation!!</li>
    <li> Wow~ works great applies make up with a clean and flawless finish. Wish I had bought one years ago....</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this there&#x27;s not other way to apply my foundation</li>
    <li> I will always order this product the best ever</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product...Perfectly applies any liquid makeup...easy to clean! Arrived prompt and was package well as not to be damaged! Can&#x27;t beat the price Anywhere else...this is the best brand of this product by far! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it so much and I save a couple dollars than the one at sephora</li>
    <li> Love this thing. I use it all the time after I received it. Blends makeup into skin flawlessly and worth the price.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life?  Awesome!</li>
    <li> Life changing product!!! I use this for liquid foudation and concealer and it works so much better than any brush I have ever used.</li>
    <li> So, so, so, so good. Go get one. Seriously, if you wear liquid foundation, dot some on with your finger, then use the beauty blender to dot/dab your foundation in. Leaves the most perfect finish. Totally worth the $$, and way better than the cheaper knock-offs.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!  I now use less foundation and gives me a very natural look!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love!!! Blends foundation flawlessly!</li>
    <li> Wish these wern&#x27;t so expensive but if you take care of it it lasts.</li>
    <li> When it&#x27;s soaked it&#x27;s too light and super soft like if it bounces off your foundation while applying it the best Beauty blender I have ever used I purchased it at ulta for 10$ that one was amazing it was hard but as you pressed it it became very spongy that one was amazing!!</li>
    <li> I love using this product.  It disperses my makeup really evenly.  I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Best way to apply liquid foundation</li>
    <li> OK product, but made my makeup wet and soupy.... you have to use it with care.</li>
    <li> I found about the sponge through PEOPLE magazine.  It is amazing. If you use expensive foundation, this is the sponge for you. It doesn&#x27;t waste your foundation. I have big pores and the foundation can goop up  The sponge eliminates the foundation from clogging up your pores. It evenly spreads out the foundation and very easy to grip and apply.  It doesn&#x27;t soak in your foundation like department store makeup applications. The packaging includes a plastic holder so there is no need to wrap in tissue to stay clean. The outside plastic packaging is also useful. I use it for my Q-tips.</li>
    <li> This was misleading ! It is tiny....not the normal size beauty blender and priced too high the size !</li>
    <li> I read about this in a magazine where the reviewer raved and raved. I figured, why not and ordered it even tho it was pricey. It&#x27;s cute, you bet, but just try cleaning it after the first use. What do you mean it won&#x27;t come clean?? Try soap?? Still nothing?? You can still see and feel the make up ??&lt;br /&gt;So, now I have this cute, used to be pink, thingy on my counter. Can&#x27;t get it clean no matter how I try. My advice would be to stick to your old foam wedges that can be cleaned.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge! It&#x27;s easy to clean after every use, which helps avoid breakouts and stuff.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and I was very disappointed. According to the description I should have received one applicator sponge but when I opened the box there were two mini fake sponges. The shippers sent the original beautyblender case and might I add looked old with faded lettering. It&#x27;s very unfortunate for those such as myself who are temporarily overseas without a USPS close by or I would return this product.</li>
    <li> Makes applying liquid foundation a breeze. I use this when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have enough time to put on makeup. This doesn&#x27;t not leave streaks of foundation on my face and makes foundation easy to blend. I also use the pointy part to apply undereye concealer and other areas and contour of the face that aren&#x27;t flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product</li>
    <li> The Seller for my order was Amazon so no doubt about it, is the real thing, it is indeed a wonderful sponge, cleaning it is a bit tricky at first but is a great product, I would order it again and I would definitely make sure Amazon is the seller, I have seen a lot of complaints about other sellers and don&#x27;t want to risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great sponge! To begin with, it does leave your face looking very dewy and airbrush like. It&#x27;s not like other cheap alternatives ones because 1. doesn&#x27;t feel the same and 2. when both wet this sponge absorbs less 3. This reaches and is good for corners and edges. I tested this sponge to see how much it absorbed of my foundation AFTER I got it wet and squeezed out the excess water and to my surprise it was very little. I really like this because I can get a better look with cheaper foundations. I use the bottom big part of the egg when im done applying my makeup with the egg to get any excess out and im done!</li>
    <li> Now I see what the hype is about: this little sponge makes blending makeup much easier.  I dot my foundation on my face first, spread most of it with my fingers and then use the Beauty Blender to blend everything evenly.</li>
    <li> You will save money by buying a good sponge like this one. My liquid foundation is stretching a lot farther than it used to so I am saving a bit of change by not wasting a bunch like I do when I use my fingers.  This blender is especially good for applying makeup because of the way it is shaped. I like it.</li>
    <li> A makeup essential. My makeup looks so flawless because of this thing. Especially coming from someone like me, who is new to makeup, this blender makes application seamless!</li>
    <li> This works foundation and concealer into the skin beautifully. I have found pressing &amp; rolling it along the skin works great.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t blend half as well as the real techniques sponge I have. This may not be the original as the packaging looks a little different from the one in Sephora.</li>
    <li> makes applying undereye concealer a breeze.  it&#x27;s a little bulky for undereye area but does work well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and does the job well. I was slightly disappointed that I need to wash it between applications though. Thats not always easy. Good product overall.</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best beauty blending sponge in the market. I love how well and easily it blends my concealer, highlighter, cream blush, foundation. If you want that dewy look its great for foundation but I myself perfer the sigma F80 flat kabuki top brush to buff and blend my foundation and the beauty blender is the best at blending concealer, it&#x60;s a staple in my beauty bag and routine! I do recommend to wash it once before using it but after that it super easy to wash and maintain.</li>
    <li> Best makeup sponge ever!!!</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is a wonderful product.  I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and i love it!!!It just makes putting on foundation (and concealer) a lot easier to blend and it looks natural, especially now with summer coming.  I don&#x27;t know what has taken me so long to order this as I am a beauty junkie and try everything at least once.  This is a product that I will definitely repurchase. It is very different from those wedge sponges available at drugstores.  I have used them in the past but no longer repurchase those since using this product. One recommendation is that you have to use it moist, it won&#x27;t make much difference if you use it dry.  That is the key to this product.  I would definitely recommend this  for everyone, makeup artists, beginners anyone who loves makeup and wants a flawless look.  Highly recommended!!!!!</li>
    <li> This sponge is WORTH every penny. I know its a little pricey but you cant beat the results and it really is easy and fast. All I did was watch the video on beautyblender.net and it went perfect. Flawless application, you use less make up than with a brush, and no streaking. If you are looking for that perfect finish to your foundation you have found it with beautyblender.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she like it. it was as described, and the buyer was friendly too . thanks a lot</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing makeup secret I have encountered in a long time. I don&#x27;t know what the magic is behind this little pink thing, but I use it to blend concealer, foundation, and it makes my makeup look flawless.  I have always envied those girls with flawless nice skin. I have to wear concealer to leave the house, and this little thing makes it blend in so that it looks natural and coverage is still there. Plus, I am not wasting a bunch  of makeup that just gets absorbed by those little sponge applicators. Buy this thing. Seriously.</li>
    <li> I love my new beauty blender! My foundation was always cakey and I heard so many good things about this product so I decided to give in and I&#x27;m so glad I did! My makeup goes on so  smooth now and the sponge is so soft on your face. It did bleed a little when I washed it with soap, but not with just plain water and it was only a tad. All in all great product!</li>
    <li> provides a flawless airbrush finish, helps bends throughly</li>
    <li> The Beauty Blender is super soft, and that&#x27;s my favorite thing about it. That&#x27;s also really the only difference between it and another blending sponge. You get the same results. It&#x27;s great for the eye area because it applies makeup so gently. I don&#x27;t know whether its worth the price though yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it a few times now and each time the dye has bled. Not liking that.&lt;br /&gt;The first time, the dye bled a lot. Now the sponge is a lighter pink color.&lt;br /&gt;Im also starting to feel like it takes less time to just use my hand/fingers for foundation application then using this. Eiether way you get nice results.</li>
    <li> I use this constantly and it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> The beauty blender on the left is one I purchased from Sephora. It feels lush dry &amp; feels even more so when wet. The &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; on the right is one a friend gave me on the right. When I started using it, it felt a bit rough compared to the one I already had. Not that it was harsh on my skin, but it definitely felt like a cheaper material of &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;. When soaked it under water &amp; squeezed it until it was ready to use, the sponge felt even cheaper. For lack of a better word, the real beauty blender will feel plush &amp; marshmallow-like while the fake one felt as if it could easily tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the eye, they look exactly the same. The packaging, the instructions that come on the inside &amp; the product is sealed, so why not buy it from Amazon? BUT- when you compare the quality with your hands, it should be consistent &amp; be the same. You can tell from my attached photo that the tip of the right beauty blender &amp; from Amazon (&amp; even more in person) is not the same either. It&#x27;s as if it was attached to anothe beauty blender at the tip &amp; both were twisted off from each other to separate the two (aka excess sponge that the REAL one would not have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sponge is a sponge. I&#x27;m a makeup artist &amp; essentially you can make it work if you really wanted to. But to scam customers thinking this is the real deal &amp; making them think this is the quality of the Beauty Blender - IS WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to go to your local makeup store like Sephora &amp; purchase it from there. It lasts much longer even after several washes &amp; the quality of it is exactly what you should be getting.</li>
    <li> Worthless. I was so excited and saw no changes in the way my makeup looked smh</li>
    <li> This product makes any foundation achieve an airbrush finish! I only use this after wetting and squeezing water out. I have used brushes and sponges but only this allows me to get into those tiny curved parts of the face to smooth out any product for a flawless finish perfect for closeup!</li>
    <li> O-M-G!!!!! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve gone so long without buying this! It is amazing!!!! My first time using it, and my skin looked flawless!!!! I&#x27;m extremely happy because I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars trying to find the right foundation and even spent money on expensive brushes and I have never gotten results like this! I&#x27;ve always been insecure about my skin, but not anymore. My foundations work 10x better and I use less product. A must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> the item is nice but so are other sponges for less than half the price&lt;br /&gt;it does look cute&lt;br /&gt;and the color is pretty&lt;br /&gt;but the price is outrageous&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t perform any differently than a common makeup sponge&lt;br /&gt;just another marketing trick, I guess, for us gullible customers</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this product. Let me first say it was delivered on time and in perfect condition. The product itself makes foundation/concealer application 10x easier and faster and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. I have only been using it for about 3 weeks but so far I love it! I know it is a bit pricy but for what it does it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Beautyblender, The Ultimate MakeUp Sponge...well I have to say this works better than the sponges sold at Walmart, but it is pricey considering it is a sponge...one of my cats loves to play with it when I accidentally drop it on the floor in the morning.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with the beauty blender! First of all, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with questioning the authenticity of this product; it is definitely the real deal. I first purchased a BB from birchbox after discovering it there, but then discovered that Amazon had much better deals on them. This BB is exactly like the first one I purchased on birchbox, so no doubt about the authenticity of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my makeup goes on like a dream! I have tried using this with both my BB cream and my regular foundation, and I LOVE it for both. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;ve had my makeup airbrushed on. I also have that beautiful, dewy look that comes with airbrush makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was such a skeptic of this product for SO long. I was the girl saying I would NEVER pay this amount of money for a SPONGE. A sponge? Not happening. However, after reading so many great reviews on the product, I gave in, and I will NEVER go back to cheap sponges or to applying makeup with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get a little annoying to have to clean the beauty blender after each application, but that&#x27;s the only way to ensure that you are getting it properly clean and ready for your next makeup application.</li>
    <li> the original no crease no nothing this is exactly what it say it is</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used my fingers or brushes to blend but I decided to try this sponge. It&#x27;s awesome! I couldn&#x27;t believe what a huge difference it made, both in ease of blending and how much better my makeup looked! It may seem a little expensive at first but trust me, it&#x27;s well worth it. It&#x27;s easy to use, just dampen it slightly and use it to stipple on whatever product you like, or to blend. Awesome!</li>
    <li> My first beauty blender was bought from Amazon.  Though it worked fine, it did not last very long and when I read the reviews from Sephora, it sounded like I had a different product.  Sephora reviewers reported how long this would last, but mine lasted less than 2 months and it started tearing after just a few washes.  I finally decided to buy the beauty blender from Sephora, and there was a big difference indeed.  It&#x27;s been over a year and the Beauty Blender bought at Sephora still is in tact.  The buyer I bought this from Amazon shows up as Silenz Beauty.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Definitely worth the steep price, and the sponge is easy to clean with regular soap and water. No need to buy the blender cleanser in my opinion!</li>
    <li> I like this. Although I do not really see a huge difference between a normal wedge sponge. I do however, like that this has the little point on the top and the bigger rounder bottom which makes makeup application time go by faster. I haven&#x27;t been cleaning mine like i should have and i feel like that could be having an impact on my view of it. But even at the beginning, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference between this and a normal wedge sponge. However, I think i will keep buying this as it is much cuter than a normal sponge wedge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but this is very worth the money. I makes my makeup look so professional.&lt;br /&gt;I love using it!</li>
    <li> A must have for liquid foundation ,concealer and powders. Never fails to deliver a better finish to the face! Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> The item took forever to get to me. Almost forgot I even ordered it. But the bb is good, so I&#x27;m not so mad.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It flawlessly applies my makeup without absorbing too much of the product.  The beauty blender also easily gets into those tough to cover places like under the eyes.  My makeup looks like it&#x27;s airbrushed on and stays put all day.  My only reservation about this product is the color (which is super-cute pink!).  When washed, a bit of the dye washes out with the cleaner.  Not an issue for me but it does make me wonder about what kind of dye is used in the sponge and if it comes off so easily, how good could it be for me?  It hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using the product but it does give me pause. Perhaps the makers of beauty blender may want to reassure customers that the dye is safe or switch to a more natural color.</li>
    <li> My dog ended up chewing mine up, but this is definitely a favorite. Its great for foundation, cream products, concealer, all things liquid and cream just get applied so beautifully with this product.</li>
    <li> Shipment was quick and the product is exacly as discribed and works as promesid and I love it. I highly recomend this seller and this product to others for application of makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this. Beauty blenders and stipple ng brushes are magic for people with not so perfect skin. Where have they been my whole life. Nobody ever told me the secret till now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the beauty blender! It&#x27;s the only tool you need when applying foundation and concealer! I love how airbrushed it makes your make-up look, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t absorb your make-up since it&#x27;s already absorbed water. My only complaint is I don&#x27;t know how to store it. I don&#x27;t want it sitting amongst other things collecting germs. I kept the original packaging and just plop it in there to dry when I&#x27;m done.</li>
    <li> The best sponge ever. Easy to use easy to wash. I&#x27;m happy with the cuality and the result. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am so impressed on how quick my package shipped.I love ordering from amazon.I received my package and when I opened my Beauty Blender I loved how cute and small it is.Cant wait to try and see how flawless it makes my makeup look.</li>
    <li> Ok this is the best thing in the makeup world!!!! I have tried other &amp;#34;beauty blender&amp;#34; dupes and those do not compare AT ALL! I have been wanting a beauty blender for a while and I just didn&#x27;t want to buy it because of the cost. But I am telling you it is SOOO worth it. Other &amp;#34;beauty blenders&amp;#34; are not this soft, not nearly. This is so soft and has made my makeup routine so much faster, Serious life saver cant reccommend this enough!!</li>
    <li> I love my beauty blender sponge.  It makes your make-up look fabulous.  You have a fresh look all day long.</li>
    <li> i really like this sponge, work very well, saving a lot of my time. However, it not last very long. It is expensive for a sponge that didn&#x27;t last forever &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would be as soft, efficient, and effective as it is, but it&#x27;s a really good sponge. I normally used my fingers or the prepackaged (enclosed) sponge with my makeup, but having the beauty blender really makes a difference! I didn&#x27;t want to pay so much for it (hence the one star off) but overall it&#x27;s a great beauty tool and a lot of fun to use. Works with my liquid foundation, cream blush, and powder.</li>
    <li> I love, love this blender. Bought more for my best friend and cousin for Christmas and birthday! What a great product!</li>
    <li> My BB just arrived and I&#x27;m so happy with it! Thanks for this great product :D</li>
    <li> this Beautyblender is the best product to blend foundation evenly on you face.. don&#x27;t use ur hand or anything else.. just go for this.. this is my advice to all my friends and family</li>
    <li> Really nice makeup sponge, lasts a long time, washable.  The tip is great for under eyes.  I just bought my second one, then realized that my first would last even longer.  I have had it for about a year.</li>
    <li> Perfect blender.....there are no substitutes at any price. Great deal. I had always wanted to try this, but the cost seemed high. Was I wrong! This is worth every penny. Foundation is smooth, seemlessly blended and flawless! I will never go back to any other applicator!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE MY BB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :) :)</li>
    <li> 5 WORDS: It&#x27;s way easier with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can check out YouTube tutorials if you haven&#x27;t tried using a beauty blender and you&#x27;ll realize how easy it is and how seamless it can make your foundation look.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my daughter for Christmas , She just LOVES it ..It got here on time .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works great..</li>
    <li> it was wooow&lt;br /&gt;i love it a lot it worth the money for this pushers and my friends like it as well</li>
    <li> Texture amazing so soft, applying my liquid foundation and concealer seamless. Finished face looked amazing. My only applicator from now on</li>
    <li> Love! Was worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I love how this sponge evenly smoothes your foundation over your face without it looking \\&quot;cake like\\&quot;. I have to admit I was hesitant to purchase this at first, but was willing to try after watching a youtube makeup tutorial. This applicator gets all areas of your face, this was a great investment, definatley worth it!! :)</li>
    <li> It better than any brush, sponge or even hand/finger application of foundation and concealer.  Follow the directions closely to make it work its magic.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product. .absorbed too much of my liquid makeup!  Sorry but my Mac is too expensive to waist.I did give it to a friend that loved it so no loss. Thanks</li>
    <li> Cool, but maybe not worth the moolah. Blends well, and doesn&#x27;t absorb (read: waste) as much makeup as the cheaper sponges, but it&#x27;s no miracle sponge.</li>
    <li> Here when expected! Really nice product, I&#x27;m just not wowed by it, to be honest I would go back to a regular cheaper sponge to apply my makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brushes for putting on makeup and this by far the best way!  plus it&#x27;s reuseable!  I wash mine daily with DHC mild soap and it comes clean! Don&#x27;t bother with the cleanser they sell. DHC mild soap is the best,</li>
    <li> I would say this product is really just nothing special. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between using those disposable ones you can buy in a big bag. I have used this about 5 or so times and I am already seeing small holes and tears in it. I would have thought it should last a lot longer than just a few uses. So overall I would say, don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Love this! I don&#x27;t know what I ever did without it in my life! It&#x27;s a must have for all women who use foundation.</li>
    <li> this product is ok.  works ok but already peeling away.  not sure i would buy again.  concept is good.</li>
    <li> I like the sponge because the makeup foundation slides on better and it is so much more refined, love it....</li>
    <li> I was so excited about ordering a beauty blender after hearing EVERYONE talking about it, that I failed to read the reviews before buying this. Once I had already ordered, I began reading these reviews and got a little nervous after seeing that some people believed they had gotten fake beauty blenders rather than the authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved mine yesterday and I can 100% say that it is definitely authentic! I love it! Works way better than my CVS brand dupe! There is just no comparison! It&#x27;s so soft and feels so great on the skin! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Barely started using with foundation; not sure if I recommend this product yet. Read great reviews and my best friend also suggested to use.</li>
    <li> Just get it. It&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s so worth it. The other ones don&#x27;t even compare. Buy it. Do it.</li>
    <li> A number of my friends and co workers have been raving about the beauty blender for a while now so I ordered this one the other day and to my surprise it is already here. It lives up to all the hype because makeup looks flawless when applied with the beauty blender., much more finished then with a brush.</li>
    <li> flawless application! the sponge leaves your skin with that airbrushed look and i have been using the same one for months. its very durable!</li>
    <li> My step daughter told me I needed one of these. She was right. It is a must have. Blends everything really well.</li>
    <li> This makeup blender sponge is all that and more. I hated having to buy sponges and then dumping them and buying more. This is forever and an excellent buy. Get one you won&#x27;t be sorry. Shopmaster hopes her reviews are helpful to all my beautiful ladies out there.</li>
    <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
    <li> I love how airbrushed and natural my skin looks when I use the beautyblender! Will be purchasing another one for sure!</li>
    <li> I got the Limited Edition Red Carpet BeautyBlender (same thing as the pink one but red) because of how many people told me they love theirs. Too bad it leaks pink-colored dye when you get it wet. I usually would be fine with this but IT RUINED ALL OF MY FOUNDATION. Not only did my $20 investment not pan out but it destroyed and permanently ruined about $150 worth of primer, contouring and foundation. Thanks a lot, Beauty Blender and your stupid limited edition red carpet gimmick!</li>
    <li> I will admit I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money and bought cheaper versions of this but they were so hard and rough on the face so I caved an purchased the beauty blend. Im SO HAPPY I did\,I love it and use it everyday when applying my makeup. Spend the $ and you will be so glad you did. Looking to buy another one to have in a travel make up bag.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She used it once and we ended up throwing it away. She said it&#x27;s too small and it soaks up way too much of her makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t invest in this baby sooner! It applies my foundation flawlessly and works amazing with under eye concealer...I will never use a foundation brush again!</li>
    <li> love it  its easy to speared the foundation look like normal and its easy to clean with water and baby shampoo</li>
    <li> Lived up to the hype, for sure. I am just struggling to keep it clean and get the foundation stains off of it.  Have not tried the cleanser products yet. But the sponge itself IS totally worth the extra cost vs. standard drug store sponges. This is the best for foundation application. The tip allows me to smoothly apply under/around the eyes, mouth and nose. And the rounder part allows for easy application on cheeks, forehead, etc.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many make up sponges but Beautyblender is the best. The sponge is soft and my make up looks better. Thanks for the original beautyblender:-)</li>
    <li> I fully expected to be disappointed by this being just an ordinary sponge. But it truly is different, and it applies makeup amazingly well. The end result looks very natural and smooth on your face. The sponge does get stained, and should be cleansed daily, but that is quite easy to do. Overall, I must say that I am impressed by it.</li>
    <li> It works well, but I don&#x27;t use a liquid foundation. I use dream mouse. I think this would be even better with liquid makeup. Makeup doesn&#x27;t go on thick, and it&#x27;s pretty even with this sponge.</li>
    <li> Love it. Order as many as you can.</li>
    <li> Washed it once and the sponge ripped.</li>
    <li> I read about this on Buzzfeed as a beauty product must have and then a model friend of mine who is also a make-up artist recommended it so I had to get it. It really is amazing. My foundation goes on smooth and flawless and the pointed tip gets in all the little grooves and crevasses around your nose and eyes. I&#x27;ve had it a week and the only thing I am worried about is it getting moldy because it stays damp after using and if you put it in a closed drawer that could possibly happen. I did just end up splurging on the Beauty Blender case so I&#x27;ll update after I get that.</li>
    <li> As an insider, I can tell you that this product is WAY overpriced. The company that makes it it a private label, which essentially allows other companies to sell their products but with their own individualized name on it. So while the sponge can cost $4 at one place, some other company may charge 3X the price..FOR THE SAME PRODUCT! It&#x27;s just the name they attach to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product, but not worth this much money when you can easily get it cheaper somewhere else. Again, it&#x27;s the same thing!!</li>
    <li> they suck compared to this one. I have tried a few other brands and have been disappointed every time. Make sure you keep it clean with the cleaner</li>
    <li> I ordered this sponge thinking it was the real Beauty Blender. It&#x27;s not, and I am extremely disappointed! As someone else said in their review, the only thing real about this product is the packaging. I was not aware it was fake until I was shopping at Sephora and bought another Beauty Blender sponge. When I got home and compared the two sponges, I immediatly noticed a difference. The texture is different and the real BB sponge expands when damp/wet and works so much better than this knock off sponge! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when I first received it, I liked it and it worked ok, but after using the real sponge I noticed a dramatic difference and finally realized why so many people love this sponge!  If you want the real deal, go to Sephora and purchase the BB sponge there or from their online store. It&#x27;s $20 and works amazingly! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I honestly can&#x27;t believe that they are selling these fake knock off &#x27;Beauty Blender&#x27; sponges in the actual Beauty Blender packaging! Definitely false advertising!</li>
    <li> The best one that I ever have. I have heard about it before but not sure. I finally purchase it and it works.</li>
    <li> I really like this! It took me awhile to really appreciate it because it&#x27;s so different than anything I have ever used. It does leave a flawless finish on the face, in my opinion. I would absolutely recommend this product if you love to wear liquid foundation. You just have to get used to putting a damp [very soft] sponge on your face!</li>
    <li> They sell it in Sephora for about $20, so it’s a great deal. Blends well, very easy to use. However, it really consumes too much foundation; it is too absorbent for my taste. Also, I recommend washing it and cleaning it with a bounty towel fist because the first times I used it and washed it a little bit of pink came out in the towel I used to dry it with.  It came out easily, did not ruin the towel  but still, strange.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Best thing yet to apply liquid foundation with. It makes your make up look flawless, almost air brushed :)</li>
    <li> GAMECHANGER! I&#x27;m so obsessed with mine</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she loved it  !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine I guess. I don&#x27;t see what everyone is raving about though.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without. It makes your makeup look flawless</li>
    <li> I thought I got the real one- it worked amazing-- until I had to get a new one &amp; purchased it from Sephora &amp; realized that my current one purchased from Amazon was a fake- the one I received from Amazon is larger &amp; a different texture than the one I just bought today at Sephora.  Even though it works amazingly well, it is upsetting that I paid the same price as the REAL one at Sephora.  Now I know. :(  Although it is an Amazon Prime shipped item, the sellers are often different- the seller that supplied my order was Express Health.</li>
    <li> the only way to apply makeup</li>
    <li> The only sponge I&#x27;ve ever used that flawless applies foundation without leaving a thick layer of product. Easy and flawless blending.</li>
    <li> Love the beauty blender, gives an air brush finish every time. It&#x27;s annoying to clean but it&#x27;s worth it. Love!</li>
    <li> This is the real thing - not fake.&lt;br /&gt;Super soft when wet, and easy to work with.</li>
    <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
    <li> I ordered this item to try it out and now I can say that it is fantastic! It makes foundation application super easy and blends so flawlessly! If you use liquid foundation this product is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Excellent item....blends everything like butter...accept no substitutes. There is definitely a difference between the cheap ones from Marshall&#x27;s and this one...so much better...</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best Make Up sponge ever. It is totally worth the price. Amazing product, no other sponges compare.</li>
    <li> I will never use a different applicator. Everything goes on so evenly, nothing looks blotchy or cakey, it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
    <li> From reading the reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to received my Beautyblender- I really wanted to like it.  In my opinion it waists a lot of makeup. I like using brushes much better.</li>
    <li> Love this. Helps my foundation go on smoothly and blend well. I would recommend this product. Better than a regular application sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really bad at putting on foundation, I can&#x27;t blend and it takes me forever. The Beauty Blender makes this task fool proof. I&#x27;ve tired other sponge applicators because I did not want to spend all that money on the BB, but nothing compares to the texture and effectiveness of this product. I end up using less product and it goes on flawlessly and really quickly. Applying foundation is now a piece of cake!</li>
    <li> I got this because I ordered the cheap one, but then realized it would take over a month to arrive (shipped from China). So I got the real thing in the meantime. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I was skeptical, I mean how special could a sponge be? But this is a quality product. I&#x27;m making mine last longer than 3 months by cleaning it weekly (the cleanser for it works great) and taking care of it. It really does blend well. I&#x27;ve used either my fingers or MAC foundation brushes my whole life, and I like this a lot more. It really does look a lot more professional. Compared to the cheap China knock-off, well...there IS no comparison. This is soft and fluffy (when filled with water, as the directions indicate) and the cheap one was still dense and just not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion for this, aside from lowering the price, would be to improve the pedestal. I don&#x27;t like to have the cheap plastic container on my sink, so maybe they could come up with a more permanent pedestal that looks nicer...stainless steel? I like the idea of having it out to dry, but the plastic container is cheesy. Also, don&#x27;t jam it in the hole in the pedestal, because it will tear at the sponge.</li>
    <li> Love....Love...Love this sponge.  I am 63 and this makes my makeup look flawless. I use much less, and having a clean sponge every time I use it is a plus with the solid cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon Prime.....everything has been delivered in time and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I had been noticing (and my husband had been commenting) that my makeup was not very blended or smooth lately, and my foundation brush and/or my fingers were just not cutting it. I&#x27;d seen this product reviewed for some time, and been anxious to try it, so I decided to blow my Christmas gift card and get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love it. I tried to love it. I kept using it hoping I would learn to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just liked it okay. My reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I considered it the least of all evils in applying my makeup. My foundation brush left streaks, my fingers left oil, this didn&#x27;t do a great job either but it was better than the others. I liked the feel of using the sponge wet on my skin, but I had a hard time getting all the water out of the sponge before application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It absorbed A LOT of product. My foundation is not cheap, so I didn&#x27;t like this aspect and it made cleaning almost a daily necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Cleaning it was complicated. I watched numerous tutorials, and did the best I could, but this morning, after only a month of using it, as I was cleaning it, I felt a rip, and a big chunk of my sponge fell out. :( I&#x27;m past the return date, and very sad about it. I can keep using the sides and tip, but the bottom is gone. Not pleased about that at all.</li>
    <li> Works great definitely better than regular sponges</li>
    <li> Perfect for make up thanks</li>
    <li> The best makeup sponge I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is now apart of my daily regimen. I would never apply my make up with anything else! I&#x27;ve gone into other stores to see and touch their blender and it doesn&#x27;t even feel as awesome as the beauty blender!! There is no comparison. Quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it. I tried it for the first time today and it made my makeup look flawless and not cakey at all. I love it and I will continue to buy this forever!</li>
    <li> I bought this over a YEAR ago and I am finally needing to get a replacement. I never imagined it would last me this long and am beyond happy with this product! I use it all the time and never will go back to regular crappy makeup sponges again - it truly does give you an airbrush finish and I love how soft and durable it is! I wash mine out with plain ol&#x27; hand soap and water before each use, (which is great because I&#x27;m not pressing nasty bacteria into my face) and I&#x27;ve found that I get the best results when I use it slightly damp. I dab my liquid foundation onto the sponge and with a dotting motion stipple it onto my face, with a slight press and turn. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Greatest product! I absolutely love the way the beauty blender works. My makeup looks perfect and flawless with every application!! I&#x27;ve told all my girlfriends about this:)</li>
    <li> Great product my girls love it</li>
    <li> This sponge really does make a difference! love it! it makes my makes my makeup flawless. I wish I bought two.</li>
    <li> As my wife expected. Excellent.</li>
    <li> i love it! as i expected to be!</li>
    <li> My makeup looks flawless using this sponge.  I will definitely order another one to keep on hand for when I wear this one out.</li>
    <li> I love this for concealer, and foundation!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my makeup look flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend if you are looking to buy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to try it out since everyone seems to love this. I didn&#x27;t exactly like how it left my makeup. It takes a lot more blending than with a foundation brush. It&#x27;s probably better if you want your makeup to be super full coverage definitely not if you&#x27;re going for a natural look.</li>
    <li> Nice for applyig makeup</li>
    <li> I was very interested in this product for a while before I finally bought it 6 months ago and I&#x27;m SO happy I did. It is wonderful as I&#x27;m starting to have an actual interest in makeup I bought this hoping it would make my foundation routine a little easier and needless to say it worked absolutely perfect. Now remember it&#x27;s not a miracle worker and I won&#x27;t do the impossible but it is probably as close as you are going to get. After having mine six months it is starting to tear and the color is faded to a light pink with foundation stains on the bottom. Although I ordered mine from sophora as I heard some people saying they suspected that companies where selling dupes in the beauty blender packaging and I didn&#x27;t want to risk spending that much money on a fake. I also got the set of two with the cleaner and used that to clean it for a while to keep it looking nice but after about three months the color started fading so I switched to baby shampoo because it was cheaper for cleaning it everyday and I used the cleaner once a week for deeper cleaning. I have never used any dupes so I can not compare it to any of them but I can say form everything I have heard there is just nothing like the real one.</li>
    <li> I like to wait a few weeks before reviewing a product because my initial hope that a product will actually work usually clouds my judgment. It has been so hard to resist reviewing this product and I can&#x27;t put it off any longer! This little sponge is AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use brushes on my face to apply my foundation and something just looked really off every time I applied it. It would look streaky or very cakey and just overall very unnatural. With this sponge, my face seriously looks amazing with my Revlon Colorstay foundation. It really doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup as there&#x27;s no streaks at all and it just creates a very flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $20 for one sponge, yes, it is pricey. I&#x27;ve tried dupes but they just don&#x27;t compare. Splurge on this and you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I recommend searching this product on youtube and watching videos on how to correctly use it. I think a lot of people don&#x27;t really know how to properly use it and the sponge won&#x27;t work as great if it&#x27;s not damp.</li>
    <li> HOLY... this sponge is AMAZING. Seriously, I was extremely skeptical at first. The first time I used it, I forgot to wet it so it turned out not as well as I hoped. However, I realized my mistake and tried it a second time... and oh my... I couldn&#x27;t believe the results when I looked at myself in the mirror. My foundation looked flawless! I didn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing make up! I love this sponge, and has used it every day since!!!</li>
    <li> finally a sponge i actually use.  i bought two.  one to put in my make-up case and one for home.  it&#x27;s fun and pretty too!</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM! I had heard people raving about these, and so I decided to purchase one. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and just didn&#x27;t understand what the hype was about. It is basically a giant make-up wedge  that you can buy a pack of at Target for $2.00, only its actually less dense. I decided to write a review and looked at some of the other reviews first (which I should have done before I bought one), and I am convinced these are fake. I never would have thought that a sponge could be fake, but whatever this thing is, it is NOT worth $20.00. The sponge I use when I rinse my dishes would be more beneficial for putting on my make up than this thing. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Amazon should be more vigilant and not allow this seller to advertise counterfeit products. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I love it. works well in so many area&#x27;s of the face and with so many different products. when it wears out I will repurchase it again. great tool. would recommend.</li>
    <li> It good for me, it blend well, the color come of when you wash it.  But it blend well.  Hope you like too.  The price is ok not too bad.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge - so much better than what I have used. Doesn&#x27;t leave a dewy effect on your face - it blends foundation to a flawless finish.</li>
    <li> I will never be without this little life changer again.  I love a good foundation brush, but this is just so easy to use and gives such a natural look.  I use it damp with a light foundation and my skin looks airbrushed.  I do clean mine every single day.  And I don&#x27;t wait three months to replace it; maybe more like two.  So you do have to take into consideration the cost of replacing 4-6 times per year, plus buying the cleanser, which can add up.  For me, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described</li>
    <li> Its a fake!!!!! The packaging is correct but the sponge feels different than the original. Buyers beware!!</li>
    <li> Got this because pretty much aaaaall the YouTube makeup gurus use them. I use/d it for applying under-eye concealer and occasionally my all-over-face foundation. However to be honest, although it&#x27;s good, and it works (not so much on under-eye area in my opinion, actually) I got bored of it pretty quickly and have just gone back to using a clean finger for applying under-eye concealer and various different brushes for foundation. Not saying it&#x27;s rubbish, just a bit of a gimmick really. Would still recommend.</li>
    <li> Best make up sponge on the market!! Love the feel and the look it produces. Makes covering blemishes and scars a much easier process. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
    <li> It did great blending out my under eye concealer, but I hated it for my foundation! It felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting it blended well at all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my BB! I use it the suggested way, and it applies my foundation flawlessly. The fat end gets the coverage I want to make application go fast and the pointed end gets in around my nose &amp; eye area easily. I had tried a knockoff makeup sponge before and only used it once before tossing. The BB is the softest makeup sponge I&#x27;ve come across. Definitely make the investment if you wear foundation even semi-regularly</li>
    <li> Smooth, even application when dampened and &amp;#34;bounced&amp;#34; or stippled on the skin.  My under-eye concealer in particular looks so much more evenly blended and less prone to settling into fine lines and wrinkles.  I love this sponge!</li>
    <li> I bought this bases on several YouTube videos I saw with make up artist.  I was a little hesitant due to the price but it is well worth it.  It really does blend your makeup so well!</li>
    <li> Love this product, how after it&#x27;s second wash it began to tear.</li>
    <li> It was great at first bu tafter a few uses it started getting splits in it</li>
    <li> I never buy into hype products. I mean after all, it is just a sponge. But after a lot of research I thought why not! Once I got it in the mail, I didn&#x27;t use it for a couple of days. Finally I used it and WOW it is SO worth the hype! It gives your skin a FLAWLESS, natural finish! It doesn&#x27;t even look like I was wearing ANY foundation. Because of this beauty blender, I RARELY reach for my sigma flat top kabuki brush anymore. And for any Sigma Beauty lovers out there, we all know how amazing that kabuki brush is. I should&#x27;ve bought the one where it comes in two but because this was my first time, I just went with the single sponge. HIGHLY recommend for all you &amp;#34;on the fence&amp;#34; folks!</li>
    <li> This sponge is great!! I can definitely tell a difference when I apply my foundation compared to other sponges. It give a much smoother and more even application. Definitely a MUST in my makeup bag from now on!</li>
    <li> Perfect application! I use this everyday! No more brushes for me! Definetly highly reccomend to any makeup user young or old!</li>
    <li> Glad I finally decided to buy one. I like it a great deal more than the knock off that I purchased from another site.</li>
    <li> Blends my makeup perfectly. So much better than the knock offs. They are way to hard and don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
    <li> Who knew a little sponge could work wonders! Love it always get an airbrushed look after using this. Will keep repurchasing</li>
    <li> Sure, this was a nice makeup sponge. Sure, it worked and made my skin look &amp;#34;dewy.&amp;#34; But I just don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t really wanna look dewy. And using this, I went through an entire bottle of foundation in less than a month! It is definitely a great makeup sponge, but just not for me. If you are really big on liquid foundation and using makeup sponges, it&#x27;s worth buying one of these as opposed to multiple cheap ones. Or just get a brush!</li>
    <li> This little thing holds the foundation and will not let go no matter how much I wash. It distributes the foundation evenly across my face so u am happy with it. It gives me a light finish</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING. It makes my makeup look FLAWLESS! I will never use anything else to apply my make up. Especially good for concealer!</li>
    <li> Only use the beauty blender now!</li>
    <li> I expected much better application based on the reviews. I&#x27;ll stick to my Clinique foundation brush. My brush gives me the flawless application that people are saying the beauty blender does.... I haven&#x27;t used it since the first couple of days I received it.</li>
    <li> I try this a couple of time. Its ok but nothing special about  it for me. I like the brushes better putting on my makeup.</li>
    <li> Amazing for everything foundation, concelr ,compact powder , even for a dewey look</li>
    <li> The beauty blender is wonderful.  Awesome for blending any make-up.  You will never want to go back to using a face brush.</li>
    <li> This item is definitely worth the hype! I was very skeptical to buy it for a long time because I feel that paying for a $16 &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; is rather ridiculous where I can buy ones in store for about $5. After going through a number of different makeup brushes for my foundation, I finally gave in because nothing else was really giving me that streak-free flawless look. I&#x27;m so very glad I did because it definitely leaves your skin even and, dare I say it, flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t know if it was a mishap or not but I got two beauty blenders instead of one!! What a great surprise!</li>
    <li> I wanted to see the big ol hype about this sponge &amp; it really lives up to what everyone says. No matter what foundation I use, high end or drugstore it always comes out really flawless. I will be buying more in the future!(:</li>
    <li> Very durable and pliable, super product for doing makeup and concealing under eye.&lt;br /&gt;I have even used it for cream blush.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago! Applies concealer and foundation flawlessly and face looks so smooth. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge applicator.  Easy to put on makeup and looks natural.</li>
    <li> The sponge applicator lets you blend your foundation perfectly.  Great shape idea as it allows you to blend your makeup around your eyes, hairline, and nose effortlessly.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE. The beauty blender I received was FAKE!! Just a normal sponge marked up to a crazy price! It was smaller and less absorbent than my previous ones purchased from Sephora. Would not recommend!</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist in California. I&#x27;ve been through MANY brushes and sponges of all kinds to get a flawless foundation application. So far NOTHING has come close to this amazing &amp;#34;Beautyblender&amp;#34; sponge. The super-fine texture makes sure you don&#x27;t get uneven coverage yet allows for a flawless finish. This does not let your foundation cake into the fine-lines, or deep lines, as other applicators do. I have tried using a &#x27;Smashbox&#x27; foundation for over a year (determined to apply it professionally) and the brush that came with it never came close to second against this sponge! The foundation is now a professional airbrushed look because of this sponge. I am elated and very glad I discovered and picked up the double pack of this sponge - I will NEVER apply foundation without it again. I use my &#x27;Philosophy&#x27; Cleanser and the sponge cleanes out phenomenally. Make sure you wash it after each application and allow it to air-dry so no bacteria will build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hint: don&#x27;t try to cover all your imperfections in one go. Allow the first light application to dry, then apply another thin layer over the trouble areas. This makes for a more realistic coverage.</li>
    <li> fabulous for putting on foundation. My 52 year old skin look amazing - really makes a difference</li>
    <li> I liked it but it is removed part from the edge which make me unhappy.</li>
    <li> this little thing is magic, i love it, if i can i bought a 10000 of them, a little bit expensive, but worth it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I took the advice of others and tried the Beauty Blender it does make a difference in the way your concealer applies.... (I use mine for concealer exclusively) it provides and creates a flawless application that cannot be achieved with a concealer brush or you fingers, I&#x27;m a little upset that mine did receive a little tiny whole at the tip after one months use with daily washing ..... maybe I&#x27;m washing it to much IDK but next one I&#x27;ll try to be more gentle while cleansing my Beauty Blender. That is what the minus 1 star is for...</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! I have no clue why it took me so long to finally buy this but this product makes doing making 100 times easier. got it on time and it was packaged very well!</li>
    <li> Read my review on &amp;#34;Beautyblender - Double Blender Sponge &amp; Cleanser Kit&amp;#34; I bought this originally to try it and then ended up buying the double.... loved it that much and def worth every penny!</li>
    <li> If you cut an old beauty blender in half and compare it to any other sponge on the market you will see NONE of them are a dupe for this. It expands when wet and makes a great blending tool for avoid cake face makeup, and easily blends creams and liquids into the skin. I use mine daily and I buy the 12 packs for clients. It&#x27;s the best beauty sponge out there, and Amazon always has it for the best price!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m old school and have been using either my fingers or the wedges to apply my foundation and highlighter. I even had a representative at Clinique ask me why I was taking my foundation off after applying it. I really didn&#x27;t realize I was taking so much off. I love to watch new makeup trends on Youtube and some of them used this Beautyblender stating that they wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I thought about it for a bit and decided to get one. Let me just say that I&#x27;m a believer now. I apply my foundation and do touch ups with it. I like it so much I&#x27;m going to get another one just for my concealer. Seeing is believing. It&#x27;s a makeup must have.</li>
    <li> It makes makeup application really easy and seamless. So for that 4 stars. However, it&#x27;s not easy to clean, so 2 stars. IDK if I&#x27;m supposed to be cleaning it everyday (not gonna happen) or it&#x27;s just really difficult to get the makeup out of it. I&#x27;ve washed it several times, in several different ways, but there is still a good bit of foundation in there. I feel like I need a new one, but these are so expensive, I don&#x27;t think I can afford to buy a new one every 3m. So IDK if I&#x27;ll be buying again. Considering everything, overall I&#x27;ll be giving it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I love this blender.  It applies my foundation seamlessly.  It is easy and quick to use and simple to clean.</li>
    <li> Love it! Have has no problems with it! And I have  had no problems cleaning it either would recommend again</li>
    <li> I feel that with the price you pay, you should be able to get four. Still a great way (possibly the best way) to apply foundation nonetheless. The price is my only problem. Especially because they only last so long if you&#x27;re someone like me who applies foundation nearly every day.</li>
    <li> I like the finish it gives while putting on liquid foundation.  my only complaint is it really sucks up and wastes product!  becareful if you use brush cleaner or any lather type soap to clean it.  I was rinsing and squeezing for days trying to get all the soap suds out.  Use low lather soap or the bar cleaner they sell with this instead.</li>
    <li> Much softer and goes on smoother than other brands!</li>
    <li> Great for blending my foundation and ensures even coverage. I used this on my wedding day and was pleased I bought it, but I removed a star for the price. Its a lot for just a sponge.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! never tought it would make such a difference in my makeup but it does. Fully recomend it, it&#x27;s great for people like me (who are not beauty proffesionals).</li>
    <li> This is the coolest beauty product since mineral makeup!  It arrived really quickly, in perfect condition, and works exactly as explained online.  I only wish I had found it sooner!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype. It works and all, but it&#x27;s no magically applicator as they say. I used to get sponges at walmart, 30 for under 2 dollars, that broke apart after 6-8 weeks use, but worked just as well as this. I guess if this lasts me over 1260 weeks it will be worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love the &#x27;Beauty Blender, The Ultimate Makeup Sponge Applicator&#x27;! The title says it all it make my face makeup look so naturally flawless. I would definatly recommend it and will be purchasing another when needed. I hear they last months though:)</li>
    <li> does a great job with liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Small put power full, I use to use an expensive brush but this even better results</li>
    <li> I am eternally gratefully to have finally discovered this magical sponge!  My foundation goes on flawlessly.  LOVE it!!!  And, I can clean it using my regular makeup remover (Neutrogena brand).</li>
    <li> This provides an airbrushed finish that simply can&#x27;t be achieved with a kabuki, no matter how good the brush.  When used slightly damp, it performs on a professional level, making it simple and easy to apply foundation and cream concealers even in the hardest and smallest of areas on the face.  I won&#x27;t use anything else and neither will most make-up artists!</li>
    <li> Great purchase, this is the original version so I&#x27;m please with this seller. Make-up goes on flawless and looks professional, easy to use and easy to clean, definitely recommend this sponge is you want your make-up to look airbrushed!</li>
    <li> the best sponge ever , i love</li>
    <li> I really like this little make-up sponge!  BUT.......I used it once and my nails dug a chunk out of the side, it is quite delicate despite it&#x27;s intended use.  I have read reviews and watched youtube videos galore and am still having a hard time getting it as clean as I would prefer.  I have NOT tried the cleanser that you can buy with it so I cannot attest to it.  I have however tried baby shampoo, antibacterial hand soap, a really great Trader Joes organic body wash and make-up remover (face wash).  I think next I will try good old dawn dish detergent!  All in all despite not being able to get the foundation stains off of it, it&#x27;s a great little product!  I see that they sell a black one so maybe I should purchase that one!</li>
    <li> You have to get this!  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!  Foundation is flawless with this.  Get the Beautyblender, do not order any knock offs!  I will be ordering more of these!!!</li>
    <li> This really gave me a great flawless finish! I have countless expensive brushes , but I must say this is definitely one of my top three.</li>
    <li> i was expecting for sponge to look as big as it is in the picture, unfortunately it is not.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this! It is a weird shape and doesn&#x27;t get clean completely. the pointy end is useless.</li>
    <li> Love this product, this is the real one if you are wondering.</li>
    <li> Literally the best s*** ever I&#x27;m a guy and I love it</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and very useful.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely disgusted. The beauty blender I recieved came dirty and obviously been used. There is still make up in the sponge. And the tip of the sponge is missing a chunk. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed</li>
    <li> Love this blending sponge!! Works great :))</li>
    <li> Love this thing!  Had it forever and you just rewash and use and it holds up great!</li>
    <li> You got what you pay for. It&#x27;s true. The first one I bought last for more than a year. Now this is my second purchase. I don&#x27;t mind paying that much for an applicator, you really will love how it does the job well done</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the rave reviews it had. I actually really like it. I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s any better than a regular wedge sponge, but it serves its purpose. It is easy to clean. I wash it after each use with soap, but the instructions say you only need to rinse it with water. It is a pretty color. I don&#x27;t have much else to say about it, except that it is nice not having to run to the store every few weeks when I run out of the makeup sponges. It should last a while, the quality is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It was a little broken when i got it and i couldn&#x27;t even clean it.</li>
    <li> I would see reviews about how &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; the original beauty blender was but i never understood the hype, how good can a piece of foam that looks like a tear drop be, right? Well, let me tell you, I&#x27;ve applied foundation many ways and NONE came out as good, even, flawless, almost airbrushed as this little piece of magic.  For the first time it wasn&#x27;t obvious that i was wearing foundation and it felt AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Love this little beauty blender.  I am a fair red head and it blends well on my fair skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best make up purchases that you can make. This makes any liquid foundation go on flawlessly if used correctly. I tell everyone about this and buy them for gifts. Make up is my passion and ever since I started using this to use liquid foundation I cannot ever go back. It gets in all the crevices in cracks, applies just the right amount, you can not ask for any better!</li>
    <li> Great , like this so much better than the sponges you can get in the cosmetic isle at the store.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used sponges to apply makeup in a long time, but this one is amazing. I love how well it distributes the makeup on my face. I spray a bit of alcohol-free toner on my face before I apply the makeup, and the application is even smoother.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Better than other similar sponges I&#x27;ve bought like this. I received an authentic product in it&#x27;s original packaging. I used to use a brush for my liquid foundation but now I use only this.</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender. It applies my makeup better than anything, also I recieved it on time. No ptoblems from the seller.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup sponge around. When they stopped making the disposable flat sponge I couldn&#x27;t find anything that worked as good as them till I purchased this Beautyblender. I use it every day and wash it as well. It has not peeled or flacked. It is just like the day I received it. Kudos Beautyblender for making a sponge that is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000I5HJ2Y Beautyblender, The Ultimate MakeUp Sponge Applicator, 2 sponges.]]</li>
    <li> My liquid makeup foundation looks FAB! with the ease and convenience of this product! However, wish I knew how to get my liquid color stay makeup rinsed out!? -Then I could have the longevity that&#x27;s talked about and loved about this product! :)</li>
    <li> Very cool little thingy.  Much nicer than my finger or a brush for blending.  I gave it one less star because it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive for what it is.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge as there isnt one on the market that dupes it. My concerns though, are that it soaks up product too good, leaving it stained and hard to clean. It is pricey so I only buy when the price has dropped. The sponge does last a long time, but I dont use it every day. Ive purchased 2, and I am still on the first one. The other is my backup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a sponge so naturally its going to rip after repeated use. I think it ripped fairly quickly though even though I moisten it prior to use. The price has increased since it&#x27;s popularity has soared, way too pricey now. Okay product if you want to even and smooth out your makeup, 3 1/2 stars for me.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to spend the money on this product because I have a set of make-up brushes but so many people said this is one thing you definitely need! So I bought it and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied! It works great and I have used it everyday! It is great for applying liquid foundation or blending out messes like too much foundation or too much blush! I would definitely say that all those people who told me to get this were definitely right! If you don&#x27;t have one, you are missing out.</li>
    <li> Good beauty blender. Easy to use. Does not shed</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and the price is even better.  My makeup looks great and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money.</li>
    <li> OK, that&#x27;s a little dramatic but I&#x27;m seriously thinking about ordering one for all of my friends so I can spread the joy. For years I used a brush to apply my foundation (Make Up For Ever HD) and that worked well until I started using Atralin (Retin A). All the lovely (read excruciatingly annoying) flaking that comes with Retin A made using a brush impossible because it encouraged more flaking. So I switched to a powered foundation (still Make Up For Ever HD) and applied it with a stippling brush. That worked well but I craved more coverage. More research ensued and I found this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new and highly rewarding foundation routine: after I apply my sunscreen ([[ASIN:B004LCWFUG Supergoop! Save Face SPF 35+ A.m. Moisturizer, 3-Ounce]]) I wet the sponge and squeeze out all the water I can, then I put a small pea of beauty balm ([[ASIN:B004WO9EE8 Dr. Jart+ Water Fuse Beauty Balm SPF 25 PA++ Water Fuse Beauty Balm SPF 25 PA++ 1.7 oz]]) on the back of my hand and dab, dab, dab one side of the sponge in and out of it to work it into the sponge evenly before using the same dab, dab, dab motion on my face. Then I do the exact same thing with my foundation. Afterwards, I set both using a micro finish powder [[ASIN:B0016M52EU MAKE UP FOR EVER HD Microfinish Powder 0.35 oz]] before cleaning the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It blends well, but small pieces started flaking off the first time I used it. It only lasted about a month before the tip broke off from washing it. For the price I&#x27;d expect better quality. I replaced it with a cheaper version from Ulta that seems to hold up a lot better.</li>
    <li> i lovee the beautyBlender sponge , it applys my foundation in really good ! ive seen a difference between the sponge ive been using and the beauty blender sponge.My regualar sponge soaked in my foundation and it was just waisting up my product. But im glad i purchase the beauty blender sponge, i highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Wet, still holds integrity and assists makeup to a flawless airbrushed finish! I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> No need to talk about this.  If you haven&#x27;t already heard about the beauty blender, then you my friend are living under a rock.  Bottom line, its the best way to apply your foundation.  Nothing comes close.</li>
    <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Beautfyblender sponges! Why didn&#x27;t I know about these earlier.  However, the cleaner is an absolute MUST!</li>
    <li> This makes such a huge difference in the way my foundation looks!  Worth the money, I have a cheap knockoff that does not even come near to doing the same thing as the real one.</li>
    <li> I have been a make up artist for 20+ years and this is one of the better sponges that I&#x27;ve used because of the shape. However, I do not feel it is anywhere near worth what they are charging for it - downright ridiculous in my book. I will try the Monster bundle next time - much better value and I am guessing on-par quality.</li>
    <li> Every woman must have this fantastic beauty blender to have a perfectly evened out and blended makeup application, especially when it comes to liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive at first do to the price of the product. I still think is a bit expensive, but you can tell the difference on how well it works, when compare to other sponges.</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing .. makeup goes on smooth no scratches gives you the flawless look you desire ... I strongly recommend it ...</li>
    <li> This is now my 2nd Beauty Blender. I love it!! There&#x27;s nothing like the real thing.</li>
    <li> Using a foundation brush is a thing in the past for me now after using the BEAUTY BLENDER!! i was so skeptic on spending $15 on a makeup sponge and not knowing if I&#x27;ll be satisfied with they results from the BB... Boy was I wrong..The beauty blender is simply amazing!!! its very easy to use and easy to clean. You do not need to use the expensive cleaner for the BB that you can buy seperatly i use dove soap and it removes any build up of foundation. im defintilt going to be using a beauty blender to till the end of time!! No makeup brush can compare to this Hot pink sponge!</li>
    <li> Sent a mini one. Wrong product.</li>
    <li> First time owning one of these, its the best sponge ever</li>
    <li> Giving it three because it does work well on putting foundations on, however it must be cleaned and dried properly because it can smell and get moldy</li>
    <li> Flawless application with mineral powder foundation and liquid foundation. Looses one star though because the pink color comes off when washing the sponge. If I were to buy again I would buy the black one.</li>
    <li> Way too expensive for a piece of foam. I tried using this for a few weeks, and gave up, going back to using my fingers or brushes. The sponge gets stained easily, and doesnt really blend as well as it is portrayed to. Does not live up to the hype!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, especially because of the price, but I did some research online, watched some YouTube video and bit the bullet. I have to say: I&#x27;m in love. I started wearing liquid foundation again because of the Beautyblender, it gives some a nice finish and it looks so natural. I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends/family. Hopefully I can convert some folks. Whatever they&#x27;ve done to make this different than the imitations is working. I&#x27;m a forever user!</li>
    <li> EVER AGAIN. This BB is genius! It blends so fawlessly and leaves the face glowing and radiant and not cakes, at all. Bye bye foundation brush! Hello Beauty Blender, my love!</li>
    <li> I admit I was the biggest skeptic about this item. I had always avoided makeup sponges as they sucked up so much product when applying liquid foundation that I wondered why people even bothered to continue using them. I would apply foundation with my fingers but after it got too messy, I discovered brushes and invested in various types - one for powder, one for liquid, and another for concealer. I needed all three to adequately cover imperfections and achieve a finished look. It was a pretty tedious task but I thought this was the way it had to be. No more! I kept hearing about the beauty blender and decided on impulse to try it. I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I am amazed at what it does. It gives a smooth finished look with very little product and my makeup looks flawless and light. I am able to use the sponge tip to press foundation or concealer onto blemished areas and it covers beautifully without looking cakey. I honestly can&#x27;t believe how well it works. I have used it with both mineral and liquid foundation and the results are the same. I don&#x27;t know how this works the way it does, but it absolutely does what it says.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the beauty blender doesn&#x27;t do much more than a brush. I like to use it for my thick BB creme from too faced, because that product is too thick for brushes, BUT I do not really see a difference in finish of my makeup. I don&#x27;t feel like it makes my face smoother looking, or anything like that. I get the same finish with my brushes, but I do find it useful for applying products that would be tricky with brush application.</li>
    <li> This really does leave a beautiful flawless finish to my skin.  I loved using my foundation brush and didnt think this would make much difference but i heard all the raving about it and tried it out and now i wont go back to the brush.  This is definitely a must in my makeup bag!</li>
    <li> I wondered how a sponge could cost so much and be any different...but this sure does the trick. It is quite amazing and I have never put makeup on so perfectly before.  This little pink thing is really a miracle...spend the money-it is worth it!</li>
    <li> Product works great, just as described. Was on the fence about this blender and how well it worked but I&#x27;m truly satisfied with it!!! I love finding ways to blend makeup and apply it smoothly and this works like a dream!</li>
    <li> This was a counterfit item.  Wish I could return it after I used it. The only thing real was the packaging. Horrible purchase.</li>
    <li> Its okay I guess.  Once I figured out it needed to be damp to work... Not sure it was worth the $25.  Certainly wouldn&#x27;t buy again.  Directions would have been VERY helpful</li>
    <li> I had tried several cheaper dupes from other brands before purchasing the Beauty Blender.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this.  It is so soft and springy, and really does give a flawless finish to your liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> Even after washing it daily, this sponge had a weird smell. I feel it absorbed too much of my foundation. A stippling brush works a lot better and needs less product! I needed about 3-4 pumps of foundation to Get the same coverage that 1 pump gives me when I use a brush. Don&#x27;t waste foundation ladies, you&#x27;re throwing money away ;)</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. Super soft on the skin. Highly recommend it to everyone who wants a natural flawless finish!</li>
    <li> Beauty Blender works great, you need to tell me how to clean it!  I use vinegar right now.  I think they have to have a product out there to use to clean it better.  Mine has junk all over it that won&#x27;t come out with dawn or any other products.  Hum..let me know ok????</li>
    <li> Never had a product like this before.&amp;#62; You can use it wet or dry.. and you can clean it very easily.. it makes my concealer go on flawless and makes me adore what it does.. Definitely a must have for any girl who knows anything about make up!</li>
    <li> this is bar none the best way to apply all of your makeup for a flawless finish.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean and is better than any brush i own! i love it!</li>
    <li> This is a normal SPONGE. If you are using an expensive make-up (I use HD and DIOR foundation) don&#x27;t expect to be able to clean the makeup off of it until the next morning. I&#x27;ve had it maybe 3 weeks and the sponge is already tearing and stained with foundation spots. While the application is awesome, it&#x27;s still just a SPONGE and in my opinion, NOT worth the $18 I spent for it. If you can find it cheaper, then try it out! If not, don&#x27;t waste your money - find a cheap makeup sponge. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s about savings for me...</li>
    <li> I enjoyed using this for blending my foundation and concealer. It cuts my blending time down and I have a natural look to my make up when I finish using this. I would recommend this to anyone that likes a more natural look to there foundation. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I debated buying this makeup sponge because it is a bit pricey. It&#x27;s a wonderful makeup sponge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> Well worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;Applies perfect make-up, even in a not so well lighted area.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy when need a wonderful gift.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just awesome and its more durable compare to other beauty sponges out there. It will last you longer and won&#x27;t fall apart like others. I&#x27;ve had my fair share of testing other beauty sponges and this one is by far the BEST!</li>
    <li> Beautyblender makes makeup application a breeze, and I get good coverage with less makeup. My only criticism is that the sponge&#x27;s surface looked dinged up after the first squeeze to get excess water out. Treat it gently. The sponge material is delicate.</li>
    <li> I have avoided getting a beauty blender thinking it would be a waste of money. Now I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but I use this to blend out under eye concealer, cream blush and any other creamy products I use. It is unreal how beautifully it blends everything out. I love naturally beautiful makeup. This is key in achieving that look. Don&#x27;t forget to buy the beauty blender bar cleanser. It is worth the money, too!</li>
    <li> This has completely changed my makeup routine.  I don&#x27;t think I have ever loved a makeup tool like the Beautyblender!  It is so easy to apply foundation, concealer, and powder with, and gives an airbrush effect when you stipple.  I can&#x27;t ever go back to applying and blending with my fingers or a brush again!</li>
    <li> Love it and its a must have!  Have had it for 6 months and i always use it.  Flawless look!!</li>
    <li> This is another product that saved the make up naive me.  It blends perfectly and avoids that lovely line that shows between different layers that shows you dont know what you are doing.  It is washable.  The dimensions are perfect so I can use it on eye shadow as well.  I need all the help I can get.  It is pricey, but I use it daily with most of my products so it does count as reasonable.  I read a lot about these and finally got one, and I have to say it lives up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Airbrush finish when I&#x27;m done with this baby! Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> The triangular sponges at Target or your drug store work just as well.  $20 is crazy.</li>
    <li> Great it does wat i need</li>
    <li> I am under-impressed with the way that it applies my foundation. I was expecting that \\&quot;even effect\\&quot; but I didn&#x27;t expect that also meant dewy (should have being that it&#x27;s a sponge but - my bad) However, I do love the way that it blends out my concealers. Because it&#x27;s just porous enough it soaks away the right amount of left over product on my skin that would have made my under eyes look baggy and crease. It blends out just about anything else on my face wonderfully. I just wouldn&#x27;t use it as an applicator. I have combination skin and so far nothing tops a stippling brush for me, when it comes to coverage and using as little product as possible i&#x27;m not picking up my beautyBLENDER. I do rinse the sponge in water and then pat dry so that it grows to proper shape and is able to blend properly as well.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for a product that works no better than a drugstore makeup sponge. Totally waste of money. Think twice before you buy this.</li>
    <li> Seems genuine. Speedy delivery from e-pack delivery service</li>
    <li> It does it job really good, I always use sponge for foundation, did try one at sephora, only one dif, this one twice smaller then other, from sephora.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what it says it does, it blends makeup to perfection!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone. This is better than a brush or anything you have ever used before.</li>
    <li> I have read so many reviews on the Beautyblender and I was a little skeptical. &amp;#34;How could it be that amazing?&amp;#34; Trust me when I say this is the sole product that has made me thoroughly enjoy doing my makeup in the mornings.I would recommend this to ANYONE!</li>
    <li> I had seen reviews stating that nothing compares to the Beautyblender so I decided not to go for a knock-off, and I am glad that I didn&#x27;t. I am sure others have stated this, but make sure you use the product wet. The first time I used it I only dampened it a little (it did not grow in size) and it did not blend very well. I wondered what all the hype was about. However, if you get the sponge completely wet and squeeze out the excess water, it will grow quite a bit in size, and then it works wonders! I use it to apply a BB cream that I previously had blended in with my fingers or using a foundation brush. There is a huge difference in the way the product looks on my face: it is much more even and blends into my skin much better. I highly recommend the Beautyblender!</li>
    <li> Amazing for natural flawless look thank you!</li>
    <li> never going back to my brushes</li>
    <li> This applies my liquid foundation beautifully and evenly. All the hype is right! You will not want to use a brush for foundation ever again. The only thing I noticed is that this pink one does bleed when you wash. I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects from this. Be careful of your nails when washing.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and I really like it.  Make up goes on smooth and evenly and I notice I use less actual makeup because of it.</li>
    <li> This was totally worth my money! I like how flawless my foundation goes on with the beauty blender! Under eye concealer looks amazing applied with the beauty blender. Am happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Love it! One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever owned in regards to make up application. It blends so well with my foundation.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
    <li> Its an great product for foundation it leaves a natural finish but I hate wetting it every time I have to use it</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype but, I don&#x27;t like how you have to clean it...kind of gross. If you think about how much bacteria stays in a kitchen sponge...eew...I couldn&#x27;t get over how it couldn&#x27;t be cleaned enough...the makeup went on flawlessly but, a nice brush can do the same and it is easier to clean.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is everything it&#x27;s hyped up to be. It&#x27;s definitely worth every penny. Stop looking because this is the best blender out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with my beauty blender.  I absolutely recommend this sponge. The quality speaks volumes. Plan on buying another one.</li>
    <li> The product works very, very well! It takes a couple uses to get the hang of it, but once you do, I get much better results that I was with my traditional technique (foundation brush and finger tips).&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, suspect that these are fakes. My best friend paid much more for hers at a \\&quot;big named make up store\\&quot;, and we compared them... Mine does not swell up to the same size, out textures are slightly different when dry and wet (mines rougher), and already has some slight \\&quot;cracking\\&quot; pattern to it. The shape is comparable, and packaging as well. I don&#x27;t believe hers honestly puts on foundation with any noticeable difference, but thought I should just make sure no ones buffaloed!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype!!!!  This is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; so don&#x27;t settle for the others.  You won&#x27;t get the same results.  Great price by the way!</li>
    <li> love love love it :) service was spectacular! a personalized handwritten note was with the product which hows that they really care about their customers</li>
    <li> This is a great tool for applying foundation. It allows you to apply your foundation in a stippling fashion. Blends foundation nicely. My only concern is that it is a bit difficult to clean properly. It may take you a little practice to get the swing of using this, but once you do it will be one of your favorite makeup application tools as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add an update for this product review: after approximately 12-15 uses and perhaps 7 cleansing of the Beauty Blender I have noticed that cracks are developing in the foam applicator. I do not believe it will last as long as I had hoped it would. That doesn&#x27;t mean I won&#x27;t purchase it again. Give it a try...you are worth it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a flawless foundation application product, the BeautyBlender is for you. It allows you to build foundation and blend effortlessly. I have tried a foundation brush but felt the application was too heavy. I use the it wet with liquid foundation. I have heard that some use it with mineral make up but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet. Well worth the price. I highly reccomend it.</li>
    <li> I just got this in today and used it for the 1st time omg!!!!!!!!!!  airbrush finish totally worth the price althogh you can get  double with cleanser at Sephora for around the same price I love this thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing ! I saw that the make up artists were using this and saying how great is this so I order it. OMG ,I love it ,it is amazing how it make your foundation so smooth and natural looking. I love it love it love it...</li>
    <li> I put off buying the Beautyblender for over 6 months despite the rave reviews by friends, family and Youtube gurus. I&#x27;ve used makeup sponges for years. How could this pricey pink thing be different? I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shape, material or color but IT IS!!! I&#x27;m 48 and hate the way my foundation &amp;#34;settles&amp;#34; into my fine;) lines. I&#x27;ve invested in primer and expensive foundation but &amp;#34;The Beautyblender&amp;#34; was the trick to the perfect application!!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this!!!! A+++</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life. My concealer looks flawless every time I use this. I recommend this product if you want your make up to look perfect.</li>
    <li> Use the Beautyblender everyday to apply my foundation. It truly gives you that &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; finish. Can&#x27;t go with out it. A must buy for anyone looking to have flawless, natural looking skin.</li>
    <li> I love this! It has made my foundation look so flawless! Best thing ever!! I highly recommend it! It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I decided to splurge after reading TONS of reviews about how this sponge allows to you to apply flawless foundation. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like it and since I didn&#x27;t spend EXTRA money on the cleaner, I am hesitate to use it because I don;t know if it&#x27;s cleaned after some soap and water action. Overall, I just use my hands to apply foundation and I think that works best for me.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin look moist and evenly blended.... So worth the money. I need two of these one for home and one for work.</li>
    <li> This is one of those devices that seems way too simple to be effective, yet it&#x27;s simplicity is precisely what makes it so effective! Although I&#x27;ve not tried any of the generic versions, I have used drugstore cosmetic wedges and there is absolutely no comparison. Before purchasing the Beauty Blender, I spent several days reading comments/reviews and viewing a huge number of YouTube videos. The vast majority of opinions were positive, and those that weren&#x27;t impressed tended to be hung up on very minor issues that are easy to resolve. Bottom line, this a &amp;#34;can&#x27;t-go-wrong purchase&amp;#34; for those looking for excellent results from their make-up application!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time I bought this item so I can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s fake or not. But there is a small uncomfortable smell, for me.</li>
    <li> Umm I have mixed feelings.. It&#x27;s like a love hate relationship. I continue to use it and it gets the job done, but I&#x27;m iffy.. I&#x27;m not complaining but in not praising it neither.. try it!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the original BB. I was duped because this product was &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34;. The original BB is a little more dense and the color doesnt bleed when you wet it.</li>
    <li> YAY! Nothing beats the original sponge, i&#x27;m sorry!  I&#x27;ve tried many dups and they are just too harsh! I totally love this little drop shaped sponge! If you are into that airbrushed clean Hollywood skin effect you will love this little tool. It&#x27;s a must have. Size does not matter in this case, because this little baby accomplishes an amazing finish. It&#x27;s Super Soft and it feels great on your skin when it&#x27;s Damp.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean. The price is not bad for what you are getting in the end. It is awesome when used damp for powders to set the undereye/concealer area !!!!!  Please go buy one, or two!  PS. and it&#x27;s PINK! Need I say more?!! lol xoxox</li>
    <li> Great everything! But the price holds me from repurchasing.</li>
    <li> My new makeup must have! You truly do see a difference on the application!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Better than using a foundation brush.</li>
    <li> It is an amazing product. The only problem with it that I was cleaning it then it scratched at the top of it. But it&#x27;s amazing for application and blending.</li>
    <li> I swear guys. For all you skeptics who thought this was a hoax- paying 20 bucks for a sponge, believe me I was one of you. I made fun of people who actually bought this. However, when I got it because I wanted a lighter everyday coverage, I kid you not this did the job for all my cream foundations. I love it and will keep repurchasing it because it&#x27;s that much of a staple!!!</li>
    <li> Skin type: ethnic, acne scarred, and very oily. I&#x27;m no makeup guru and most of the time I have do my makeup in a hurry; new mom type rush. This sponge is awesome because it really helps my foundation to blend more than a brush, especially at the speed in which I go. It definitely gives me a more natural finish. I&#x27;m definitely a fan. Love it.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Blends my make up beautifully. Love the way I can vary the coverage.  Feel like I use less liquid make up and get better results.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this sponge.  It leaves your foundation or tinted moisturizer with a flawless finish every time. I&#x27;ve used both brushes and the beautyblender to apply foundation and tinted moisturizer and the winner is the Beautyblender because there are absolutely no lines or streaks at all. You must also buy the cleaner (liquid or solid) to wash the sponge.</li>
    <li> I never use a brush for applying my foundation coz I have normal to dry skin and applying with sponge suits me better.&lt;br /&gt;I just had to order this beauty blender as there was so much hype about this product. But after using it for 6 months I couldn&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s the hype all about. I am back to using my regular sponge.&lt;br /&gt;This beauty blender soaks so much foundation :(</li>
    <li> This is a huge FAKE!!! I have had the original beauty blenders but this is ridiculous. The only thing that is legit is the packaging, i knew instantly when there was an allure sticker that look reprinted. The actual sponge was smaller and there were little pieces flaking off of the sponge. And when I went to wet it pink dye came out! Like really?? Its my fault for not really reading the reviews on the sellers but what con-artists! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! So disappointed beyond belief and the do not do returns.</li>
    <li> I love how this blends.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  Flows seamlessly from concealer to foundation.  It needs to be replaced every 3 months or so depending on amount of usage.</li>
    <li> The Beautyblender is awesome.  I have tried so many different brushes but only this one allows me to change the coverage of my foundation.  Make your Beautyblender a little wetter for a lighter coverage and drier for a fuller coverage.</li>
    <li> I love the airbrushed look the beauty blender accomplishes onto my skin. It&#x27;s very easy to maintain and clean. It&#x27;s a little pricey but so worth every cent. I&#x27;ve bought other generic brands and I never used one. When I went to clean it for the first use they would bleed the pink dye. I didn&#x27;t want to put that on my face. This beauty blender doesn&#x27;t bleed any dye. I have washed it many many times and it&#x27;s still holding up great. If you have long nails I would say be careful because you could scratch the outside of it. It&#x27;s just a must in any ones make-up case.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that this product is a complete fake! If you have never tried one in the store then you probably won&#x27;t believe it. First off, the beautyblender is not supposed to bleed pink when washing it nor fall apart or turn black and moldy. These things last for months!! Up to a year at the most (with washing after evey application.) This is not worth the price; you think your getting a good deal for the real thing but your not because these are coubterfit.</li>
    <li> It has lasted me a year and some months, and it is still in perfect condition. Instead of buying the manufacturer&#x27;s cleaner, I used olive oil and a dish cleaning soap! It worked wonders on the blender keeping it soft and clean!</li>
    <li> Applies my makeup so nice, it came one day early and it is the same brand that sells in the expensive makeup stores. a little expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is THE BEST for blending makeup! I tried using a cheaper, more generic brand and was not impressed. I finally ordered the Beauty Blender and WOW, this thing was a game changer!</li>
    <li> A little disappointed  because I&#x27;m pretty sure these are fake. The shape is slightly different from the original ones didn&#x27;t get as bif as I&#x27;ve seen in videos and there are typos all over the box :/  my own fault for not buying then at sephora. Oh well</li>
    <li> I have long been a fan of makeup sponges for foundation application but in recent years switched over to the brush technique as I couldn&#x27;t stand the quality of the brushes and how they were leaving my foundation...streaky, clumpy looking...uneven.&lt;br /&gt;I also, like many others here stated have tried the cheaper versions. Trust me, buy nice or buy twice, this sponge is a GAME CHANGER.&lt;br /&gt;First of all compared to the others on the market that say they are the same at a lesser price, I wasted my money on them and they are not the same. They are denser, they absorb lots of the foundation and they are difficult to clean since they do absorb so much. The Beauty Blender rinses clean so quickly. I have been washing mine daily after application with a pump of antibacterial soap and I am super pleased at how easy it is to keep clean. It seems like it will hold up well, time will tell on that one.&lt;br /&gt;Upon using it for application you simply run it under the water, squeeze it out (I squeeze mine in a towel) and it&#x27;s ready to go. My foundation looks flawless...or my skin looks flawless is what I should say because it blends the makeup so well it&#x27;s hard to tell I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I use the &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; side for all over foundation and the tip for concealer spots, around the nose and eyes. I just use tapping motions all over my cheeks, forehead and chin and I keep doing that until it&#x27;s all blended. It&#x27;s super easy, the finish is perfect and it&#x27;s quick. I find it easier to the blend without streaking as can happen with the brush &amp;#34;stippling&amp;#34; method and this thing seems much easier to clean then a brush (I like to clean my applicator after every use), plus it drys faster then the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, I couldn&#x27;t recommend it more, and I&#x27;m a makeup junky so I&#x27;ve tried just about every other method (which I think was a waste now) and this tops them all.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know how to use it, check out a video, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s tons of beauties that put up videos on it.up videos on it.</li>
    <li> A must have to put on your makeup. This works flawlessly. Fast shipping. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Evens out foundation application.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this beauty blender. I used to use a stippling brush to put my foundation on (which I thought worked really well) until I bought this. This blends your foundation and concealer PERFECTLY. The only thing I&#x27;m sad about is when I wash it with the beauty blender solid the pink comes off with the soap, so it&#x27;s not as bright as when I first bought it. Also, some of my foundation and concealer has stained the sponge but I can live with that. I will be buying another one of these when the one I have needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> Love this product..Can&#x27;t imagine applying my makeup without it now! Definitely would recommend it to a friend! ******* Must Have!</li>
    <li> This is by far hands down the best way to appy liquid foundation/BB or CC cream.  I gave one to my mom for her birthday and she is raving about it.</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge applicator!</li>
    <li> The ultimate blending tool. Worth every penny. Can make a little bit of foundation go a long way for smooth, even coverage.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Never living without it again&lt;br /&gt;So much better than the real techniques</li>
    <li> Love this thing! Don&#x27;t forget to READ directions for use! You need to get it wet first. This is the best thing invented for makeup application. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for so long!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I use this everyday and would highly recommend this product to anyone who uses cream foundation</li>
    <li> I like the fact that you dampen the sponge before using it to apply liquid foundation, because that helps with the smooth application results.  This sponge is made of good quality sponge material that I dont anticipate cracking or breaking apart like cheaper sponges tend to.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, of course, but I am pleased with the sponge and it works a bit better than my fingers (which work better than any previous sponge).  Read the directions for use and care.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved it, but it started to mold within two weeks. Granted, I didn&#x27;t wash it straight away. I bought a dupe that I&#x27;ve treated the same, if not worse on purpose and it still hasn&#x27;t molded. At half the price for four sponges, I&#x27;ll stick with the knockoffs.</li>
    <li> I got a dupe for this awhile back and they didn&#x27;t work, i thought that this would be the same thing because a sponge is a sponge right? Well wrong, this is amazing soft and blends my foundation and concealer so nicely! I always found it hard to blend my concealer bit with this it comes out amazing! Don&#x27;t waste your money with dupes and just get this one because it really does work and it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
    <li> I love beauty blenders. You have to wet first, and make sure you ring them out a TON before using or else your face will look wet and way too dewey. I find cleaning them is the only pain point. I like to use dish soap then put them in the microwave for a few seconds</li>
    <li> Dampen this little guy, and it gives your liquid foundation an airbrushed finish. It&#x27;s easy to blend, stipple, and add more coverage in areas that need it without any streaking or cakeyness. I&#x27;ve switched from using a brush to apply foundation to this, and I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> nice to hold onto while applying makeup but very expensive for what it is -i don&#x27;t have 6 more words to say about it</li>
    <li> VS the Essence of Beauty sponge that is sold at CVS the moment I took it out of the box you can feel the difference in the material. The CVS sponge is not egg shaped and it a much firmer material than the BB sponge. When you wet it the expansion between the two is both drastic but the BB starts off about the size of a small chicken egg and than expands to be the size of about 2.5 large chicken eggs while the CVS one just stayed about the side of a large chicken egg.(Hopefully that makes sense) The application blended with my skin flawlessly and did not emphasize the pore on my nose like how you apply foundation with a brush. It did work with my cream foundation but it works best with liquid makeup. The CVS sponge is NOT a dupe for the BB but it is a good stepping stone to work your way up to the BB if you do not want to spend the money on the BB. The beauty blender is a one of a kind product and the other companies that follow it&#x27;s concept do not compare in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a top of the line beauty sponge I would highly recommend this, but if the price range is too high for you I would suggest looking around for a discounted one on Amazon its highly worth it</li>
    <li> I’ve been using a foundation brush for years but decided to give this sponge a try. I LOVE IT! The coverage is really nice and I use the same amount of foundation as with my brush. My other sponges just soak up the foundation and I end up having to use twice the amount. Be sure to dampen the sponge before you use it!</li>
    <li> Really love this product!  It blends my foundation so much better than a foundation brush and works better than generic blenders.</li>
    <li> I bought this sponge (exactly this one, from the same seller) few months ago, and it was  perfect. Few weeks ago i purchased a new one. And there is visibly something wrong with it. It looks fine, works well, but every time i wash it, it looses color like crazy. Water runs off totally bright pink color. And if it drops somewhere  - it colors everything. I have pink stains on my white bathroom counter now, and i can not take them off! Used all kinds of cleaners, scrubs, alcohol - nothing works.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is safe to use this on face... i still do, but thinking about throwing it away... sad.</li>
    <li> absolutely love the beauty blender. Works like a charm. I&#x27;ve used them for over a year now and won&#x27;t go back to make up brushes for foundation. Gives such a natural finish.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other make up applicator.</li>
    <li> i was disappointed....i thought it was larger than it was and then i saw the exact same thing for $5 in TJ Max!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner!  It&#x27;s surprising that a little sponge can make your face look so great, but it does.  I use high end makeup brushes and I&#x27;ve never been 100% satisfied because it&#x27;ll sometimes make my makeup look flakey.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the sponge is damp when you use it or what, but it blends my foundation perfectly!  And, it&#x27;s good for getting under your eyes and in the corners.  Great product!  I will def be buying again once it&#x27;s time for a new one!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item over the summer because of hearing good reviews on you tube, delivery was prompt but the product didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference to me. I have used wedges, brushes and sponges in the past and the beauty blender doesn&#x27;t apply foundation better than any other sponge or brush i&#x27;ve used. I do not have alot of scars/blemishes on my face but i love using full coverage foundation to hide those scars that i do have and i&#x27;ve found that my revelon concealer brush or a round brush applies foundation most wonderfully, the look is natural and never cakey. After purchasing and using this item it just went into the basket i store my other sponges in - i gave this item a two because delivery was good and it&#x27;s my favorite color - pink! I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking to buy a good sponge but in my opinion it&#x27;s not the best one out there</li>
    <li> Holy grail makeup product!!!</li>
    <li> The beautyblender makes a HUGE difference for the better on how my makeup turns out every day plus it&#x27;s easy to use. THANKS</li>
    <li> its an expensive little beauty sponge but its so worth the money. it arrived on time. its not too dense. and it works the best when dampened. it really is the best way to apply foundation/ or concealer. awesome product!</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender.  It works so well. Not really sure if it is any  better than any regular sponge when used the same way, but do love the sponge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reallly worth the money. It&#x27;s pretty much flawless.</li>
    <li> If you want a flawless look with no streaks and bumps then this is it. I find it is best to damp the beauty blender before applying the foundation. And then just pat the foundation onto your face until its all blended in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only gave it 4 stars because i think beauty blenders are a little overpriced.</li>
    <li> This thing is great it blends to perfection leaving no lines separating you face from neck.It leaves a smooth canvas minimizes how much product your use, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin cakey at all!! I so recommend!!</li>
    <li> Beautyblender is the only sponge applicator I&#x27;ve found that works as it should.</li>
    <li> my makeup has never looked so good! My only complaint is that I have not figured out how to keep it clean or if I am supposed to wash it after every use. Other than that, my skin looks great because the beauty blender makes my makeup look so flawless!</li>
    <li> Love it, it gives off an airbrush look.</li>
    <li> Im really loving this beauty blender.  This is the first sponge I have tried; I have always used a brush for foundation.  I am really liking this though! I am using it with the Revlon Colorstay whipped cream foundation and it works beautifully!!</li>
    <li> First of all....you can do without it!!! Unless you are a makeup artist using it to blend colors and do shading...You honestly DO NOT NEED THIS!! I am a makeup artist and take it from me &#x3D;) Spend your money using real good natural brush and you are good to go!!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. My make-up goes on light and seamlessly every time.  Not sure how to clean extra make-up out of it.</li>
    <li> Gives off a nice natural coverage without sheering out the product. Makes putting on my foundations, bb creams, concealers, etc. so much easier/faster. Also, it&#x27;s very easy to clean! I just use a gentle handsoap (the kind I buy is called &amp;#34;method&amp;#34;) and &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; out the makeup stains. But be careful of how you store your beauty blender. Many people have claimed that theirs got moldy after two weeks and that&#x27;s due to improper storage! First off, do not throw away any of the packaging. It makes a perfect home for the sponge. After cleaning it, put it in the plastic container WITHOUT the lid on and put it somewhere well lit and sturdy. Remember, it&#x27;s still a sponge and sponges get moldy if you store them in a dark, damp place. Once it dries you can put the lid back on.</li>
    <li> This Beauty Blender is great.  I used several other brands but this one is soft and blend foundation very evenly.</li>
    <li> I love this cute, little sponge! It makes my make-up look flawless! I recommend Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk foundation paired with the beautyblender. It looks amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  It definitely helps cover my scars and fill in a couple of wrinkles.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This little sponge is a bit pricey but worth it. I love how hydrated and flawless my makeup looks when I use this sponge. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very soft, very easy to clean. I use it to blend in my under eye concealer, works great!! It would work great for foundation too.</li>
    <li> I use this every day! It also works well when dry, but it does blend makeup better when wet. I mainly only use this for concealer because I don&#x27;t use liquid foundation, but I&#x27;m sure it would work the same with foundation, A bit pricey, but you really get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Great product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who uses makeup. This seriously made the concealer under my eyes look like it had been airbrushed on. Just make sure to clean it regularly. I wash mine with Johnson&#x27;s baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET THIS MARCH 14 AND WHATS TODAY APRIL4TH YOU WILL GET STIFFED I PAYED AND WHAT DID I GET NOTHING DO NOT GET THIS!!!!!! IF YOU DO YOU WON&#x27;T GET ANYTHING!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good sponge.  Does a great job of blending and the point is perfect.</li>
    <li> now my make up routine is quick and easy</li>
    <li> Really awesome! I wish I knew how to clean it.</li>
    <li> Sooo soft and works amazing! I do however have concerns about cleaning it. I guess I&#x27;ll have to figure that out soon.</li>
    <li> Best blender ever.  Hands down.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with my other makeup tools.  Great from around the nose and eye area for smoothing your makeup and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I think you need to be a pro in order to make use of this little tool. I usually use my fingertips and don&#x27;t do much contouring. You should wash this after every use, which I find a little impractical.</li>
    <li> I was not going to buy a sponge for my oily acne prone skin. However, I couldn&#x27;t find anything that gave me coverage and a great finish that I desired. I have tried the wet application method with other sponges and been sorely disappointed. This is now my HG applicator and I am going to buy SEVERAL for my make up arsenal. I watched tutorials and followed instructions carefully and got a flawless professional look with the first application. I have oily acne prone skin and am approaching the age where wrinkles are a concern so I really need something that will work wonders. The beauty blender is that product. I am nota professional and I cannot believe I&#x27;ve been converted but I am really glad I tried this. It is well worth the price. I also did a lot of research to be sure I got an authentic beauty blender it cut my foundation application time down to 1 minute flat! I now use three pumps of liquid foundation as opposed to 5/6 and coverage is even and full. Love love love this sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sponges for makeup before. They are nothing like the Beauty Blender! It blends makeup beautifully without sucking up lots of it into the sponge. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Fabulous foundation blender!  Not sure its worth the money&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> Not sure if its authentic. I had previously used one purchased at Sephora and this one has more of a crease around the top unlike that one. Seems like the whole selling point of this product was that its perfectly smooth and rounded. Love the beauty blenders though!</li>
    <li> I love this! My foundation looks so natural!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these from Sephora, after hearing so many rave reviews, and I&#x27;d have to say, I&#x27;m not impressed. I like for my foundation to be heavier coverage because I have some issues with acne and acne scarring and I feel like no matter how much I squeeze it out it still retains water and thins out my makeup. Worse than this I noticed it falling apart after only a few uses. Now, it has a big gash on the top rendering it basically useless. I was never hard on it and I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month. I think I&#x27;ll just continue to use my hands from now on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend it to every woman who wants that perfect look.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this is the thing...sponges are great for applying foundation...but you could you get a pack of disposable ones for less than half the price without jeopardizing your skin.  The shape of this sponge is nothing special and the brightly pink dye on it bleeds out.  The foundation stains it, and it gives the appearance of being something dirty even though you know it isn&#x27;t.  All in all not saying it doesn&#x27;t perform, it just isn&#x27;t worth it in the long run...save your money and keep it fresh and buy makeup sponges at you local drug store and apply accordingly.  I also prefer foundation brushes over wasting any change on this obnoxious item.</li>
    <li> It work perfectly, doesn&#x27;t absorb your makeup if you do get it wet, i don&#x27;t like to put any fix or other products on it to help your makeup stay, i like to do it directly to my face, otherwise it becomes really hard and even though you get it wet you can definitely smell the other products.</li>
    <li> THIS IS MY HOLY GRAIL!!!! love it makes my foundation  look flawless .Defenetly a must have!!!!</li>
    <li> Love love love all the other dupes can&#x27;t compare!</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender and use it regularly with various foundations. I also got my mom hooked and ordered one for her. It&#x27;s perfect for creating that dewy finish or blending out concealer. I also use this to blend out my cream bronzer or blush and make sure there are no harsh lines.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my beauty blender! I want another!! Blends out makeup so great.</li>
    <li> Love it! Stipples perfectly and especially great for contouring around your eyes, nose, lips etc. Definitely a great investment! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this sponge!  I have used different applicators in the past and this is far the best.  Saturate with water and wring out apply LIQUID foundation and apply.  Foundation goes on nicely...does not settle in the creases.  Leaves a nice even coverage!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not the real deal and I sent it back</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I love mine.  Does seem over priced for a sponge though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this method of putting on my makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t buy into the hype if you already have adequate brushes and a method of applying foundation. Works alright for thinning out sections I&#x27;ve overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I didn&#x27;t know what the heck I was doing. This is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY use this damp now - by damp I mean lightly wet. Do not submerge in the ocean and then try to use it. I really tend to grab for it when I want a sheer, natural look and only have a few minutes to do any sort of makeup. I&#x27;ve used it with both MAC (studio fix fluid and studio sculpt) and MUFE HD foundations and love the natural \\&quot;me but not really\\&quot; look achieved.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about a year, and it has only minor damage. The beautyblender blends makeup flawlessly and creates an airbrushed effect. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and you can use the beautyblender wet or dry. I absolutely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it does what is says it does. It makes my face look like i got a great airbrush. I would recommend the Beautyblender to everyone.</li>
    <li> This thing is one of those...WOW , this really does work. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because when I washed, it ran pink dye under the water. Not a huge deal but I kinda wonder if any of that pigment is getting on my face? However, I love the fact that you can get heavy coverage by using it dry and light coverage when you wet it. The Beautyblender should be in every woman&#x27;s makeup bag.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t really imagine how this will work until you use it.  It really is amazing.  Every girl needs a beautyblender.</li>
    <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
    <li> At first the sponge was great until I had to clean it, and it ripped. I know how to wash a beauty blender so this sponge was just cheap.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve used sponges b4, but like EVERYONE says, those don&#x27;t even compare! I love the way this blends in my liquid foundation...the only downfall is bc I have nails, I now have a small rip in the top fatter part from squeezing it while cleaning it. Def recommend!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this sponge amazing results.... Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I had to buy this product because of all of its rave reviews.  I have been extremely careful with it and have maintained its cleanliness. However, the tip ripped off within the first month I bought it and now it will not soak up water and it will not expand. I keep it stored in a cool, dry place and it still somehow collected meld-dew. They will not let me exchange it. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I know nothing about makeup. This product was for my wife. She looks sexy, so I&#x27;m assuming that it&#x27;s working well and that she enjoys it.</li>
    <li> The greatest invention in history of make-up</li>
    <li> This applicator makes applying liquid foundation so much easier!!  My foundation application is even and smooth.  And I don&#x27;t get the foundation all over my fingers!!  I would highly recommend this product.  In fact, I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my travel bag!</li>
    <li> I heard all the hype about the Beauty Blender and finally caved because other methods (other sponges, brushes and just fingers) were not giving me the look I was going for.  I do the &amp;#34;full face&amp;#34; which is moisturizer, primer, foundation and use higher end products so I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why my makeup wasn&#x27;t quite as flawless as it should have been.  Then I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOLY MOLY!!  What a change!!!  I went through my normal application process except I used the BB to apply my foundation.  Once I finished my entire makeup routine I took a step back and just couldn&#x27;t stop staring.  I looked poreless, soft focus, airbrushed....flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the first time I used it, my face itched just a little.  So I went back and cleaned it thoroughly before the next use and I haven&#x27;t had another issue.  It might be wise to give it a little wash before first use, just to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the BB.  I know there are cheaper alternatives but in this case I feel like you really get what you pay for.  Just do it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> Had bought original at sephora and liked it enough to want to get another one.  Saw that the pack of 2 seemed more reasonable and ordered it only to find that the 2 sponges were each maybe a third of the size of the original.  The difference in size is not noted anywhere in the description so be aware that you may not be getting all you think you are paying for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT it is wounderful products&lt;br /&gt;it is BEAUTYBLENDER no one can deny it&lt;br /&gt;thank u . .&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
    <li> Beautyblender, I wanted to love you, I really did! But, you just soak up too much of my expensive foundation :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m doing this wrong, but for me this just didn&#x27;t work. I know several make up artists who swear by it, but I just can&#x27;t afford to buy my expensive foundation more frequently.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought but really makes my makeup look flawless.</li>
    <li> If used properly it does save on makeup and I use lancome products so they are pricey but it does a good job</li>
    <li> I love the beauty blender. Nothing else compares to the original. It gives your foundation a great natural finish, definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what i hoped for and better. makes my makeup look flawless. i have tried everything expensive brushes, sponges, triangles, air brushing - everything! this thing does the job and keeps the skin looking flawless. loves it!!</li>
    <li> I really loved this sponge and want to try it since while , the Blending is unique with it and It makes the foundation becomes very smooth and consistent on the face .&lt;br /&gt;and the deal with the seller was so sophisticated ..</li>
    <li> I was really hesitant at first to spend so much on a sponge - I&#x27;m not really invested in makeup, I just want to wear enough that I look decent at my customer service job - but I&#x27;m glad I did. It works pretty nicely.</li>
    <li> best. makeup. sponge. EVER!</li>
    <li> This product is as great as everyone says it is - it&#x27;s worth the hype. It blends makeup perfectly. It&#x27;s soft on your face. It allows you to build coverage as heavy or light as you want. I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. If you are looking for a way to transport your blender in a makeup bag or train case and don&#x27;t want to spend an ungodly amount on the travel case, pick up some mesh nylon bags (search Black Cell Phone Nylon Mesh Drawstring Pouch Bags here). It will allow them to breathe while you travel. I wouldn&#x27;t store them like that permanently, but it&#x27;s handy because I oftentimes do my makeup at work or in the car.</li>
    <li> Smaller than original one</li>
    <li> It looked brand new when I purchased it</li>
    <li> Honestly, I do think that this is a well packaged and well marketed product. It&#x27;s feminine and it appeals to the female psyche of our quest to always become prettier than we already are. However, this is really over priced for a makeup sponge. I do love the fact that it is made right here at home in the good old USA, but it is no different than the sponges that were popular in the &#x27;90&#x27;s. In fact you can still buy said sponges at Walmart. Youtube and allure magazine did a wonderful job hyping this product up, but that all it is.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST makeup tool I have ever used. I had so many compliments and my friends ended up purchasing one for themselves. Your face feels lighter, looks airbrushed, and you save so much makeup. The only problem I have is that its hard to get that makeup stain off.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected. Great service. Thanks</li>
    <li> this little pink egg makes me look forward to applying my cover-up and foundation and liquid powder. I love this product and the finish look is flawless. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> This is such a great product! Before finding this, my makeup would sometimes look cakey and not smooth. From my first use, I knew this little sponge would work wonders for my skin. My skin look natural, and not heavily made up. Usually when I wear makeup you can sort of tell that I am wearing it, but not with this! After the first time I used this product, my mom actually noticed the difference enough to ask me what had changed in my makeup regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how I do not have to use those little white triangle sponges that aren&#x27;t reusable like this one. Also I found that I use A LOT less makeup than before when I used makeup brushes. This is great, because I can make each bottle of foundation last longer and longer than before.</li>
    <li> i used mine for a little while but i went back to using my fingers becuse its so much faster</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this applicator just rinse in water ring it out a little and voila that simple. I would recommend if you have red or darker spots to take your time and go over a few times lightly dabbing to conceal blemishes.</li>
    <li> I will never apply makeup with anything els . They are THE best.</li>
    <li> The best beauty blender ever!!!!!!! Blends Jr concealer and foundation effortlessly.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Applying liquid foundation with this gives you an absolutely flawless finish and such an easy/fast application.  I also find that i use less foundation when applying with this as opposed to a brush or my fingers. I love that there&#x27;s the large end for most of your face and the pointed tip for eyes, nose, etc.  Its definitely worth the price since its a one time purchase, so happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Love it just ordered a second one.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I was sold a fake version of this but I have had it for about 3 weeks and it has completely fallen apart. Not sure why but it is coming apart in pieces.</li>
    <li> Great product! If you don&#x27;t have one…buy one!</li>
    <li> I got this to blend out my concealer and I love it! I actually switched from power to liquid foundation because it works so well! If you hesitant to buy this don&#x27;t be! This product is amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my &amp;#34;Beautyblender&amp;#34;! First use and I am spoiled rotten. Forgot to use it one day and my makeup did not look as good. Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this, I really didn&#x27;t want to get this product. Here&#x27;s why: I thought it was hyped up and overrated. Yeah I saw the high ratings, but trendy products are going to inflate ratings, and honestly, I thought it was way too expensive for a glorified sponge. So I went to Walgreens, saw a cheap (seven dollars) pink sponge sort of shaped like the beauty blender and bought it. To put it simply, it sucked. Usually with sponge applicators like these you have to get the sponge wet (thanks Internet) for the so called &amp;#34;airbrush effect&amp;#34;. The cheap thing never stayed wet, and didnt absorb anything. Sure it worked alright, but it took forever to apply because the shape wasn&#x27;t as easy to use, and took me way longer than I wanted it to. It looked miles better than dry triangle sponges, but not dramatically. The I tried to wash it. I used baby soap (which was recommended by the Internet, again) and chunks came out of the sponge, and it really wasn&#x27;t any cleaner and stained the color of my foundation. So I saw the beauty blender again, and chucked the old crappy sponge in the trash and ordered the damned thing. THIS IS NOT HYPED UP. The sponge is small, held by your finger tips and either &amp;#34;stippled&amp;#34; on with the bottom flat side or precisely applied with the tip in small areas when wet. The sponge GROWS when wet. No problems with it staying wet at all. The sponge didnt fall to pieces when washed and cleaned. If you choose, you can buy a cleanser that is about 8 bucks for its smallest size and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Story Short: Get it. Yes it&#x27;s a little pricey, but it does what it should, and is not a waste of money if used as suggested. I tried the cheaper sponge for at least two weeks, and it was clearly inferior. It&#x27;s tempting to buy a knock off, and you might be happy, but chances are its not going to work the way it should and its just a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> bouncy soft, pliable sponge. blends foundation, sheer application to build coverage. seamless application that blends easily. great for beginners and pros. forces you to wet and wash a little with every use (which is a good thing) good for dry skin because it does not exfoliate like brushes and pull up dry skin. pointed tip gets in perfectly under eyes to blend foundation and concealer. love the color too; very hot pink. worth buying the REAL beauty blender.</li>
    <li> this product is raved about in almost every beauty news media and must say it does not disappoint. foundation goes on easily and flawlessly.</li>
    <li> When I buy it I felt really guilty for spending so much on a simple sponge, but I go by the reviews. very bad decision. when I began to use it I really liked the finish that I got, but after a couple of days I  use it.......!!!&lt;br /&gt;my skin started to feel horrible, like sandy. didn&#x27;t matter to wash my face or if to exfoliate, didnt work at all. I had to pay for me to have a facial.This &amp;#34;WONDERFUL SPONGE&amp;#34;  cover my pores  horrible!</li>
    <li> I heard a lot of hype about the Beauty Blender, so I decided to give it a try. I had purchased a knock off version and I was not impressed. This, on the other hand, does just what it&#x27;s name suggests: it blends beautifully! I&#x27;ve tried it with foundation and bb creams, and it works well with both. Follow directions and make sure the sponge is damp when applying the make up.  If cleaned and used properly, I think this will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I give it four stars instead of five is because of the price.</li>
    <li> It was strange at first but the more I use it the more I live it!! Great application for foundation or concealer. Like the way I can get into all the nooks and crannies!!!</li>
    <li> Consider this single item your 2-years&#x27; worth of make up sponge.</li>
    <li> After watching a lot of girls using this on YouTube in their makeup tutorials - I decided to give it a whirl. I love this for putting my base foundation on, and even sponging really light concealer when I&#x27;m doing really bold contouring looks with bronzer. Highly recommend! And yes - I tried a few knock offs from Walgreens but this is still a notch better.</li>
    <li> Bought this for applying my daughter&#x27;s stage makeup.  She has a fair amount of skin blemishes and this sponge allowed the products to cover better and give her a flawless appearance.  Worked much better than using my fingers or even my expensive foundation brushes.</li>
    <li> I have been using my beauty blender since I received it in the mail. It&#x27;s been about two months and I have yet to miss my foundation brush. Shipping was right on time making me extra happy!</li>
