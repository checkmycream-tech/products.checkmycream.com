      <li>WOW, this is a wonderful cream, the scent is warm yet</li>
      <li>This stuff works just fine and is good for the traveler.</li>

      <li>It raises the beard nicely, while lubricating the skin, making shaving very smooth and easy.    </li>
      <li>I need to try more tobs.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is.  </li>
      <li>The sandalwood smell here is noticeably different, a delightfully earthy smell in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I love all the TOBS shaving creams.  </li>
      <li>It does smell better .</li>
      <li>thing that I love about Taylors is that they don&#x27;t use parabens in their products.  </li>
      <li>Its OK.</li>
      <li>These tubes are much better for traveling than the tubs.  </li>
      <li>pretty good shave</li>
      <li>Another great product from my favorite shaving product company, Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
      <li>and it makes a huge lather,  so much better then</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok at best nothing to jump up and down about.</li>
      <li>With little effort I&#x27;m able to whip up an amazingly perfect, creamy lather in seconds with this cream.</li>
      <li>Another valuable plus for me is that it&#x27;s easy to transport on a trip.</li>
      <li>Unlike some shave soaps, it&#x27;s easy to see where it&#x27;s applied.</li>
      <li>The smell on this product is WAY to strong.  </li>
      <li>Love this shaving cream very rich and thick, smells great!!!</li>
      <li>Having never previously been familiar with witchhazel, it&#x27;s great for your skin and helps with moisturizing, tightening the skin, recovering from acne scars, fighting acne, etc.  </li>
      <li>Once it comes out, you&#x27;ll notice that the cream is just fine after you start to mix it.  </li>
      <li>My wife told me if we have a fly problem this summer she was going to ask me to shave with this product and go outside and eliminate the flies.  </li>
      <li>I was a big fan of proraso&#x27;s sandalwood shaving soap and hears great things about taylors and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
      <li>but I still enjoy using this cream.  </li>
      <li>These fit the bill</li>
      <li>Plus it isn&#x27;t so light on the face to apply.</li>
      <li>Fantastic fragrance.  </li>
      <li>There is a reason that Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood is the number 1 seller: it is just that good.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and comfy and it performs well in protecting the skin.</li>
      <li>An excellent shave cream at a very competitive price in an extremely convenient travel size.</li>
      <li>OK, the Almond not so much.  </li>
      <li>Lathers very well, and the fragrance becomes more aromatic in the lather without being overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell of this cream, but it seems to really work like soap and it dries out my skin.</li>
      <li>Those were returned (unopened) and amazon paid for return shipping and gave a quick refund.</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite shaving cream.</li>
      <li>Good smell, stays moist in dry weather, no skin irritation.</li>
      <li>Fits well into my toiletries kit, smells the same and lathers up as nicely as the version in a bowl.</li>
      <li>overpriced but worth a go</li>
      <li>Decided to compare Art of Shave, Proraso and Taylor in my own personal trial.  </li>
      <li>Just Love Taylor of Old Bond Street products and this product does not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>Like the original I really like this shaving cream,</li>
      <li>; scent right up there with original old spice.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time today, not quite what I expected on the scent, it did make a very smooth lather, it did require a bit more than expected, overall a pretty good cream.</li>
      <li>As a performer, I thoroughly enjoyed this vs the trumpers tube of cream I got with the same order.</li>
      <li>do when applied to unshaven skin, but goes so in a way that&#x27;s much more gentle than alcohol based aftershaves so it doesn&#x27;t actually burn or hurt when applied to freshly shaven skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sandalwood seems to be a popular scent among the wet shaving community</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I ordered.  </li>
      <li>This was my first purchase of shaving cream in a tube to use with a bowl and brush to work up a lather.</li>
      <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street is fantastic ...</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming by any means.</li>
      <li>I feel it is hard to make a nice rich creamy lather.</li>
      <li>I honestly much prefer Art of Shaving&#x27;s Sandalwood, though this product certainly does perform.</li>
      <li>Not too much to say about it really</li>
      <li>The Art and Proraso are very comparable and passable from a performance perspective.  </li>
      <li>Works very well, though the box it comes in is a bit flimsy, but who cares really.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very thin gel with a light scent and a good amount of witchhazel.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried Taylor&#x27;s other scents in a tube, but now I will for sure.</li>
      <li>The cream smells more of alcohol than other sandalwood cream&#x27;s</li>
      <li>As much as I like proraso products (such as pre/post shave, and white aftershave balm), tobs sandalwood shaving cream is much better.</li>
      <li>The only downside is this is a true &amp;#34;old</li>
      <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood shaving cream lathers and performs pretty well.  </li>
      <li>Normally I lather twice, once with the grain and once against, but if I really want a particularly close shave</li>
      <li>It makes me feel better about what I&#x27;m slathering on my face over the years which is one less thing to worry about.  </li>
      <li>The lather is fantastic and it doesnt leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
      <li>It really is a decent shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Every real man should have a Sandalwood product in their repot ire from Taylor of Old Bond.</li>
      <li>I normally prefer soaps to creams, but TOBS has changed my mind.  </li>
      <li>I prefer the tubes overall as I find them to be a little more convenient for travel, usage and storage.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great for travel and lasts quite a while.  I&#x27;m on a plane once or twice a week.  This actually has lasted me a couple months and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space</li>
    <li> Good smell, stays moist in dry weather, no skin irritation. This might be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; after a year of trying different products!</li>
    <li> Its OK. I may purchase again.  The cream smells more of alcohol than other sandalwood cream&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, and its lather is less creamy than some I&#x27;ve used, like Art of Shaving&#x27;s sandalwood cream.</li>
    <li> WOW, this is a wonderful cream, the scent is warm yet masculin.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to make a wonderful lather.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had bought a bowl of it now!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I ordered.  Having used it before, I knew what I wanted--a really high quility shave cream with a good smell and a good lubricant to avoid cuts.  This merchant delivered it ahead of schedule and in mint condition.</li>
    <li> Use it as my travel version of the same product in a bowl at home. Works very well, though the box it comes in is a bit flimsy, but who cares really.  Fits well into my toiletries kit, smells the same and lathers up as nicely as the version in a bowl.</li>
    <li> I usually use either shaving soap or shaving cream in a tub. This was my first purchase of shaving cream in a tube to use with a bowl and brush to work up a lather. I have to say I&#x27;m delighted with the results. Very simply, it&#x27;s easier to work up a thick and luxurious lather using this than any of the other products I&#x27;ve tried to date.     The scent is pleasant and not overwhelming by any means. If you like sandalwood you&#x27;ll enjoy using this product while shaving and the scent that lingers is very subtle, much less than an aftershave product for instance. The lather quality is extremely good as well. It raises the beard nicely, while lubricating the skin, making shaving very smooth and easy.    Another valuable plus for me is that it&#x27;s easy to transport on a trip. The tube takes up much less room than a tub of either shaving cream or soap. There&#x27;s plenty of product if you use it sparingly, which makes perfect sense. With a small amount, somewhere between a pea and an almond sized squeeze I got all the lather I needed. Normally I lather twice, once with the grain and once against, but if I really want a particularly close shave I&#x27;ll lather three times, once with the grain, once across and once against. Even when I lathered three times there was plenty of lather from just a small squeeze from the tube.    I haven&#x27;t tried Taylor&#x27;s other scents in a tube, but now I will for sure.</li>
    <li> overpriced but worth a go</li>
    <li> The lather is fantastic and it doesnt leave my skin feeling dry. The only downside is this is a true &amp;#34;old man&#x27;s&amp;#34; scent right up there with original old spice.</li>
    <li> Best Shave Ever, I use the tube for when I am traveling</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream very rich and thick, smells great!!!</li>
    <li> I love all the TOBS shaving creams.  OK, the Almond not so much.  These tubes are much better for traveling than the tubs.  PLEASE NOTE: Some of the retailers Amazon works with have old inventory.  I have heard complaints that the aroma of this inventory is sometimes flat.  TOBS reformulated Parabens out of their product in 2009; if the ingredients label lists Parabens, you have old product.  I purchased the sandlewood along with two others which did list parabens.  Those were returned (unopened) and amazon paid for return shipping and gave a quick refund.</li>
    <li> I honestly much prefer Art of Shaving&#x27;s Sandalwood, though this product certainly does perform.</li>
    <li> The scent grew on me. As a performer, I thoroughly enjoyed this vs the trumpers tube of cream I got with the same order. I need to try more tobs.</li>
    <li> This is shaving as it was meant to be.  I remember my grandfather shaving with cream and a brush.  Luxurious!</li>
    <li> Nice shaving cream with a good smell.  The only knock I feel it is hard to make a nice rich creamy lather.</li>
    <li> Great product. Five star scent. Four star performance.</li>
    <li> A dime size and it makes a huge lather,  so much better then the Col. Conk shaving soap I have.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time today, not quite what I expected on the scent, it did make a very smooth lather, it did require a bit more than expected, overall a pretty good cream.</li>
    <li> An excellent shave cream at a very competitive price in an extremely convenient travel size.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I needed something to comply with TSA restrictions.  Taylor of Old Bond Street is fantastic ... it produces a rich, creamy base and the sandalwood smell is nice.  This is my favorite travel-size product!</li>
    <li> I get the closest shave with this shaving cream vs any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Like the original I really like this shaving cream, but this smell is definitely not for me (my wife can&#x27;t stand it)</li>
    <li> Easyer to use a bar of soap than this . Cleans up easyer an is not as oily . It does smell better . I like Sandlewood .</li>
    <li> My second favorite shave cream so far right behind trufitt and hills sandalwood scented cream. Comes in second in terms of shave comfort as well. Still really good though.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feeling like a baby and the sandalwood scent is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good. Slick, protective goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product, so I always purchase for him when I catch a bargain.  He loves the smell, and so do I.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I normally prefer soaps to creams, but TOBS has changed my mind.  Great lather.  Excellent performance.  Fantastic fragrance.  Small enough to travel with.  I will be buying larger sizes of TOBS in the future.</li>
    <li> Been using Art of Shave sandalwood for years.  Decided to compare Art of Shave, Proraso and Taylor in my own personal trial.  The Art and Proraso are very comparable and passable from a performance perspective.  Taylor, however, blows the doors off of both.  There is a definite difference in formulas as the razor truly glides through my whiskers with comparatively low friction.  I have often suffered from neck rash but the low friction properties of Taylor appears to have solved that problem.</li>
    <li> Another great product from my favorite shaving product company, Taylor of Old Bond Street.  This is theoretically billed as a shaving cream, but it&#x27;s really a post-shave skin treatment.  It&#x27;s a very thin gel with a light scent and a good amount of witchhazel.  Having never previously been familiar with witchhazel, it&#x27;s great for your skin and helps with moisturizing, tightening the skin, recovering from acne scars, fighting acne, etc.  With this product a little bit goes a long way since it spreads on thin.  It gives you the slight tingle to the skin once applied like alcohol based aftershaves do when applied to unshaven skin, but goes so in a way that&#x27;s much more gentle than alcohol based aftershaves so it doesn&#x27;t actually burn or hurt when applied to freshly shaven skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with sandalwood and the old barber shop smell. This stuff is great on my skin too.</li>
    <li> Good product, smooth shave, great lather but for the scent was a disappointment. If I buy again it will be a different scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d say my title says it all.  I&#x27;m very happy with all aspects of the purchase.  For my next trip I&#x27;ll buy this again with zero hesitation.</li>
    <li> I was a big fan of proraso&#x27;s sandalwood shaving soap and hears great things about taylors and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. This is my new favorite shaving cream. The sandalwood smell here is noticeably different, a delightfully earthy smell in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried. And the lathering, amazing. With little effort I&#x27;m able to whip up an amazingly perfect, creamy lather in seconds with this cream. It&#x27;s admittedly a bit on the pricey side, but there&#x27;s definitely a clear value to the extra cost. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use this during travel. Foams great and gives a good shave.</li>
    <li> The smell on this product is WAY to strong.  My wife told me if we have a fly problem this summer she was going to ask me to shave with this product and go outside and eliminate the flies.  One thing about the smell it is the gift that keeps on giving.  I was hoping it was similar to another sadalwood product I had tried from another competitor.</li>
    <li> I have used the product in a tub... but needed a smaller size for travel.  These fit the bill</li>
    <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood shaving cream lathers and performs pretty well.  However, the cream is a little hard to squeeze out of the tube.  As you squeeze it, it almost feels as though it has dried up inside.  Once it comes out, you&#x27;ll notice that the cream is just fine after you start to mix it.  I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is.  On a brighter note, I do find it to be less runny than Eton, St. James, and Mr. Taylors in a tube.  I prefer the tubes overall as I find them to be a little more convenient for travel, usage and storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sandalwood seems to be a popular scent among the wet shaving community so I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Well, I learned that I&#x27;m not a huge fan of sandalwood but I still enjoy using this cream.  The performance is very good and the scent is not unpleasant by any means; it just seems a bit cloying.  If you haven&#x27;t smelled it before, it&#x27;s heavy on the sweet, old-fashioned soapy smell.  It might be the perfect scent for someone who enjoys sweet, woody, oud-type fragrances.  If that sounds like you, then give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I love about Taylors is that they don&#x27;t use parabens in their products.  It makes me feel better about what I&#x27;m slathering on my face over the years which is one less thing to worry about.  So the tube and the ingredients are convenient for me.  The scent is pleasing enough, although I&#x27;ll stay away from Sandalwood aftershaves and colognes.  And although it&#x27;s not the thickest cream I&#x27;ve used, it does lather and protect without any issues.  For now, I&#x27;ll give this the four stars that I feel it deserves.  It really is a decent shaving cream.  With all the shaving products out there, you could do a lot worse.</li>
    <li> I like the smell--it&#x27;s both woody (like wood shavings, not forest) and a little soapy. It smells clean and comfy and it performs well in protecting the skin. I apply it by hand and a little bit goes a very long way. Unlike some shave soaps, it&#x27;s easy to see where it&#x27;s applied. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Not too much to say about it really, it has a great smell, builds a nice lather with a brush, and works quite well as a shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Great mix, best Sandalwood smell, pretty good shave creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every real man should have a Sandalwood product in their repot ire from Taylor of Old Bond.</li>
    <li> My very favorite shave cream, the size and tube make this an excellent travel companion in my shave kit.</li>
    <li> Lathers well. I have a hard time squeezing the product out of the tube. Either the hole is too small or the soap is too thick. I don&#x27;t care for the smell, either. Smells like Ivory soap concentrate and old lady perfume, not sandalwood. I prefer the Proraso Sandalwood in every way to this and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is a purchase I regret. I don&#x27;t care for the smell. Plus it isn&#x27;t so light on the face to apply. It seems to clog my razor.</li>
    <li> Just Love Taylor of Old Bond Street products and this product does not disappoint.  Best shaving products on the market</li>
    <li> There is a reason that Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood is the number 1 seller: it is just that good.</li>
    <li> As much as I like proraso products (such as pre/post shave, and white aftershave balm), tobs sandalwood shaving cream is much better.</li>
    <li> Vendor didn&#x27;t have cream in tube, sent the bowl instead (after contacting me). Pleasant smell without being overpowering. Have hard water so it takes some effort to get a lather going.</li>
    <li> Great for travel! A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Best Travel sized thing of shaving cream I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve used a lot.</li>
    <li> This stuff works just fine and is good for the traveler. However, it&#x27;s definitely not as good as the shaving cream that comes in the puck.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cream, but it seems to really work like soap and it dries out my skin.</li>
    <li> Lathers very well, and the fragrance becomes more aromatic in the lather without being overpowering.  If you like creams and sandalwood, I&#x27;d recommend this product.  I&#x27;d always heard great things about TOBS and now I know why.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok at best nothing to jump up and down about. I prefer the tub type and use it all of the time.</li>
