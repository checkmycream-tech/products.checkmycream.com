<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nice size, easy to grip and use - not yet sure if it is working</li>
    <li> Way too small and useless - expected much bigger</li>
    <li> It gave me bruises and I didn&#x27;t notice any change after using it 2 weeks in a row, twice a day. I started to dread using it. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re supposed to use it longer than 2 weeks, but I had to stop because it was hurting too much.</li>
    <li> Used with a cellulite reduction cream and saw no results from constant morning and night use. In addition, it causes bruises along my thighs. Trying to return and will update my review if the seller is easy to interact with.</li>
    <li> This massager brush is effective at rubbing and absorbing the cellulite cream into my buttocks and thighs. I love it very much.</li>
    <li> Great little device, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt and it helps reduce the appearance of cellulite.  Really!  Use with some cream or oil in the shower, be somewhat vigorous and use for a minute on each area (turn off the water to reduce wasting it).  Great for circulation.  Use on your feet as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still working with it. Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
    <li> easy to use, not heavy, I will post if it really worked.. so far, I feel my skin a little bit better</li>
    <li> Firm yet gentle enough, thank you!</li>
    <li> Work really good when used with anti cellulite lotions or creams.</li>
    <li> Excellent !!! It works great with the cream,it doesn&#x27;t hurt not sharp or rough. I like to use it while I am watching TV I Just rub it along my thighs where there is cellulite. Definitely would recommend to buy this massager brush.&lt;br /&gt;Karen</li>
    <li> I am using this with the Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream with Caffeine, Retinol and 3 types of Seaweed and I saw immediate results.  Being a busy mom with small kids, I only have time to use this about 2 - 4 times a week TOTAL and the difference is obvious.  I still have cellulite but definitely not as apparent and I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in.  If used daily, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d look like a rock star.  Note: I do not work out, aside from chasing 2 small kids.</li>
    <li> Great massager! I use it in the morning and evening, and my skin is red after using it. I apply some lotion to use it.</li>
    <li> It is made of plastic, the tips are not rubber although they do move around. The handle is hard to hang onto, but other than that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> Been using this in the shower and with anti cellulite cream and its slowly showing progress. It&#x27;s a good massager. Have to use cream or lots of soap in shower to get a good massage in</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve lost count of all the cellulite massage gloves and gadgets I have used over the years.  Some were okay but most turned out to be from disappointing to unusable, mostly because they would start to drag on my skin as soon as the lotion or gel I applied was absorbed.  This little gem remains comfortable no matter what, I can even use it on completely dry skin.  I love the small size and the grip is brilliant, really solid but adjustable.  It becomes an extension of my hand and allows me to concentrate on the massage instead of constantly having to shift my grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other unique feature is that the nineteen knobs are flexible and move independently, they sink slightly and each one can rotate in a very shallow arc, all of which gives the massager a very kind action.  The little fingers are so smooth and rounded that it is possible to apply very firm pressure on specific area, and really stimulate blood circulation, without hurting the skin.  The open design also makes it easy to wash, although it already tends to stay a lot cleaner than most.  Given my experience with so many different massaging devices, I know this one will give results because it is so pleasant to use and lets me continue to massage long after the product has sank into my skin.  I am very happy to recommend this really effective massage helper and the fact that it&#x27;s so pretty certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review purposes (and I&#x27;m so glad I accepted!)</li>
    <li> I love this item it really works its a good massager and it really works!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using almost a month and no improvement. Maybe it ll work for the others. Didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> Love! Use this every day.</li>
    <li> Use with lotion or over clothing. Starts to hurt a little after awhile on bare skin.</li>
    <li> Fast and easy transaction.  This is really cool in that the nobs move.  Glad I have rhis</li>
    <li> This brush is easy to use with or without lotion or cream. A contoured handle and rotating nubs allow for comfortable use.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for helping to stimulate circulation.  I use it during or after a shower, and you can really feel it doing its work.  Very nice quality, and easy to keep clean.  The handle is easy to use, as well, and keeps a secure grip.  It can be used practically anywhere for massage or circulation.</li>
    <li> I liked this at first. But then I went on vacation and left this in my shower. It had an odor when I came back. It took me a minute to find out where the odor was coming from which means I was smelling everything in the bathroom! The water gets trapped inside and then it becomes sitting yucky water. Why they have this tiny hole for the water to get in, I have no idea. The water doesn&#x27;t come out when you are using it so it is just a dumb design. So 1 star for a product that seems to work well at first.For the yucckyness, no stars!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, very easy to move around, easy to clean.  The size is perfect, just fit into the hand.  It does the work, really smooth out the knots and relax the muscles.</li>
    <li> small and good to use</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure a cellulite brush would actually work, so I did an internet search. I learned that this technique can help reduce cellulite, but...you must use it 5-10 minutes every day &amp; works best with proper diet &amp; exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush&#x27;s nubs/massage fingers are flexible &amp; rotate.  At first, I thought this brush was hard to hold.  Such a little handle...well...it didn&#x27;t take me long to realize that the handle is designed to be held between your pointer finger &amp; your middle finger which allows the brush to rest comfortably in the palm of your hand. Check out Amazon&#x27;s product photos for a close-up of the model holding the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for muscle massages too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to turn over a new leaf this year, recently joined a gym, etc. I&#x27;ve only been using this a short time, along with Equate Farewell Cellulite Cream sold at Walmart (really cheap, a little over $5 for a large tube!) It will take awhile to see results I&#x27;m sure, but for now it feels great, just not sure if it&#x27;s working yet. It&#x27;s a well-made brush, and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~sample provided for review~~~~</li>
    <li> Very good product, useful under the shower or with cream after, love the grip and the shape. Good material too, I think it´s good value for money. I´ve had mine for months now and it doesn´t look like it´s degrading at all. Some people were saying it´s cheap plastic, well, I disagree (even though it is plastic, but decent quality).</li>
    <li> Great product! I cannot comment yet on the disappearing cellulite yet.. I will update when I can... but this little thing feels SO good! I use it a few minutes in the shower or just over my yoga pants and it is wonderful! Very well designed and comfortable to use and hold! Very important if you are going to keep up with it. I am adding this product to my diet and exercise routine I am currently in. Looking forward to a wonderful summer! Added bonus: Feels great as a massage tool as well! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is the best massager brush I ever had. You can feel it. My blood circulation improved. I just started to use this brush, and it&#x27;s difficult to tell about cellulite. But I am sure, it will work.</li>
    <li> Too tiny and comes out of hand a lot but doesn&#x27;t hurt, WON&#x27;T cause bruises! Don&#x27;t understand reviewers who say that! Its gentle and maybe too gentle and soft. Only had for a week but using daily</li>
    <li> I think that I am going to really enjoy using this tool and the trial run was invigorating and quite easy to use. Hope to see some thigh improvements over time.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool I use in the shower. Very easy to hold and use. The nubs are nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got this. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Love this tool. Tried several others;this one is the best! Use with cel-lab!!</li>
    <li> I start using this product as soon as I received it with my Body Merry Cellulite Defense Gel-Cream.  It was only three days ago, but it feel good.</li>
    <li> Ladies I love this gadget! I also love that you can use it over your clothing! Just started using it for about a week so I can&#x27;t give a IT WORKS review but I will say it&#x27;s feels wayyyyy better then the brush, less abrasive and a great massage! I will check back in in a couple of weeks to let you know how much progress I&#x27;ve made...Wish me luck!!</li>
    <li> I love it! It works! And will def recommend it!</li>
    <li> Confortable and great product</li>
    <li> First off I have not noticed a reduction in cellulite as of yet, I have been using it for about a week or so. However it feels so nice as a massage.  The nodules move around and are not to firm I absolutely love this for the massaging effect that it gives. I would recommend this product just because it feels so nice when you use it, and it will be an added bonus when I see the cellulite start to go.</li>
    <li> Incredible results in less than two weeks!!! No diet, no exercise,  just massaged my thighs in circular motions with a seaweed lotion once and sometimes twice per day and all my cellulite is gone! At first it&#x27;s a bit painful but as the cellulite start dissappearing, no pain at all... I highly recommend this item ;-)</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels, I just need to stop pressing so hard.  I&#x27;m getting bruises. I suspect I don&#x27;t need to use so much pressure.</li>
    <li> Began using the massager 5 days ago and I can see a noticeable, slight improvement. I am using it along with a cream I purchased (Skinny Cream) and the combination seems to be helping... It&#x27;s still early, so I will continue to use it and post again once I have completely evaluated it. I am giving 5 stars because I&#x27;m happy with the quality of the product and because I am seeing some improvement.. Again, it&#x27;s still early in my use, so I&#x27;ll keep you posted with my results!</li>
    <li> Feels nice when using, but I&#x27;m not convinced that I&#x27;m seeing any actual improvement. I agree with some of the other reviewers...I like this best as a scalp massager!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd cellulite massager I&#x27;ve purchased in the past month.  I like this one a lot better than the first one I bought (different brand).  This one is smaller, fits in the palm of my hand, and the &#x27;nubs&#x27; grind into my thigh with a lot less effort than the other massager.  I think its working!  It feels good to circulate the skin on my thighs. My thighs always felt very &#x27;stagnant&#x27; because sit at a desk all day. Although I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks, I think I see a difference....  My thigh lumps look more broken up, smaller lumps rather than big ones.  Maybe they&#x27;ll disintegrate easier being broken up (?).  I will continue my routine and then update my review in a month or so.  I have also increased my water consumption and that helps a lot.  This massager is great - 5 stars!</li>
    <li> feels great- I don&#x27;t use it as consistently as I should-but i love it</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s really going to help with cellulite, I love this massager for after workout massages! I am a crossfitter and love using this on sore muscles after my workouts. It really helps with faster recovery and I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it. Love!!</li>
    <li> This is a good sturdy brush, but the handle is short.</li>
    <li> Does not work / help with cellulite</li>
    <li> I have been using this product in the shower on my legs. It has only been a week, but I feel that the appearance of my skin is ready smoother. Just what you need in shorts season!</li>
    <li> It feels nice with a dry/body oil. What everyone says is true you have to use it alot to see results.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Just as pictured. Handle is very easy to hold and maneuver. Happy with this purchase and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> is great, but the little massager sticks move, they are not fixed in the base of the massager. Is kind of cool because it makes it less rough. It all depends on if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll want or not.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and use.  Can use anytime, love the convenience and the little knobs move around with the motion. I love this unit but shipping took over 2 weeks so it was a bit of an inconvenience .</li>
    <li> I can not understand the other coments, the product looks cheap, feels cheap, you can find same options for 2 usd</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 3 weeks.  I have seen excellent results.  I also use Cellulite Reducing Soap bar with coffee and a cellulite cream, so I feel its the combination that is working.  I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
    <li> No great effects on cellulite. It came broken on one side but still usable.</li>
    <li> This Cellulite Massager, I have tested and found several thing that it can be used for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) For me, I use this in the shower for all over body use as I find because the device has moving roller tips, they massage my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I tried this as a scalp massager in the shower when I had a tension head and it helped (somewhat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more thing: This massager is kind of small so it did NOT hang up in my shower. I placed in onto a rack in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know that this massager is basically for cellulite, yet I did find other purposes for it.&lt;br /&gt;This review is based upon my personal opinion after using this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Provided for review purposes]</li>
    <li> This really works! No bruising.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, your skin gets better</li>
    <li> It is a little on the small side.  I&#x27;d like to have one that&#x27;s a bit larger.  Love and enjoy the design.</li>
    <li> Never in a million years would I have surmised that this little device could be so effective.  I have always been very fit, and as time has gone by, lunges and squats don&#x27;t seem to do it all anymore!  I use this for ten minutes before I shower in the morning, and I am thrilled!  Smooth legs are in your near future too - give it a shot!  Thank you for a simple solution :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent, for massage!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use it alone. Use in the bath with a moisturizing oil. That way it can slide smoothy on your skin.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to feel like they are doing something to make themselves looks better?  Although I&#x27;ve always been on the thin side, after two pregnancies, my body doesn&#x27;t look the same as it used to, including that I have cellulite on my legs.  I&#x27;ve been using it after I shower and it feels really nice as a massage on my legs.  I am also exercising and eating right to melt away the pregnancy weight gain.  And this massager does make me feel as though I&#x27;m doing something else to try to bring my legs back to the way they looked when I was in high school.  Its fingers are flexible and there is an &amp;#34;air cushion&amp;#34; which helps to be able to push enough pressure without it feeling badly.  It is easy to hold, even if your hands get full of lotion. The finger hold helps me not to lose my grip while massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if nothing else, it feels great as a back massager.  My husband and I have taken turns running it over each other&#x27;s backs.  And my toddler got such a kick out of giving mommy and daddy a back massage too!  My husband also loved the way it felt as a scalp massage!</li>
    <li> This is a very good massager, it is comfortable in your hand and is not only good for cellulite areas. It feels good on the bottom of your feet, or even as a light massage for your head to reduce tension.</li>
    <li> Excelent. It is posible to do a good massage.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt i used it with celullites cream i don&#x27;t have bruses it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Had a Issue with the product. The seller came to the table with great customer service, feel free to buy the item.  They walk their talk regarding the product and the return policy. Beyond that the massager is a great tool I have a neuro muscular disease and it truly helps the circulation in my legs.</li>
    <li> Kinda hurts to be honest. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to or not, but it feels really rough.</li>
    <li> I really like it. Now everyone have a great day!</li>
    <li> Not sure yet if there will be any results as I forget to use it</li>
    <li> The second time I used it the plastic edge holding the bristles in broke off and everything fell apart. The plastic was cheap and not well put together. I had high hopes with the reviews but didn&#x27;t get a real chance to use it... save your $.&lt;br /&gt;I had them replace with a new one and the first time I used it it broke again.</li>
    <li> I love the size and the fact that it fit in the palm of my hand! And it makes it that much easier to reach those are to get places!</li>
    <li> At first I was disappointed  the brush was going to be bigger in circumference but after using it I actually like the size it is.  It fits in your hand so comfortably that you can really apply slight pressure when moving in circles.  The fingers are firm and not as hard as it looks in the picture.  I hope to see great results!</li>
    <li> Nice and firm but slips from my grip a lot in the shower .... anyway it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> Ok but small if it was bigger would have been perfect</li>
    <li> The design of this is super nice, I couldn&#x27;t have picked a better one. I&#x27;ve been using it daily! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to do what they can to help themselves look or feel better?  I haven&#x27;t tried a cellulite massager before, but I really like this one.  The fingers are flexible, which allows them to &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; around when the massager is moved, the handle is nice, and it is sturdy and well made.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also discovered that these give great back rubs/massages too!  My husband and I have taken turns using this on each other&#x27;s backs and it feels wonderful.  :)</li>
    <li> Handle can be very slippery when wet if trying to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> my brush handle broke. I would love to receive a replacement, and hopefully it won&#x27;t break as I love how the brush works.</li>
    <li> I just received my brush. After few seconds of massaging, I can see my legs with tiny open capillaries (which will dissappear in minutes), I have tried different massages, but this is the best. It is obviously too soon to say i have results, but I will update my review!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use on person&#x27;s thighs, legs and arms, but it is not on stomache or abdominal area.</li>
    <li> Use it with Slim Extreme 3D Serum Cream and it works great. It&#x27;s the first burst of this kind i&#x27;ve ever purchased but really like it. It&#x27;s kind of small but bristles are moving and the base of the brush is soft and squishy so it does&#x27;t damage the skin</li>
    <li> I use this in the shower.  Needles rotate so it is comfortable for massage.  Handle could be more ergonomic or have better spacing so could hang from hook in shower.</li>
    <li> Like many others I was definitely a skeptic. I thought &amp;#34;how would a brush looking thing help with my cottage cheese ham hocks?&amp;#34;. I used it every other day in the shower with a seaweed bar soap to slide around my thighs for 2-5 mins each. It hurt. I got bruises. But those go away, cuz now blood is circulating right? After a couple days of uses I definitely saw the difference. Some areas may take more work than others. I continued in circles going the same direction and it&#x27;s working for me. Mind you, I have been exercising and improved my eating habits so that probably contributed as well. I can only speak for using it every other day but maybe some will get better results using it every day. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This massager brush fits easily into the palm of my hand and between the first and second fingers.  The bristles rotate and move, while still securely staying in the device.  I have a rather large scar that the dermatologist recommended that I massage frequently during the first year of healing, and this works perfectly for this.  I also use this on my sore, tense neck muscles and for some sensory stimulation on my sensory seeking son. Quality product.</li>
    <li> I am a skeptic at heart, and also a believer at heart. I was skeptical that this would do anything for the cellulite on the back of my legs, but I wanted to believe that it would. I decided to give it a try because I read a few different articles that said massaging your cellulite problem areas helps to alleviate the issue. Lo and behold, I have been amazed - this massager brush truly does work. The old adage, &amp;#34;You have to suffer to be beautiful&amp;#34;? It kind of applies here. This thing is not necessarily comfortable to scrub around in circles on your thighs. Don&#x27;t use it 5 minutes before you put on a bathing suit because you&#x27;ll have some red spots. But what I&#x27;ve started doing is using the ItWorks! defining gel along with the scrubber - mild discomfort issue solved. I can FINALLY wear shorts again without being totally self-conscious about the bumpiness of my thighs. So incredibly happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is very small .. it barely fits in my hand and doesn&#x27;t allow for a good grip. It&#x27;s hard to get a deep massage with it and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all. Also, it has a hole in it which allows water to get inside which is then impossible to get out. Would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Its good but expensive its too small!</li>
    <li> I have an older one of these and it held up well.  I needed an extra to keep in our RV.  Very sturdy, less expensive and just as effective as more expensive, larger massagers.  This is the perfect size for your hand, and though I have many different ones, this is one that gets used most.  You will need to wash it out now and then however, as cream will get inside of it through the moveable fingers.  Just rinse it well under water while pressing it in and out and then shaking the water inside for about 30 seconds.  That will quickly loosen any debris inside and then shake out the water into the sink.  Pretty easy.  I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love how this cellulite massager fits perfectly into my hand.  The actual ‘fingers’ (the bits that do the actual massaging) are nice and strong and they fit into a soft cushion type base which gives the massager its flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this cellulite massager with or without cream which is fantastic.  It’s so easy to use that it is now a part of my daily routine.  Good quality product!</li>
    <li> vary gentel and effective</li>
    <li> This is the first cellulite massager brush that I have tried simply because I did not believe that they really work.  After researching it a bit, I paired this brush with a cellulite cream I had also purchased.  I have been doing the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; every day for almost two weeks and I feel like I have seen a little improvement.  I will say that my arms get a little tired from constantly massaging the areas of cellulite, but it&#x27;s worth it to help get rid of it!  And thankfully the brush has a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I tried using this as a back massager and it feels wonderful!  I love that the little nobs have some wiggle room instead of just being stationary.  I was also told to try it as a scalp massager and that feels awesome as well!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!  Even if you don&#x27;t have any cellulite, just buy it as a massager!</li>
    <li> it really works if you use it.. cool item.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very comfortable &amp; easy to use.  I purchased 2 of them &amp; use it right before bed &amp; when I wake up in the morning.  I keep it by my bedside &amp; encourage myself to do something for me for 5min each day/night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made very well; sturdy, ergonomic, yet gentle on your skin when applying pressure.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great product. Works well in the shower with a little soap.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I like this little piece. You can use it at any moment you want: while watching a movie or reading a book, or talking to smb ))) It gives nice massage, not as deep as you expect, but very pretty good.</li>
    <li> This works well on breaking up what seemed to be solid belly fat so that it can hopefully dissolve and burn away quicker.  You can see red marks from the increased circulation, but the marks disappear quickly too. My wrist gets tired and tingly from prolonged use, so then I use it on my palm and wrist and arms and that takes care of the problem.  This is a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> I have been using massage brushes for many, many years so I was delighted to be offered this cellulite massager brush to review without cost. I find massage a great way of waking myself up and the improvements in circulation have been very beneficial to me. I am actively trying to lose weight so breaking down unsightly cellulite is something that concerns me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made, with its clear plastic and old gold colouration blending in to almost any bathroom decor. I particularly liked the way the plastic grip handle slots comfortably between fingers so that the slightly oval brush rests comfortably and securely in the palm of the hand. The 19 firm plastic &#x27;fingers&#x27; are set slightly loosely in a soft silicone pad so that they can move independently, each finger having a gently rounded end with no rough edges to damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I particularly liked about this product was the fact that there is enough space between the massage fingers to make it easy to clean if you use it in conjunction with a cellulite cream or lotion. I&#x27;ve had plastic brushes in the past that were tricky to clean, rapidly becoming unhygenic as a consequence and deteriorating through being soaked in bleach solutions. There should be no such problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with circulation problems should always seek medical advice before using products of this type of course. Personally I find this type of massage extremely beneficial and an aid to good circulation, should you find the product unsuitable a 30 day money back guarantee is offered. You have nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it feels good on my legs. it does help my cellulite. I like the rotating motions it has, the softness of the massager. I recommend this product to everyone that has cellulite.</li>
    <li> I have used it several times and like the way it massages. Found out the first time not to put much pressure as I bruised myself (too anxious to get rid of this crazy cellulite). I give it a 4 because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say much more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smooth, but I like another product better.</li>
    <li> I have been using various cellulite brushes for years and I recently received this one as a gift. (in a gift basket with a lot of spa stuff... no I don&#x27;t think someone was trying to be subtle... LOL!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that there are a few things that are really key with these brushes, they have to be sturdy and they have to have a good grip. Otherwise, the whole process won&#x27;t work. I am happy to say that this brush is good in both of these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to deeply massage the areas where fat has stored on your body to stimulate the natural \\&quot;drainage\\&quot; of fat. So you have to kind of dig in and massage it vigorously. I was able to do this and hopefully I will always be able to keep cellulite at bay.</li>
    <li> Very easy to hold and very effective, &amp;#34;If you use it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the size and ease of use of this cellulite massage brush. It fits perfectly in my grip to massage the gel in the appropriate places and the firmness is perfect for the job.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started using this massager, what a great product.  Very we&#x27;ll designed, easy to hold and comfortable to use. I feel sure that with continued use that the flexible nodes on this massager will help me win the battle against cellulite. I already feel the benefits this provides as I am able to get deep tissue penetration. Instructions direct to use daily for about 5 to 10 minutes. Works best in conjunction with diet and exercise. Suitable for use with anti-cellulite lotions. I personally like to use this device after being in the shower long enough for my skin to be warm.  There is a 30 day money back guarantee.  Recommend this product, think this would be useful to use even if you don&#x27;t have a cellulite concern.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d previously gotten rid of alot of my cellulite through Ionithermie treatments and two types of cellulite cream. But I hadn&#x27;t been able to get rid of the rest, despite having lost weight through diet and excercise. I started using this brush less than a week ago and I&#x27;m already seeing small but noticeable results. I&#x27;ve been using it with a massage oil but will switch to another cellulite cream if need be.</li>
    <li> feels great, I hope it works, I will repost in a few months</li>
    <li> I think this product is ok. It did leave some bruises on my thighs, but my skin is sensitive in that way. Def use a lotion/baby oil to massage your body. I can&#x27;t say that I saw any changes, but I didn&#x27;t use it every day either so...</li>
    <li> Well made. As all cellulite massage brushes, it hurts a little to use. This is not the product&#x27;s fault; it&#x27;s the sensitivity of muscle &amp; tissue.&lt;br /&gt;By far the best brush I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> It looks poorly made and I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is so special about this massager. This flimsy thing gets rid of cellulite?? Hmmmm.</li>
    <li> The best cellulite massager It is very sturdy and it consumes the cream on your body effectively.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Use it daily with a cream or without and will see the results! Easy to clean! Good quality!</li>
    <li> After looking into many different cellulite brushes, I decided on this one based upon the guaranteed return if I weren&#x27;t satisfied. I am very satisfied and have already noticed a difference after only using this a few times.  I bought 2 more for friends</li>
    <li> Nice and fits in the palm of my hand!  Not too hard either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product,  very strong when use using in my daily massage 100% recommend.</li>
    <li> This palm-sized cellulite massager has wiggly fingers that help the brush move along the surface of the skin.  It has a small handle on the back -- something I don&#x27;t use because it&#x27;s easier to fit it in my palm and hold onto it that way.  The base that holds the fingers is flexible, allowing it to move along a curved path.  But does it help cellulite?  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, but perhaps a younger body might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the massager works best on either recently moisturized skin that still has the sheen of oils or completely dry skin; otherwise, it sticks.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t help cellulite by breaking down the fibrous connections, it feels good as a massager.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two pregnancies and enough weight gain for all moms out there!! I got this product with the intention to use it to tackle my stubborn &amp;#34;mamma belly&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been dieting and exercising and it seemed as if the mamma belly was getting bigger as everything else was shrinking. My loving husband assured me that wasn&#x27;t the case, but either way the belly was NOT shrinking on it&#x27;s own. I started using this product exactly one week ago and I have noticed a HUGE difference in my mamma belly. I can tell that the fat in there is starting to break up and get softer. Before it was a more solid feeling fat. My weight has also started to drop more, I can&#x27;t say that it is solely because I started using this product, but I would recommend this product for all moms out there who have trouble with their stubborn belly fat! Oh and I used this with just regular cocoa butter lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd cellulite massager brush that I have owned. The biggest difference between the two of them is that this one has flexible brushes and I really like that. They \\&quot;wiggle\\&quot; whereas the other one that I owned the brushes were stationary. My other massager was a \\&quot;gift with purchase\\&quot; and seems to be cheaply made. This one is higher quality. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now, mainly on my thighs. It has become part of my evening routine. I use it with some body lotion &amp; it massages very well. I usually have to reapply lotion at least one more time during my massage. I have used it without lotion &amp; it does okay, it&#x27;s just better with the lotion. Plus, my skin is getting hydrated. The directions say you need to use it for 5-10 minutes for best results. To be honest, I usually stop after about 5 minutes because my arms get tired. Though I guess you can say that my arms are getting the benefit from the extra exercise! Sometimes I think I can see some improved firmness in my thighs and other times I&#x27;m not sure. I will definitely update my review after extended use.</li>
    <li> Admittedly, I am fortunate to somehow have avoided any cellulite deposits on my body. That being said, I am a sucker for any type of massage, so even if it&#x27;s attached to a specific purpose (cellulite massage), I&#x27;m game to try. This feels really good against my legs with the right amount of pressure. Even though I am not trying to break any deposits up, I really enjoy the feeling of improved circulation and just stimulation on a very active area of m y body. The brush itself is comfortable and easy to hold and maneuver, and the nubs of the brush are smooth and pleasant as well. I could see this possibly being even better if a lotion was to be applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also found that my young son thoroughly enjoys this as a back massager, so that&#x27;s another plus. This is an excellent product, it delivers what it advertises, and I would recommend to others for either it&#x27;s specific intention, or for a simple, effective stress-relieving massage for the tight areas of one&#x27;s body.</li>
    <li> This brush is very comfortable and easy to use.  It is the perfect size to fit in the palm of your hand.  A+ :)</li>
    <li> good quality, feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> Really like the massage I get from this &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;. Strong, durable, easy to use with or without massage cream. Easy to clean after use and just hang to dry. Grip on back is a nice bonus to make this easy to use, fits comfortably in the palm of my hand.</li>
    <li> This is the first massager brush I have ever owned and I really like it. It has a sturdy build that is hard on the back, but the bristles and core are softer and give while you&#x27;re using it.  I bought a cream along with it and I think it is helping. It feels good on my legs, and if nothing else it is helping me circulate your legs. It&#x27;s easy to clean and you can hang it by the handle on the back when not in use for easy storage.</li>
    <li> Great little tool.  I am 44 and have gone through a few hormonal changes, one being the appearance of cellulite.  It has only been a week but the massager has improved my circulation and the appearance of my skin has changed and is improving slowly.  Combined with exercise I think this could really help.</li>
    <li> I recently learned the advantages to deep tissue massage; it is important for blood and lymph circulation to aid the body in detoxifying...thus I was glad to have found this brush.  I can get a good grip on the brush which allows me to get to a deep level, and it feels good doing it.  I like the fingers, they move well and contour nicely.  I enjoy massaging in lavender oil so I really appreciate that the brush is washable.</li>
    <li> Not very effective and hard to hold on to while massaging skin.</li>
    <li> This cellulite massager is the best I&#x27;ve found! The individual tips actually move and roll along with the motion, I&#x27;ve seen great results so far, it&#x27;s been 2 weeks. I find the quality is very good. I read some of the comments about the handle breaking, if the handle breaks it would be from using too much pressure. I would highly recommend this massager.</li>
    <li> This thing works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a week and so far so good. I use it with cellulite cream. I&#x27;ll chime in again to report how it goes</li>
    <li> This item is awesome. I am quite impressed.</li>
    <li> This is a well made, effective cellulite massager. The wooden alternatives are nice but don&#x27;t hold up as well, and wood, ball bristles harbor bacteria. This brush doesn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Great massager FOR legs best use with coffee  soap and massage during shower time.</li>
    <li> Should have purchase the more sturdy bamboo ones.</li>
    <li> Great product. Got here fast.</li>
    <li> Just the right size in your hand and works great. Love how easy it is to clean.</li>
