<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My new favorite neutral. Glad I could find it online bc it&#x27;s no where in stores! Truly the best neutral out there!</li>
    <li> I was looking to try an nude and this color was perfect.  Nice nude color that goes on smoothly.  Totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect nude color polish forever and I finally found it with Essie topless and barefoot! It goes perfectly with tan brown skin color.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly like I imagined. It doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, and it&#x27;s not see translucent unless you have a bruise or something on that toe (I do, and you can lay a couple layers on to fix it).</li>
    <li> The polish shipped fast and I absolutely love the color ! It&#x27;s the perfect nude. I think it would suit everyone&#x27;s skin tone and it&#x27;s perfect for all year round.</li>
    <li> I ordered this little gem along with essie&#x27;s \\&quot;Nude Beach\\&quot; - can you tell I was going for a theme? ;) I got this to go under Nude Beach (although I sort of wish the names were reversed for these colors so that, when asked what color&#x27;s on my nails I could say \\&quot;It&#x27;s Topless and Barefoot on a Nude Beach\\&quot;). Anyway, the two colors were meant to go together. I would also wear this color alone for a nice, neutral, subtle, professional look.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this nail polish the first time I put it on, but now I love it! I can&#x27;t stop staring at my nails when I wear it &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my friend who couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally. She is obsessed with the color, it looks very nice. Shipping was very fast.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love. Not AS wonderful as \\&quot;Sand Tropez\\&quot; or a couple of years ago&#x27;s \\&quot;Pink Parka\\&quot;, but stunningly pretty nonetheless. Perfect for spring! Those who haven&#x27;t used Essie might need practice with application, as it applies differently than other brands (in my opinion). But once you get the hang of it (more paint on brush, several coats, watch easy streaking, top and botton coat necessary) you&#x27;ll probably stick with Essie. Color lasts long and shades are really unique &amp; often fashion-forward. Love this color. Highly recommend you try Sand Tropez too. It&#x27;s my new favorite... I might rock it all April!</li>
    <li> I love Essie polishes and this color doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is perfect for a nude nail but gives just the most beautiful color ont he nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect nude polish that wouldn&#x27;t show up so sheer, when I saw a swatch for it I knew I had to get my hands on it. Hands down, THEE best.</li>
    <li> Hi my name is Sara-&lt;br /&gt;I just got my Topless &amp; Barefoot, form the Essie spring Collection. all i got to say is ((((LOVE IT!))) only needed like two coats looks great on me with my pale olive Skin. can&#x27;t wait to see it on me when I get my tan going on.&lt;br /&gt;As long as Essie keeps making this topless &amp; barefoot nail polish I will keep ordering it. :) Amazons packing is really good with it. I got my nail polish faster then what they had guessed it would be</li>
    <li> This is a great nude color...even on my fair skin!&lt;br /&gt;Love the Essie polishes! They are chip resistant and I only apply two coats!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is a pink with beige tones to it. Looks good all times of the year. Very neutral.</li>
    <li> Not the color I expected (looks darker in the pic) but I do like it.  I am big fan of Essie nail polish but this bottle was horrible.  I don&#x27;t know if it was sitting on their shelf for a long time or if they watered it down, but I have never had such a hard time applying nail polish.  Throwing it out.  I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying nail polish online!</li>
    <li> Amazing color all year round! I&#x27;m constantly getting complimented on my nails with this color.</li>
    <li> Perfect nude color. I was a little leery to purchase this at first but to my surprise the application was smooth unlike my mint candle apple one. This is my favorite nude polish. Looks great on nails.</li>
    <li> I love Essie. And I love this color.. I would definely suggest it. I change my color every two weeks and try not to repeat, buuuuttt I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll be going back to this soon :) It&#x27;s the perfect nude!</li>
    <li> I ordered this polish after getting a manicure in it at the salon, so I knew what the color was going to be (perfect). It&#x27;s an opaque, peachy-pink nude. Three coats makes it completely matte. And it came in the mail early. Props!</li>
    <li> great,clean and polished looking color, makes me not want to paint my nails a vibrant color again! i have received so many compliments on it....need to buy another bottle!</li>
    <li> This color is the perfect neutral shade to wear for all occasions.  I highly recommend this nude shade by Essie!</li>
    <li> not what I expected. Product is very runny and no matter how many or how few layers I put on - it looks streaky and chalky. tried different undercoats as well, nothing helped. disappointed, waste of money.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, great color, and good quality nail polish.  I will be buying more from this seller.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this Essie nail polish shade. It is a natural shade that works well with the modern short cut...for all those women who spend a good part of their day at a keyboard.</li>
    <li> Essie is a good brand of nail polish, but I thought I was getting a sort of nude color. It turned out to be quite a shade of light pink - not what I expected or wanted.</li>
    <li> My new favorite nail polish ever. Kinda of beige natural color, very pretty especially with a dark tan! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know what the hype is surrounding essie nail polish! The polish is so bad to apply! It streaks, doesn&#x27;t dry quick and smudges. To top it off it chips VERY easy. The color is pretty, but i think i will stick to OPI. They have the same colors but theres are smoother to apply and have better brushes and chip proof for longer than these...</li>
    <li> It has taken me several months to find this polish! It is my absolute favorite!!!! I should have ordered 10!</li>
    <li> I was anticipating something a hair darker...but I really like this too. I&#x27;m sure that I will just buy another!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love topless and barefoot nail polish! THis is such a classy color and great for daytime or night time!</li>
    <li> I love the color it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! And the shipping was fast :) I will most likely buy it again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this color it&#x27;s a beautiful nude with a hint of pink to it.  I did have to put 3 coats on it because it was streaky but I&#x27;m not sure if its my application or just the polish itself.  I&#x27;ve only used it once so far so ill have to see next time how well it goes on.</li>
    <li> I have an olive skin and was worried that it would just blend right in, but it looks so nice.  I have short nails and work with my hands a lot out in front of people and I get so many compliments.  It&#x27;s truly a beautiful color for a girl who doesn&#x27;t feel like wearing reds all the time.</li>
    <li> Although I had received this a couple a weeks ago I used this last week for the first time.  I applied it to my toes and I must say I love it.  At first I thought it was going to be to light.  But it was perfect.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear it the summer!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m more of a loud color person, so for some this color would be a great product, but for me it was a boring color.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a pink to it but looks very neutral, I just love it. I was worried that it was part of the 2011 collection but the quality of the polish was excellent.</li>
    <li> Its a really nice bare nude type of color that I highly recommend if that&#x27;s the color your looking for. These are great nail polishes.</li>
    <li> The color is my absolute favorite now!  I love how simple, yet elegant it is.  I can wear this color year round.</li>
    <li> I get compliments on the color all of the time and bought based on all of the hype about Essie on Pinterest.  The color is great, but I will say that I agree that it doesn&#x27;t apply the same way all of the time.  It is often streaky and takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
    <li> Although I love the color of this polish, it is the worst quality I have ever used. I searched high and low after seeing this color on Pinterest, and since it was from 2011 it is not being sold in stores. I was so excited to find it online. However, the consistency of the polish is very runny at first, and once it makes contact with your nails it becomes gummy and cakey. Unfortunately, it takes an extremely long time to dry as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received lots of compliment on it. It&#x27;s pretty mild but still very classy. It reminds me of something that Olivia Pope would wear. :)</li>
    <li> I seen this color on Pinterest and fell in love I got t way cheaper then on the Essie website! I&#x27;m very happy oh and did I mention it came 3 days earlier then predicted?!</li>
    <li> I find that ordering nail polish online can be questionable.  Sometimes based on your computer, you will not be able to determine the real color.  This is a great nude color that will look great even if it chips just a bit! I liked it so much, I ordered one for my mom!</li>
    <li> This has quickly become a favorite nude of mine.  Essie polishes are good quality, long lasting and are well priced here on Amazon.  I would recommend this to anyone, I think it would complement many skin tones!</li>
    <li> Perfect nude shade for all year round. I get compliments often while wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color! I am a huge fan of neutral color schemes and this was right up my alley. Looks gorgeous with fair skin. It&#x27;s not as dark as the picture but I still am very happy with my purchase, especially for the price!</li>
    <li> Absolutely beautiful, subtle color.  It takes everyday wear &amp; tear without a top coat needed.  I would definitely recommend Essie nail polish to anybody.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon for $5 with free shipping, compared to $8 &amp; up in stores.  However, no matter where you purchase it, it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a very neutral color, and I am very pale, but it still looks nice.  I love Essie products.  I think they provide a good product in fabulous colors.  So all I can really review is this shade, Topless and Barefoot.  Even though it is pale, it is a richly pigmented polish and only took two coats for great coverage (that&#x27;s more than I can say for Bikini so Teeny which takes 3!)</li>
    <li> I love this color!! It goes with everything and is so classy. I accidentally ordered two and am happy I did because now I have extra! The price was just right as well, cheaper than getting it at drug stores.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this nail polish until I put it on.  It is a pretty nude color - very light. And if that&#x27;s what you want, then this product is great. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered quickly.  I love, love, love this color.  The perfect nude color polish.  I bought two just to make sure I wouldn&#x27;t run out anytime soon because I knew I would be using it on my nails all the time!</li>
    <li> When I Googled the swatch for this color I was a little worried. It came out weird an too muddy of a taupe color. But I went ahead an ordered it because I liked the description Essie described this shade to me. And I was super pleased I went with my gut on this. I love it!!!! Perfect pinky/nude color I have been searching for. It&#x27;s a nude/pinky/slight taupe color. It&#x27;s just perfection don&#x27;t go off the swatches on google. This color is what it is described to be by Essie.</li>
    <li> Great, simple, clean, color.  Good for all skin types.  Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I got this for a party and thought it was so cute. I wore it at night, but it still looked really cute. Its a purplish grey.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m active duty and this color is perfect for feeling girly and still being in regs!</li>
    <li> Essie nail polishes are my fave! They always last a really long time without having to use gel. I do use a base and top coat and my nails last at least one week with no chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like neutral shades for everyday looks.</li>
    <li> I thought this color would have a little more sparkle to it like the polish in the picture. I still like the color and I will still use it but there is no sparkle to it. It is a nude color with a pinkish tint.</li>
    <li> I love this polish. Usually I hate polish from Essie &amp; their brushes are too skinny. This nude was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t streak, &amp; I only used two coats. Beautiful. So far I&#x27;m on day 2/3 &amp; no chipping has occured. This is a must buy. \\&quot;)</li>
    <li> I received compliments on this color when i wore it - i had seen it on pinterest and loved it!</li>
    <li> This is by far the  best nude nail polish i own. Its a beautiful neutral color that flatters all skin tones. I doesnt have that negative beige undertone to it like most others do...it has more creamy pink tone to it. A real flesh color... awesome.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect nude for my fair skin tone! Make sure to use thin coats otherwise it will end up looking terrible.</li>
    <li> Great color.  Perfect nude shade!</li>
    <li> This color is the best nude color I have ever used on my nails. the shine is great! does not chip as fast as other colors i have used! love it !!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t show chips so I get more days out of it before I have to touch up again. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The color was a nice nude, but it was kind of streaky and watery. If you used 3 coats you might be able to even it out and make it look good.</li>
    <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not really look like the color in the picture&lt;br /&gt;- Not as deep a color as anticipated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- The actual color is really nice&lt;br /&gt;- Lovely blend of pink/nude.</li>
    <li> Works well. Nice shade. Essie is always a good brand. Nothing to rave about, but it did the job. Shade was a little different than what it looks on the picture.</li>
