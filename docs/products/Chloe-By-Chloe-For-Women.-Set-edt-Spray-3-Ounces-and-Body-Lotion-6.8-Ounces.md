<li> The new Chole doesnt smell the same.</li>
<li> My experience with Amazon in the past has been great, but this left a bit of a bad taste.</li>
<li> Either it sat in an overheated warehouse for a long, long time or this is a knock off.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t lady long on my skin.</li>
<li> We ordered this set and it&#x27;s not right.</li>
<li> This is dark - like iced tea.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s half the price of department stores and those boutique stores you find in the Mall.</li>
<li> I made a mistake and ordered the wrong Chloe scent as a Christmas present for my daughter--</li>
<li> Chloe is very pale color - about the color of ginger ale.</li>
<li> I will be sad when i can no longer purchase.</li>
<li> It came just as described and it was in a sealed box and package, no signs of anything wrong.</li>
<li> Too bad it was discontinued in the stores.</li>
<li> So disappointed.</li>

    <li> One of my Mom&#x27;s favorite. Great deal</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, great for everyday and does not over power. Soft floral, wonderful and smells great on young and old alike.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy.  I thought that this item may not be the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; but it was perfect. I received it in a couple of days. I highly recommend this product and Amazon!</li>
    <li> I sent it to my niece, Chloe, for her birthday and she loved it! It was the perfect gift and the scent is really nice.</li>
    <li> I have worn Chole since high school and always get compliments. I will be sad when i can no longer purchase. The new Chole doesnt smell the same.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake and ordered the wrong Chloe scent as a Christmas present for my daughter--I guess she wanted the latest Chloe perfume and I neglected to clarify.  Anyway...Amazon is generally great about accepting returns, but when I tried to return this item I learned it was classified as a \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot; and because of that it was not returnable.  I ordered a whole bunch of stuff at the same time that I ordered the perfume, but I honestly don&#x27;t remember any kind of a warning or notice alerting me that this item couldn&#x27;t be returned.  If there was one, then I missed it and I am certainly at fault.      My experience with Amazon in the past has been great, but this left a bit of a bad taste.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my mom last Christmas and she loved it. It&#x27;s half the price of department stores and those boutique stores you find in the Mall.</li>
    <li> Easy to order and receive. Exactly what I wanted. It&#x27; s a fragrance that for me has been a standby classic!!</li>
    <li> My favorite..... Not too loud.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t lady long on my skin. Maybe one hour. Booo!</li>
    <li> Great value product. It came just as described and it was in a sealed box and package, no signs of anything wrong. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> My wife has used Chloe for Women for years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  I have bought her a lot for different occasions but have always paid a lot more for it than I did on amazon.com.  Thank you amazon.com</li>
    <li> grateful for sale thanks.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to do more business with your clothes and other things that might interest me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally send in reviews but I&#x27;ve been wearing Chloe for 30 years, it&#x27;s been a staple fragrance of mine. Not sure if this is an authentic fragrance, or if they have changed their formula but Immediately after applying, you can&#x27;t even smell it!!! So disappointed. Will never purchase perfume online again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn the Chloe fragrance for several years, mainly because I get so many compliments from other people about how good it smells and they always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. The spray and body lotion combination are a great deal when purchased together. Occasionally I&#x27;ll venture off and try another fragrance, but I always come back to Chloe. It&#x27;s my favorite!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite scents at a great price</li>
    <li> Great buy and experience!  Arrived promptly as well for the holidays.  Also, it&#x27;s the best price for this gift set I was able to find online!</li>
    <li> I bought  this for my grandma , because she loves Chloe ,  me personally I am not a fan of Chloe but it wasn&#x27;t for  me it was a gift for my grandma , and she&#x27;s happy with it :) .</li>
    <li> My wife has enjoyed using Chloe for years. We ordered this set and it&#x27;s not right. Chloe is very pale color - about the color of ginger ale. This is dark - like iced tea. The fragrance is definitely NOT Chloe, way too strong and metallic. Either it sat in an overheated warehouse for a long, long time or this is a knock off. NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome scent, better price</li>
    <li> I love this product ... When I was working even by the end of the day someone would come up ot me and ask what I was wearing.  Most often, men complimented me on the fragrance.  Too bad it was discontinued in the stores.</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter loves Chloe perfume; the aroma it delivers once mixed with her body chemistry. I&#x27;m happy&lt;br /&gt;she&#x27;s enjoying. Thanks</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Thank yoi</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.  If this is your scent, this is the way to buy it!</li>
