      <li>It really does work!!!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this product.</li>
      <li>Feels good on my face, but as with most of these products, they need to be used daily and their results take time to be evident.  </li>
      <li>When I am close to finishing this tube, I will certainly purchase more.</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>Once off my face did appear firmer however when looking at my pores they were still full.</li>
      <li>Some may feel it is pricey, but I assure you, you will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>ONE problem was the application is is sticky but worth it.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t think my skin can handle that kind of abuse too long.</li>
      <li>very very very bad,,hard</li>
      <li>SO VERY MUCH.  </li>

      <li>I looked at the Beau Visage reviews, although there were not as many reviewws, almost all of the reviews were from verified purchasers - people whom actually baught and tried the product.</li>
      <li>I have used this facelift in a bottle for many years under a different product name.  </li>
      <li>I tried it various ways, using just a little dab and then using more and using more water to make it not so glue-like.  </li>
      <li>I chose 5 stars because this really does work.</li>
      <li>FINALLY A REAL ANTI-AGING PRODUCT THAT WORKS.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this. It makes my skin feel wonderful and bright! I use as often aas I can. I have extremely sensitive skin and this entire line is the only thing I use, everything else turns my face bright red and stings. Highly recommended for anyone.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do enough to justify the cost.  I would not buy it again.  Go back to the lab and try again.</li>
    <li> It really works well!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product too.  Worked from the first use.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.  THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.  FINALLY A REAL ANTI-AGING PRODUCT THAT WORKS.</li>
    <li> i like it. it feels good, i use it once a week. makes my skin feel good and soft. i would buy it again</li>
    <li> I found this product to be very easy to use, and quite nice.  Indeed, a choice product for the price.  Highly recommended.  DAME HILDA</li>
    <li> This product is like putting glue on your face.  It is awful.</li>
    <li> Back to nerium oleander leaf: it&#x27;s poisonous and potentially fatal if consumed orally, which isn&#x27;t how this product should be used but using any plant on your face with that kind of toxic profile should give you pause. Specific to topical use, there is no published, substantiated research proving this plant extract has any special or unique properties for aging skin, uneven skin tone, or large pores. There was one animal study showing oleander&#x27;s anti-inflammatory benefit, but lots of plants offer this benefit without the risks involved with oleander. Other research has shown is that nerium oleander leaf is a potent insecticide and it interrupts the cellular process known as mitosis, a process of cellular division that affects the body&#x27;s chromosomes. None of this is appealing when we&#x27;re talking skin</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of the reviews, I really wanted it to work and hoped that it did.  I tried it various ways, using just a little dab and then using more and using more water to make it not so glue-like.  I just didn&#x27;t feel that it tightened my skin and I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see that if there were any results to be had, I would have seen them by now.  I&#x27;m sure that it works for some people but it just did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many face lift products and none has worked as great as this one.  I even went through chemical peel and used a face lift anti aging mask, but did not see the results that I have experienced with this product.  I am fifty-six years old and this is the number one product for amazing non-surgical face lift results!  I highly recommend Beau Visage.</li>
    <li> Great products wonder scents! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This product may be fine if you have few or no wrinkles. Like most antiaging products, if you are a firm faced 20 year old you can probably use this product and feel you get your money worth. As a woman with a few more years on her, all this product does is make your face look like a prune when it is being used.  I used it about three times and left it on the required time. It will empathize what ever wrinkles you have.</li>
    <li> It is very thick and sticky to apply. Honestly I prefer my home made mask that works just as well . Will not reorder</li>
    <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago...and was apprehensive to use it to be truthful. I chose to use the product this past weekend because I was going to a girlfriend&#x27;s birthday party. I put it on as directed according to the info sent to my email address upon purchasing. I am 56 years young (lol). I got such positive feed back on the way I looked. My skin looked refreshed and my skin was indeed tighter. It really does work!!! When I am close to finishing this tube, I will certainly purchase more.</li>
    <li> I have only used it for a couple days. But I love it already. It makes my skin feel tighter and smoother. And it seems like it has a healthier glow to it. I&#x27;ll update the review after a month as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great product to add to your facial regimen. I have very sensitive skin, and a lot of things make me break out. But this didn&#x27;t irritate it all. Great product, and will buy again! 5+ Stars!</li>
    <li> I have used this facelift in a bottle for many years under a different product name.  I have always liked it.  It evens out skin tone, firms and tones your skin.  I highly recommend this mask. You can use it on your hands and any other area of your body that needs a more youthful appearance.  Use it at least twice a week for three months and then for maintenance... I forgot!  The effects are cumulative so the more you use it, the better your results.</li>
    <li> I took a before and after picture to see if I could tell the difference because of the expense.  There was a definite change - the wrinkles were much lighter around my mouth and the creases at my cheeks. the skin was firmer. There was a little difference in the firmness of the skin at my jawline.  I showed the pics to family and they were surprised and wanted the name of the product.  I&#x27;m 53 with average wrinkles.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing.it&#x27;s not just for the one but us guys can use it to.I would definitely recommend this product to all my friends</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time. It dries like a hard mask on your face. I mean really hard. Afterwards your skin feels so nice and smoothe and appears much smoother. I cannot say how it will look after a day or two but it sure is refreshing.</li>
    <li> It was a nice mask, no big deal and definitely not Age Reversing. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money I spent on it. I will use it, but I won&#x27;t consider it the best I ever had.</li>
    <li> I love this mask!  I only use it a few times a month but it leaves my skin soft and firmer.  I have seen comments saying that this product is too thick to put on smoothly.  I actually ad a small amount of water on my face and in my hands when applying this.  it goes on beautifully and does not get sticky.</li>
    <li> Works best with damp face and wet fingers. Make sure you pull in the direction to minimize wrinkles or you might make them worse! Do this where no one can talk to you so you don&#x27;t crack up your face before you take it off!</li>
    <li> don t see any improvement in skin condition&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;spent all that money&lt;br /&gt;and for what&lt;br /&gt;does not work&lt;br /&gt;as far as I am concerned</li>
    <li> After 2 uses (every other day for 90 days then once a week after per the instructions that I never got it my box) I am wow&#x27;d. I will post past again periodically as I know there are thousands of us that just wanna know what works an what doesnt. So far.....Im impressed</li>
    <li> did nothing hard to get on, like glue.  very hard to remove.  my face had no changes</li>
    <li> This masque really works!  I&#x27;ve recommended it to a number of friends.  It tightens pores and lifts the skin. You need to moisten your fingers to spread it evenly over your face--it feels like glue but the results are great.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably overpriced and literally didn&#x27;t do a thing.  That about covers it.  A total waste of money.  I&#x27;ve used products a quarter of the price that performed better.</li>
    <li> I could write a book about Beau Visage Face Lift Mask.  I tried this product some years ago that i purchased at a local health store and i loved it.  It smoothed and lifted my face, like i had a face lift. I just loved, loved it!! I used the product for about a year and for some reason the store discontinued the product.  So, i tried another product in the store in its place.  I used it for a while, but there was no comparison. I finally just quit using that product.  It was \\&quot;junk\\&quot; by comparison.  I wanted to try and find the Beau Visage but could not remember the name but remembered the bottle. I was devastated. Low and behold, three years later, i was on Amazon searching around for face products and... there it was!! It was like i found a \\&quot;buried treasure\\&quot;.  I recognized the bottle and ordered it instantly.  Needless to say that was one of the happiest days in my life. To anyone who would dare try this product, i guarantee you WILL be not only satisfied, but pleased!!</li>
    <li> Works Great you can see the difference after using. Must use everyday.</li>
    <li> I used this product many years ago and loved it.  Then apparently the company changed hands and I could not locate it. A friend did some research and found it for me.</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter and I both love it  Makes a nice stocking stuffer too.</li>
    <li> After I applied this, my girlfriend stopped by and during our visit she said - you look really good, what did you do?</li>
    <li> I like this product and the way it makes my face soft after use.  it also gives my skin a little glow. JS</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work! Follow directions and wet your face before applying! My face is left so firm and soft, it&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m only 38 with a few fine wrinkles so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for more deeper ones, it&#x27;s worth the price if you want a more flawless look!!</li>
    <li> I chose 5 stars because this really does work. I was hesitant about trying at first, but decided to give it a go. I made sure to follow the directions to a T, and was well satisfied. I think it does best around the eyes and mouth. I did not see much as far as lifting up the neck, but my skin does feel smoother and shows less wrinkles. I think possibly the neck may take more time ; with gravity and all. I have a Red Hat lunch coming up and can&#x27;t wait to show off my &amp;#34;new face.&amp;#34; I think this should work best for those looking to smooth wrinkles and all. Time will tell if it can actually lift up the lose skin under my neck. I am more than satisfied by what it has done sofar though. This was a quite a good purchase i feel.</li>
    <li> My Aunt asked me to get this for her, since she is not very good on the computer. I looked online and I was happy when I saw Amazon had it. I&#x27;m no expert on facelifting creams, but my Aunt swears by this. It&#x27;s been a few weeks since I saw her, and what a difference. I thought it was all hype, but even I could see the difference. No wonder so many people love this company sand their products.</li>
    <li> This is amazing product face is tighted afer 6 mins but I leave it on 1 min more for results. ONE problem was the application is is sticky but worth it.USE it and apply it upward for best results.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this product. Received it quickly enough.  I hate how difficult it is to put it on. It pulls my skin and does not smooth on as expected. Finally I began leaving my fresh washed face slightly damp rather than dry as the product said. That helped some. It also feels like plaster on my face and takes a bit to remove it which is frustrating. Once off my face did appear firmer however when looking at my pores they were still full. I had hoped that it would draw stuff out better. 3 stars because it did appear to fade wrinkles some and my face did appear firmer. I follow with toner and yes again the cotton ball was slightly dirty. Probably from leftover mask. Would love to have it smooth on easier and come off easier. It also dried my face</li>
    <li> This was about the worst thing I have ever used on my skin . It was thick, and it felt just like a really dense glue. It even smelled like glue. (And we all know where glue comes from). I&#x27;m telling you, I used it one time and was horrified. To make things worse it was  incredibly hard to remove. It got hard fast, and was. Just awful, it did nothing for me September make my skin look worse. I would Not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> It works great if you can stand the feeling! It feels like you are putting Elmer&#x27;s glue on your face. It is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. I noticed a difference after only using it three days. My skin went from tissue paper to printer paper almost immediately. I am 62 years old and I have finally found my face/neck product.</li>
    <li> How can anyone tell this soon how well a skin product will work?  It absorbs well.  That&#x27;s all I can determine at this time.  I have only had the product for 1 wk.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1CZJ2M7OH6DXW]]</li>
    <li> I live by it .I love it</li>
    <li> Feels like and smells like Elmers glue on your face... did not notice a thing.</li>
    <li> May work for some, just not for me. There was no difference one way or another. Go to the doc if you want to see dramatic changes</li>
    <li> Was very disappointed, Only used one time, made my face break out, will continue to search for a better product.</li>
    <li> I have about every skin care product ever made. BUT NOTHING I HAVE EVER PURCHASED has worked like this! I rode horses all my life-no sunscreen etc...I am 59-wrinkles and saggy skin. From first time I used it BIG BIG BIG MAJOR BIG difference in just ONE use! SOLD ON THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;follow up-month later-My Neck is tighter than ever- face major difference-Sold on this product. I put bottle in warm water (softens product) then wet face/hands and it looses it&#x27;s glue like feeling as some one posted) glides on-Does it job!</li>
    <li> Feels good on my face, but as with most of these products, they need to be used daily and their results take time to be evident.  So time will tell.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, and was as described.</li>
    <li> Great product that moisturized and softened quite well.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference at all with this and it&#x27;s very sticky to put on, just another gimmick to get your money.</li>
    <li> The tightness this product has leaves your skin. Feeling young again.i need to look at other products sold under this brand.</li>
    <li> More hype than results don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> very very very bad,,hard and nothing happened to my skin&lt;br /&gt;i throw it, dont waste your money, i swear it is  very bad</li>
    <li> This is the facelift mask review that almost didn&#x27;t get written. I got caught up in reading the reviews about another product I found on Amazon.That was the same product my neighbor was selling as part of some pyramid scheme thing. Fortunately for me, my Son saved me by pointing out that most of the raving reviews were not from Amazon Verified customers. He explained that those people who were raving about the other product were probably part of the pyramid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I looked at the Beau Visage reviews, although there were not as many reviewws, almost all of the reviews were from verified purchasers - people whom actually baught and tried the product. What impressed me was the way the company addressed even the most negative reviews. (Customer service is really important to me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also looked at the manufacturers reviews on Amazon. I thought I would just find shipping reviews, but there were product reviews also. My son said that the only way someone could post a review on that review area was if the reviewer actually order the product. So, I felt like I was dealing with a good company and felt much better about my chances if everything didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I tried this mask. I saw someone say their face tightened like a drum. That&#x27;s a pretty good way of explaining. After the first facial, I immediately saw results. I don&#x27;t think anyone will mistake it for a knife and needles facelift yet, but I counting on the results getting even better. I recommend this facelift mask highly!</li>
    <li> I think is good. , I try and buy more, ...</li>
    <li> The product seems OK. Nothing special. Didn&#x27;t really cone with instructions on how often to use it. I have been doing every other day.</li>
    <li> I think I may have wasted my money.  I use this on the legs more than my face and hands.</li>
    <li> I saw immediate firming and lifting after washing it off, but these results only lasted a few minutes. Also, the mask was  extremely hard to get off, and took about 30 minutes to remove it. I actually made a puncture wound on my skin trying to get it off!  Don&#x27;t think my skin can handle that kind of abuse too long.</li>
    <li> gooey stuff. feels best to get it OFF- no noticable results. I wont buy it again but never hurts to try</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. After only three days I felt my skin texture transform from tissue paper to copy paper. It feels much denser and firmer. I am 62 years old and if my skin can get such immediate results anyone&#x27;s can. I use the mask, cleanser, toner and moisturizer. I highly reccommend this product. Some may feel it is pricey, but I assure you, you will get your money&#x27;s worth. In fact I feel it will save me money. Try it, you have nothing to loose but signs of aging. My name is Bernadine Dunaway and I am not getting paid to say this. I only review products I truly beleive in and am very satisified with. NOBODY can pay me to say something they want you to hear.</li>
