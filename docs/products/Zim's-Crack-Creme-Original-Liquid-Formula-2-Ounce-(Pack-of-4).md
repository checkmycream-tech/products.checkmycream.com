<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT all natural healing product.  This is NOT a cream, but rather a spray liquid.  Just spray at night and go to bed....best way as it gives it time to soak in.  Lasts a long time as you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
    <li> It has some smell to it, not bad. This is the only one that works for my heels.</li>
    <li> If you suffer with cracked heels, fingers or skin anywhere, this stuff is for you.  It works wonders and is easy to use.  Only issue I have is that once I spray it on, whatever I step on next ends up with a sticky mark.  I solve that by putting down an old towel for the first couple of steps.  I&#x27;ve recommended and purchased this produce for several friends.  It&#x27;s easy to recommend because it works.</li>
    <li> Looking for a great dry skin remedy? This is it!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is easy to use and it works instantly.  I have trouble with my cuticles splitting and bleeding from being so dry and during the winter time my hands are so dry and they won&#x27;t absorb anything.  NOTHING else works for me and I have tried everything from shea butter to petroleum jelly. Plus I put this on my elbows and they are always soft.  I use this on my feet and knees,too amazing stuff! All-in-one product thank you to the inventor, who happens to be a pharmacist!</li>
    <li> Smells funny, works great on the feet, put socks on, cracks heal quick.</li>
    <li> I have chronic and lifelong dry hands from restaurant cooking for 24 years. Without Zim&#x27;s, I can&#x27;t even separate two sheets of paper, no oil in my hands. Zim&#x27;s is the ONLY thing that works for me. I cannot live without it. Your new bottle design is very nice but the new sprayer is EXCELLENT. The previous type sprayer I think wasted a lot of the precious liquid by having a very wide spray zone. This sprayer shoots out a thin stream much more efficiently. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I started using this stuff about 10 years ago when I lived in Arizona. My feet were bleeding from the dry heat. I tried everything, including a podiatrist. I felt like I had the feet of a homeless person, and it made me cry :(  A fellow nurse recommended this stuff and I never looked back! Use a pumice ,and this stuff after a shower ,and at bedtime. It really works. It used to be readily available at Albertson&#x27;s and Walgreens, but not recently. The Amazon price is also cheaper than in the stores. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the smell. Don&#x27;t care for it. Don&#x27;t bother with the creams, made by the same company. Only the oil works. If they stop making this stuff, I don&#x27;t know what I will do!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get this at the local Wal Mart or Walgreens anymore. This stuff really works on those weather cracks. I also keep some at work and when I get a paper cut, it stings, but it helps heal.</li>
    <li> Zims liquid is very convenient and contains arnica oil; however, it did little to prevent the winter splits and cracks on my fingers this year. The cream may work better, judging by a sample size application.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever found that can clear up cracked heels in one week (with daily use). I also use it in the winter to keep my hands from cracking (I&#x27;m a nurse; lots of handwashing and it really dries them out).&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product about 10 years ago &amp; wish it had been around when I was a young child.  I have a rare skin condition and have always had problems with my feet cracking when I walk.  Since I&#x27;ve started using this product it hasn&#x27;t happened!!  It&#x27;s something I try never to run out of!</li>
    <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering about the all-natural ingrediants, here&#x27;s the list from the packaging: Glycerine, SD alchohol 3-C, de-ionized water, arnica extract and myrcia oil. I have 2 packages of this version of Zim&#x27;s in front of me, one has a daisy on the box instead of a picture of the bottle, and the other looks the same as shown. I believe the daisy one is older, but the ingrediants are the same. I found both at my local CVS drugstore, but it is important to note that they were NOT located with the hand lotions or body lotions. Instead, they were across the store on the shelf with the poison ivy cures, and anti-fungals like Lamasil. Strange place to put it, no wonder it&#x27;s not more well-known. The Crackcreme website says it can also be found at Rite-Aid, K-Mart, Albertson&#x27;s Grocery, Fred Meyer and a long list of other stores (but not Walgreens), so you might want to check the list of US and Canadian locations. (Interestingly, it shows available Canadian Wal-marts, but American Wal-Marts are on the list). The 2.4 oz spray bottle is easy to use on feet as well as hands. The name is Crack Creme, but in the spray-bottle form, it&#x27;s more of a *liquid* than a creme, with a texture somewhere between water and baby oil. Note that because it is liquid, it can run and drip (it&#x27;s a spray, not a mist), so be especially quick to rub your feet together if you use it on your feet. The wetness seems to evaporate in a minute or two, so really it is not greasy like baby oil is. Using the product at least twice a day seems to work best for me. I use it on the inner sides and balls of my feet, and on the side of my index finger, which can get a bit rough from writing with a pen all day. The box says use it on your cuticles, elbows and knees, as well as hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;Believe everyone&#x27;s reviews, get some, and give it a week of twice-a-day application. You&#x27;ll feel a difference.</li>
    <li> Great product, not greasy...</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the fact that every single one of the 4 of these is leaking through the box.  They were supposed to be a gift and now I have to return them and start over.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this creme it was by mistake.  Had to be one of my best mistakes.  Everytime I recommend it to someone they can&#x27;t believe how great it works in such little time.  My friends say I should be in sales for Zims or on the Board of Directors.  It&#x27;s herbal which makes it twice as appealing.  LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Really did the trick healing my hands</li>
    <li> Treats very dry cracked skin on hands, heals, etc.  Very, very fast and lasting relief at least for members of my family.</li>
    <li> Purchased on a total whim!  I HAD rough scaly toes and feet, plus completely cracked heels. Did monthly pedis myselt, too scared to go to salons, with razor blade, the only way to shave off heel calluses and try to minimize the cracks, though never removing the cracks completely, we all know the cracks are too deep to shave off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the spray and it took a while to see the difference, definitely not instant. First month or two I used a lot of spray. Probably 7-10 sprays per foot. Rubbing and rubbing, massaging, every night.  Also spraying every am. Bought at end of summer, now, 5 month later my feet have transformed. I keep using the spray only in am, before putting socks on. In summer and fall, while I wore sandals, I used it twice a day, at night and in morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have cracks on my heels. Not one. I&#x27;m astounded. Shocked really. For past 20 years I cannot remember any time when I did not have a crack on my heel. Feet are soft and smooth and pink, not ashy!  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, but to see a total transformation, please make a commitment. Good luck and happy feet!</li>
    <li> We prefer the spray liquid not the cream. It works great after bath. Great spearmint smell not offensive. Cracks and dry spots heal in matter of hrs. to couple of days. Would recommend to anyone that has problems with hands cracking in cold weather.</li>
    <li> I have problem with fingers cracking at nails edge. Eventually they lead to painful splits. Zim&#x27;s is by far the best product I have used to alleviate the dryness and cracking. I spray it in the palm of one hand and then rub both hands together getting good coverage and finish with a lotion (Zim&#x27;s is excellent).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had cracked, dry heels for 16 years. Recently, the cracks were so painful that I could barely walk. I decided it was finally time to do something. This product was wonderful. Within 2 days most of the dryness was gone. After one week, more than 90 percent of the cracks are completely healed. The deepest cracks are the ones that remain and they are healing rapidly. The pain from the cracks was gone after only one day&#x27;s use. I love that it is a spray because it is easy to apply and not messy. It lasts a long time, even with socks on. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong, it smells refreshing. I love that the ingredients are a short list and everything has a purpose. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I love it and I&#x27;m thankful that I tried it.</li>
    <li> I have dry hands that crack and bleed especially in cold dry weather. I have tried many different creams and lotions and nothing comes close to this product.  I highly recommend the liquid and not the cream. The cream was not much better than other products.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, my grandmother had heart problems that led to LOTS of swelling in her feet and lower legs.  Her skin suddenly became thin, dry and scaly.  We tried everthing and the condition of her skin worsened. Finally, I picked up Zim&#x27;s crack creme at the local drugstore - really thinking what could this little bottle (that was so expensive) do to help.  But, I was desperate to help the situation before her skin cracked (it would likely get infected because of her poor circulation).  We applied it at least twice a day.  In a few days there was a marked improvement.  In a week, despite the swelling her skin was almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> My hands are in such BAD shape with lots of hand washing and WINTER. I actually use it on my fingers and backs of my hands/knuckles at night then use some little spa gloves. After a night or two my hands are back to being SOFT ... like a babies behind. And at MY age that is saying a LOT. Positively works and works FAST.</li>
    <li> If your feet (or hands) are dry, rough and prone to cracking, this product is for you.  I have used this for years and the results are almost instant.  Personally, I like the oil better than the cream.  For me I can use less and it absorbs better.  The Zim&#x27;s web site will tell you where you can find the product in store but I have all but given up on this since they never seem to be in stock.  Amazon shipped fast and the 4-pack means I am in stock for the rest of the year.</li>
    <li> Read the other reviews, because all I can say is DITTO.&lt;br /&gt;This little spray bottle is simply and absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just really really works.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a friend for extremely chapped hands and feet. It works better than the expensive perscription. I would highly encourage anyone with dry hands and feet to try this.</li>
    <li> Let me say right at the outset: This product really works even in stubborn cases.&lt;br /&gt;In fact,this is the only product of its kind that WORKED FOR ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it now for some time and could not recommend it higher.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the product arrived securely wrapped and in good time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I would not hesitate to order from this seller, again. In fact, I did.</li>
    <li> This has helped my hands that get more chapped from the winter weather. I apply it at bedtime. My hands were better with one use.</li>
    <li> Mother in law loves this product and asks for it on every holiday and special occasion.</li>
    <li> this is not the product i was expecting to get, at all. do not name your lotion \\&quot;crack cream\\&quot;... very misleading</li>
    <li> I have ordered Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme 2 oz. spray (pack of 4) bottle as pictured before and love the product. HOWEVER, I placed another order and when I received it I was sent 2 oz. creme (lotion) instead of the spray. I was very disappointed as this is not what I ordered. I contacted the seller, Mr. Medical, and was told the manufactor pictured the wrong product. I requested to send the creme back and had to email several times to get a shipping label to send the product back. It has now been a month and I still have not received a refund or even an email stating that Mr.Medical has recieved the product back.Don&#x27;t believe I will ever order any more products that is from Mr. Medical.</li>
    <li> The winter months bring on dry and cracked fingers.  This Zim&#x27;s creme is&lt;br /&gt;the best.  It helps to heal the cracks and prevent further cracking.  I have&lt;br /&gt;recommended this to many people.  I was able to purchase this at CVS originally&lt;br /&gt;and they no longer carry it.  So, I was thrilled to find them at my most favorite&lt;br /&gt;on-line shopping place.....Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kelly Gallagher</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find this in my favorite stores.  It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s absolute favorite product for preventing skin cracking on his fingers.  It&#x27;s so wonderful to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> When used consistently, Zim&#x27;s definitely works to heal and soften cracked skin, especially on the heel area.</li>
    <li> I have been using Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme for several years.  I have extremely dry skin and before I started using Crack Creme I had real  problems with my hands, especially in the winter.  They would crack and bleed all winter long, no matter how much lotion I used.  I use it every night before I go to bed and that is all it takes to keep my hands healthy.  I use it on my heels also.  This stuff  works great!</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s original liquid formula Crack Creme is the best product ever for dry, cracked feet! I&#x27;ve been using it for years and after having trouble finding it in a brick and mortar store I am so excited to have found it here on Amazon at such a good price! I will be coming back for more soon!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product exclusively for years as an overall body creme.  I also use it on my face.  Although it looks like it might be greasy, it isn&#x27;t.  With light massaging it quickly absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film.  It is lightly scented so it won&#x27;t compete with any fragrance you use.  I live in a very dry climate and my skin is very dry. Zim&#x27;s is the only creme that has relieved the \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling in my skin.  During the winter months Zim&#x27;s has also helped me keep the cracks that appear in my hands and feet at a minimum.  I have found that a heavier and longer massage of the problem area is necessary to speed the healing process and keep other cracks from forming. I hope they never stop making this product because I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable.  I order a pack of 4 from Amazon on a regular basis.  Amazon&#x27;s consistently low price, ease of purchase and speedy delivery keeps me coming back.</li>
    <li> We went back to the Original formula as this spray does not work. The original works very well and we highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Softer heels if used daily.</li>
    <li> For the last few years my heels have been getting more and more dry and cracked.  Last year I had a hard time keeping them looking decent, nothing seemed to work that well and at one point I had a crack on one heel that was so deep it actually caused pain when I walked.  So spring came this year and my heels were in the worst shape ever. I was really stressing that I would soon have to put socks and shoes  away and expose my ugly heels to the world.  I found this stuff on Amazon with all the great reviews, and not too expensive. Although it wasn&#x27;t an \\&quot;overnight\\&quot; miracle for me like some other reviewers experienced, after two weeks of consistent use I look down and it&#x27;s like I have someone else&#x27;s feet.  It is absolutely amazing.  I wish I took before and after pictures - literally not a single crack, just smooth healthy looking skin. This is what worked for me:  every morning after showering and drying off, I rub my heels one at a time with the part of a ped-egg that&#x27;s like a nail file - NOT the metal parts, I think that&#x27;s how I injured myself last year - and then smooth on a generous spritz of the CC and let it absorb, it doesn&#x27;t take long.  That&#x27;s it.  If you are in tears thinking of how your feet will look in cute summer shoes, get some of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Cured the worst cracked hands and feet very quickly. Just 2 sprays a day for a week. The spray goes a long way. It works better than a lotions and goes not leave your hands greasy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme original liquid formula for a few years and I am pleased with how it works. I&#x27;ve tried many skin creams on my hands and feet, but the Zim&#x27;s liquid formula works best by far. The liquid formula is very light and I didn&#x27;t expect good results when I first tried it, but it did work. Don&#x27;t expect instant results. I takes a few days of applications to give complete healing. It does sting when putting it on a deep crack, but, in my opinion, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for ultimate relief. The smell is pleasant; like cloves. All-in-all I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great for me, no more cracked dry feet.</li>
    <li> I tried it &amp;#34;by chance&amp;#34;.  It helped my hands first, then I needed to put cream on my feet every night ( per doctors orders)...so I tried it there also.  Over 2 months time now....it is helping greatly......plus it seems to be taking away the fungus on some toes.  YEAH !&lt;br /&gt;It does have a different smell (but OK).....and IT WORKS !</li>
    <li> I love the product. It works great, however when I received the package liquid from all the packages had leaked out and soiled everything. I won&#x27;t buy it again if this happens the next time. Every item had leaked.</li>
    <li> False advertising. Picture show pump bottle and 20% bonus. Received bottles no pump applicator. No 20% bonus in bottle, 2oz bottle. Product is good works as advertised.</li>
    <li> I really like Zim’s Crack Creme® since I&#x27;ve tried many things on these rough feet and to little avail. I get a pedicure once  a month but I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of the calluses. I started putting this on every morning and I saw results probably about a week into it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, along with a pumice in the shower and my feet are amazing! My search is over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received in exchange for honest review*</li>
    <li> This is the best! I&#x27;ve never found anything else to heal cracked feet or hands as well and as quickly as Zim&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I have used Zim&#x27;s for years and was happy to be able to get it thru Amazon.  It is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Feels and smells good, but does not get those cracks in thumbs.  Works in very silky.  Thre again it might work for younger skin.</li>
    <li> I love Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream.  It&#x27;s the only cream (really a liquid) that prevents the painful cracks I tend to get during New England Winters.  It also softens the heels of my feet.</li>
    <li> My grandma used to use this all the time for cuts, scrapes, dry skin, and mild burns.  I remembered it always working well but hadn&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere - so glad I finally found it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very strong but pleasant (almost cinnamon-y) and it works very well for dry, cracked skin.  What else can you say in a review?  I will buy it again as soon as it runs out.</li>
    <li> This product works better for keeping my dry hands from cracking than any product that I have ever found! I have tried lots of other products without the same results.</li>
    <li> Works great, forget the creams</li>
    <li> Since I used this liquid on my skin cracks on my fingers, it has been like getting a skin graft because the cracks had been recurring for more than a year, cracking, bleeding, hurting like hell, all gone within two days. Before this creme, I tried just about everything and made an appointment with a skin doctor. Now, it is canceled. This is truly a miraculous cure for me and I have begun using it on my feet also.     8/20/09 This is just an update. My podiatrist while trimming my nails commented that my usually hard and brittle nails were \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and my skin was a lot \\&quot;smoother and pliable\\&quot;. When i told him that Zim&#x27;s was the reason, he said he was going to use it on his patients. I had a diabetic ulcer on my toe and due to Zim&#x27;s, it is almost healed after some 6 months of jacking around various things, useless things. God save Zim&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an entertainer here in Nashville, TN. I sign a lot of autographs everyday and a lot of people see my hands everyday. I have had problems with my hands cracking for decades. This stuff is the only thing that works. Lotions just dry up and go away. I used to buy it in walmart and kmart but the nighttime formula is no longer available there. The day formula is nothing more than a lotion and doesn&#x27;t work for me. The nighttime is in a small spray bottle and is more of a liquid that really does the job. This stuff is great!!!</li>
    <li> Then you are bound to put wear and tear on your tootsies. There are many good formula foot care products; one which has proven to help in mild or extreme conditions is Zim&#x27;s Crack Cr&amp;egrave;me. Although good for other external skin locations this is where I found it to be most useful. This cream also works on more modest feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even thought it says natural ingredients as with any topical item you may want to try it in a small area first to be sure you do not have an unwanted reaction.</li>
    <li> The only criticism I have of the product itself is that it is in spray form which I don&#x27;t personally prefer.&lt;br /&gt;However, due to my own error or otherwise, two orders were inadvertently ordered which is much more than I can use for a long time. I requested permission to send one back and thought my request had been approved, so sent one back unopened and according to the process given and have not heard one word nor any kind of refund so am quite disappointed with the process. Had I known, I wouldn&#x27;t have sent it back and at least had a lifetime supply of the product which I really do like.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to the product based solely on the name--Crack Creme! that basically describes how my hands are (almost all the time) TO my pleasant surprise--it really worked. I will say I was confused when I realized it was a Spray bottle and not a &#x27;Creme&#x27; but applied it anyway. I will continue to use this and see how well it works at keeping my hands soft, but I think it will be great just on the short 1 day results so far.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that solves the issues of my cracked heels and feet.  It works, buy it, period.</li>
    <li> Being a mechanic my hands get very dry and rough, since using Zim&#x27;s they are soft and don&#x27;t feel like sandpaper anymore.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of cloves and this does the trick for dry cracked skin!  If used daily, maybe twice in some cases, it will prevent cracked heels and soften feet.  Remember to exfoliate often while this is working.  Your feet will smell pretty!</li>
    <li> I get this for my mom.  She sprays her feet every night before bed so her feet don&#x27;t dry out and crack.</li>
    <li> My wife needs this cream to olivate pain on her foot. It provides relief, works and is very good product.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and it is the only lotion that helps the eczema on my hands.  I use it every night.</li>
    <li> Yuck. I hate this. It&#x27;s an OIL, not a cream, in a spray pump bottle. I want that thick, lotion-y feel on sore, crack feet, not oil. I though I might use it for something else (massage?) but it&#x27;s tacky once it dries. Yuck. It also has a distinctive odor, which doesn&#x27;t bother me but some might find it unappealing.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  If you have spent lots of $$$$$$$$$$ trying other products--STOP right now and try this.  I truly have the worst heel problem, very painful especially in the winter.  My daughter found this in one of her supermarkets, and said Mom just try it, what do you have to lose?  Well let me tell you, ever since then I cannot live without Zims.  Plus it smells good too.  It has worked miracles on my heels, and my husband also uses it on his elbows.  Works there too.</li>
    <li> wow.  wow.  wow!  An amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve Been using this one for years and i can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores, so i&#x27;m glad to see it here.  I had tried lotions, foot cremes, wax treatments, that stuff that chemically peels the dry skin off... and they all failed to fix my dry, scratchy, cracked heels, calloused toes, and tired feet.  Day 2 of using this stuff, i threw the foot file and exfoliants away.&lt;br /&gt;  Part of the problem with other treatments was the directions to put lotions and what not on your feet, put on some socks, and sleep with it on.  I cant stand wearing socks and can&#x27;t sleep with them on - my feet just get sweaty.  Then, the next day, i&#x27;d have this stuff on my feet and my feet would just sweat in my shoes all day.  Worse than having the dry feet to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s herbal -smells lovely.  I love that i&#x27;m not pouring a bunch of chemicals on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s liquid - not a creme.&lt;br /&gt;The spray form is very handy! (keeps your hands clean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just spray this on my feet before bed, rub my feet together, and tuck my tootsies in.  Easy!  It soaks in pretty quickly.  No need for socks!  After just a few nights, my thickened cracked skin was softened and the cracks started healing.  Now I have the soft pink little feet i used to have as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps you as much as it helps me.</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s crack creme is a great product with an awful name AND it&#x27;s no longer available over the counter.  I ordered from Amazon and love the product which works better on really dry skin than anything else in the world.  BUT the company used usps for delivery and it took way too long to be delivered ~ and the post office delivered it to the wrong house and then I had to wait for the neighbor to bring it to me.  I won&#x27;t order from Amazon if the supplier isn&#x27;t using UPS.</li>
    <li> Best product for dry skin or feet - even after one application I noticed a marked improvement!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zim&#x27;s for many years now and it works great on dry cracking skin. I couldn&#x27;t find it at my local pharmacy so I took a chance on finding it at Amazon. I won&#x27;t have to look for it any more as I will keep coming back to Amazon for my Zim&#x27;s</li>
    <li> 3 stars because the bottles had leaked out at least 1/4 of the product.  The boxes were soaked with the oil.  Good price if the bottles are full.  The product itself is awesome, I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years now.  Every winter, when the air gets so dry and my fingers start to split around the nails-- nothing works as good as this product.  I&#x27;ve converted at least a dozen guys at work.  It is an oil, has an odor, and burns a bit if you apply it to broken skin where you can see blood.  It will heal completely heal those splits though, in as little as 3 days if you apply the product 3 or 4 times during each day.</li>
    <li> Received item exactly as described.  It&#x27;s really a great product.  I&#x27;ll be back for more of this miracle cream...nothing works as well.  thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different solutions for winter cracked finger tips.  This product worked for me, but just a little relief.  It is very oily so it is pretty hard to leave on unless you put gloves or bandages on.  Neither are good options for me.  Next, I tried OKeeffes Working Hands Cream (I also reviewed this) and it worked over the first night!  For me, that was a much better option, and less expensive!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems with my hands drying and cracking, especially in the winter.  This creme has done a much better job than typical hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Actually, it is the packaging that I don&#x27;t like.  I think a spray bottle is an unsatisfactory  way to apply a CREME. So why did I order it?  I did not understand that a bottle would be a spray dispenser; and I could not find the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; dispenser that I had ordered previously</li>
    <li> Used this stuff years ago and was excited to find out it was still available.  I work with my hands 7 days a week and in all kinds of weather.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve used that absolutely works (and right away) for treating cracking and peeling skin on my hands.  Fast drying and OK smell.</li>
    <li> As someone else stated mine also arrived leaking.  And one accidentally got knocked over on my dresser and it leaked all over even with the cap on.  Other than the leaking, it works very well.  I like this and the cream.  Both work wonders on dry skin, feet etc.</li>
    <li> Just ok, not a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> The last time I ordered this, I got the bonus 2.4 oz bonus size. When I ordered this time, the bonus size pic was up both here and on the Zim&#x27;s website, but I got the 2.0 oz size. The product is fine but Amazon loses 2 stars for deceptive advertising!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product but when it arrived 3 out of 4 bottles showed signs of leakage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.  When I no longer could find it in the stores here at home, I started looking toward the internet.  It is only with this last purchase that I found it at such a good price on Amazon.  I have eczema and extremely dry skin.  My heels would crack open and bleed..Not only were they very painful, I could only wear a pair of hose once because I would end up with runs in them.  After using Zim&#x27;s for a couple of weeks, my heels cleared completely up-no more cracks, smooth and soft as a baby&#x27;s behind.  I hope that I never have to be without this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever found for preventing dry, cracked skin in the winter.  I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Crack Creme is a must for living in New Mexico&#x27;s very dry climate-It needs to be used every night to be of most benefit.  Amazon is the only place that I have been able to find it. Crack Creame is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme for more than a decade and it works. I have tried other products, but always return to the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme because it works better and usually costs less!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff.  I have a tiny patch on my hand that hand lotions don&#x27;t touch and I have a bad reaction to lactic acid and alpha hydroxy products (affects my usually dormant carpal tunnel).  This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried (I stopped looking) that takes care of my dry spot and even seems to improve my nails.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awful. My husband will gripe and complain when I come to bed with this on. It gives him a headache. After 5 nights of using it my cracked heels are actually worse. The oil is super oily and hard to spread. It sticks to the skin but gives no benefit. Don&#x27;t buy this! Stick with Walgreens lotion for 5 dollars instead.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day no cracks awsome.  I would recomend this product for dry cracked hands or feet.  My wife does not like the smell.  Reminds me of Bay Rum and I like the smell as my dad used bayrum and gliserian on his dry crack hands.</li>
    <li> USING IT FOR 3 YEARS AND IT REALLY WORKS. VERY HARD TO FIND IN STORES. IT&#x27;S REALLY IS  A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zim&#x27;s for years but it&#x27;s not always easy to find.  It&#x27;s the only thing that worked on my cracked cuticles and dry cracked finger tips. It&#x27;s oily and will probably stain, so I apply it at night and wear cotton gloves. It works great on feet too, but wear socks.</li>
    <li> This crack creme is amazing. I squirt a little and mix with my hand cream and my hands don&#x27;t feel like sand paper anymore. There is nothing quite like it, and believe me I have tried a lot! Not exactly crazy of the smell in the beginning but I have grown accustom to it. Also when I mix it with the lotion it cuts back the smell. Regardless, this stuff is amazing and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> this item is great. It heals my cracked hands very quickly. Amazon is the only place to get this item. I would recommend this item to anyone that has dry, chapped, or cracked hands. I swear by Zim&#x27;s Crack Crème.</li>
    <li> This is the only stuff that works for me. 5 stars</li>
    <li> I was not able to find it again at the beauty supply store. I immediately searched for it online. This stuff works like a dream on my very dry cracked feet. Vaseline doesn&#x27;t work, or other drugstore creams. Shea butter works well but is very slippery for sandals. The Crack Creme is a spray on liquid that is quickly absorbed into the skin and make my feet beautiful. My feet feel soft and not greasy and cracked skin is cured. You will want to have a bottle on hand at all times.</li>
    <li> I have been using the liquid formula Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme for at least five years.  I had deep painful cracks in my heels and nothing, not even prescription medication, helped until I tried Zim&#x27;s.  I live in Florida and use it everyday after I shower and pumice or file my heels and balls of my feet.  If I lived up North, I would probably use it at night as well.  I have feet that look at least twenty years younger than the rest of me.  I wish I could use it everywhere!  I gave a bottle to a friend who swears it keeps the psoriasis on her feet in check.  It may be a little oily for some, but I promise you that if you use it faithfully for a couple of weeks, your dry feet will be a thing of the past.  I do not find the creamy formula as helpful.</li>
    <li> I have very dry feet.  I also tried vaseline and other products but to no avail.  This has really help.  I use it in the morning and at night before going to bed and I have really noticed the difference.  I will definitely purchase this product again and again.</li>
    <li> Best product for the winter when people tend to get cracking skin on fingertips and thumbs.  I use it after each shower and also on the bottoms of my feet and heels.  It keeps them soft and smooth.  Have not found another product to work as well.  I usually by 4 or 5 at a time.</li>
    <li> I had first tried Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream when I saw it in a local drug store. I had tried other skin softeners to see which actually works the best on dry skin. It was Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream that had beaten all other brands by a very impressive performance. When I had used it as directed, it really did seem to leave my skin in very good condition. Try it and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream not only softens your skin, but it leaves it that way for many days when it is used as directed. I recommend the Herbal Skin Care Original Liquid Formula. You don&#x27;t have to have cracked skin to use Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream. If soap dries your skin, try Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream after you dry-off, after your bath or shower. You&#x27;ll be glad that you did. I happen to be someone with very dry skin. Just follow the directions on the bottle and you too will recommend it to someone that you care about. Nevertheless, I didn&#x27;t find the Zim&#x27;s Crack Cream Lotion to work as well as the original liquid formula. But every body skin is different, so try it for yourself. Sincerely, Leonard Greene.</li>
    <li> I have been using Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme (the liquid spray) on my toe nails and feet for several years now.  I have not found a better product for softening my hard nails.  This is a GREAT product.  And it smells good too :)</li>
    <li> I use this cream when the weather gets colder.  It is the only cream that I can use…on both hands and feet…that will soothe and moisturize my skin.</li>
    <li> My sister inlaw works with young children and washes her hands so many times daily. She started to have cracked hands and they started to hurt her. As soon as I seen Zim&#x27;s crack cream I thought of her. She has tried so many products and I had hoped this would help her heal her hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to her and she has been using it over a month. Her hands are healing so the cream is working. She is thrilled about this product and I am so happy to help her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will continue to use it so hopefully her hands will fully heal. I received this cream complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father over the holidays.  I have cracks on my fingers, as does my mother.  We all started using it and in a few days, the cracks are gone and my fingers feel normal again.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My feet are were very dry. I mean if you looked at them, they always have a white look to them because of the dryness. I was ok with this until I started noticing that my heel were beginning to crack!. I bought this product and have found it very useful. Its all natural so that is even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I did for an entire week, every night and saw results:&lt;br /&gt;1) Take the ped egg and scrape all around the feet. This is get all the dry skin out.&lt;br /&gt;2) Take a squirt of your shampoo and wash the feet in luke warm water thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;3) Pat your skin dry and then use a generous amount of this product ( I used 3 pumps for each feet) and massage all around the feet. Especially around the heel area.&lt;br /&gt;4) Wear a clean pair of socks and go to bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repeat all of the above every night for a week.</li>
    <li> I have THE. WORST. FEET. EVER, when it comes to dry and icky skin.  Calloused heels, dry nails, embarrassingly tough cuticles -- they&#x27;re hard to keep up and even nightly slatherings of Vaseline didn&#x27;t help the situation.  But Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme -- the liquid spray; the lotiony cream didn&#x27;t work as well for me -- actually keeps my virtually impossible to moisturize tootsies looking lovely.</li>
    <li> My wife originally found this product for me and I have found it to work the best for hands and skin that takes a beating regularly. This fights the problem of split skin on the fingers during the dry winter months and makes my hands feel real good year round.</li>
    <li> Some years ago I suffered through bleeding, deeply cracked cuticles on mostly my thumbs and fore-fingers.  Being I work in the construction field in the Northeast, this was always a winter time problem.  Very painful. I tried bag balm and other lotions and they did not work.  I stopped in a drug store one day and an employee suggested trying Zim&#x27;s Crack creme.  Funny name, but I bought it.  I applied it to all my fingertips in the morning before heading out.  About a week later, my deep cracks did not hurt any more and 2 weeks later actually started to heal. The following season I began to use it in late November every year before any cracks developed.  I have never had cracked fingers again.  My wife now uses it for her cracked heals in winter.  I can&#x27;t find the liquid any more at local drugstores, so I bought it here.  The creme version does not work for me and was greasy.  I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 10+ years now.  I normally never leave a comment on a product, however this stuff truly works. I have told many other people about this product and they have had the same results as me. Hope this review will help others suffering the same problem as I once had. Great, Great product.</li>
    <li> Love it. Helps dryness on elbows, toes and heels of feet and fingernail cuticles year round as my skin is extremely dry.  Works like a charm.</li>
    <li> Rough feet or cracked feet? THIS IS AN OIL NOT A CREME - and I LOVE IT!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years! Had to order from Amazon because most stores don&#x27;t carry this product.  This works better for feet than most products that are made for cracks on heels.  Try it.</li>
    <li> My grandpa has crack feet during winter, so I bought it for him. If the effect is good, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I am a 55 year old, RN. I work with my ahnd a lot. Wash my hand a lot. My finger tips were cracking. I went to four different doctors, they perscribed steroidal creams and lotions with minimal success. I asked a pharmacist what she would recommend, and that is when I started on crack cream. In 3 weeks of applying it twice a day it was all gone. I stopped using it regularly and just put it on as needed now. It is a game changer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past. I wasn&#x27;t able to locate this product locally. I was delighted to find it available on Amazon. I would highly recommend this to anyone with extreme dry skin with cracking.</li>
    <li> I love Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme! It&#x27;s amazing. My feet tend to get dry, and cracked which then makes them feel itchy. I&#x27;ve tried foot cremes, and any number of fairly expensive concoctions with mixed results. I found Zim&#x27;s a few years ago and never looked back. I spray some Crack Creme on my feet and within minutes, it seems, the itching is gone and overnight my feet are smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my hands too -- it&#x27;s a good all around moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I used to really like this stuff. It&#x27;s the same as ever, but the stickiness and the challenge of using it on my feet as my arthritic hips worsen, makes application a challenge. Still something that is call a miracle product given the condition of my feet and ankles during the winter.</li>
    <li> Great product. Wonderful results, works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Been using crack crème for years it really does help to heal cracked and dry hands. If you have a favorite cream try putting the crack cream on first then your favorite cream over it, works good&lt;br /&gt;Charles&lt;br /&gt;Pennsville NJ.</li>
    <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t like the way it smells, but I mix it half and half with Corn Huskers and it makes the best nongreasy hand lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> CREME works like a charm and is excellent for the worst cracked skin. I wear it at night with &amp;#34;texting gloves&amp;#34; However, the manufacturer and seller&#x27;s packaging leaves little to be desired. All 4 boxes in 1 pkg were soaked with &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; from leaky bottles. It appears that the packaged was REPACKAGED also....the 4 bottles were put into a very loose shrink wrap package. This most certainly should have been noticed in packaging up the product to secure the contents better. I am guessing the person who took (4) off the shelf either didn&#x27;t care or is blind. They continue to leak after receiving them so I know it is in the construct of the bottle.  I highly recommend this product but after getting the bottles, ALL 4 bottles (necks) still LEAK and need to be kept inside a plastic bag so it doesn&#x27;t transfer onto shelving, clothing or leak in your purse. -written by John F&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever!! love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Quite disappointed in this. It doesn&#x27;t do any more than other good creams. This was an oil and messy to use. Two of the four bottles arrived frozen and leaked onto packaging. When in use, the spray tops leak around the base of the top after 2-3 pumps, so I unscrew the top to access the oil. I will use the remainder on my feet.</li>
    <li> Great product for keeping heels soft.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I work with elementary school children and have to wash my hands constantly.&lt;br /&gt;It really works</li>
    <li> Have used this product for dry cracking skin of the elbows and heels of the feet. Works well and I continue to use it. Merchant was great and product arrived before date of delivery.</li>
    <li> the best for cracked skin</li>
    <li> Every winter I have problems with cracks on my index fingers and thumbs next to the nail. I blame this on the cold and also the dry air. This winter I had a crack on the tip of my thumb which really bothered. The only products that work for me are Zim&#x27;s crack creme (creamy and night formulas). I use the creamy daytime formula during the day and I try to use \\&quot;the original\\&quot; at night. The original is an oil and has more of an \\&quot;odor.\\&quot; I use the daytime formula several times a day and rub it in really well, both in the direction of the crack and across the crack. The crack may take a day or two to heal but the products work. I have tried other remedies but keep coming back to Zim&#x27;s crack creme.&lt;br /&gt;I did try O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands hand cream but came back to Zim&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll see a difference with weeks!  I find this far better than the Zim&#x27;s Creme that is mixed in the creme.  I use it as soon as I com out of the shower and in the winter I put Eucerin on top of it.  In the summer I don&#x27;t put any cream because my feet sweat.  That&#x27;s why I love this product it gives me the choice.  It is very hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from cracked feet which made it painful to walk. I tried many many cream and most didn&#x27;t help much. Zim&#x27;s crack creme is a miracle cream which I highly recommend. It is the only one that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> Zim&#x27;s crack creme spray is the only product I use for dry feet.I feel the spray is much more effective than the actual creme.</li>
