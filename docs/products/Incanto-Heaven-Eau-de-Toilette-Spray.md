      <li>This is already the second bottle of this product that I am using and am still not bored with it coz it smells so good..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better to get something that you&#x27;ll really appreciate like Bulgari Rose Essentielle, Channel Chances, Versace (pink) Angel by Tierry Muegler, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein</li>

      <li>I completely love this perfume and I paid 3x less on Amazon than the MSRP price in a retailer store.</li>
      <li>It is strong enough that it would last until the end of the day but light enough that you will not fill-up the room or overwhelm the people around you with the smell!</li>
      <li>The package looked brand new and the perfume smelled the way it should.</li>
      <li>I mean they smell great and last long.</li>
      <li>Have always loved this fragrance but unfortunately the nozzle was leaking and couldn&#x27;t use it properly.</li>
      <li>Scent was exactly what was provided by other reviewers.</li>
      <li>I like sweet fragrances but do not like the extremely fruity or extremely flowery perfumes..</li>

    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND PRICE</li>
    <li> The perfume box was wrapped in plastic, which I really like. Scent was exactly what was provided by other reviewers. It smells good, but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long...It&#x27;s better to get something that you&#x27;ll really appreciate like Bulgari Rose Essentielle, Channel Chances, Versace (pink) Angel by Tierry Muegler, Marc Jacobs, Michael Kors, Calvin Klein (summer is pretty good)- I mean they smell great and last long.</li>
    <li> The fruity notes (apple particularly)in this fragrance is the most evident /forward scent regarding this Eau De Toilette. I&#x27;m undecided concerning if I truly like it though. I&#x27;m still undecided. This scent kinda grows on you.</li>
