      <li>I have oily combination skin, so I wanted an oil free moisturizer .  </li>

      <li>I found this to be a light product, no greasy, easily absorbed moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It is cool and feels healing to my skin.</li>
      <li>Excellent for sensitive skin, but recommend for summer if you have a dry winter.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light texture, but still very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Love is so far.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I was happy to learn this Alba moisturizer contains the hyaluronic and I am able to purchase it usually for $15 at my local health food store.</li>
      <li>this price is much better than my local store.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and made with natural products.</li>
      <li>First time bought it.</li>
      <li>My face is so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin very soft and fresh feeling.</li>
      <li>It smells nice and a little fruity.</li>
      <li>Product works really well, no break outs, etc.</li>
      <li>very moistunizing cream - leaves skin feeling refreashed.</li>
      <li>and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
      <li>I have spent many dollars on moisturizers from drug and department stores -</li>
      <li>I have to say I really don&#x27;t like the fragrance of this product.</li>
      <li>Good moisturizer for delicate skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad to see to be able to get it online as it is a bit expensive.</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or harsh chemicals</li>
      <li>This really moisturizes your skin without making it oily, which is something I tend to have a problem with most other facial moisturizers.</li>
      <li>I have super duper dry skin.</li>
      <li>That being said, I probably will buy again and it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to more expensive creams.</li>
      <li>I usually use this before bed and wake up with moisturized and more luminous looking skin.</li>
      <li>It does smells tropical, I have allergies and sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I also like how I do not need much product for my entire face.</li>
      <li>I thought this was a natural product.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin and have occasional breakouts, but have not broken out with this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not thick enough to keep skin hydrated in winter...</li>
      <li>Food not do much for my dry skin</li>
      <li>She said the hyaluronic acid retains moisture in the skin, so the skin will not produce extra oils because it is being hydrated naturally.</li>
      <li>- it is actually a humectant (moisture-binding ingredient) and a natural moisturizer already in our skin but diminishes as we age.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing, and the consistency is extremely smooth--a little goes such a long way!!</li>
      <li>It lingers way too long for someone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>I have acne-prone skin, and have had breakouts when using this moisturizer in the past, but when I started taking Pantothenic Acid vitamins, my skin cleared right up.  </li>
      <li>Few days later added a bit more for facial massage and the result was: s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells amazing, non greasy. I wish there were SPF in this, but otherwise it&#x27;s my favorite moisturizer. And it&#x27;s oil free!</li>
    <li> Too oily.  Leaves your face looking dirty.  Moisturizer does not soak into the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  It smells amazing, and the consistency is extremely smooth--a little goes such a long way!! I have acne-prone skin, and have had breakouts when using this moisturizer in the past, but when I started taking Pantothenic Acid vitamins, my skin cleared right up.  This is one of the most moisturizing products I have ever used, and I feel good about using it because it&#x27;s alba!</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive skin, but recommend for summer if you have a dry winter.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not thick enough to keep skin hydrated in winter...and I don&#x27;t have dry, dry skin.</li>
    <li> Product works really well, no break outs, etc. But the smell is a little overwhelming, it would be great it this was scent-free or just toned down. That being said, I probably will buy again and it&#x27;s a cheap alternative to more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Amazing moisturizer. I really love it, smells good and feels good.</li>
    <li> I like the cream however, there are &amp;#34;dimes&amp;#34; in this and I really wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I thought this was a natural product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores and absorbs well. I have combination skin and have occasional breakouts, but have not broken out with this. I also like how I do not need much product for my entire face. This jar will definitely last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> A++++++! Excellent product</li>
    <li> Has a pleasant aroma. Does not feel greasy. Good moisturizer for delicate skin</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I have combination oily skin. It hasn&#x27;t been easy to find a good cleanser and moisturizer that is good for my skin type. This Alba moisturizer is light, silky feeling and glides smoothly across the skin. It is cool and feels healing to my skin. I like to put it on in the morning and it seems to hydrate my skin well for many hours and keeps my skin oils balanced. This product contains green tea, aloe and hyaluronic acid (see explanation below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this Alba moisturizer a couple years ago, because an aesthetician at a spa recommended that I use skin care products with hyaluronic acid to prevent oiliness. At the time I was experiencing extra oiliness on my forehead, nose and chin, but not cheeks. She said the hyaluronic acid retains moisture in the skin, so the skin will not produce extra oils because it is being hydrated naturally. She recommended the Derma E cleanser containing hyaluronic so it wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and now that I also use the Alba green tea and aloe moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, I hardly ever have oiliness or get blemishes. My skin is clearer and softer. Hyaluronic acid sounds scary but it is not a harmful acid - it is actually a humectant (moisture-binding ingredient) and a natural moisturizer already in our skin but diminishes as we age.

I was happy to learn this Alba moisturizer contains the hyaluronic and I am able to purchase it usually for $15 at my local health food store. Here on Amazon it is a couple of dollars less.</li>
    <li> I found this to be a light product, no greasy, easily absorbed moisturizer.  I have used half of the jar and I love the way it makes my face feel.  I have spent many dollars on moisturizers from drug and department stores - but this one has my vote and I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Love this. I tried the even advanced cream which made me break out. I&#x27;m going back to this one!!!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite face lotion. It is light and not oily and has a wonderful &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; sweet smell. Leaves my skin very soft and fresh feeling.</li>
    <li> I have oily combination skin, so I wanted an oil free moisturizer .  This product stays that  condition, but after trying once  it felt greasy. Nevertheless, I decided to give it a chance and used a small amount through out my face.  Few days later added a bit more for facial massage and the result was: s a big break out!!!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not what I expected...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame,  cause i lreally like Alba Botanicals products....but this one hasn&#x27;t work at all for me</li>
    <li> A good value. I found the smell unpleasant.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing since I started using this lotion.  I put it on at night after washing my face and my acne has cleared up significantly.  I don&#x27;t even have to use acne creams anymore.</li>
    <li> 2nd jar of this moisturizer.  Gives me the softness and just enough moisture in all seasons.  This winter has been so drying on the skin, especially my face, so i added a drop of coconut oil to a small portion and applied before leaving the house. The combination was impressive; my skin remained soft. No tightness or itching due to the cold.</li>
    <li> I have super duper dry skin. Tried this moisturizer and i LOVE it! It&#x27;s nice and light, does the job and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greesy at all. From now on I will stick with this product.</li>
    <li> I have to say I really don&#x27;t like the fragrance of this product. It lingers way too long for someone who is sensitive to fragrances.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, no greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Really feels great on the skin.  Like that it is oil free but sill absorbs and feels really smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin and I rave about it to everyone I know. Thank you Alba!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. First time bought it. Love is so far. Skin feels moisturized.</li>
    <li> It makes my face bad acnes.</li>
    <li> This is a great day time moisturizer.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens or harsh chemicals and it wears well under makeup.</li>
    <li> Food not do much for my dry skin</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer on a whim and I love it!! It&#x27;s a light texture, but still very moisturizing. I usually use this before bed and wake up with moisturized and more luminous looking skin. It works great for day time under make up as well. It smells nice and a little fruity. It&#x27;s a really great price as well..there is a lot of product in the jar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and love it.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and made with natural products.I&#x27;m so glad to see to be able to get it online as it is a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Having been using this for years and will continue to use it. I use this in conjunction with the Alba Botanica face wash.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My face is so soft and smooth. I will start using all the alba botanical products</li>
    <li> Excellent for people that need a oil free free creme!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells awesome and dries quickly without leaving hands greasy.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Needed something oil free for the hcg diet and this worked perfect. Couldn&#x27;t have done the diet without it.</li>
    <li> very moistunizing cream - leaves skin feeling refreashed. I will buy again love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s so light and refreshing and feels great on my face! It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I will use from now on and this price is much better than my local store.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice facial moisturizer. It does smells tropical, I have allergies and sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t bother me what so ever. No breakouts. This really moisturizes your skin without making it oily, which is something I tend to have a problem with most other facial moisturizers. Not a lot of product is needed to layer entire face, so this will really last a long time. I no longer use this moisturizer because I needed medicated lotion for my acne, but if I didn&#x27;t have problematic skin then this would definitely be my every day moisturizer. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Love it! Just ordered a second so I can keep one at the office. My hands are silky smooth!!</li>
