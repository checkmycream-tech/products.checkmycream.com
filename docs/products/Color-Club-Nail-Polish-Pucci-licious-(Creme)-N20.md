<ol>
      <li>Great product...as described!</li>
      <li>The quality of the polish is excellent, too!</li>
      <li>not the best for extended wear.</li>
      <li>which I LOVE!!!</li>
      <li>Beautiful color.</li>
      <li>color is beautiful and I get a ton of compliments on it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful color</li>
      <li>Great color for summer.</li>
      <li>After 3 days the polish on my nails still looked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought this and will continue to reorder it as I run out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s bright, but the guys love it too!</li>
      <li>I bring it to my nail salon, and the manicurists love the color, too!</li>
      <li>love i!</li>
      <li>But in all fairness, I love Color Club and will continue to order them!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was thrilled that Amazon had Pucci-licious.</li>
      <li>This was a very nice light purple.  </li>
      <li>and it dries quickly!!</li>
      <li>We love this nail polish.  </li>
      <li>After falling in love with this polish (that I borrowed from a friend)</li>
      <li>For those girls that love purple</li>
      <li>Better quality than china glaze.</li>
      <li>Polish was high quality and the nail brush was great.  </li>
      <li>The perfect color (a bit like a grape jellybean when dry).</li>
      <li>my girlfriend is a fabulous artist, and will work her magic with her paint to create the ORIGINAL Pucci-licious color that I fell in love with.  </li>
      <li>Love at first sight</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the color the first time I tried it.</li>
      <li>It turned out to be true for me, as well.</li>
      <li>Lucky for me</li>
      <li>I gave it four stars because it chips really quickly...</li>
      <li>I use American Classic topcoat because it leaves an amazing shine.</li>
      <li>first used this color at my local nail shop and fell in love.</li>
      <li>I thought it was my imagination at first, so I took the bottle to compare it with my girlfriends bottle...</li>
      <li>This is a KNOCK-OFF of the real Color Club Color!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been perhaps one year since I first spotted this neon color at my nail salon.</li>
      <li>Color Club Nail Polish Pucci Licious have fun, vibrant colors.  </li>
      <li>This color is such a vibrant matte color, and it looks even better with a ultra shiny topcoat.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Well, fast forward.</li>
      <li>such a vibrant color!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a ton of compliments it goes on easy and last long!</li>
      <li>The color looks good on skin tones with pink hues, brown hues, and even the red ones-like my hands from Purell and frequent washing due to my work.</li>
      <li>It is such a pretty deep lavender that has a hint of blues and fluorescent-neon.</li>
      <li>This color is less blue than the ORIGINAL and doesn&#x27;t have the same WOW factor as hers does.  </li>
      <li>Compared to the other neon Color Club polishes I have tried, this is my least favorite.</li>
      <li>I was afraid that they would run out of my new Favorite color</li>

<li> It goes on very thin and isn&#x27;t easy to apply.</li>
<li> I recommend it especially as an petal or center color when drawing flowers on your nails.</li>
<li> I had already bought two other nail polishes from this seller and jumped at the chance to purchase Pucci-licious.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed that it chips easily and soon.</li>
<li> It wears well during travel, in hot and cold weather conditions.</li>
<li> I got the purple color and it stayed on longer than my usual nail polish.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the store had none in stock, and would not be re-stocking it since it was a &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; color.  </li>
<li> This polish lasts about 3-4 days with base and topcoat, but I don&#x27;t mind because I like to change my nail color.</li>
<li> Very disappointed, since I bought FOUR bottles!  </li>

    <li> I got the purple color and it stayed on longer than my usual nail polish. After 3 days the polish on my nails still looked great.</li>
    <li> We love this nail polish.  Color Club Nail Polish Pucci Licious have fun, vibrant colors.  Thank you.  Thank you. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love at first sight&lt;br /&gt;I first used this color at my local nail shop and fell in love. I was afraid that they would run out of my new Favorite color so I went to my trusty Amazon.com and there it was !!!&lt;br /&gt;This color is beautiful and I get a ton of compliments on it. For those girls that love purple this is a must have.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a beautiful color I&#x27;ve had a ton of compliments it goes on easy and last long! Would recommend it for all skin colors.</li>
    <li> The perfect color (a bit like a grape jellybean when dry). I&#x27;m disappointed that it chips easily and soon.</li>
    <li> Compared to the other neon Color Club polishes I have tried, this is my least favorite. It goes on very thin and isn&#x27;t easy to apply. But in all fairness, I love Color Club and will continue to order them!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Better quality than china glaze.</li>
    <li> After falling in love with this polish (that I borrowed from a friend) I couldn&#x27;t wait to go and purchase a couple of bottles for myself.  Unfortunately, the store had none in stock, and would not be re-stocking it since it was a &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; color.  Where else to go but to Amazon?  And there it was, or so I thought.  This is a KNOCK-OFF of the real Color Club Color!  I thought it was my imagination at first, so I took the bottle to compare it with my girlfriends bottle...Not even the same bottle logo.  This color is less blue than the ORIGINAL and doesn&#x27;t have the same WOW factor as hers does.  Very disappointed, since I bought FOUR bottles!  Lucky for me my girlfriend is a fabulous artist, and will work her magic with her paint to create the ORIGINAL Pucci-licious color that I fell in love with.  Some things you just can&#x27;t buy online....Seeing is believing!</li>
    <li> This color is such a vibrant matte color, and it looks even better with a ultra shiny topcoat. I use American Classic topcoat because it leaves an amazing shine. I gave it four stars because it chips really quickly...not the best for extended wear. This polish lasts about 3-4 days with base and topcoat, but I don&#x27;t mind because I like to change my nail color.</li>
    <li> Everytime I wear this color, I receive compliments. I bring it to my nail salon, and the manicurists love the color, too! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this and will continue to reorder it as I run out. The quality of the polish is excellent, too!</li>
    <li> Great color for summer. Got lots of compliments. Same brand as salons use but just not thinned out like theirs is.</li>
    <li> I remember reading one comment about receiving lots of compliments while wearing this color. It turned out to be true for me, as well. The color looks good on skin tones with pink hues, brown hues, and even the red ones-like my hands from Purell and frequent washing due to my work. It wears well during travel, in hot and cold weather conditions.</li>
    <li> This was a very nice light purple.  Polish was high quality and the nail brush was great.  I recommend it especially as an petal or center color when drawing flowers on your nails.</li>
    <li> such a vibrant color!!! love i! and it dries quickly!! which I LOVE!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been perhaps one year since I first spotted this neon color at my nail salon. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the color the first time I tried it. Well, fast forward. My nail salon hasn&#x27;t had this color for the last two visits. I told them I would find the color online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled that Amazon had Pucci-licious. I had already bought two other nail polishes from this seller and jumped at the chance to purchase Pucci-licious. I got 2 of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you are looking for a knock-out color, give Pucci-licious a try. It is such a pretty deep lavender that has a hint of blues and fluorescent-neon. It&#x27;s bright, but the guys love it too!</li>
    <li> Great product...as described!</li>
