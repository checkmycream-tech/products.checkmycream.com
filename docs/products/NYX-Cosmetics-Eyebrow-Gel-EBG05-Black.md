      <li>Great dupe for Makeup Forever.</li>
      <li>Amazing product, stays on all day!</li>
      <li>Good color, use a spoolie to comb out after application...it helps reduce intensity.</li>
      <li>This gel works best when your brush is moistened with a mild makeup remover.</li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>good eyebrow gel.. love it.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>OMG I love this stuff movie star eyebrows</li>
      <li>But all in all i will be using this for life :)</li>
      <li>Great Product, and fast delivery</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, once I adjusted to it though, I love it.</li>
      <li>otherwise you will end up using more than you need to.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>it is very easy to work with but drys very quickly</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s noticeable in the light.</li>
      <li>I totally recommend it to anyone looking for a good eyebrow gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, but gets flaky if you apply too much.</li>
      <li>Hardens too quickly while applying.  </li>
      <li>so you have to move quickly.</li>
      <li>It seems gentle on the actual brows but holds up great.</li>
      <li>, so you need to work quickly.</li>
      <li>No smudging after it drys even on my super oily skin.</li>
      <li>However it is very bold and will last all day.</li>
      <li>I keep equate gentle makeup wipes nearby and swipe my brush over it before working some of the product in.</li>
      <li>Dries fast so</li>
      <li>work fast.</li>
      <li>I got the black since I find most browns to have an auburn undertone.</li>
      <li>Just dark enough for my new hair color and it blends well if you know how to apply makeup and make it look natural.</li>
      <li>Fair warning: when they say black, they mean black.</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit, but you have to work fast</li>

<li> This product is actually a very dark brown it is not black neveretheless</li>

<li> It seriously does not budge all day, even during high heat and humidity conditions.</li>
<li> just remember a little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;g know if this just depends on skin colors but mine turned out like a dark brown</li>
<li> For reference, I usually use Anastasia Dipbrow.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or do anything weird on the skin.</li>

    <li> LOOOOOOVE this!! Doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;g know if this just depends on skin colors but mine turned out like a dark brown but it&#x27;s noticeable in the light. it is smudge proof and water proof though.</li>
    <li> OMG I love this stuff movie star eyebrows yes&#x27;s please</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright brow gel in a pinch and I&#x27;ll probably use it occasionally. For reference, I usually use Anastasia Dipbrow. This gel works best when your brush is moistened with a mild makeup remover. I keep equate gentle makeup wipes nearby and swipe my brush over it before working some of the product in. Dries fast so work fast. Good color, use a spoolie to comb out after application...it helps reduce intensity.</li>
    <li> Hardens too quickly while applying.  Prefer MUFE.</li>
    <li> Great dupe for Makeup Forever. I got the black since I find most browns to have an auburn undertone. Fair warning: when they say black, they mean black. Not brown-black, or blackish brown. Black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, once I adjusted to it though, I love it.</li>
    <li> good eyebrow gel.. love it. obviously it looks less natural than a pencil but it lasts all day</li>

    <li> This eyebrow gel seems to be the product that I&#x27;m looking for but I need the espresso color. Can someone please help me?</li>
