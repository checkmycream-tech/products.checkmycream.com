<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it!!! So comfortable and easy to use</li>
    <li> I see a little difference but not what I expected.</li>
    <li> The flash was crazy and the smell of burning hair was undesirable.  I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month. On only my underarm hair because I&#x27;m currently pregnant. My underarm hair is 1/2 what it used to be. The hair that&#x27;s left is finer &amp; there are spots where I no longer grow hair anymore.  I&#x27;m very excited to see the final results. So far I would HIGHLY recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dark, course chin hair for 12 years. I made a mistake when I was a teenager and shaved....it was the worst thing I could have done. I had to shave and pluck every single day thereafter. I would spend half of my time getting ready each day on treating my problem. Twice a week, I&#x27;d spend at least 2 hours plucking. I tried all forms of hair removal and growth inhibitors. Nothing worked. I would use makeup to try and cover up the ever-noticeable 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, but I think that just helped me ignore it. I would always have breakouts from the different methods I tried, as I was always messing with my skin. I even paid for 6 professional electrolysis sessions...they didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, I decided that I needed to give it electrolysis another try, since there are inexpensive options for in-home treatment now. I cannot believe it.....the Flash&amp;Go ACTUALLY worked! After the first three sessions, I did have to continue to shave some, but plucking was a lot easier. The hair was getting softer and the frequency kept lessening. New growth started just &amp;#34;falling out&amp;#34; if I squeezed the follicle, or used a good facial scrub. After 4 treatments, all I have to do now is pluck random hairs, less than 10 total, every week or so. I have full confidence that after the 6th treatment, my problem will be merely a bad dream from the past. It already is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO glad I decided to give this device a try. It was the best $200 I&#x27;ve spent, for sure. Just make sure that you have the right skin type, and use the highest setting you can bear, right from the start. I hope this works for others as well as it worked for me! I have not tried it on other areas yet, but I will write another review when I do!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review 6 months into using the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go, and I bought it directly from the company&#x27;s website. I have been sharing this laser with my brother, his girlfriend, and myself, and between 3 people, we have not had to buy a new cartridge yet. (5,000 flashes.) We just use disinfecting wipes on the laser cartridge between uses when we share. YES, it does work. However, depending on your skin/hair color, it will work better or faster for some than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, my brother&#x27;s girlfriend is Vietnamese, so she has olive skin and black hair. It only took three sessions for her armpit hair to completely disappear. I am white with brown hair. The laser seems to work best on my legs, (probably because the hair is dark and my skin is super pale) but slowly on all other parts of my body that get more sun. Even though it is slow, I can tell that it&#x27;s working. When I let my hair grow out, there are permanent patches of bald spots where hair has not grown back for months. Since I&#x27;m 6 months in, I know that if I just keep going, the hair will eventually all go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had professional hair removal done by a dermatologist before, and it cost me $275 for only one session on just my face. I was told that I would need one session every six weeks for 5 more sessions. ($1,375.)  If I wanted only one session on my entire body, it would have been over $1,000. ($6,000+ for full body at a dermatologist.) So even though this product seems expensive, it&#x27;s really NOT. It is totally worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silk&#x27;n will probably take twice or three times as long as a dermatologist, because the at-home laser is a lot weaker, but it is gentler on the skin. (It is hot, and stings, but not as painful as the professional laser.)  I also don&#x27;t have to worry about the embarrassment of lasering my bikini area at a dermatologist, and I know I have this laser for the rest of my life- to lend to friends, etc.I love it..</li>
    <li> This is so much better than I ever dreamed! So I have dark brown(almost black) hair that&#x27;s very thin, but extremely dense and olive skin tone. Get what I&#x27;m saying? I have thin hair, but disgusting amounts of it. I used this once and I let my hair grow back for about 3 weeks, I had tiny little patches of hair completely gone! It blew my mind!! I&#x27;ve only used this twice now and have reduced my hair by like 80% I&#x27;m buying one for my sister for her birthday, I never thought this would work so well!</li>
    <li> Half year past. It is proved that it doesn&#x27;t have any long term effect to my hair....they all grow back</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Flash and Go three times and I&#x27;ve seen a significant reduction in hair growth (facial)!! I&#x27;ve bought the other more expensive competitor a few years ago. This is so much better!! Glad I found and gave it a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. She has noticeably finer, lighter hairs in some areas, and in some areas (upper lip, etc), there is no new hair growth that we can see. I was skeptical, but this thing seemingly works, although she&#x27;s not had it that long. It makes her happy, so I&#x27;m happy with it. UPDATE : My wife has used this for about 6 months now, with great results ! She used to have to pluck her face daily. She now does so about every 2 weeks. Most hairs are either gone or much lighter and finer. So far she has only used it on the lower settings (2). She has PCOS, so this is a wonderful device for her!</li>
    <li> unfortunately bad experiment</li>
    <li> Had six sessions and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I feel like I&#x27;m the perfect candidate(fair skin, dark hair) but this did not work for me.</li>
    <li> SO far so good, I have totally noticed a difference in the coarseness of my hair! Looking forward to a smooth hairless body parts next year at this time!</li>
    <li> I purchased this Item and I will review because of 2 things one its not cheap second im not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using for 4 months as indicated it does not do anything plus every time i use it irritates my skin and i break out, hair comes back again save your money and look for something else</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with the correct cord to plug into the wall. It came with a european cord, so i had to also purchase an adaptor, so have &#x27;t actually used it yet, as the adaptor finally came in yesterday.</li>
    <li> Bullsh*t. I&#x27;ve had it just over a week, used it twice AND IT DIED. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and I love it!!  I&#x27;m tan-skinned with dark black hair and it worked really well on the highest setting.  It worked as well as the professional laser I&#x27;ve had done before.  I&#x27;ve done two sessions so far and noticed a huge difference in the amount of hair regrowth.  It&#x27;s super easy to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt (slight sting but nothing bad at all).  This is definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the TRIA I used to have (it died after 4 yrs) that I used on my legs and had just started needing it for my &#x27;goatee&#x27; I seem to be growing as a 46 y.o. female. Gross. Anyway, I have noticed a slight decrease in the growth rate of my goatee. When it zaps the hair root, it feels like a tiny sting. Not unbearable, and no worse than the TRIA laser (IMHO). But this one smells bad when you zap hair, the TRIA had zero smell.</li>
    <li> On the areas that I had laser hair removal professionally done, it seems to working as a maintenance procedure. But on my chin and lip area which I have never had professionally done, no results yet. My skin is very fair and the hair on chin and lip are jet black. So it should have worked by now…nothing yet.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the comments on this product and I bought it expecting this to be a miracle worker. I have used a whole cartage,  with no visible results. I feel stupid for buying it.</li>
    <li> Machine is useless..would not recommend...</li>
    <li> I bought this device from Kohl&#x27;s.I used it on 3 or 4 different occasions and I notices the device stops after 5 pulses in a row.Then it has to be restarted.Out of all 5 pulse only the first one has a bright light.The rest don&#x27;t light up at all.I assume it&#x27;s the lamp that&#x27;s defective.The customer service is almost non existent.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I eventually exchanged the device for a good one at no extra cost. I&#x27;ve been using it on and off and I it does what&#x27;s supposed to do.I noticed a significant hair reduction on my legs.The skin looks smoother.No more ingrown hairs and scars.The more you use it the better results.</li>
    <li> Love it, works great so far. Will update after some time.</li>
    <li> I may have to come back &amp; edit this review but for now, I&#x27;m sold on this product for small areas! I have paid high dollar for laser hair removal on my underarms which are almost hair free, my upper lip which was not, my bikini... &amp; my lower legs... I started using this on my upper lip first &amp; am shocked that after a few months, it is totally hair free! It was not all that hairy to begin but I would say average for women in her 30&#x27;s. I&#x27;m light skinned with dark hair. It really zapped your upper lip but totally bearable but I knew what to expect. I am definitely going to try out on other areas &amp; consider the Sensepil which treats a larger space if I begin to have success in other areas. I HATE shaving!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this from another website but I truly do enjoy this!  I have only done half of one leg to compare if it is working and there is truly a difference after only 2 uses!  I am very pale - hoping to continue the change!  It does say it can up to a year however based upon hair growth but I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> This was junk, I had to return it ASAP. It dd not do one thing it said it would. After two times it never worked again. I can&#x27;t say it enough this is the biggest waste of money. JUNK, JUNK,  JUNK, JUNK , JUNK I CANT SAY IT ENOUGH ok one more time JUNK.</li>
    <li> the yellow lite gets a little frustrating</li>
    <li> works great so far but have not seen results as far as hair loss...</li>
    <li> Just got this product. Very disappointed I cannot try it out, it came with European plugins only. Now I have to wait for an adapter. Come on they shipped it to the US.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after a month and a half, just outside of the return window.</li>
    <li> Works great MAMA loves it</li>
    <li> Not sure of its working really i have had laser hair removel on my face before and it was very good this doesn&#x27;t seem to be powerful enough. Maybe it will just take longer but not sure I want to wait for years of doing it that&#x27;s why I want to get rid of the hair soo am free to get on with my life without having to deal with it shaving might be faster at this point so in saying that I might return this because they don&#x27;t even give u enough time to find out if it would work before U have to return it and to me that&#x27;s just bad business and a way to get people&#x27;s money maybe it works better for some then others but I have a lot of hair problems and im telling you if u do probably not the best thing for you in the pic I put up U can see what it did to my chin but the hair is still growing</li>
    <li> It really does the job! Maybe some people can take longer than other to see the results, but for my hair/skin I could see the results after the second session.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for me. Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I must first say that I have no liaison with this company nor have have I received a free device or monetary compensation for this review.&lt;br /&gt;I must also say that I have had about 6 professionally done laser treatments on my legs and bikini area by the time I started using this device.  I did however, still had thick black hair growing everywhere (it was even worse before the professional treatments).  I have done about 4 full body treatments with this device and I can certainly notice the difference.  It&#x27;s not as effective as professionally done treatments with a good aesthetician, however, for the price and convenience of not having to make appointments and pose naked in front of someone it&#x27;s well worth it.  You have to be attentive and thorough when zapping yourself.  You must realize that the lamp area isn&#x27;t as big as the entire head of the machine so there will be a margin area that will not get zapped.  The more surface area that you leave unzapped, the poorer your results will be.  So it&#x27;s up to you to be thorough without over-zapping yourself and potentially damaging your skin.  I like to use a pen to create grids on my skin so that I know where i have zapped and where I have not.  Call me anal but this is how you will get the best results.  Expect about 10-20% hair reduction per session.  Be realistic and patient.  Do not expect to be completely hair free in a couple of months.  Give yourself about a year of well-performed treatments (depending on your hair type) and you will see great results!  I have dark long hairs on my arms (which did not have previous professional treatments) and after 4 treatments with this device I&#x27;ve had about 40% hair reduction, which I&#x27;m quite happy about.  I would have given this device 5 stars if it was a tad bit more effective, you didn&#x27;t have to wait 3 seconds between zaps, and if the head did not have a margin of plastic around the lamp which makes it trickier to measure the zap area.  I&#x27;m overall happy with my purchase and do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I always used the highest zap setting on all my treatments and I cannot attest for any of the other settings!</li>
    <li> I bought my flash n go about 8 months ago and used it once a week for 8 months with no reduction on my face whatsoever. I am fair skinned with dark brown hair so I am a candidate. I am really frustrated that I wasted so much time and money and got no results. I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> wish it worked on lighter hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this and received it the following day...I was a bit leary and wanted to see if it worked so I did my left leg and underarm for the past six weeks, so I could see if it was working ...now I am wishing I had done both sides there is a definite difference in the two sides.  I did use it more often than every two weeks,  as I am impatient and wanted to see results quick...so far I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> First off, I have light skin and dark hair. So I&#x27;m pretty much an ideal candidate, and can&#x27;t really speak to the effectiveness for people with darker skin or lighter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had professional last hair removal before, on my legs. It worked quite well, but after about 6 years I&#x27;ve started to get regrowth in small patches. I&#x27;ve also for many years wanted to address other areas of my body, but can&#x27;t afford the investment in professional treatments. I was able to get a good deal on this unit over the holidays and decided to roll the dice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I won! My under-arm area is significantly improved after 5 treatments. Hair is growing back much more slowly, and most of the regrowth is finer. Areas with darker skin and lighter hair (eg: my face) do not show as significant an improvement, but I&#x27;m still seeing some improvement there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and given a complexion and hair color similar to mine, I have to say ... go for it!</li>
    <li> I keep trying but the hair keeps growing. My hair is very light blond and I never noticed that it might not work. I just saw I should have good luck because my skin is so fair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months now, just on my face and one arm (so I would have a good comparison to see if it&#x27;s working). The arm I&#x27;ve been using it on is noticeably less hairy, so it does seem to work! You just have to stick with it and be patient. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference on my face, but I have to admit to some plucking in between sessions, so that could be the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, it&#x27;s easy to use, quiet, and I haven&#x27;t any trouble with burns (I&#x27;ve had it on 4 for both arm and face) or discomfort. As other reviewers have noted, this really should be used with eye protection! Also be aware of pets- their eyes can be damaged, too!</li>
    <li> Will not eliminate hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for six months now - once a week at least on various parts of my body.  I am fair skinned with dark hair - perfect right? I have gone through two heads now and I can tell you this is not a hair removal device.  This is a TEMPORARY hair removal device.  I can go longer in between without shaving but the hair still comes back.  I was hoping for a permanent solution to the hair problem.  This is not it.  I honestly don&#x27;t think it permanently removes ANY hair, it just grows back so slowly it gives the illusion that it does.  But it is always always growing back.  And the heads are so expensive - I&#x27;m going to give it up and save up for a laser.</li>
    <li> I have been so pleased!  I have used this on my face and underarms. For facial hair removal it will take several months or quite possibly a year but that&#x27;s ok.  The stray hairs that I get on my chin have been greatly reduced and when they come in now they are a much lighter color if not white now. When I have used it in my underarms it has worked much more quickly in slowing the hair growth. Love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product , i had a very hairy skin, but using this for over a year now, i lost 95% of  the hair after several times, and the growing hair is very soft and unseen. I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:&lt;br /&gt;• I’ve used it eight times per their instructions/schedule, and it seems to work mostly (I’ve noticed some difference).&lt;br /&gt;• I’ve had professional intense-light-pulse (ILP) hair removal from a dermatologist, and their equipment does work better, but it far more intense, painful, and costly.  This home system seems to work, but will take longer to get end-results because of repetitive needed sessions due to lower light intensity output (compared to a dermatologist office).  Basically, it will take longer (more sessions) for you to get your wanted results.&lt;br /&gt;• You do not need to waste money on eye protection for this device; the light output is too low.  Although not necessary, I simply close my eyes before each blast.&lt;br /&gt;• I have always used the most intense level/setting on the device (5).  If you use a lesser setting, I highly suspect it will take you even longer (more sessions) to achieve your wanted results.  Even on level-5, the pain from the pulse is almost non-existent (especially compared to the dermatologist’s office where you MUST using numbing cream or else you would be in high pain).&lt;br /&gt;• The unit comes with a 5k-pulse cartridge attached, and the device will allegedly alert you to when you only have 100 pulses left.  I have already ordered a 1k-pulse replacement cartridge ($25) to ensure I’m not stopped mid-session.&lt;br /&gt;• You need to shave your targeted hair down as much as possible immediately prior to a session because an extended hair absorbs/wastes energy from the pulse and also creates a burning smell from the hair.&lt;br /&gt;• Instructions warn that you should not go over the same area twice in one session, but I have with no concerns because (again) the pulses are not powerful enough (to me) to cause damage/burns (compared to the dermatologist’s office).  I believe they say don’t go over twice in once session in order to legally protect themselves (as a burn is possible in ultra-sensitive areas), but I’ve had no problems.  That said, you should always follow manufacturer’s instructions (my legal disclaimer/protection).&lt;br /&gt;• Some say they have had negligible results following the instructed 2-week schedule, and they have increased the session schedule to about once-a-week.  I believe you will have to observe your skin/hair reaction and make adjustments as needed; one plan may not fit all.&lt;br /&gt;• The device works best on fair-skinned dark-haired people.  It will not work on dark-skinned people or people with grey or blond hair.&lt;br /&gt;• Yes, I would recommend the product to a friend.areas), but I’ve had no problems.

    <li> 4th treatment and no results yet</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
    <li> This was a complete waste of money. I used this several times exactly as the directions say and saw absolutely no results. Not only is this product expensive but buying the replacement cartridges are very expensive. I prefer to just get a Groupon for somewhere that will do it professionally. You get better results and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this was actually very easy, I bought glasses to project my eyes from the flash, HDE Laser Eye Protection Safety Glasses. You just plug this in wait for it to heat up I guess, only takes a minute or so and then you press the button to zap your skin. The zaps aren&#x27;t as quick as they could be, it takes about 3-5 seconds between each one. That doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot but it adds a lot of time to how long it should take to do this.</li>
    <li> I am a scientist.  I followed the directions and for 8 weeks, I used the device on FULL POWER on all my parts.  Legs, Face, Bikini.  I followed directions- and I only treated my RIGHT side, thinking I would be able to see thinning hair, smoother skin, etc.  After the 5th full body treatment, I realized NOTHING had improved on any region of my body!  I called the laser removal place in town and had immediate results wtiht the first treatment.  Save yourself some money, ladies, (and well groomed gents) and go get your hair professionally removed with industrial medical quality instruments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin color is pale white with dark med hair:  This should have worked if the device was effective.  It was not.</li>
    <li> this oneburned my face ,but it also said not to use it on dark skin so.... there you go.</li>
    <li> I bought this on here a couple of years ago. I am so mad ,i wasted over $200.00 dollars on this. I tried every few weeks and it did nothing but hurt. I read all the reviews and was sold. This does not work and I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.</li>
    <li> This product works amazingly. Only used for 2 months and already showing a dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> I too read all the reviews on the Silk&#x27;n site before purchasing the Flash&amp;Go Luxx.  Based on so many people&#x27;s confirmations of fast results I was happy to spend the $300 versus a thousand+ on laser treatments.  So far I am only mildly impressed.  I have very fair skin and dark, coarse hair and expected better results.  I started my first treatment on June 20th and completed my 7th in October I am at a loss.  Based on their instruction book, after treatment 7, &amp;#34;treat as needed until desired results are achieved.&amp;#34;  Um how about if no results are achieved up until this point, what is your idea of &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; should I do it daily?  I fully expected to be hairless by now, well shame on me.  After following the instructions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and completing more than 7 treatments, I contacted their customer service and was told to continue treating the smaller areas weekly and leaving larger areas to monthly.  So I have been continuing my underarms, face and bikini line weekly, still no change.  My legs seem to slowly be getting patches of hairless skin but I am well past their 8th treatment mark.  Apparently it may take a year or more for me to actually be hair free if this product is going to fulfill its functionality.  My video review can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;IDqwVFZfXyA&amp;list&#x3D;UUqUwuEvVFeQmHEX7283BCfQ   ***Over a year later***  I find my legs are showing the most change, but still not hairless by any means.  My underarms don&#x27;t seem to have any result and yet I am doing them weekly along with my bikini area.  I&#x27;m hoping eventually it will do something, but how long do I need to keep this up?  Forever?  Surely my hair growth cycles aren&#x27;t that out of whack, at some point this product should work!</li>
    <li> This product really works.  My wife loves it!!!</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I followed the directions to a T and had no results.</li>
    <li> after reading all info.sounds scary and a big pain. sending back</li>
    <li> As someone who&#x27;s had laser hair removal over the years I can verify that It works nearly as well as going to a professional and is less painful.&lt;br /&gt;Benefits being less cost than having someone else do it. You&#x27;re free to use it pretty much anywhere on your body and you do it on YOUR own time.&lt;br /&gt;The only set back in my expectations of it is that due to safety features (needed of course) you&#x27;re unable to access smaller areas because the laser must make full contact with the skin so it doesn&#x27;t emit harmful light to parts/or unwanted areas for laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT! 😊</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on people of color. SUCKS!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me from my Christmas wish list in 2014. I have used it faithfully for the last 6 months and it simply does not work. I&#x27;m the poster child for the skin and hair color this apparently works best for. I have very fair skin and dark brown/black hair. But unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything, absolutely nothing for my facial (chin) hair. I regret asking for this, at the time of purchase it was $279 and for that amount it should have done something, anything. I wanted to give it fair try and I was hoping it would work so I kept using it for 6 months.  I wish I had given up hope sooner so I could have returned it for a refund. Now I&#x27;m down almost 300 bucks and still using a tweezer ;-(  Don&#x27;t waste your money and time, pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Been using Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go for 6 weeks and I getting great results. More of the areas I use it on, the hair is taking longer to grow back. Can&#x27;t wait to see full results!!!</li>
    <li> this morning june 5, the unit falied to work as advertised...under warranty i want to return it and have it replaced</li>
    <li> thanks. product was on time</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this device. You do have to accept when you buy it you are never gonna get rid of every hair--it&#x27;s more for hair reduction, and to reduce shaving. I have used it every 2 weeks for about 4 months and have had very significant hair reduction in the bikini line, armpits, neck/facial hair. I do have fair skin and dark hair, so it works really well. I find it works best on the thick, coarse hairs--the finer hairs stick around, but they are harder to see anyway.  It has 3 settings you can try.  I mostly use the 1st and 2nd settings as the 3rd is a little too painful for some areas. After struggling with dark hair for so long, I wish I had bought it sooner! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Not powerful enough to really be effective. Needs multiple treatments to eventually be effective.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the results of my normal thickness hairs. It works great. I have a few thick hairs that no matter how high I put the setting, it won&#x27;t touch them. So basically, if you have normal thickness hairs I would expect you to be pleased with the results. I do have a hard time getting to the area directly under  my nose over the upper lip, but since there is barely any hair there, this is not an issue for me. The area it does at a time is small so it does take some time. For that reason I haven&#x27;t done it too religiously on my legs and under arms, but I get the feeling (based on the results thus far) that it actually would work. I tried it on someone&#x27;s upper lip who is mixed ethnicity and it actually worked. She only let me do it once, so I can&#x27;t say the long term results, but I figure I should mention it does work if not too dark. Also, I didn&#x27;t shave, I am terrified to do that on my face. I used cuticle clippers and trimmed the hair right down to my face and it seems to work as well as shaving. I think the point is not to have hair there.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I purchased this product.  Well, it has exceeded my expectations.  It works great!</li>
    <li> Works extremely well- I have saved over 5k on laser hair removal. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!</li>
    <li> My wife used this device for 6 months.  During that time the cartridge had to be replaced at additional cost.  Ripoff.  How can a laser light only last 6 months.  This product is a scam to make you buy the cartridge twice a year.</li>
    <li> Very good. Recommended item.</li>
    <li> I have done 5 full body passes with the device so far and have fair to good results. I have very fair but yellow / olive tone skin and am using it on areas with very dark brown to black hair. Since it could be too early to know if I get 5 star results, I will update this review if need be. Also note that I used it on the highest setting on every area and did my treatments about 5 days apart and may have over lapped treatments in areas because I had no way to mark what I did and did not do. So I defaulted to &amp;quot;over doing it&amp;quot; a bit. I had no adverse reactions on my skin and only the bikini and arm pit areas had any pain which went way in about 3 to 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Full area of leg below the knee: Hair type coarse dark brown:80% of hair very slow to grow back in. 20% grows as normal.&lt;br /&gt;Back of thighs: Hair Type: Sparse coarse black hair. 90% gone!&lt;br /&gt;Under Arms: Hair Type: Coarse Dark brown: Only 20% hair reduction&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area: Hair Type: Very coarse black and brown: Only 15% reduction in the tenderest regions and about 30% in the outer areas.&lt;br /&gt;Still pretty happy with the results. I get terrible eczema from shaving and the joy I have from not having to shave as much is great. I als noticed when I do shave my eczema is not aggravated any more! Over all a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> so far so good  cannot give 5 stars yet as have not used enough  but ease of use is great  i only got the 5000 pulses  and know i am going to need repacement head later for lower legs  can you tell me where to order one  again i really love this product but have only used twice so i do not expect immediate results  thanks much  commited user  b lowell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using now about a month. I use it everyday and it works. I have been shaving my face and chin for over 20 years. Tried every hair removal created. There is just less and less hair to do each couple of days. No discomfort.  I&#x27;ve found my miracle.</li>
    <li> This has work wonderful.  I use to shave my legs every day after a few weeks, I am just shaving whatever&#x27;s left so I can use it again on any new hair growth.  I am blonde, but it is still working for me. I use it every where from face to toed</li>
    <li> If you follow directions, this product is amazing. I highly recommend this. I spent 1500 on professional laser and the Silk&#x27;n gives the same results for a way better price. I love it. Complete opposite from the No-No.</li>
    <li> If you hate shaving, this is the gadget for you! BUT it cautions that it is not for darker-skinned people--I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get rid of facial hair for 20 years. Plucking, waxing, laser treatment, another hair removal machine I hated, electrolysis, some other thing, laser plucking I forget what it&#x27;s called... I kept it under control but never got rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had flash and go for about a year. I love it! My hair is nearly gone. Even on the chin area, which is the most stubborn the hair is nearly all gone. Some days I forget to shave and my chin is not full of hair by 3pm. I have to actually look for the hair now.&lt;br /&gt;I was zapping the hair every two weeks as the directions say, then I went to once a week. Now I do it whenever I think to do it but never more than once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I spent thousands of dollars over many years trying to get rid of facial hair. $200.00 and one year with flash and go and I&#x27;m nearly hair free. Finally</li>
    <li> I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I have had the product for one month, and I definitely see a difference. I wanted to use it before shorts season. I am Asian, with a medium skintone, and dark hair. I also suffer from keratosis pilaris, which made/makes me uncomfortable with baring my legs too often. I purchased the Tria when it first came out. It was very expensive, but I was willing to try anything to try and get rid of my bumpy legs. I was able to successfully use the Tria on my underarms, but it was too painful, and the treatment area was too small, to use on my legs. On level 5, the Flash &amp; Go is slightly unpleasant on my legs, but bearable. The treatment area is also larger. I did not follow the schedule. I wanted results as fast as possible. I&#x27;ve used it maybe 6 times in a month. There is much less hair, and I don&#x27;t want to jinx it, but my legs area a lot smoother in texture as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this a 3 so far because I don&#x27;t know the results yet. But it&#x27;s very easy and fast to use. I&#x27;m using on my bikini area. I&#x27;ve put it up to the max level (3) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s just startling. And it only takes me about 4 minutes.  I will need to figure some things out though--I&#x27;m not sure how long I&#x27;ll be able to use this until I need to replace the cartridge and not sure how long it will take me to see results, I&#x27;m sure everyone is different.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will live up to it&#x27;s reputation.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier to use.</li>
    <li> I love not having to shave anymore. Works great on bikini area and under arms</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sad one recent hardware which I bought not work all lights are burning laser it was the fourth time that bought the device and not I&#x27;m having a similar problem, what should I do help me</li>
    <li> Item seems to be what it claims to be.  Fast shipping. No complaints</li>
    <li> Works great for what I bought it for.  No complaints</li>
    <li> Started seeing results after the second treatment on my legs. Some hair was much more sparse and took about twice as long to grow back. I should mention that I started the process in winter when I have the palest of skin on my legs and I have very dark hair so I was the ideal candidate for the best results. It starts to grow back in some patchy areas as not all hairs have the same growth cycle. I use white eyeliner before I shave to mark the areas to be sure to sure to pay extra attention to. I had no pain when using it on level 5 on my legs, however, on the dark skin on my underarms it was a bit painful at a level 3.</li>
    <li> I really like this product</li>
    <li> Did not notice any decrease in hair.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this and sees the results after 6 weeks!!!</li>
    <li> Over priced and doesn&#x27;t work like it should.  Don&#x27;t waste a dime on the product.  It is a purchase I regret and now I am stuck with it and out nearly $200.00.</li>
    <li> I returned this product under the belief that it simply wasn&#x27;t safe for use. The FDA approval means literally nothing. Tried the device a few times on the lowest setting. Of course I didn&#x27;t see results- I didn&#x27;t use it long enough! However,  the side effects from using it on level 1 are obviously a precursor for worse things to come. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone who has sensitive skin, little patience, or a legitimate need to remove hair. Go see a dermatologist and get some cream instead.</li>
    <li> Delivery wasn&#x27;t 2 day delivery as i expected. Other than that i like the device. It is easy to use and hopefully will work</li>
    <li> It does what it claims if you have time to spend an hour or more every other week using it.</li>
    <li> Still using it and still waiting for results!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately after 2 months of using this product on my face and neck, I noticed no reduction in the hair growth.  I have light skin and thick black hair so I am the ideal candidate for this type of hair removal.  I did it once a week immediately after shaving for 1 month.  After 1 month I decided to try it a day after shaving so that there was more hair to attract the light, but still no effect.  Once I started doing it a day after shaving when my hair was longer, I smelled burned hair but still no reduction in hair growth.  I think it just depends on the person, but enough people have had success so I think it would be worth a try. I recommend buying it in store or amazon so that you can return it within 90 days if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and I don&#x27;t notice any difference in hair growth.  Will continue to use and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;With that I give it 3 stars.  An in the middle review for now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like I just using two time no work no more&lt;br /&gt;😔😔</li>
    <li> I am only giving this two stars.  My husband purchased this for me as a birthday present because it was what I told him I wanted.  I don&#x27;t think it hurt as much as I have heard going to a spa and getting hair removal does.... However, I do not think it was as effective either.  I used it in all areas at full strength (legs, underarms, nether regions) and found that while I did notice delayed growth in terms of the hair growing back after shaving as well as thinned hair on my legs, I didn&#x27;t experience Hair &amp;#34;Removal&amp;#34; which is how this is marketed.  I used it consistently once a week for 6-8 months and finally gave up on the thing.  I have fair skin with dark hair which is supposed to be ideal for this product so I am not sure what the deal is... Read my other reviews and you will see that I am very generous with the stars... either save your dollars and put towards spa treatment or save your time and spend shaving... Because ultimately that is what you&#x27;ll have to do.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 6/7/15&lt;br /&gt;I did register this product through Silk&#x27;n so I sent them an email saying what happened. They wanted to know where I purchased it from and when I told them Amazon they wanted to know who the seller was. When I told them Amazon was the seller they said that was fine and that I needed to fax them a receipt of the purchase which I did. They sent me a email with the paid shipping info to ship to them. A couple of weeks later with no email I received another unit in the mail. It works! I honestly don&#x27;t know if this was a new unit or if they fixed mine. I guess I need to look for the serial number again to see. I am happy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back in January 2015. Up until now I absolutely loved it. Most of my leg hair is gone and some of the hair on my bikini line is going away in spots. Not much happening with underarm hair yet but it seems to be getting less hair growing but not sure yet. Anyway like I said it was great until I tried to use it today and I heard a very loud pop! Then heard glass moving around inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I though that maybe I had used up the flash cartridge so when I removed it I see that the glass is still intact but I still hear broken glass inside the unit. When I turn it sideways broken glass falls out the side of the holes where the fan runs. I&#x27;m sure this is not normal!!! The Flash &amp; Go also was flashing yellow then green when I tried to use it today and it would not flash. I thought maybe it caught a shadow and thought my skin was too dark so I moved it to another part of my skin and it flashed yellow and that&#x27;s when the loud pop happened then a little bit of smoke came out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for now I cannot recommend this item because it should last a lot longer than this. I am going to try and contact the company to see how they respond. I&#x27;m sure they will try to weasel out of it. I will update my review when I get a response from them. I tried to call their 800 number but it&#x27;s after hours so I sent an email. Their website said they will respond within two business days if possible. I will try to call tomorrow but it&#x27;s Good Friday so they might be closed.ithin two business days if possible. I will try to call tomorrow but it&#x27;s Good Friday so they might be closed.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for me</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had any luck with my hair leaving yet, but i&#x27;m still gonna keep trying,  i&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 or 7 months now.</li>
    <li> Did not function as advertised for me.  I am male but laser hair removal is working, so perhaps not powerful enough.  Hard to say.  Tried it for three months to give it fair chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use, wish it worked.</li>
    <li> This is beginning to work for me</li>
    <li> I have a hormonal disorder that causes me to have a lot of very coarse black hair. I&#x27;ve had hairy arms since high school, I have to shave my legs and underarms daily, and I usually have to use depilatory on my chin/lip weekly. I could tell a huge difference after just one treatment with this tool, and over time the results have been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is to make the treatment area bigger, so it would take less time. It gets monotonous and takes a long time, but if you have the patience, this thing will work.</li>
    <li> Easy to use so far. Just started using it and I am excited. I went up to just lvl 2 and felt a little heat but that&#x27;s it. My skin is light for an Asian so this should work fairly well for me.</li>
    <li> Still have to shave every other day. Gives results but not near as dramatic as the advertisement would have you think. Covers a very small area with one flash, so I see the bulb having to be replaced very soon. On the plus side, it really slows down growth.</li>
    <li> This is not an immediate fix by any standard.  I am a pale white male with pitch black hair and lots of it.  I bought this mainly for my face but decided to test it on my armpits as well.  My face has had no noticable changes over the course of three months.  The only thing I can see it do is create a layer of bleached hair so I think if I can keep this up it will eventually have an affect.  I think that part of the issue is that I get a lot of sun due to my work and hobbies so that may affect my result.  My armpits are another story.  Before if I didnt shave they could be long enough to stick out of my shirt.  Now it takes forever for them to grow back and when they do it is very thinned out.  A perfect result for 3 months.</li>
    <li> I would rank this product higher - it did thin my hair out and lessen my shaving but it stopped working after 6 weeks. I then went through a merry little dance with the customer service people - calling, emailing, calling again, emailing again...The bottom line is this: Unless you buy from them directly, they do not honor the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m out $175. Don&#x27;t you be foolish either.</li>
    <li> The site says its not suitable for dark skin tones. I started to buy but oh well! Not for Carmel to dark skin tones... THUMBS DOWN!</li>
    <li> The people at Silk&#x27;n have the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.  Seriously... TERRIBLE.  It took me a month and a half to receive this product, and I only ended up receiving it because I filed a claim with Amazon, which they granted (Amazon &#x3D; amazing; Silk&#x27;n &#x3D; horrible).  The two customer service reps I spoke to were missing a sensitivity chip and instead of just apologizing for the mistake, argued, told me they couldn&#x27;t do anything for me, etc. and then when I said that I felt that they were being rude, said &amp;#34;Oh really?  How am I being rude?&amp;#34;  COME ON PEOPLE, you&#x27;re in a customer service industry!!!!  The worst.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Works good although I do notice a reduction in the amount of time I have to shave, it has not as of yet removed the hair. Ive done about 5 or 6 sessions on the spot and I used to have to shave daily, now its only weekly. I do however have very thick hair so that could be why its not completely effective. I would definitely refer this product though.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery but unfortunately this product hasn&#x27;t helped me to the degree I was hoping.</li>
    <li> worked ok.. seemed to be working, at least.. about 3 months, bought a replacement cartridge and bam. done, dead, useless. and they won&#x27;t recognize it/replace/etc/ if you buy anywhere except directly from them.</li>
    <li> I noticed much difference but i am still using it, i mean the hair is much thinner and i shave much less than before but still waiting for the final results, hopefully the hair will be gone forever.</li>
    <li> Slows hair growth down it seems but doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of it completely</li>
    <li> I purchased this from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The box was intact and unopened. I assembled it exactly as instructed. It worked for 5 pulses of light and then turned off and the change bulb light came on along with the malfunction button. I am pale white with black hair (recommended skin/hair tone). Ridiculous amount of money to spend for something so poorly constructed. I&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews here and was somewhat hesitant about buying this but I wanted to try it. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times for hair on my face and it&#x27;s been amazing! I used it on the medium settings and I haven&#x27;t had any hair on my lip grow back in over a week and a half, it feels like I got it waxed! I&#x27;m very happy with how it worked on the facial hair but on my legs the hair is coarser so I&#x27;m expecting it to take longer to get the same results. I will update after I&#x27;ve been able to use on coarser hair.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for a year and have followed the directions and used the highest level and have not received any of the expected results. I am really disapointed in the money i spent for nothing. I have managed to use only 2 cartridges because I am only using this on my armpits &amp; bikini area. I have too fine/blonde hair to use on my legs and arms, but the arm pits should have been the perfect canidates. There are lots of good reviews out there which is why i purchased this in the first place, but it just didnt work for me :(</li>
    <li> I am fair skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months now and no results at all. I have it at the lowest and i got burned many times. I used it the way it was instructed but doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> i am still zapping and hair is still growing back.  one month now.  but it is not as bad.  so i am still zapping maybe one day.</li>
    <li> Ive had this product since 2012 and forgot I had it,I finally dug it out and after my first use on my neck I can already see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2x but I am pretty sure I can see a change already.  I have the perfect fair skin and dark hair for this.&lt;br /&gt;Virtually pain free too.</li>
    <li> I am excited to see how this works. I have had different professional IPL hair removal treatments that worked well, but still have some regrowth after 8 years. This is so much more convienent and cost effective. I just did my first treatment and will fill you in after 3 months. *added 4-11-15  I don&#x27;t see any results and its been 2 weeks. I&#x27;m not sure how long it takes for the treated hairs to fall out but was hoping I&#x27;d see some changes. *added on June 30,2015:  I&#x27;m sorry to say I see virtually no hair reduction at all.  I really can&#x27;t believe that I have hair that is resistant to treatment since I have had success with professional reduction treatments.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. I give it one star because you have to give a star to leave feedback.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t last more than 2 months before it completely stopped working. Won&#x27;t turn on and I barely used it. Too expensive for the poor quality.</li>
    <li> Really, Really wanted this to work.  I bought it in February and have been using it as stated.  I didn&#x27;t see any hair loss.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received this for Christmas of 2012 &amp; was elated. I immediately read the instructions and began zapping away. I did it first every two weeks per the instructions, but after around 3-6 months without results, increased to weekly. This was tough because the instructions recommended only zapping after shaving, not tweezing or waxing, so I actually became hairier initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted customer service around that time, concerned my laser wasn&#x27;t working. They reluctantly shipped me a replacement (only after asking why I hadn&#x27;t used the laser DAILY, despite that NOT being on the suggested instructions), &amp; my enthusiasm returned. Maybe now I&#x27;d see some results - any! Alas, the answer was a resounding NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product since receipt, but I have noticed absolutely zero impact of these laser sessions. I&#x27;ve always used the highest setting, and lately been doing it daily everywhere (under arms, bikini, face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice that each area I zap, the laser randomly &amp; unexplainedly gets stronger for one or two shots (one or two zaps in a row make me jump in unanticipated pain) but it goes back to tolerable zaps after, only to pop back again one or two more times before I&#x27;m done. I don&#x27;t know what to make of this, or whether the voltage actually changes or just seems to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding insult to this extremely expensive paper weight is the fact that the laser cartridge does not last nearly 1,000 zaps. I just inserted a new cartridge less than 10 days ago, for example, &amp; it went out today. While I did not count zaps, I highly doubt I used 1,000 in less than 10 sessions (if face, arms &amp; bikini each used 25 zaps, that&#x27;s 75 a day. If I&#x27;d lasted 10 days, I should&#x27;ve had at least 750, hence 250 or 25% left. Nope)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed because other comments show practically instant results (to some degree, at least) &amp; I gave up using my money for REAL laser sessions on this ineffective device. Now I&#x27;ve lost 1.5 years trying to eliminate facial hair before going Gray (and it becomes hard to impossible to achieve then)....I wish I could turn back the clock and just pay for professional laser sessions that would actually WORK.ng to eliminate facial hair before going Gray (and it becomes hard to impossible to achieve then)....I wish I could turn back the clock and just pay for professional laser sessions that would actually WORK.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for 5 months. It keeps turning itself off. I have not been satisfied with the results in this time. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing what it is supposed to do. Amazon claims I can&#x27;t return it after 30 days and Silkn won&#x27;t take it back unless it was sold through an authorized seller. So I&#x27;m stuck with a $200 piece of junk? Thanks Amazon. There is supposed to be a one year warranty on this product. Good luck actually applying that if you have problems with the unit.</li>
    <li> Honestly I follow the directions and have used this for almost 3 months with no sign of hair removal or the end result I should be seeing!!!!  Disappointed greatly!</li>
    <li> Happy I bought a replacement cartridge! along with my purchase. It was suppose to come with 5,000 pulses. I got exactly 8 before it went dead!&lt;br /&gt;Just enough to do both arm pits. I&#x27;m hoping the replacement cartridge  will deliver 1,000 pulses as stated.</li>
    <li> Returned . Did not function.</li>
    <li> Update: I am adding a star today. I  have been using at full strength and am seeing some real results in my underarms and forearms. I have not seen much progress on my legs. However, even at full strength in a sensitive area it doesn&#x27;t hurt. It does burn for a moment and it doesn&#x27;t feel good, but I&#x27;ve never dreaded doing it.  Update: I got a replacement device. It works in terms of turning on and functioning. It is still painless and comfortable to use - but in all fairness I have waxed for years so pain is not usually my concern. I will update as I go  I bought one less than a week ago. I am already going to return because it is defective. I got a total of maybe 5 flashes before it stopped working. I will say this: it didn&#x27;t hurt (when it worked). So while I might get a replacement, at this point I think paying more for a better brand may be worth it.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product. If it worked it would be awesome but it arrived completely defective. I contacted Silk&#x27;n directly for a replacement but have still been unsuccessful.</li>
    <li> It worked for me. It takes time and patience, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m light skin and dark hair. I used higher power to achieve the result.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the NONO for men. Used that for about 6 months and I gave up on it. It took hours to do my chest and upper legs and after a few days it was prickly and long again. The large tips were expensive and didn&#x27;t last even a month of usage. The hairs did become finer, but I found that I would still get in-grown hair cysts because the weak hairs would get trapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I purchased the Tria Laser 4X without doing much research on the pain. I received it at the beginning of September 2013. When I first used it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how painful it was and it took forever to do a small area. I bought Dr. Numb&#x27;s cream to help with the pain, but due to the short battery charge life of the 4X, the numbing cream would wear off before I could recharge the unit again to finish an area so I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go at the end of March 2014. I bought is directly from Silk&#x27;n.com. I tried to post a review on their website and it never got posted, so I decided to post here on Amazon. I am a male of italian decent with light olive skin with a lot of dark body hair. The flashes feel intensive but my skin handles it with no adverse effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Luxx (120K head) in addition to the 5,000 Flash unit. So I suppose I have 125,000 flashes. This is what attracted me to the unit. If it wasn&#x27;t for the extra long life I would have never purchased it. Being a guy I was skepical that it would be strong enough to handle my body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first week of April 2014 I&#x27;ve used it almost weekly, once bi-weekly. I&#x27;m an impatient guy and I wanted to see results right away. It can get time consuming. It takes me about 2 hours to do my neck, shoulders, chest abs, upper lower back, underarms and upper leg to the knees and top of feet. I&#x27;ve had about 10 sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first week I never got any shedding. It has reduced the amount of hair on my chest and shoulders maybe by 50%. My abs and stomach seem to be more tough. The hair on my upper legs just seems to be dormant, but no patches. The Silk&#x27;n website said that men can use it too, but it will take longer to see the same results and I can attest to this. After four month of using this IPL/HPL, I just don&#x27;t think it is strong enough for my body hair. They say you have to use it for 18-24 months to get all the different stages. I have hairs growing on my stomach that keep coming back over and over and I can&#x27;t seem to kill them and I know they are not new hairs from the same follicle because I can still see them under the skin after I shaved and treated him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now I give this unit 3 stars. I will continue to use it. I like IPL because I can do larger areas then with the Tria and there is little pain compared to the Tria. But, I am already looking for another IPL system that has a stronger power output. After doing extensive research I&#x27;ve been looking to buy the Boot&#x27;s SmoothSkin Ipulse from the UK. They don&#x27;t sell in Canada, but I plan on purchasing it from Ebay. It has 10j/cm2, which is the highest I can get. It&#x27;s sell for about $550 Canadian. I really wanted the E-one by Swin, which is stronger, but no one is allowed to ship it to North America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions.</li>
    <li> I am a male with pale skin and dark hair and I bought this product to remove hair from my armpits and lower neck.  I have used my Flash&amp;Go every two weeks as instructed for the last four months and I have had ZERO results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to be patient with this product after reading review here saying it takes months to see a difference.  Now it&#x27;s too late for me to return this product and I feel that I&#x27;ve been robbed of $200.  I also believe a large amount of the positive reviews here are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product.</li>
    <li> Have not had a chance to do more than the test site as it directs you to do before using.  But so far it is great</li>
    <li> Love it! This has been a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> AWFUL with &#x27;The Official Manufacturer of Silk&#x27;n&#x27; company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is first time ever leaving awful feedback in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, i am Asian.&lt;br /&gt;which means, this kind of device should work PERFECTLY then European, or African American.&lt;br /&gt;We have lighter skin color with very dark color of hair (most of us have black hair) ; this what i want you to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;before i purchase this thing, i research all the review in my country, and state.&lt;br /&gt;two brand were popular in my country, silk&#x27;n flash&amp;go and Tivia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course i wanted to try cheaper one first, But i guess quality goes equal by money goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i got the first device exactly 10 days from order date.&lt;br /&gt;i checked the box, watched CD first, and followed instruction with level 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two shots later,&lt;br /&gt;i had Replace Cartridge Indicator light, System Warning Indicator Light were ON with Level 2&amp;3 lights blinking but not level 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was very disapointed.&lt;br /&gt;but in my mind, &#x27;okay, it could happen, there are always risk purchasing over the internet.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;i sent an email, and response back with cust service #.&lt;br /&gt;CSR (customer service representative) was nice,&lt;br /&gt;her tone of voice was good enough change my feeling unsatisfied to satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;said will send me a replacement with a return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a week from the first package received, i received the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i opened the box, there was NO RETURN LABEL.&lt;br /&gt;from that point, started giving me a negative feels about the company.&lt;br /&gt;i tried with replacement device,&lt;br /&gt;Thank GOD!!!!! Worked Good........... for 10 shots.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Replace Cartridge Indicator light, System Warning Indicator Light were ON with Level 2&amp;3 lights blinking but not level 1&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;i tried whole my legs, and got that warning couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hmm....&lt;br /&gt;then i had to think.&lt;br /&gt;is this device defective also, or i am doing something wrong with this thing??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;again,i email them with my concern. i guess i was too honest.&lt;br /&gt;i wrote them, &#x27;i may doing something wrong, let Tech Support call me.&#x27; also about the label.&lt;br /&gt;that night, i was checking ALL Youtube, Blogs, my community etc.,&lt;br /&gt;but i figured that i DID NOT do anything wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next day morning, i got a call from the lady who were emailing me with.&lt;br /&gt;(which i don&#x27;t think she works for tech support... however)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first thing she wanted go over was label, which is not nice at all.&lt;br /&gt;i understand that they need get their device back, but at that point,&lt;br /&gt;get something result for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she sounds like can&#x27;t believe why there is no return label, but how should i know??&lt;br /&gt;she said will send me a return label over the E-MAIL.&lt;br /&gt;i guess, she didn&#x27;t trust me to saying there was no label, and may thought i would keep and not returning???&lt;br /&gt;this is just a guess. she didn&#x27;t say that for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, then.&lt;br /&gt;she asked me to do some step, i followed with my lip&lt;br /&gt;(because i had no skin left on Leg to try, since i was testing the day before)&lt;br /&gt;Ooooops! skin tone warning light was up?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then she start saying, my skin tone may not good for this device... blah blah blah,&lt;br /&gt;i was very embarrassed when she said that. (but i had no problem on lip or arms with first defective device)&lt;br /&gt;and she kept saying &#x27;you may do something wrong,&#x27; also she said, &#x27;but you sounds like doing right.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;then again my skin tone could be the reason to have warning light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well...&lt;br /&gt;then, only skin tone warning light should be on, but not replace cartridge indicator light, system warning indicator light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;guess what?&lt;br /&gt;i was getting skin tone warning, because my face got TANNED.&lt;br /&gt;i had driving all day long, day before.&lt;br /&gt;i realized it after conversation over with her.&lt;br /&gt;but i can not believe that she couldn&#x27;t think about that way either??&lt;br /&gt;she must be a professional of this product.&lt;br /&gt;should know all situation.&lt;br /&gt;whatever....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(thank you for reading this Looooooooooooong story, you may got tired now)&lt;br /&gt;yeah, i got tired also.&lt;br /&gt;so, i requested two return label, so i can return both of them.&lt;br /&gt;(but still, i couldn&#x27;t make decision, because second device worked some, even thou there was warning lights comes up later, but not often as first one. i was keep thinking should i return or not, return or not?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;seems to be end, uh?&lt;br /&gt;sorry, Story is on going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next day.&lt;br /&gt;i got something in a mail.&lt;br /&gt;hmmm? what is this??&lt;br /&gt;opened the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;HAHAHA! a Return Label!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looked over stamp date, it was next day of replacement package shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so, this is what i guess.&lt;br /&gt;they sent a replacement, and someone forgot to put return label in it.&lt;br /&gt;so whoever forgot to put it in, mailed out with post office next day,&lt;br /&gt;but no one else knew that was happened but blame on me to saying there was no return label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was very helpful to make decision about 2nd device.&lt;br /&gt;i returned both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want try this product,&lt;br /&gt;please do with someone else but \\&quot;The Official Manufacturer of Silk&#x27;n\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t recommend you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this company &amp; product are the first time me to leave 1 star feed back in my life.&lt;br /&gt;i need to try other brand.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this handy hair removal. I spent over $1,000 out of pocket for laser hair removal services and this product meets my wallet and standards.</li>
    <li> I tell you what if you have any dark color to you don&#x27;t use this damn thing it burned the hell out of my legs leaving burns the shape of the cartridge.. Boy am I pissed and there&#x27;s no describing how betrayed I feel. Never again will I try anything like this</li>
    <li> Minimal results after three months dedicated use</li>
    <li> I love this product. Painless, even on the highest setting. I bought it in October and use it almost weekly even thought it says bi-weekly and sometimes I forget some weeks. It has worked amazingly. I have used it at least 8 times and I have seen a remarkable improvement in hair reduction. I am only shaving about once a week now where I had to shave everyday and by evening it was stubbly feeling. I anticipate it getting even better as I continue using it. I haven&#x27;t had to replace the cartridge even after 8 FULL body uses, and I mean from head to toe and everywhere in between:)  I highly recommend you try it. Stick with it, it will work if you have dark hair and light skin, like they suggest. BUY IT! You won&#x27;t regret the investment!</li>
    <li> different from it&#x27;s discription！It&#x27; s an old edition</li>
    <li> This product simply does not get rid of hair. I used it for almost a year. Religiously. Maybe, 10% reduction in hair. Save your money and buy a proper laser from tria. I hear it&#x27;s the best one, but I have not tried it yet.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product - HOW EVER - I may have gotten 500 (being generous) out of 5,000 pulses?!! I am very disappointed it was either used or defective and there is no way to contact for exchange.</li>
    <li> still using it but not getting the results I would like in the bikini area</li>
    <li> I am using it from 2 month and tell now no change at all</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Works great!</li>
    <li> Directions are really complicated, warnings abound - I have light colored skin and facial hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t try this product on myself if I was paid. Returned it carefully re-packaged after just looking at it.</li>
    <li> I brought this machine 4 years ago for around 250/300 dollars, when it first came i think. Used for few times and I noticed the hair growing slower than before but it never get rid of the hair completely. Fifth time I use Silk&#x27;n, it burned my skin so bad, I swear I followed all the appropriate instructions. I had spots all over my skin, first red and then white, looking like burn from the sun. I went on a trip with my legs with spots all over, really bad experience. Went to dermatologist and she said it would go away. It did, after 2 years. I still kept using the machine and then after a while it just stopped working, I plugged in and a smell of burn comes out. Silk&#x27;n doesnt get rid of the hair that much comparing with laser treatment. Dont waist your money, I bought this to try on my legs but had laser on the other parts. if you wanna save money, dont wast money buying this.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! I know 2 people who have spent hundreds on other machines but never had the results that I have had with this one. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Works great. You must follow the direction and have dark hairs. As stated does not work on gray or light hair. It has been a year since I purchased this device and my legs and arms are hair free.  I still do about every 10 weeks a spot check.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the lights were cheaper.  I am on my 2 sets of 3.</li>
    <li> I am so pleasantly surprised! I was expecting maybe a reduction in the thickness of my body hair but it&#x27;s even better than that! I have very white skin and black hair.  I started using the device the day I got it and saw results on my armpits right away. I haven&#x27;t needed to shave my underarms in a month and a half. My bikini line has much deeper roots but that too has stopped regrowing hair. I little exfoliating removed the left over stubble (because you need to shave before you use it the dead root of the hair is left in the skin).  I can wear my bathing suit without being embarrassed by stubble or my bikini lines five o&#x27;clock shadow. I feel more feminine at the beach. It rarely stings me at all, only when I accidentally zap a dark freckle.  I do close my eyes or look away when I pull the trigger because the flash is very bright. I am normally skeptical of beauty tech but it&#x27;s been a dream of mine to take a shower and enjoy it instead of feeling like it was a chore because of shaving, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so happy with it, because it really has worked for me. Also no more ingrown hairs. I am starting my legs now. I&#x27;ll post more results and maybe some photos once I see how well it works there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :  it&#x27;s been about a year and a half (1-26-17) and I haven&#x27;t shaved my armpits in a year. They are baby smooth! I did my arms and bikini line, a little work on my face, even my toes and hands, my upper legs and have finally started my lower legs. It&#x27;s slow going. I really do wish the area the device covered during a pulse were bigger but I don&#x27;t even mind. It&#x27;s been working so well all this time I can&#x27;t complain. I saved my legs for last because I knew it was going to take the longest but even now, I already don&#x27;t have to shave my legs but once every two weeks and I&#x27;ve only been doing a portion of each leg every 6 days or so (whenever I find a moment) . I used up the bulb that came with it a long time ago and bought the longer lasting one which is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. No ingrown hairs, no balancing in the shower to shave, no razor burn. We have a pool and its great to be able to throw on a bikini if friends show up and not worry bikini line stubble. And I actually enjoy my baths and showers now because I can relax and enjoy the bubbles instead of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I totally approve.e it. No ingrown hairs, no balancing in the shower to shave, no razor burn. We have a pool and its great to be able to throw on a bikini if friends show up and not worry bikini line stubble. And I actually enjoy my baths and showers now because I can relax and enjoy the bubbles instead of shaving.   Anyway, I totally approve.</li>
    <li> I love this!  Very easy to use, and incredible results in just three months.  I never need to shave!</li>
    <li> This device is so helpful, if we can understand is some low level energy than the big machines Doctors have,  everything is constancy,  so no forget do it at the time,  I use it in my tomy, in my ankles, foots , under arms, legs, face,  and just keep doing it.  Other things is the battery have life, so eventually we need buy extra,  ## Ok, don&#x27;t forget when use in your face cover your EYES,  so glades dark, and try to look other whey.at time the flash,  o you can cover with your hand that lite.  The price is right , for the service and the comfort you have do it in you house,  recommend check. The life time of life, mine still working, hope fore more time,</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I have had a few laser hair removal treatments in the past but it is hard for me to make regularly scheduled appointments. I have had similar results with this product as I had with a salon treatment. With just 2 uses I went from fairly thick underarm hair to barely having to shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so I&#x27;m not going to give it five stars. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain using it on third level and I really didn&#x27;t see any immediate result from that first use. Time will tell if this product will work for me.</li>
    <li> The maintenance light started flashing five flashes into second treatment. Also, there was black lint under the tape sealing the packaging leading me to believe that it had been used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t have a problem with the product, just be sure to buy one at a local store to insure that you are getting an unused item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a happy customer!</li>
    <li> This is a review after one month of usage!    I always had problems with my hair, especially my armpit. The growth rate of my hair were extremely fast and I had to shave almost everyday. It was kind of nightmare and I didn&#x27;t have any confidence in showing my underarm or wearing the sleeveless shirt.    After reading many reviews, I decided to buy this Flash&amp;Go device.  I&#x27;m an Asian. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if the device will be usable on my tan skin, but I bought it anyway. And I&#x27;m glad I did!  It actually works! After 1 month of usage, I&#x27;m starting to see the results.  The growth rate of my hair is noticeably slower and the hair become finer.    The device is easy to use. Just take a glance at the video on the manufacturer&#x27;s website and you&#x27;ll be ready to go.  It only take a few minutes for a single session of underarm treatment.  This device comes with 5000 pulses and you&#x27;ll only need no more than 20 pulses for each session. So it looks like it&#x27;ll take forever before you&#x27;ll need to buy a new cartridge.    All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to accurately rate something that requires several treatments before knowing the results, the 4 stars above reflect the ease of use through this point, which for me is 2 treatments thus far.  I HOPE NO ONE THINKS LASER HAIR REMOVAL IS EVER TOTALLY PERMANENT or they will be disappointed...but one should be hair free for several years which is a blessing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought/used the Tria several years ago...the Tria was even more expensive at the time than it is now...and, as I remember, it was more painful to use than the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go and had a smaller hair removal space.  I also found Tria&#x27;s Customer Service to be non-existent...a phone that rings into dead air space...and I hope if I need to call Silk&#x27;n Flash that they have better C.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; is startling at first...but I promise one will adjust to it quickly.  I have decided to believe it is safe.  If one wants to do their facial area...perhaps a pair of sunglasses would be a great asset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain?  I can also promise one adjusts to this quickly too.  The most UNcomfortable area for me is the bikini coverage area...but...it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do my legs, unarms and bikini area...and the only area that remained 95% hairless after my prior usage with the Tria was my lower calves...but the upper calves still need to go through a full cycle with the Silk&#x27;n Flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not needing to shave for a few years is worth the effort and approximately $200 ish dollars.  And, there is always a chance I won&#x27;t need to shave even longer.  If you are on the fence, yes, I think it is totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I am in late 30&#x27;s white/greek with skin that is considered white but when gets sunburned turns nice bronze color, i have black hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Hair:&lt;br /&gt;So i did not have high expectations, however i am impressed. I have a small (8 hair) patch on my chin that i used to pluck once a month or so but lately (last 5 years) its been like every day and i started getting 3-4 hairs on the other side of  my chin (I hate getting older)!, So this was my trial thing and i must say i been using it every friday since purchase at the end of March (today is June 1st) and i see a huge difference, i pluck maybe 1-2 a month now as needed, and so with such great results i also started using it on my legs in May.&lt;br /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;So  in just 4 weeks (remember i am using it more often than recommended - which i do not recommend  but this schedule works for me and my body), so i use machine every Friday and I shave whatever comes thru on Mondays, well first off, my hair growth amount on my legs reduced&lt;br /&gt;by more than 50%, last friday i only used it on spots where hair came thru, under knee caps, side, low ankles...and the hair that does comes in is much softer, i no longer hear complains that my legs are poky and when i sit on my legs i dont feel any hair.  I will tell u i have a high pain tolerance but even i had to cringe when i zapped my bikini line...now in soft skin folds thick hair hurts like M**F*** but everywhere else is barely anything...&lt;br /&gt;so, maybe it should be a 5 star review, but the only thing i have have complaint about is the speed, once u pull that trigger and move device sensor does not flash until I re- lift device off the skin and let it refocus(?), that kind of annoys me because it takes time and u are now in general area and not in exact spot u wanted to be in...but as for results i understand this is not a cure but more of a reduction of hair and in that aspect this device performed flawlessly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for two months now and used it nine times. Like others who have reviewed this item I used it every week instead of waiting two weeks in between treatments. It works great on my legs. Sure a few stray hairs grow back but my legs look smooth and I love having smooth legs. I used to use an epilator for years but I was tired of the red bumps and ingrown hairs that would show up three days later so I wanted to try something different. When I read the reviews for the Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go some of them were negative but a lot of them were positive so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Yes the red bumps and ingrown hairs are gone therefore the smooth legs. But I wish this worked better on my armpits! I shave them first before use like you&#x27;re supposed to but the next day there&#x27;s stubble! Ack! My armpit hair is dark and I thought this was supposed to work on dark hair. Because I&#x27;m getting chemo for my ms I cannot use this again until next April. If you have a skin condition like Excema you can&#x27;t use it.  I did buy glasses to wear while using it since the flash is so bright and I don&#x27;t want to damage my eyes. I did not find it to be painful at all. I just wish it would leave me permanently hair free like it says it would.</li>
    <li> Item received in good condition. Device working well.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair and light skin. I&#x27;ve used this product 5 tines in a two month period. It has produced absolutely no results whatsoever. I am deeply dissatisfied considering the price. My advise is to look elsewhere. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned cash.</li>
    <li> I give this Silk&#x27;n Flash &amp; Go Removal Device ONE STAR based on skin complexion people. I was not aware of the device bias functions until after I purchased the product and review the DVD instructions on how to use the device and type skin color the device is best used on for a successful hair removal results. The device it self seems to be a good product for the price I purchase for $176.00, not including taxes and shipping/handling. I purchased this device to remove fine facial hairs from above upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the device to test the sensitivity on the inside of my forearm which is a fair light skin area and it stimulated that area twice but I had to keep moving it around to find a fair lighter spot. I tried it on the upper lip area absolutely NO stimulation and the indicator AMBER LIGHT will let your know that the device sensor could not sense any light skin on the face... TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!  :(</li>
    <li> Went through 3 bulbs and see absolutely no reduction in hair thickness or hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Do not buy this!!!&lt;br /&gt;Followed the program to the core, It does not work!!!</li>
    <li> It does work.  I have lighter skin and darker hair...and very fast growing hair.  I have tried this out on my underarms.  I saw results in the first week with reduced hair growth, and now after a few months barely have to shave my underarms at all. I went from daily shaves to once a week shaves within just a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;Put the setting all the way up and follow the directions.  Simple to use, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
    <li> Wish it removed hair immediately . I notice slight stunted growth. I will keep using to see if beneficial . Ps,the flash  is really bright</li>
    <li> Yes, it scatters the amount of hair, but don´t think that this is gonna be your short-mid term solution for hair removal...maybe if you use it constantly and for a looot of years,  you will be able to say that it worked, but if you are thinking about not having to take care of unwanted hair anymore, sorry but ain´t gonna happen.&lt;br /&gt;I´m giving 3 starts because it  really diminishes the overall amount of hair, so if you have a ton of hair and you are just happy with having less, this could work for you. But keep in mind that you will have to keep shaving and waxing almost as much as before.</li>
    <li> Does the job -- this is not an instant fix, and does require patience and occasional retouching.</li>
    <li> so far I did not try it.&lt;br /&gt;but it looks good though...</li>
    <li> it really works! you have to stick with it, though-</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  None of the ads tell you that It does not work on blond hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the device for about a month now, and so far I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I&#x27;d like to note that anyone who is purchasing through this link is buying the \\&quot;newer model\\&quot; of the device, which comes with a cartridge with an \\&quot;extra 3000 flashes\\&quot; according to Silk&#x27;N&#x27;s response to me. Therefore, this package isn&#x27;t gonna contain an extra cartridge that you might see in older reviews on other sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve been experimenting by only doing the treatment on my right side areas so that I may hope to see the difference from my left side. As of now, my leg had gone through 3 treatments (every 2 weeks) and underarm 4-5 treatments (every week) with level 5. I&#x27;m a pale Asian with dark coarse hair, so the device should be ideal for me, but alas I haven&#x27;t seen any obvious signs of improvement yet even though it has been a month. The hair on my right underarm still grows at around the same rate as my left side, although *maybe* some hair is slightly thinner now, but I feel like the amount is still there. This goes the same with my right leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where I DID see results at were the hair on my fingers. After 2 flashes on each finger at level 3, the hair now no longer grows back, otherwise it&#x27;s like super fine. But then they were practically baby hair to begin with, so I&#x27;m wonder if this means that darker coarser hairs require more time and treatments. Another area that has shown results was my chin, which had like couple stray hairs. I flashed them once, but I also pulled them out shorter after as they were growing in length again...but after that, there hasn&#x27;t been any stubble. So I&#x27;m wondering if I should epilate my right side to test whether the hair follicles were destroyed by the device, or simply continue the treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I though my skin color and hair color would be ideal enough to show obvious progress, since the darker the hair the better the light&#x27;s absorbed...I got another 30 days, so we&#x27;ll see what happens since the product claims that it might take months....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, I don&#x27;t think the DVD that it comes with is all that helpful since it basically is just informing what the manual book already says.he product claims that it might take months....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, I don&#x27;t think the DVD that it comes with is all that helpful since it basically is just informing what the manual book already says.</li>
    <li> Worked for me almost immediately, After about a month I can say that I have to shave and tweeze less than half as often as I used to. I heard that it can take up to six months to get a full result, so I&#x27;m optimistic.</li>
    <li> After 2 uses I all ready see results in spots, either no hair growth at all or it is finer than before.....use as directed and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was very skeptical that it would work. Wow have I been surprised! I was an every day leg shaver and if I got goosebumps then it was five o&#x27;clock shadow. I have been using this for two months once a week and while there is still hair growth it takes a week to come back and is very patchy. There is a lot of areas with no hair at all. I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and confident I will be hair free by summer. I have never had any laser treatments and I have dark hair with olive skin. However I live in Chicago so in the winter (now) I get pretty pale. Seriously recommend , it does take consistentcy and my husband complains that the light is too bright. I do wish they had a higher level than five because I think I could handle a higher level but honestly I can&#x27;t complain and for any of the Mediterranean women who battle the constant shaving this is a must. I have only tried it on legs and arms as I am lucky I don&#x27;t have a problem else where.</li>
    <li> I was really scared I would be wasting my money. I am so pleasantly surprised. After about two weeks of using on full strength, I am hardly seeing any new growth above lip area, along cheek area and on chin. I have hormonal issues that give me such a problem with facial hair. This has always been so embarrassing. I have had to tweeze every other night for at least an hour. This device has made my life so much easier.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter recently.  She has only used it once a week for the last 4 weeks and has noticed much slower and thinner hair growth which is expected before the hair is finally gone.  I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars at the salon years ago on myself, wish this came out sooner!</li>
    <li> So far it is good.  I have only just started but it seems to do what it promises to.</li>
    <li> Used repeatedly and per instructions experienced some of what instructions conveyed I might.  Did not work</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas present, so I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I&#x27;ll try to update as I see results.  But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve experienced so far.  For reference, I have light skin (think the lightest concealer option in the make-up aisle) and coarse dark hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to remove for years with laser hair removal- which only showed any results the first time- and prescription-grade hair removal creams that have only done so much.  I&#x27;ve settled for plucking (on my face)/ shaving (underarms, stomach, and legs) and I finally got tired of my limited options. So far, I haven&#x27;t gotten past the first setting in the process.  It&#x27;s super easy to use- literally plug it in and turn it on (though I would recommend watching the DVD that comes with it first, just to make sure you&#x27;re aware of the process) then point and shoot.  If you&#x27;ve done laser hair removal, you&#x27;ll notice a HUGE difference: no more feeling like you&#x27;re snapping a rubber band against your skin fifty times!  Granted, everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance is different, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain at all- that&#x27;s a definite plus for me!  Considering how dark and coarse the hair used to be, there&#x27;s been a noticeable change even after only using this three times: it&#x27;s lighter and thinner already, which means it&#x27;s less noticeable if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two longer than usual.  I can&#x27;t wait to up the energy setting to see what this thing can really do!  It&#x27;s slow-going, but I figure if I want it done right, I&#x27;m going to have to be patient.  I&#x27;m definitely hopeful about what it&#x27;ll look like by the summer!  UPDATE: May 2015- It&#x27;s been a few months since I started this process and I&#x27;ve upped the energy to the highest setting.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change, though the hair does seem to be slightly thinner than before.  I have gotten to the point where I can use it whenever I see hair growing back, so I&#x27;m still hopeful that the increased frequency will make a more noticeable difference.Also, I have noticed a few side effects: namely dry and itchy skin mostly on my chin and neck.  I&#x27;ve found that Cetaphil moisturizer works pretty well to take away the majority of it though.</li>
    <li> So far I have been very happy . I have used it twice and there is very little new growth. I would rate it five stars but this is more if a long term item. It has been worth the money so far</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy yet another product, but I&#x27;m tired of haur where I don&#x27;t want it.  This thing works! Even if it ends up not being truely permanant, I already see less hair in the treatment areas.  And its so easy to use, painless!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution,  don&#x27;t drop it. I dropped it and the lamp broke. Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery.  Nice product</li>
    <li> It is pretty effective. I was surprised when I first tried it because of it&#x27;s bright light, but i get used to it soon. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like I thought.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a woman, and I have no feedback on how it works. I don&#x27;t think she has used it, and is very evasive with my questions. I think she is afraid that she might vaporize herself.</li>
    <li> High quality!!  I have used this device and yes I have seen less hair growth. Actually, no hair regrowth!  It is working for me!  I found it very easy to use.  Comes with an instructional DVD.  Very helpful.  Several strength levels.  Nicely packaged.  Great safety feature.  I love it!!  Very happy that I purchased this device.  Definitely believe that this product has offered me more than what I was expecting.  I am glad I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> This definitely does work for me. I have fair skin and dark hair. I have used it more than it is recommended, probably once a week, without any negative reactions. My hair seems to grow really fast and after using this there is definitely less hair and bald patches in some areas. I&#x27;m very happy about this purchase and will continue to use it. You have to be patient though, you don&#x27;t see result after one session. I also had professional laser done and it pretty much worked the same way, so I did realize this wasn&#x27;t going to do anything overnight. I did a lot of research before I purchased this and I&#x27;m glad I decided on this product! Although reading some comments, it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but has worked very well with my skin tone and hair color.</li>
    <li> I know this product is getting mixed reviews, so I wanted to chime in with my own experience.  I purchased this at costco because it came with the &amp;#34;unlimited&amp;#34; cartridge, which I doubt I will need at this rate.  I&#x27;ve used this product a total of 6 times, repeating every 2 weeks per instructions.  I use it on my underarms, legs, and bikini area.  I had no problem using the highest setting on underarms and legs but had to work my way up to the bikini area.  Now I use a 5 there and while it still stings, it&#x27;s completely tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just would like to say that I&#x27;m SO glad I purchased this product, I suspect that with another 3-4 month use, I will not have to use it anymore.  Hair growth has slowed tremendously.  I shave my underarms once a week now and the hairs are much less coarse.  If you have fair skin with dark hair, I DEFINITELY recommend you give it a shot!</li>
    <li> I love my silk&#x27;n flash!!!! Started seeing some changes right after my first treaemt</li>
    <li> I did not see any different!!</li>
    <li> I am a fair skinned black woman who had problems with irritation from shaving and waxing. I tried to use an epilator but it hurt. I couldn&#x27;t afford laser treatments so I opted for this. I&#x27;m so sad I waited! This is amazing! I bought it in June and started treatments every two weeks on my legs and already about 90% of the hair is gone. I started on my bikini zone and under arms last month and I already have 30-40% gone!  Can&#x27;t say how much I love this!</li>
    <li> Reading the reviews made me think it would work!! If anything that it would work a little bit.. I am dissapointed to see not even the slightest difference. and i followed the directions accordingly. there goes 200 dollars.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: this is after 1.5* uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural beige skin tone and black hair, decided to give this a shot and do a full body treatment. It is easy to use, so far no malfunctions for me, so that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is... after one use (and a couple snaps here and there because I ran out of time the second time) I do now see a little reduction. Hopefully it&#x27;s not just placebo effect. Anyway, my hair seems to be a little more scarce in some places, no difference in other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with it is that there is a weird smell after every time I snap and it freaks me out, because I did get a burn on my arm when I tested it first there, and the mark of it still hasn&#x27;t disappeared. I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong there but it did hurt pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... I&#x27;ll continue to use it on the areas I didn&#x27;t burn on and see. I&#x27;d recommend to try it, I believe it works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll been using the product for three months now as directed in the instructions. I bought it for the dark, course hair on my face and bikini area. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve seen little to no results in those areas. However, my legs (both upper and lower) have seen great results and my underarms have seen moderate results. I&#x27;ve spent four times as much on professional laser removal treatments (and that was just on my lower legs) and seen similar results, so it really is a steal. If your curious I would recommend the product, just don&#x27;t get your hopes up.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this on my face for some very stubborn patches of thick black hormone induced hair that showed up a few years back (think mens beard hairs, Im talking thick black coarse hair, 5 o clock shadow by days end, scratchy and sandpaper rough). After the first treatment all the smaller hairs and sideburns on my face were gone and haven&#x27;t come back. My upper lip is gone too after one treatment (but that was lasered years ago so I didnt have that many hairs to begin with)  I just finished my 7th treatment on the 2 chin areas ( I have been using weekly on highest level).  I would say about 70% of it is gone and the last 30% is not growing back as quickly. Its still thick and black but much smaller patches now and not as revolting. I have yet to try my legs.  Treatments are fast, under a minute for the face and I definitely saw results immediately. I live 2 hours from a city with laser treatments and cant go every 2 weeks for a 5 minute session.  Taking care of this at home is well worth it.  Even if I have to do this monthly (or even weekly) to keep hairs at bay, one minute a month at home is not much of a price to pay to not look like Robin Williams (RIP).  My only minus is the sheer size of the machine.  For the face it can be a little unwieldy, but fairly large coverage area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update as I use it, but so far it is FAR less painful than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use, I did the lower part of both my legs, and I did it fairly quickly. About 30 minutes if you just zap away and get into a rythem. I didn&#x27;t worry too much about overlapping, and I&#x27;m sure I zapped some places more than once, but it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all. I didn&#x27;t experience any redness, and I used it on the highest setting. I even used it over a dark freckly I had, and it didn&#x27;t hurt too bad. I also did my under arms, which in my experience is the most painful part of my body to do, but it&#x27;s such a small area that it doesn&#x27;t bother you for long. I did my bikini area, and was worried it would hurt between the creases of my legs. Not so much. Doesn&#x27;t take long to do that area either, and no redness afterwords. I usually have pretty sensitive skin, but this didn&#x27;t bother me at all. Much less painful than a tattoo. I feel silly ordering numbing cream now [not that it came in], but if you are particularly sensitive, I would order some of that. The verdict is out for me whether it&#x27;s worked or not, but I will keep everyone updated as far as regrowth goes. Also, buy directly from silkn, as it comes with a 2 year warranty that amazon does not come with. I went ahead and got the Lux.</li>
    <li> If you have to contact Silk’n’s customer service. I purchased a Flash and Go from them around ten months ago, and after it broke in January (two months ago), I attempted to email the company using the form on their website. I waited a few days, and received no answer. So I filled out the form again, and again received no answer. Using all of my strong-wording abilities, I expressed my extreme dissatisfaction with their lack of response, and finally received an answer.&lt;br /&gt;A single email, asking which repair lights were showing on my device. After my response, there was again… No answer.&lt;br /&gt;So, being the clever cookie that I am, I decided to contact them a different way. I called the number on their website and actually got a hold of a *live* person! This woman informed me that the cartridge on my product had simply run out of charges (despite supposedly holding something around 120k) and that I should send it back for them to trade out with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I did, and after about a week and a half of shipping back and forth, I received the new cartridge, which worked just fine. For one day. Then a different set of repair lights started flashing, and I got to call customer service again.&lt;br /&gt;This time, I was told that my entire Flash and Go was kaput, and that I would need to go through the lovely shipping process a second time. Despite how annoyed I was, I sent back everything I had (including the new cartridge), and waited nearly two weeks for the new Flash and Go to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Except a new Flash and Go didn’t arrive. Instead, I got a single cartridge, like the one I had just included in my shipment back to them. By that point, I had their customer service center on speed dial, so I called them up and told them that I hadn’t received a replacement Flash and Go (or anything close to it, for that matter). And thus, the kicker: after I had explained my situation, the representative threatened to charge my credit card for the unasked-for cartridge unlessI sent it back to them within a day. Thankfully, she agreed to transfer me to management.&lt;br /&gt;The woman I spoke to there either had no concept of what an ‘authorized’ credit card purchase is, or chose to dismiss it, claiming that failure to send the cartridge back as soon as I could constituted authorization (spoiler alert: it doesn’t). I almost laughed at their behavior, since I’d just spent nearly two months dealing with their customer service and shipping various products back and forth; now they were concerned with urgency?!&lt;br /&gt;So, long story short, I’ve spent nearly two months dealing with Silk’n’s customer service clowns, and my final review is that—while the product itself is fine—their ability to handle defects and complaints is so terrible that you will undoubtedly want to steer clear of this product (unless you’re fine with throwing $200-300 down the drain when it breaks).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever written one on this site. I&#x27;m only doing it now because I want anyone who is dealing with the annoyance and embarrassment of unwanted hair to know that there is a product that actually works, or at least, it actually worked for me. I have been dealing with a few extremely annoying hair issues my entire adult life. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything with no success. I tried salon laser hair and it did not work, I&#x27;m not sure if it was because they didn&#x27;t use a high enough setting or if I just didn&#x27;t go often enough, but whatever the reason, it did nothing for me. Not only that, but it was embarrassing and time consuming. I was skeptical when ordering this product after reading a few reviews that said it didn&#x27;t do much, but I figured for the price, I might as well give it a shot. Worst case, I add it to the list of things that didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it HAS worked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s how I made it work for me: 1. I used it everyday, 2. I used it on the highest setting, 3. Do not tweeze, shave only. Eventually the hair just dissipates and stops growing. It took over 5 weeks to notice any difference at all. Also, know that hair can only be permanently stopped from growth if it is currently in the anagen growth stage. If for some reason you are using the product and find it is not effective, you may want to try waxing or tweezing the unwanted hair to reset the growth cycle, as by doing so you will start the anagen growth phase again, and then after beginning the laser treatments as the hair starts to grow back. It&#x27;s been a total of 8 weeks for me and I have noticed a marked decrease in hair growth. Practically nothing left and what is left is extremely light and not noticeable at all. I&#x27;d highly recommend for anyone who fits the parameters for this product&#x27;s use.</li>
    <li> I have been through professional laser hair removal for a couple of years now. I have fair skin and very dark brown hair, so supposedly I am the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; candidate for laser hair removal. But even so, at different spas I always just got so-so results. Nothing long lasting and it was so expensive! I was pretty skeptical about buying this unit because of the mixed reviews but I am SO glad I did. Here&#x27;s the story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this the first week of August 2014 and used it once a week-a week and a half for the first 3 weeks. The instructions say to use it ever 2 weeks but I know how stubborn and thick my hair is so I decided to use it more frequently on my bikini line. After the second week, I saw results. There were definite spots where I could see no hair growing at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 3 weeks, I slowed it down to using it ever 2-3 weeks and the hair on my bikini line is almost completely gone! Two weeks ago I started the same process on my armpit hair at level 4 and I am seeing the same results so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how amazing this feels as I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin all my life and shaving or even waxing always left me with the worst ingrown hairs and red, ugly spots. I would never take full advantage of the beach or the summer because I was always self conscious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (and the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) is that even though it has been working amazingly on the thick, brown hair I have, it is taking much longer to work on the thinner, dark brown hair on my thighs. I guess this is normal because the hair is thinner and it takes longer for the laser light to penetrate the follicle and damage it but so far, it looks like I haven&#x27;t been lasering it at all. I&#x27;ll update some more if I start to see results to give a timeline one it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, if you have thick, dark hair like me in certain places that you want to get rid of and you have fair skin...this will work! If you havethinner hair, I would maybe stick to permanent laser hair removal because it&#x27;s stronger and you&#x27;ll probably see better results faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy lasering!</li>
    <li> So far it has been working well. I started using this at the beginning September on my legs and I barely have hair now. Some hairs pop up after a week or so and I&#x27;m just spot treating them now. Overall, very satisfied!</li>
    <li> White male with dark brown hair. I got this to remove all hair below my neck and saw no results at all for months, but decided to stick it out. At first I would have uncomfortable stubble the next day, now I don&#x27;t have stubble until three days later shaving. It is looking good so I will keep it going and see. My hair does not seem any thinner, but grows back slower. On another note I recommend trying a shaving oil when you shave. You have to clean the razor often and it takes longer to shave, but I have had no skin irritation or ingrown hairs after I started using the shaving oil. Good luck to you if you give this a try.</li>
    <li> Great service and wonderful device!  I would know after spending over 10,000 to get to where I&#x27;m at now.  This is perfect for touch ups!</li>
    <li> I originally bought the tria 4 x - I saw results with it immediately but on a setting of 3 it felt like someone was burning me with a cigarette lighter - my motto is it takes pain to be beautiful so I would have endured the pain except after 1 use on my legs I noticed it had left little white scars all over them - so I returned the tria4x and purchased the flash and go -  I have been using the flash and go once a week - I know it says every 2 wks because of the growth of the hair cycle or whatever - I don&#x27;t get that because I&#x27;m part Italian and my hair never stops growing I shave my legs every morning  and by night I have stubble - the flash and go I turn it up to a 5 and there is no pain a slight discomfort if that - now it took about 3 or 4 uses before I started seeing results but I am seeing results - by the end of the night my legs are still smooth the hair is growing back softer and not as quickly on my arms I only shave every few days now where it was once a day - on my chin and upper lip before where I had to pluck every day now its just once in a while and I see hairs just pushing themselves out where they have died - yay!  also I like that if you have questions you can call customer support and a live English speaking person answers the phone - with tria you have to send an email and someone MAY get back with you - also with the flash and go the replacement cartridges are very reasonable and the machine doesn&#x27;t ever quit on you where as the tria 4x it only has so many uses and then its time to throw it away</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very white man with dark body hair and I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years, and I think it&#x27;s not useful in the long run. The product worked for some time, making de interval between sessions longer. I&#x27;d like to say the results are good, but after all I just can&#x27;t. You always end up having hair anyway, so it&#x27;s always better to visit an especialist if you are serious in removing your body hair forever. Don&#x27;t hesitate in meeting an especialist, they&#x27;re used to help people remove their hair even in the private parts.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice since I bought it. I have noticed that the hair on my arms has some patches where the hair has not grown back. This is a bonus if it stays that way. No change in my legs, bikini area, or  underarm area. Will give an update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit Update: 8/12/16, I now have many areas with no hair regrowth at all.</li>
    <li> Packaged well. Lots of literature and DVD for instructions! Pretty easy to use. Nice extra long cord. Instructions say it doesn&#x27;t hurt your eyes but the flash is pretty darn bright, even with my eyes closed, so I will be buying goggles.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a month for its effectiveness and will adjust my rating.</li>
    <li> I bought the one that comes with the extended life cartridge. The one that brings 120.000 flashes. I got it directly from silkn and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I didn&#x27;t want to waste an extensive amount of time doing my whole leg without knowing for sure it will work for me so I did one small area in my leg. See pictures (First picture was after 2 treatments and second after 4.) After 2 treatments I could already see results, less hair growing back. I did not follow the 2 week sheduling they recommend, instead I did treatments every week and had no problems at all. I will be doing the rest of my legs now. I also used it in my big toe so I wouldn&#x27;t need to shave it again and after 3 treatments there was barely any hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Some people complain about the bright flash and that it bothers to the eye. I just get it ready and look away right before applying the flash.&lt;br /&gt;It might not work for everyone but it did for me. I have fairly white skin and dark hair. I will be trying it on thicker hair like the bikini area and see how it goes, I&#x27;m sure it will take longer.</li>
    <li> Does not work.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It works and I am HAPPY.</li>
    <li> I believe it works better than anything else you can buy. Don&#x27;t expect immediate results, follow instructions, and repeat when necessary, and it works, permanently. I found that in some areas I only needed one or two applications. In other areas it took more time and in every case the hairs that returned were smaller, finer, almost invisible. I am very pleased with the results, and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have the history of home hair-removal tucked away in a drawer - everything from &amp;#34;stick this needle in the hair follicle and wait 30 seconds&amp;#34; on up. This really works! Yes, on my face! No burning or itching. Fast and easy to use. If only I&#x27;d found it before some of that hair turned white &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times but my hair dosen&#x27;t grow they seem like their gone after only 2 times of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. You should buy it if you&#x27;re suffering from unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> It works. It takes time, but works!</li>
    <li> Okay, so this is what I&#x27;ve figured out from laser hair removal, waxing, and working at a salon. After about 4 months of using silk and go. I found tge results to be sporadic.  Much like the hair that used to grow back after I get a wax.&lt;br /&gt;However, from the ladies I talk to that have had their hair lasered professionally it seems like about the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I am going to conclude that although I don&#x27;t get great hairless results I definitely have less hair.  And as a woman that has a 5 O&#x27;Clock shadow under her underarms.  I appreciate that. It hurt less to get my underarms waxed (now that it&#x27;s summer) and I think the results will last me a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;After taking a pole of the ladies at the salon I have decided that most hair loss treatments are (no matter what they say) less than permanent. So i don&#x27;t regret my decision.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate that I am not hair free. But at the same time I&#x27;m not as hairy. For the $179 I payed i think I probably would have had equal salon results, except I can try again next year when I&#x27;m not seeing the sun.&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s a miracle your looking for you might not find it, unfortunately.  But i do have less hair, it was quick and painless,  if you&#x27;ve got the $200 to blow. I think it&#x27;s worth it in the end.  If you don&#x27;t you arent missing out on a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with the results. There was a significant decrease after the first 2 times I used it. It&#x27;s been a little over four months and hair is about 85% gone. Device is quality and works far superior to electrolysis and professional laser.</li>
    <li> It says on the box and in the information packet that it is not for the face.  So I sent it back.</li>
    <li> wanted it for facial hair</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! After a month of use, roughly 4 times... The hair is practically gone! Love love love this product.... Only 4 stars because the light will have to be replaced, but otherwise WORTH IT!!!</li>
    <li> Have to shave first not mentioned  in  the  promotion. Have to use connected to outlet also not mentioned.  Does  not make it easy or convenient!</li>
    <li> After many weeks of consistent use, have not seen any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin and the hair I&#x27;m trying to remove is on my face and is black. It&#x27;s been 3 mos. since I&#x27;ve been using it; based on all the positive reviews I thought it was a solid purchase. Originally I&#x27;d been debating between this and the Tria--now I dont know if I should have spent the extra money or if I&#x27;d be in the same boat.</li>
    <li> Very good as described</li>
    <li> Before I ever tried using Silk&#x27;n Flash&amp;Go, I read the directions.  Much to my surprise, the directions stated that if you had tan skin,(which I do), this is not the product for you !  This was never said in any of the infomercials or at Amazon.com that I am aware of, otherwise I never would have ordered it.  Very disappointed, but happy I read all of the directions before using or I might have had some serious problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a short while, but already I have less hair on legs and axilla. I think this method is the best way to rid unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> So far impressed with it. Been using it for about a month and seems to be working well.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My armpit hair has always been a major insecurity of mine. Grown in the wrong places and much too think for me to ever think about wearing cut off shirts or even lifting my arms up. After a month of using this as directed, I AM SO HAPPY with the results. I know by 2-3 months I should be hairless and that&#x27;s something I will be forever grateful for. I suggest this to all of my friends,  it works.</li>
    <li> It takes time, but it works. I have been using this for my underarms and upper lip. After 6 weeks my underarms are nearly bare, and my upper lip has less hair. It will probably take 6 more weeks to be hair-free but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and already my hair is thinner.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am having great results though I have just used it three times</li>
    <li> It will be a slow process but I&#x27;m hoping it will be worth it in the end!!!!</li>
    <li> I have to say I am in SHOCK at how well it has worked for me this far. I got it for my facial hair, underarms, legs and hairline. So far I&#x27;ve only used it three times and I can already see the results. My facial hair (which I used to have to shave every other day) is gone! I keep getting that panicked feeling like (OMG did I remember to shave it?) then I check &amp; WOW, it&#x27;s honestly surprising each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms have shown about a 60% reduction and it&#x27;s taking much longer to grow back. As far as my legs... I haven&#x27;t been as good with using it because it takes longer but I am seeing patches in the areas treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing negative I could say is that I wish you didn&#x27;t have to shave in advance since it makes it harder to identify the areas you need to touch up which means you have to basically do the whole leg.</li>
    <li> Love Amazon prime , I got mine before I expected. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it! So just finished my first treatment and it felt the same as getting a professional laser treatment. I had about two treatments a couple years ago on my under arms and didn&#x27;t continue it was too pricey for me. So I didn&#x27;t really get any noticeable results. I&#x27;m going to stick with this every two weeks and am hoping for the best! I have fair skin, light medium brown hair. So I think I&#x27;m a good candidate. One thing I will say if you have tattoos, those areas sting worse than where I don&#x27;t have tattoos, I&#x27;m hoping it does cause damage to them but if it gets rid of the hair and I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore it will be worth it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item with moderate to high expectations based on other reviews.  I watched the video and used the device as described in the video and started with the hair around my ankles.  After about 7 clicks the device stopped working.  It is charged, but the light will not go off and all of the buttons flash.  My only assumption is it is a poorly made product that could last for such a short period of time.  Not buying from this brand again.  One star because the patch around my ankle did not grow back, though I&#x27;m now a weirdo with one hairless ankle.</li>
    <li> So I was doubtful this would work, but the price was similar to a bunch of laser treatments in a spa, so I risked it.  I have to say, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. I have dark hair and fairly light skin, so exactly the combination needed for this to do its job and it definitely has. Just after one treatment on my arms I can see the difference. It does sting a bit when using it, but quite a lot less than using wax strips. I bought glasses to go along with it, but I haven&#x27;t used them. You can still see the flash when you close your eyes, but it&#x27;s not horrible. I&#x27;m only taking the one star off due to the price.</li>
    <li> Everyone has different experiences, but the Flash N Go worked great for me, for the most part. I am quite pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to state that I did go ahead and purchase IPL approved safety glasses. The cheap $7 ones for green/blue laser lights are not the appropriate kind. I found a bunch of mixed information. But, here is the conclusion I came to. Silk&#x27;N states you don&#x27;t need safety glasses. However, after the first use, I noticed that the unit lights up an already lit room. That made me nervous. The wavelength the Flash &amp; Go uses (475-1200nm) is similar to other Silk&#x27;N AND other IPL/HPL products that a study from Australia shows DO NEED safety glasses. Here is the link to that study. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Glasses that are specifically approved for IPL use run around $70-$120. I found a pair on a well known auction site that starts with an &amp;#34;E&amp;#34; for around $30. I don&#x27;t know if you will be able to find the same thing, since the seller probably barely broke even on my purchase. However, do some research. $120 is a small price to pay to save your eyesite later in life. And, even with the glasses, this is still WAY cheaper than professional hair removal services. The ones I purchased were the Phillips LS-IPLB-206.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you point and shoot the thing. Not hard to do, with a little yoga-like flexibility. Like everyone else, I went right up to the highest level, except in my bikini area, where I still use level 4. I have had it 1 month and done 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart, as is recommended in the instruction booklet. As time goes on, you do them less and less. I also want to state that I have had many sessions with various types of professional laser hair removal treatments in my underarms, bikini, and legs - all with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges - I am treating my full legs (from 3 inches above the knees), my underarms, my bikini, my chin, upper lip, and happy trail. I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; and 140 lbs to give you an idea of surface area. I was able to complete a full treatment on all areas once and all of the smaller areas plus 1/2 of one leg (so I missed my right leg and 1/2 of my left leg) on a second pass with one cartridge. I tried to guestimate and I feel that around 1000 flashes might have been a pretty accurate number. I personally think the cartridge could do more than 1000 flashes, but they limit it because they want to sell more cartridges. But, who knows. Maybe it does wear out quickly after that 1000 flash mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my legs - it worked GREAT. No, that is an understatement. It worked AWESOME. I actually didn&#x27;t even have to shave once between my first and second treatments. I have not had that type of result with any of the professional treatments I have done so far. I was impressed and felt the price was immediately justified even if the thing didn&#x27;t work anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my bikini/happy trail - It doesn&#x27;t work fully, but does work as well as professional treatments. Perhaps with more treatments, it will work even better, but I haven&#x27;t gotten to that stage yet. There is a reduction in hair, and the hair still there is finer/thinner. That&#x27;s good news for me, because I used to be a Wookie - you know, Italian women and the hair thing. &#x3D; ) Keep in mind that I only use level 4 on this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my underarms - This is the area it works the least for me. It still works, but the results aren&#x27;t quite as dramatic. However, I have also had professional treatments here and they have worked even less. My armpit hair is apparently incredibly stubborn. In this region on my body, any improvements is a big deal to me. So, once again, I am happy. My goal is to be able to shave my armpits and make it look like I did actually shave them. Up until now, the roots are so dark that even after shaving, there is still a residual shadow. I doubt complete hair loss in the cards for me, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face/chin - the hairs here are finer and lighter.However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get. Once again, for the price, any improvement will make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, but not least, I want to give a warning. If you use something to mark out grids on certain areas, PLEASE do NOT use anything with dark color. I VERY LIGHTLY marked my legs with a pen - not in a full grid, but just with one evenly spaced row of dots. I tried to avoid the actual pen marks, but the IPL targets dark things, so it left a residual. I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t go away and I would be left with equally spaced marks up and down my legs FOREVER. I put on some vitamin E and it went away in a couple days. I saw a review where one girl used white eyeliner. That is probably a better solution. Anything other than pure white is a bad idea, though. Just FYI.However, they didn&#x27;t start that heavy or dark, so I am not sure how much better they can get.

    <li> This is an okay product, but if you buy it, DO NOT buy it from Amazon. I made that mistake, and now, 6 months after my purchase, the unit has died. The manufacturer won&#x27;t honor my Amazon purchase because they are not authorized to sell the item, and Amazon won&#x27;t send me a new one because their 30 day guarantee has run out. So i am stuck with a 199.00 paperweight that is useless.</li>
    <li> I have severe PCOS that has resulted in secondary hair growth on my face, and it is pretty dark and thick.  I was getting to the point where I couldn&#x27;t go more than 24 hours without needing to shave.  This device is slow in removing the hair, but it does do it.  After three months, I can now go two days before I feel that I need to deal with the hair.  I fully plan to keep with it and hopefully, over time, the hair will keep getting less and less.</li>
    <li> Lost my review so I hope it&#x27;s not a duplicate.  I&#x27;ve been extremely hairy all my life.  Been through electrolysis and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on laser.  This product has been a little jewel.  Most of my unwanted hair is gone after several months of use.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone with dark unwanted hair.  Quite an economical treatment considering you can do it yourself at home.  My only regret is I didn&#x27;t purchase it a long time ago.  Great product.  No pain, just gain.</li>
    <li> It is very effective and the areas where I&#x27;ve used it have almost no hair on them now.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Hair still growing, it even seems to be coming back faster.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my little review for the Flash &amp; Go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says its safe for the face, and sure it is, but it has an INSANELY bright flash and honestly, on the lowest setting, I was using it on my legs and it darn near blinded me. I was seeing spots for 5 minutes.  It gave me an anxiety attack, and I refused to use it, I had it for less then a day before I sent it back to the company, so not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried the NO-NO, it did not work either so for anyone who was using this first, and found it didn&#x27;t work for them either, the no no is no better!</li>
    <li> Excellent, Very portable.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used it just a couple of times so far. But I can say it corresponds to my expectations. Works very well, and you can use ir wherever you want. Very portable too.</li>
    <li> After the first use  I saw a reduction of hair growth. And after two weeks and the second session ??  So far I am impressed with this product. And I still haven&#x27;t had to replace the flash head. I&#x27;m sure my 3 rd session I will have to replace it. And no pain. A few little snaps at full strength. But they did not hurt at all. I am very happy I decided to purchase this product. So far it is doing everytbing I Expected. Looking forward to being body hair free. A great product. And yes. Do as the instructions say.</li>
    <li> A few years ago, I developed very visible facial hair growth, including some very coarse ones on the neck.  After unsuccessfully trying several options such as waxing (which only made matters worse) and a home electrolysis kit (painful and ineffectual), I purchased this a couple of years ago. Since my facial hair used to grow back really fast, I used this device a few times a week for the first few months and over time saw a very marked reduction in the number as well as the coarseness of hair. Furthermore, the rate of growth was also dramatically  educed. I gradually reduced the frequency but found that the beneficial effects stayed. I now use this very rarely, and still find that I have very manageable facial hair which I can keep completely in check with quick use of a facial hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This purchase paid for itself many times over by helping me effectively address what was an extremely embarrassing condition. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone. It is definitely worth giving a try, and it just may work as well for you as for me.</li>
    <li> I have used it 2 times so far.  The growth on my legs is already about 50% less and is just growing in patches.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see results this early.  More than pleased so far!</li>
    <li> 5000 pulses????  More like 1000.  Other than that, still too early to know if it works.</li>
    <li> Thank you for good item and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness of this just yet as I just bought it but I figured I would post a review after my first use and come back later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very light skinned and with a medical condition that causes me to grow a lot of hair and in areas that women normally don&#x27;t. Shaving is hell as it takes a lot of time and depending on the area tends to feel like it grows back in half an hour leaving me stubbly instead of smooth on top of being able to see it. I&#x27;m hoping to eventually be completely hairless with continued use but I would be happy with even thinning it out. I&#x27;ve been eyeballing this since it came out a few years ago and decided to try it between reviews of this and the Tria. I would recommend getting some glasses as the flash is very bright even without looking at it (including with eyes closed.)  This is very easy to use and unlike some reviews for the Tria I was not writhing in pain looking for numbing cream. I have tried this all the way up to level 5 with very mild to no discomfort. It takes a bit of work for larger areas like the legs but with level 3-4 all I felt was warmth and a slight tingle. Level 5 stung very lightly on certain areas but I would take that in a heartbeat compared to an epilator. I will add to to this in a few months time, hopefully it works half as well as I&#x27;m hoping for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 7/27/14: Since I bought this at the begin of the month, I have used this 3 times. Once more than the directions indicate, and instead of shaving, I use nair and then wait a day so my skin is ok. So far I&#x27;ve used it 3 times on my legs, 3 times on my \\&quot;happy trail,\\&quot; 2 times on my chin/lip, 2 times on my lower back, and 1 time on my underarms with the one cartridge. I&#x27;m not bothering to map anything out, just starting at the bottom of an area and working my way up so I&#x27;m probably missing spots but I&#x27;ve managed a good amount of use with only one cartridge. My legs, underarms, and stomach area were all growing dark, coarse hairand everywhere else fine blonde hair. I was afraid to expect too much but I am already seeing a major improvement on my legs and stomach. There are patches that either I missed or the hair is just in between that cycle, but I would say the majority of that hair is already 80% finer than before and is much slower in growing back. I haven&#x27;t shaved in between, only used nair beforehand and I can feel and see the difference, especially with the little patches I mentioned right next to the finer growth. It&#x27;s like night and day seriously. I am due for another cartridge, but so far it is definitely worth every penny!</li>
    <li> not impressed with thw  results yet but giving it a good try before I give up</li>
    <li> The seller dallas cwboy is great and replaced my first faulty unit.&lt;br /&gt;  Bought this nearly a year ago. I wasn&#x27;t super hairy to start but hate shaving and ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;  I still have a few light hairs but barely. I went over the areas twice in each session. I used just under the highest setting. Burnt myself a little in certain areas but no big...it heals.&lt;br /&gt;  As for 5,000 flashes...I don&#x27;t think so. Well worth the price anyway!&lt;br /&gt;  You will have to spot flash for touch ups in. future but not frequently.&lt;br /&gt;  I seriously recommend this product. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> I had a I-lite for about 2 years. I saw some pretty good results but it had a lot of draw backs. When I had a problem with it I decided to get the Flash&amp;Go instead. Having just gotten the F&amp;G today I like it much better already.    The F&amp;G treatment window is much larger about double the size if not more. Yet the whole head is a lot smaller and makes it easier to see what you are treating. My inner legs are like 95% hair gone but outer like 80% because I can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing as well there. This should help that issue a lot. Also the larger size is closer in size to my razor size so shaving as I treat to keep track will be easier.    The F&amp;G has a huge plug that forces me to have two spaces clear on my power strip no matter how I place it, which is one drawback to the F&amp;G. The I-lite had a HUGE base instead with separate hand part, pretty darn awkward. It was also kind of heavy this is light and easy to wield. I have pressed the button accidently already several times but as stated it does not go off when not in contact with skin.    Skin sensor: The I-lite was super buggy and though I&#x27;m very pale with dark hair it rarely agreed to work so I had to trick it with something reflective. I guess it&#x27;s made for sparkly vampires but I just had to trick it when first turned on as the test was on the base. So I was a wee bit concerned that the F&amp;G checks with very pulse but it has agreed my skin is good to go each time so far.    Flash: Many reviews said this flashes super bright. It hardly flashes at all compared to the I-lite. I&#x27;d say half as much.    Noise: It is also FAR less noisy. The F&amp;G makes less noise than my air purifier. The I-lite was super noisy.    Pain: Despite the larger treatment window and a more powerful looking bulb the F&amp;G is also better in this area, yep much less painful. I wouldn&#x27;t even say there is any pain just can feel the heat, except in the lowest area of the bikini area, so the most tender place there is but it&#x27;s not bad at all, especially compared to the past unit. Even with less pain I can still smell the heated hair smell so know it&#x27;s working.    Effectiveness: This will need to be updated in a few weeks to months but I have high hopes. Past experience for now to show these sorts of things do actually work and to compare to later. The I-lite as stated removed hair great on my legs. I can go weeks without shaving and wear shorts and any hair is not enough to be noticeable without close up inspection. Though there is enough hair on the outer-side I feel the need to shave if more than a month but I still think no one would notice with me just walking around town. Under arms has had little effect it is a wee bit less and for sure grows slower and finer. Worked good on arms but I have not treated them near as much as every where else so still have hair there but it is more sparse. Worked good on my lip but still have a wee bit there. Bikini area. Still have most my hair there but again it is slower to grow and finer. I am hoping to have better results with the F&amp;G but even if it&#x27;s just the same it will be a worthwhile investment.    11/23/2014 This works REALLY well and much better than the I-lite! The tough under arm hair is down to half what is was before treatment but what is left does still grow back faster than the rest of me. I expect it to keep diminishing what is left over time though. No more lip hairs at all. Leg hair, it has been a couple weeks since last shave and treatment and my inner legs still look and feel smooth. My outer legs still look smooth but feel a wee bit of stubble starting. Bikini area is dramatically diminished as well and feels smooth for a very long time post shave and treatment.     A little PS: just place this against your skin and don&#x27;t press. If you press you can push your skin against the glass and that&#x27;s how you risk getting burned.</li>
    <li> Finally, my girlfriend is happy... she liked it and sends her 5 stars... thank U...</li>
    <li> works great ,use to go out to do laser removal now i can do it home and save some money .will wait a couple months to see some more results</li>
    <li> I have had laser before and it worked for me. Of course the results of laser aren&#x27;t 100% permanent and without maintenance its useless. I didnt maintain and ended up starting over again. I decided to get this device and its working wonderfully! I am seeing new patches where hair isn&#x27;t growing back and that was after two uses! Everyone is going to see results at different times. Be patient - this will work. Like I said im already seeing results and I would recommend this product to ANYONE. Its safe. Buy some special laser glasses to protect your eyes though. And guess what? You have this device for LIFE. In the long run its a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Btw I am using this product to treat unwanted facial hair so if anybody is wondering yes its GREAT for that. Used the lowest setting first and then jumped to the highest after that first treatment.</li>
    <li> I have diligently used this product for months without any significant or lasting results.  My advice is to save your money and seek the treatment from a professional.</li>
    <li> Works great, hair is slowly disappearing. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month I am using this, I don&#x27;t see any change. My hair is not going away. looks like I wasted my money. not recommended</li>
    <li> (I didn&#x27;t purchase this item off of Amazon) I&#x27;ve been using the Flash &amp; Go for about a month and a half now. I wanted to wait a bit before writing a review, just to make sure it was actually doing something. It&#x27;s really easy to use, and quick. I started using it on the area&#x27;s I hate having to shave, my armpits &amp; pubic area. I have noticed, especially in my pubic zone... (lol) that it has really thinned out the hair. My armpits show some hair loss, which is a win for me. I don&#x27;t have to shave daily, which is awesome. I find myself forgetting to shave for a few days, lifting up my armpits and only seeing slight stubble. I have also been using it on my husbands back, and have noticed it working even better on him. I think it&#x27;s worth the money, you just have to make sure you follow the directions &amp; be diligent with using it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the item to use on the underarm area. It appears to be working. However, I&#x27;ve used fewer than 50 flashes and the yellow light is already on. I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
    <li> As soon as i got it, I plugged it in and sparks shot out.  I don&#x27;t want to say it will happen to everyone, so just be careful!  I had to click one star in order to post this message, so please don&#x27;t depend on that rating.</li>
    <li> HORRIBLE!  HORRIBLE! this company Silkn should be SUED!! Worst Purchase of MY LIFE!&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the Horrible Pain and Money. I purchased directly from the silkn.com website. I tested the machine like it says on the instructions and when I went to use it this is what happened. See Pictures!&lt;br /&gt;My burns feel like I&#x27;m on fire! I&#x27;ve had bad sunburn before and that is NOTHING compared to this. My skin tone is light olive (I&#x27;m Latina) my skin color is more like Jennifer Lopez  not George Lopez. DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL REGRET IT!</li>
    <li> tried it once and have never used it again, wasted of money and time</li>
    <li> I have just finished my third treatment on both legs, arm pits, chin, and lip.  I was skeptical when I began and six weeks later there AREA changes!  My leg hair that had to be shaved every other day takes over a week to need shaving and is very soft light hair.  This was the first place to see results and it is dramatic.  My arm pits are softer but still growing yet half the speed as before lazer use.  My face hair is responding a little slower but it IS responding.  I there is less hair and it grows a little slower.  It seems to be softer so the hair itself is changing texture and growth rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after I received this from my AMAZON wish list I jumped right in and mistakenly I used this over a tattoo on my ankle where I can barely see and omg POP it hurt for a few days after.  It literally burnt the skin.  I can&#x27;t imagine a very darkly completed person would enjoy this process.  Even if you zap a wrinkle in the skin like behind a knee POP it stings!  Thankfully I have very fair skin and the process is mostly comfortable unless I zap a wrinkle or my tattoo which I will NEVER forget to avoid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a NONO and this is close to the same price but actually does the job!  I&#x27;m seriously impressed by this machine!  I had to change my bulb half way through this third treatment but I luckily purchased one in advance so I had it covered.  I would suggest the same if you buy it because those flashes go fast having a treatment window only 1 inch wide and 1/2 inch tall.  It&#x27;s a lot of zapping to do an entire area.  I did my chin twice each session BTW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited that I have finally found something that deals with this at home and affordably.  Good luck to you and I will update in another month or so on my progress. :o)</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times and I have noticed a slight decrease in hair. I plan to keep it up!</li>
    <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I have very dark hair and very light skin, to the point that you can often see the hair under my skin. Shaving has always been a problem for me, leaving horrible razor burn that was so severe it bled for hours. I had basically given up on wearing shorts or short skirts. This product makes it possible for me to dress like a normal person. If you&#x27;re already at the &amp;#34;normal person&amp;#34; stage and you&#x27;re looking for a way to be even better, this will likely be a disappointment. However, if you&#x27;re like me, and have always have difficulty with razor burn and sensitive skin, you know just how valuable being &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it WILL NOT do:&lt;br /&gt;-Remove any and all hair as soon as you use it&lt;br /&gt;-Remove faint (light-colored) or light (not dense) hair&lt;br /&gt;-Eliminate 100% of hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it WILL do:&lt;br /&gt;-Drastically reduce both the amount of hair AND the coarseness of hair, making it possible to shave like a normal person or even skip shaving for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;-Greatly eases and expedites the shaving process&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce the appearance of hair UNDER the skin by shrinking the follicle itself, thereby minimizing &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;-If your hair is a serious problem, this is your solution. It will bring you up to the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; level.&lt;br /&gt;-If your hair is merely a nuisance, move along. This it not the product you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very glad to have this. It&#x27;s made my daily routine so much better, and my legs look better than ever. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, even on the high settings, and it&#x27;s very easy to use. It is a bit pricey, but considering how many pulses you get, it&#x27;s well worth the money. I&#x27;ve only done four treatments and am already very impressed with the results - I don&#x27;t yet know if they&#x27;ll be permanent, but it has made a significant difference so far. An excellent investment, and one that I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends!</li>
    <li> Am I doing it wrong? It&#x27;s painful as hell.  Like little electric shocks, burning, like an elastic hitting your arm.&lt;br /&gt;What am I doing wrong?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m white, shaved ahead of time, haven&#x27;t been exposed to the sun.  It&#x27;s on the lowest level...</li>
    <li> I already had laser hair removal accomplished professionally, but had some re growth I didn&#x27;t want to pay top dollar to address (simply based on the med spa price).  Bought this and it has worked wonderfully!!  I bought laser protective eyewear and still close my eyes when I click the button just to prevent the light from causing a headache.</li>
    <li> This machine let me with scars on both of my arms, I called to complain and nobody returned my calls. My burns were very deep and my scars are still showing up and down both my arms, I will never ever use this machine again!</li>
    <li> not to impressed with this product I really thought through the commercial it was as quick as it states. There is a prep to be done prior and then you apply the product to the area you want the hair to be removed. That takes a while for not hair or less hair to grow.</li>
    <li> Even though the write-ups say it is not guaranteed to remove facial hair, that is the reason I bought it and found it very effective.  The CD with instructions were clear.  I had tried electrolysis for awhile - results were poor and very painful compared to using this device.</li>
    <li> Love it -- I have only been using it for a month but can tell it is working.  I am thinking about investing in the upgrade to the permanent removal head.  Will continue to use and recommend.</li>
    <li> We got a defective one&lt;br /&gt;After not many flashes it wouldn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was new but now wonder if it was reconditioned and didn&#x27;t have many flashes left&lt;br /&gt;We sent it back to get a new one</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s be honest. This is a purchase you want to be skeptical. It works. Not on light hair and it&#x27;s a little painful on areas with darker skin but this really works. Used it twice on my upper lip, see only light peach fuzz. Bikini line, used it three times and and very little hair is growing back. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied this product at the level that it does extend the time of hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;I did three week test by only use it on my left arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 week: both arms&#x27; hair grow back three days after (i saw those little black heads and feel itches as usual)&lt;br /&gt;2nd week: I notice the hair on my hand didn&#x27;t grow back after a week(Awesome!) and the hair on the arms grow back on the fifth day. while the right arm feel itches and \\&quot;funny\\&quot;, my left arm&#x27;s hair is softI&lt;br /&gt;3nd week: some part of left arm doesn&#x27;t have any hair, some area have soft  hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is not a product that removes your hair permanently, but it does help by letting your shave less frequently.(Once a week for me )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;type: Asian Hair&lt;br /&gt;Frequency of usageF Once a week&lt;br /&gt;level: 2nd degree&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some Cons&lt;br /&gt;1: it is a bit lound&lt;br /&gt;2: the lights will make you feel blind (better not look at it when in use)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now.  I use it on my underarms (main reason I purchased it), my bikini area &amp; my legs.  My results are mixed.  I am still using it once a week on my underarms and bikini area - I do notice a difference, the hair is less dense but its still there.  I am nowhere near being able to not shave or even go sleeveless after a few days between treatments.  My legs however are a totally different story!  I haven&#x27;t shaved in a month and other than a few errant hairs my legs don&#x27;t have any hair on them.  I dropped the treatment to once every two weeks and now will probably go to every 3.  That alone is worth the money for me.  I&#x27;m holding off on a 5 star review though because it&#x27;s my underarms I really wanted to get rid of the hair on and that is still an issue.  I will update if more progress is made.  :)</li>
    <li> It was fantastic.  I ordered season 6. I&#x27;m so hooked. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Had written a review with out knowledge as to why this item can not be used by us with darker skin was going to delete it but decided to leave it up so others who are confused as to why darker skin tones can not use this item can read and learn from the first person who commented on this review. 😀 hope that person helps.</li>
    <li> my wife used it for over 2 wks. with no results. she&#x27;s going to try it for 2 more wks. If  there&#x27;s still no result&#x27;s, it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> Great product that works as advertised</li>
    <li> Need light skin tone doesnt work on my pigment im not even that tan tho at all</li>
    <li> this is the best hair removal i have ever used highly recommend</li>
    <li> Easy to use. I noticed results after the first treatment. Definitely worth the cost.</li>
</ol>
