      <li>I can&#x27;t begin to say how glad I am that I did!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Sure go to the dollar store and pick up some BP cream, and then ruin your clothing when it bleaches them!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It was amazing.</li>
      <li>this is AMAZING</li>
      <li>Since using this brand, my acne has disappeared and my skin looks amazing.</li>
      <li>, things with skin are like dancing, you just gotta find your own groove</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just as great (and even better than my favorite Perrigo brand).  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of price for a one month&#x27;s supply of acne \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Works almost as well as my prescription (and that stuff is strong!).  </li>
      <li>It is certainly more effective that most things I have tried, but it was not a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Then I put on a good moisturizer (mine is Super Antioxidant Night Rescue from Clinique)</li>
      <li>If you use it, make sure you apply lotion.</li>
      <li>I use this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (more of a cream) twice a day, morning and night, and it works wonders for my skin.  </li>
      <li>For me, the more BP I use, the better I can prevent breakouts.</li>
      <li>The advice was more helpful than some doctors have told me.</li>
      <li>I tried changing my sleeping habits, my diet, exercising more, etc.., etc... etc...</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s 10X better than it used to be.</li>
      <li>I feel so much more confident when i go out.</li>
      <li>I am SOOOOO glad i did because it is working better than anything else i have ever used in my life.</li>
      <li>Make sure you keep it off your lips as it did cause mine to crack, which was my fault as it says to avoid them</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>This 2 ounce tube, applied just once a day, keeps my 13 year olds complexion lovely.  </li>
      <li>My face probably wouldn&#x27;t survive without this stuff, I love it.</li>
      <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
      <li>Seems to work ok.</li>
      <li>but it will lead to more acne...........</li>
      <li>Once or twice a day is better.</li>
      <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>Messing with them just made it spread more and more.</li>
      <li>I was so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>it has been a week or so &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>Now I just make sure I leave a halo around my eyes and mouth where I don&#x27;t put this gel.</li>
      <li>I finally able to face the world with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I used to get more bump formation in the acne areas - even that is gone now).  </li>
      <li>Even the texture is better</li>
      <li>Otherwise, PLEASE try it if you know benzoyl peroxide treatments work better for you.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s just how it works, make sure you have moisturizer before heading out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this BP gel.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s already cleared off most whiteheads.</li>
      <li>My skin is healing from all the discolored scars since it keeps most of the acne in check</li>
      <li>My skin started breaking out more (again) in my mid-30&#x27;s</li>
      <li>i like that, feels like an exfoliation, and I assume helps the product get into pores better.</li>
      <li>and I look so much better</li>
      <li>And I&#x27;m SO glad I gave it a shot.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>This stuff is nothing short of amazing!!  </li>
      <li>Seems to be working well, but be warned, this is fairly strong and will cause dryness for most people.</li>
      <li>Very quick and effective, cleared up my face quickly.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t many available</li>
      <li>Luckily, after a three day break and lots of moisturizing, the lines went away for the most part, but I&#x27;ve been a lot more cautious since then.  </li>
      <li>Like most people, I will occassionally pick if I have a pimple, clean it with astringent and put some acne stuff on it overnight.</li>
      <li>Take it easy with the stuff</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Brilliant and not many US Benzoyl Peroxide products on Amazon ship to London</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I was 14-I&#x27;m now 27 and have tried everything under the sun!  I bought this product because my insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover the 2.5% prescribed by my doctor and this was the \\&quot;equivalent\\&quot; product they suggested.  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  I&#x27;ve taken oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics/creams/gels and NOTHING has cleared me up like this stuff has.  I started using it in January and my face got really dry (brutal Chicago winter) so I use Cetaphil moisturizer(the \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; one in the tub) religiously.      Before Glytone-my acne would clear up on certain meds but I still had the dark acne spots.  I have the kind of acne that sometime surfaces but for the most part just hurts and after two weeks heals and leaves a nice little spot in its memory.  After a couple of weeks on this-my spots faded considerably.  I NEVER used to leave the house without makeup (bare escentuals) because I was self-conscious about my acne pigmentation.  One day I realized that I had stopped wearing make-up b/c the dark spots were no longer noticeable.  I have super sensitive skin so my derm was surprised that I can tolerate this high % so well.      I NEVER write reviews but I know the stress acne can cause and the hours and $$ I&#x27;ve spent looking for a product that works.  I know this product won&#x27;t work for everyone b/c I hear it can be hardcore and aggravate sensitive skins, but it&#x27;s not too much $$ to give it a shot.  If it&#x27;s too drying for full-face application, you can apply it as a spot treatment (it drys pimples quick!).  I bought this in January and I still have about half the tube left.      **I know I&#x27;ve been curious as to other people&#x27;s acne regimes so here&#x27;s mine: I wash with a Cetaphil bar[[ASIN:B001I45ZFC Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Bar, 4.5-Ounce Bar (Pack of 6)]] in the A.M. &amp; P.M., use Glytone in the A.M. and Differin in the P.M. and moisturize with Cetaphil [[ASIN:B003AY3QWW \\&quot;Galderma Laboratories Inc 0299-391716 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, Fragrance Free 16 oz (453 g)\\&quot;]].  If I have make-up on I use the Neutrogena make-up remover wipes first...the ones in the light blue package :)  [[ASIN:B001E96NYS Neutrogena Make-Up Remover Cleansing Towelettes, Refill Pack, 25-Count Packs (Pack of 3)]]    I hope this review/product helps!</li>
    <li> If you use it everyday!</li>
    <li> i def recommend this for mild to mod acne breakouts. it cleared my skin but made it VERY dry.. so be careful about the # of times you apply. or use a very good moisturizer after.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products because they claim to work and then don&#x27;t or don&#x27;t live up to the hype.  As a mild to moderate acne sufferer for over 20 years starting at age 15, I have tried just about everything--as I&#x27;m sure most acne sufferers can attest to.  Some products didn&#x27;t work at all, some worked a little, some worked great for a while, but then stopped working and required a lot of money and a 3-step process.  My skin started breaking out more (again) in my mid-30&#x27;s just like it did when I was a teenager.  It was so annoying!  So I&#x27;ve been on a quest to find something, anything that would keep my skin in check.  Well, I found this Glytone.  I love this product because it actually does work really well (not perfect, but neither am I!) and it&#x27;s so simple and so affordable.  Some reviewer mentioned it being gritty, but I like it and it&#x27;s just mildly gritty.  My theory is it helps to get the benzoyl peroxide in the pores. It does dry the skin out, but it depends on how harsh your cleanser is and how often you apply the acne gel.  My skin is healing from all the discolored scars since it keeps most of the acne in check (works great for cystic acne too).  I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now and I love it!!! I started to break out after they had switched my birth control pills so my hormones went crazy. I tried over the counter medications but they helped very little. I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try and I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> Works great! You must use for more than just a few days. But with extended use this took care of little whiteheads that would not come to surface. Works great!</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t into a real long story about my acne, but I&#x27;ve had it since I was probably about 14-15 years old. I&#x27;m now 33 years old. During that entire time, I was never successful in keeping my acne under control. I tried every over the counter treatment sold, including Oxy, Clearasil, Panoxyl; different types of soaps and body washes, using dandruff shampoo to wash my face. I tried Proactive and some other less known similar treatments. I regularly saw 5+ different dermatologists and tried many different topical prescriptions such as Retin A and various other creams. I was on antibiotics for over 10 years, constantly switching between different types in hopes to keep it effective. I even ended up with intestinal issues due to the regular use of antibiotics attacking the natural bacteria needed in the intestines and was forced to use Probiotics along with my antibiotics. I tried changing my sleeping habits, my diet, exercising more, etc.., etc... etc... Nothing worked.    That is until I tried this stuff. I was pretty much convinced that it was just going to another failure in a long list of attempts, but it was only a few days after using that I saw an immediate difference. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month and I virtually have no more acne. This is what I do. I use a Soap twice a day called \\&quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Acne Soap\\&quot; to wash my face. Immediately after washing my face I apply Glytone in a thin layer. That&#x27;s it, nothing else.    I know not everything works for everybody, but if you&#x27;ve tried other stuff before and nothing seems to be working, go ahead and at least attempt using this product. Hopefully your results will be the same as mine.</li>
    <li> Ever since I hit 25, for whatever reason, be it the hormones or the excessive levels of life stress from trying to become a firefighter, I have been battling quite badly with cystic acne. Luckily for me, I only got it badly along the right side of my lower jaw-line, I had tried almost everything that was OTC since I lost my job in 2010 and don&#x27;t have health insurance. Thankfully I stumbled upon this while browsing some other facial treatment washes and gels and thought I&#x27;d go try to see if I couldn&#x27;t find it a bit cheaper on Ebay, thankfully someone was selling it brand new with free shipping for $8.99 (yes, it was the 2oz tube too!). After a couple days of using it, granted it did somewhat dry up my skin, I saw DRAMATIC decrease in size on the cysts, I had also unfortunately had a few zits that popped up on my chin and cheek area as well, dabbed some of that Glytone gel on and BAM! It was down in size the very next day. The dryness isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some other both prescription and nonprescription products that I&#x27;ve used in my day, but either way, the dryness can be easily combatted with the use of Cetaphil daily moisturizing wash (I use it on my body and face, it&#x27;s that amazing), as well as Bioelements crucial moisture (great stuff, but a bit pricey).  Really any moisturizer you&#x27;re currently using that doesn&#x27;t irritate your condition any further is great, things with skin are like dancing, you just gotta find your own groove and what works best for you. Overall, I DEFINITELY recommend this product to anyone looking to combat cystic acne.</li>
    <li> I have bad acne on the front of my forehead. I&#x27;m male in my 20s and I was trying everything that was out there. I even tried Pro-Active and that worked for a bit and then it came back. I was getting very frustrated that my face was looking really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product and saw the reviews and decided to give it at shot. It usually takes several days to notice a difference but I looked in the mirror about maybe 5-8 hours later and it was ALMOST GONE! I almost fainted; I was in total shock on how FAST this product has worked. I use it twice a day and my face it back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are tired of having bad acne and you have been in my place trying different products with little or no results PLEASE give this a chance. This is a life saver and I&#x27;m very glad this worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You to the company that made this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bryan</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for over a decade, and like most people in the same position, I&#x27;ve been desperately searching for an end-all cure. Recently, I&#x27;ve been focusing on healing my skin from the inside first (eliminating refined sugar and processed foods, eating more vegetables instead of grains and starches, drinking green smoothies, etc.). While that&#x27;s certainly been helping, I was searching for an external approach to complement that.  Though I&#x27;ve been on many over-the-counter as well as prescription antibiotics and topical creams, none have worked as well or as quickly as this product. Unfortunately, it makes my usually oily/combination skin very, very dry. I can combat that using moisturizers (jojoba oil, Vitamin E oil, etc.), but I definitely feel that this product wrecks havoc on my skin. Yes, this is 10% BP instead of the typical 2.5%, but if you look at the ingredients, you&#x27;ll also find that this product is most certainly not paraben-free. Also, I ended up getting a few deep wrinkles under my eyes -- at 22, that&#x27;s not okay! Luckily, after a three day break and lots of moisturizing, the lines went away for the most part, but I&#x27;ve been a lot more cautious since then.  I like to use this product sparingly -- spot treatment only, once a day or every other day. I imagine it would be better for acne on the back and chest, since those areas are less sensitive. I&#x27;m hoping that after a few months of my new diet changes, I&#x27;ll need less of this product -- but for now, it&#x27;s great at reducing my acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and tried many acne products over the last 35 years and this and another product that is no longer available are the only two that worked for me. I have an oily face and I use this twice a day and it works well without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;ve written a review for anything, this is definitely worth the (small) cost.  If you suffer from inflammatory acne, this is a miracle.   First time I used it, I didn&#x27;t expect anything drastic, and was shocked a couple hours later when I went to reapply, the swelling was COMPLETELY GONE!  It most definitely dries up the oily spots.  Expect the (previously) inflammed area to peel extensively for at least a week, but that&#x27;s because the swelling under that skin is now gone.  It doesn&#x27;t stop the &#x27;watery&#x27; sweat, but absolutely stops the oil production wherever applied-- my T-zone has  never been this dry!  It is slightly gritty, but as I don&#x27;t use foundation, it doesn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest.  Used sparingly, twice daily, the tube will probably last about a year, so  it is VERY much worth it!</li>
    <li> For any product at all to show any improvement in acne to me is something of a miracle, so that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. I&#x27;d give it 5 if it completely cleared it up, but I&#x27;m convinced no product on Earth can do that. I&#x27;ve had acne since 12y/o to 31y/o...got better with age but never went away entirely. For some reason I broke out more then normal and decided it was worth a shot. I was surprised that the flare up went away in a couple days of use. Maybe it was a coincidence since it was an unusual flare up. I&#x27;ve continued to use it and my skin is the same as always- break outs here and there, but nothing bad or worse then usual. So I&#x27;m happy with the product. Caused slight flaking of skin--but i really put a lot on and my skin is pretty bomb proof from decades of Rx ointments, elixers, and snake oils;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, and if it gets worse I&#x27;ll certainly buy another and add to the review it is a miracle cure. HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;re: gritty- it is gritty, but i like that, feels like an exfoliation, and I assume helps the product get into pores better. I don&#x27;t understand why you&#x27;d complain about that!</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for an acne product in my 16 year battle with acne. From very expensive to over the counter to infomercial to prescription. This has done miracles (I don&#x27;t use this term lightly) for my acne. Acne is GONE! It has never been completely gone only slightly and that sadly was enough for me. It finally dawned on me that really the only topical treatments that work on acne is a high strength benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. When I learned that I went on a quest for the highest percentage of benzoyl peroxide available and 10% is pretty much as high as it gets (without destroying your skin of course). There isn&#x27;t many available so when I finally came to this one I FOUND THE ONE!!! I am so grateful. The previous that I tried with the same strength is the Jan Marini one and that one was ok but not like THIS, sadly I was going to re-order that one because again it was good enough, thank goodness I paid a little more for this one. My routine now for those who care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Panoxyl 10% acne wash&lt;br /&gt;2) Glytone Acne gel 10%&lt;br /&gt;3) Neutrogena oil free moisture with sunblock (anything that says non comedogenic, or wont clog pores)&lt;br /&gt;4) Salicylic acid peel 20%-30% (Every two weeks or once a month)but really now I don&#x27;t even need this anymore :)</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> Works like a charm on my break outs.</li>
    <li> This stuff IS the best Benzoyl Peroxide that I have ever used and after 35years of acne breakouts (since age 12), I have used them all...I just hate that they call this a GEL.  It is a LOTION and as you are spreading it on your face it turns gritty as you are rubbing it in.  I will still buy it, I just hate how misleading the name of the product is.</li>
    <li> If you try any over the counter acne treatment and it doesn&#x27;t help or seems to get worse, go to a doctor!  Last year in a matter of a week my face went from perfectly clear to having over 30 lesions on my face. I am 30 and have suffered from intermittent acne in the past, but this was AWFUL. Not like any pimples or zits I ever had before. Big swollen infected red lumps- Imagine having mosquitos bites all over your face.  I tried the highly reviewed Murad kit from Sephora. It wasn&#x27;t doing anything so I went to a doctor, who happened to be a college buddy of Dr. Murad. It had been about four weeks since the problem started by the time I had my appointment and I didn&#x27;t even want to leave the house. I was so glad I did.  The doctor said the Murad was not working because it WASN&#x27;T ACNE on my face.  I can&#x27;t recall the medical term, but basically I had a staph infection all over. Like most people, I will occassionally pick if I have a pimple, clean it with astringent and put some acne stuff on it overnight. He said I must have touched something somewhere and gotten the bacteria on my hands. Later touching my face (I had started with a little pimple on my chin)the bacteria got into my skin. Messing with them just made it spread more and more. It was so bad I could never have gotten it to go away without antibiotics.  He put me on an oral antibiotic and only that. In 10 days my skin was smooth again. Several days later I learned a girl at work I shared a computer with was with her baby at the hospital, because the baby had been suffering from a staph infection that wouldn&#x27;t go away for several months. Thanks &#x3D;)  So like I said, if this or other acne meds don&#x27;t work, it might not be acne.  However, if you DO suffer from acne, this product will definitely help.  I had a breakout recently that was pretty bad-  This stuff has cleared it up in less than a week.  It can be tempting to overuse  new product when you are desperate to rid your face of acne. Use VERY LITTLE of this though, and ONLY on the affected areas. Tiny tiny tiny bits.  The first night and next morning, I put it on and kind of rubbed it around, and am now trying to recover from extremely dry skin. I had been putting Ponds face cream over it, as I do every morning and night. Even when the acne med was dry, rubbing lotion over it made it spread and cause drying in non-problem areas.  My face was so dry around my eyes and forehead it was crinkly looking- And I had only applied this twice at that point. Thats why I say TINY bits and MOISTURIZE!  Because so little is necessary to be effective, I imagine this will last me at least a year, if not more. I will never use anything else.  If you moisturize, I would suggest carefully doing so around your problem spots, then dabbing this medicine on your zits/pimples.</li>
    <li> Made my skin worse. Do not purchase this item! Wish I never had.</li>
    <li> Before I started using this product, maybe six or seven months ago, I had some mild acne issues and these two cystic pimples that kept reappearring on my cheeks ruining my life. Those monsters have been defeated. I&#x27;m usually so oily that the oils burn my eyes, man. This keeps that under control. My first tube lasted from June 2011 to February 2011 . My face probably wouldn&#x27;t survive without this stuff, I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Perrigo brand Benzoil Peroxide 10% with prescription since I was 13 but I&#x27;m having a hard time locating it.  I heard they discontinued it and now they only have the over the counter BP 10%.  I tried the acne wash, it only made me break out even more.  Btw, I get red acne, the ones that goes under your skin and it hurts when you touch, and of course, the white stuff comes with it too.  So gross, I know.  I also get em&#x27; all around my mouth and chin area.  My dermatologist sold me another BP 10% acne gel, which did an ok job but that one really dries up your skin and the gel is too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cream based on the great reviews and I have to say, it&#x27;s just as great (and even better than my favorite Perrigo brand).  Some people complain about the gel turning powder like.. I didn&#x27;t find it a problem at all.  Some poeple also mention it dries up their skin.  Most BP gels do that because the percentage is so high but this is what I do.  Before I sleep, I wash my face very well with the Clinique soap for oily skin (the soap really helps).  Then I put on a good moisturizer (mine is Super Antioxidant Night Rescue from Clinique), I let it dry, then put a layer of this cream.  Then I spot treat certain acne spots that are bumpy.  The next day, the bumps are considerably smaller, they don&#x27;t hurt and my face looks and feels great.  No dry spots either.  I hope they always sell this Gel here, cause I&#x27;ll buy it, Always!!</li>
    <li> I use this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; (more of a cream) twice a day, morning and night, and it works wonders for my skin.  Since I am very active throughout the day and sweating constantly I tend to get bad flare ups every now and then.  This acne gel has essentially cleared my skin up completely besides the occasional pimple or two that sometimes show up.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who has tried multiple face washes and creams that just won&#x27;t work.  It was very satisfying to finally know that I found a product that works every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it tends to dry the skin the first week or so, but it does stop after your skin gets used to the product.  Make sure you keep it off your lips as it did cause mine to crack, which was my fault as it says to avoid them but it&#x27;s something people should know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the previous reviewer, who mentioned that nothing else seemed to work. :)  I&#x27;m VERY glad that I did, too!!  This stuff actually WORKS!  Prior to this, I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, Clearasil, Wexler Acnescription products, Charcoal soaps and Sulfur-based zit creams, but NONE of them did very much.  Lots of money wasted, on hopes I&#x27;d get some relief.  So I went to search yet again for a solution, and came upon the other review here, and I decided to take a chance and try this stuff.    I can&#x27;t begin to say how glad I am that I did!  This stuff is nothing short of amazing!!  Literally, a breakout I had on my forehead started to clear up the same day I applied, and has been steadily improving since (beginning of day 3 and almost entirely gone/healed!).  The cream has a gritty texture, reminiscent of Proactiv&#x27;s face wash, but it seems to dissolve as it dries. -So not an issue for me at all.  I&#x27;ve even worn a thin later under foundation, and had no problems.    Along with this cream, I use [[ASIN:B002BWOXXK Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, 12-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and [[ASIN:B001G7PJAC Oxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 pads (Pack of 3)]] afterwards.  This system seems to be just what my skin needed, so to speak, to keep acne at bay.     Highly recommend this product for controlling acne breakouts and healing current ones!!  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than say Clearasil peroxide cream, but it&#x27;s WELL worth the extra cost!!</li>
    <li> It definitely speeds up the healing process when you are broken out. I have mild-moderate acne and I&#x27;m 26 years old. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I haven&#x27;t broken out in awhile. It keeps me clear and smooth. I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I think this cream is Awesome. It helped me out. I will order again when my skin starts to break out.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Put it on a zit when you feel it starting, and it quickly resolves the issue.  It really makes a difference in how fast it goes away and it keeps it from getting big</li>
    <li> Basically, this is proactiv. But at a fraction of the cost and without the complicated subscription.  I am in my 20s with combination skin that is prone to acne. I use a gentle cleanser (Cetaphil), this lotion every other day, and a gentle moisturizer.  When I am good at sticking with this routine, my skin is clear.</li>
    <li> Finally!!! After about 2 days of using this, I already started getting comments that it was noticeable my face was clearing up. I don&#x27;t want to over dry my skin, so I have only applied it once a day rather than up to 3 times. And it works!</li>
    <li> Really like especially on red broken pimples. Dries and shrinks pimple quickly. Take a little longer on new ones, but still a good spot treatment, because it has peroxide in it you will feel a drying effect, but this did not overdry my skin.</li>
    <li> I have hormonal acne so there really isnt much I can do other then try to reduce swelling and increase cell turn over. I have used antibacterials, proactiv, every otc product you could buy and never had results like when I did when my mother let me use her Benzoyl Peroxide. She would get 10% that peeled my skin badly and dried it out but worked. That was years ago and I have since updated my routine yet again. I now use cetaphil for sensitive skin face wash and I use cetaphil moisiturzing cream for sensitive skin. I added this Glytone (1 week delivery btw) because I miss Benzoyl Peroxide! This product is 10% and comes in a 2 oz. tube. Its texture is crumbly if you rub it too much which you are not supposed to do. Put it on your face in a thin layer and do not rub it in, it will turn your face red. Also start out once a day use and build up. My routine is Morning: Wash Moisturize makeup. Night: Wash Glytone Sleep. I have used this one day so far and everything has already massively shrunk &#x3D;] I am one step closer to clear skin! I will do my best to update this once a week for a month!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************&lt;br /&gt;So it has been a week or so &#x3D;] product is working well! I only use this once a day on target areas because it can be so drying. Usually for me it takes the swelling and redness down overnight :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is majic! It over dries my face a bit so I try to only put it where I need it the most. I love it &amp; will definitely purchase this item again, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a full year now.</li>
    <li> I had been using Neutragena&#x27;s on-the-spot acne treatment cream for years because it was the only thing that worked in the slightest when trying to control my blemishes. I had tried everything before that and discovered that salicylic acid was NOT for me, it made my skin oily and would create cystic acne. It was horrible. The benzoyl peroxide worked fairly well, causing no problems, but not ever completing clearing up the problem. I was kind of ho-hum about what to try next. Then I searched amazon for benzoyl peroxide creams/lotions/treatments and came across this. I was a little worried about trying a 10% solution, because I have combination skin and where I&#x27;m dry I get REALLY dry and flakey. BUT! I bought it. And it has made a life changing difference. I am blemish free for the first time in my life since I was 12 ( I am 30). I have never had anything do even close to what this gel does. I went to dermatologists and was prescribed all sorts of creams and antibiotics. The only antibiotic that temporarily worked without making me feel nauseous was minocycline, but I didn&#x27;t want to be on antibiotics for years. Not healthy! Anyway, with a combination of birth control (maybe TMI? I don&#x27;t care, I&#x27;m trying to help fellow acne sufferers!) and this cream at night, the Neutragena cream during the day, I am FREE of acne. That is some advice I&#x27;d give though, to use this at night only. It has a granular texture and if you don&#x27;t completely, I mean COMPLETELY rub it in, there are white streaks leftover. So, I only use it at night and then I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I look. Also, when I started using this, I have been using every day. For some really sensitive skinned people I would say start with every other night. I did notice dryness near my eyes and mouth for the first couple of weeks. Now I just make sure I leave a halo around my eyes and mouth where I don&#x27;t put this gel. Otherwise, PLEASE try it if you know benzoyl peroxide treatments work better for you. You will not be disappointed. I hope they never stop making this. Good luck!e disappointed. I hope they never stop making this. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product is the only reason why I don&#x27;t have all those little bumps/acne all over my forehead and cheeks. I use it every night and make sure to moisturize very well, morning and night. And remember to use broad spectrum sunscreen whenever you step outside!</li>
    <li> I love this product becuase it works SO well! It can be a little drying so all your need to use is just a little bit! I will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any true long lasting effects. If you use it, make sure you apply lotion. It will make your skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get rid of acne, stop being stressed out!</li>
    <li> My husband had severe acne. His self-esteem was so low so I took him to a dermatologist and we found a solution. They gave us a gel cream that was about $70 per bottle ( small bottle).  So I did my research and the Glytone Acne Gel has the same percentages and ingredients as his old gel cream but just cheaper price. Same great results. He has no acne...completely controlled. I would really suggest to do your research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s If your skin is being dried by the gel cream it&#x27;s because the 10% benzoyl is too harsh for your skin. Look for a lower percentage and moisturize and use suncreen because benzoyl plus harsh sun exposure equals wrinkles!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of this gel. For years I had trouble finding the right products for my oily, acne-prone skin. This gel does wonders for my skin and heals my breakouts within days. You&#x27;ll see even better results if you use it along with other Glytone products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week for my bacne. I have had new breakouts since then but, with other products as well, i&#x27;ve managed to get the inflamed skin under control. I believe this treatment helps but it does not seem to have significant effects on my bacne. I&#x27;d still like to give it more time before I abandon it completely..    Want to remove acne scars and stretch marks? Check out my blog: [...]</li>
    <li> It kinda dries up and feels like you put something nasty on your face, like diluted plastic, feels crappy. I lost it for about a year and didn&#x27;t even notice it was gone. good riddance. not memorable.</li>
    <li> This stuff is no better than any ten percent benzoyl peroxide you can buy at Walmart. It is just way more expensive.</li>
    <li> I was using ProActiv for a long time and its effectiveness was no longer working for me.  This product is helping to control acne breakouts.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered this after having read lots of very encouraging reviews. I was, however, slightly skeptical, as I&#x27;ve only ever had one acne product work for me. It was an oral medication (not acutane, but similar) which made me very sick and moody. I couldn&#x27;t handle it so I gave up on fixing my acne for awhile. Anyway, I bought this and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; And I&#x27;m SO glad I gave it a shot. I got it on January 4th. I began using it twice a day, every day. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out as badly as others have mentioned, but it does dry my skin enough to where my acne is almost completely clear on my cheeks and almost completely on my chin (the two places my acne was the worst). I will continue to use it if I continue to see an improvement. I doubt the tube will last as long as others have mentioned, but the bottle is bugger than I had anticipated. It really doesn&#x27;t take more than a dab for each section if the face, and I haven&#x27;t found it to be irritating while using face washes that have other active ingredients. Overall, not having to have a prescription, not messing with my body, and still seeing results... I give it a 5/5. I don&#x27;t know that it will work for everyone, but I was very glad to give it a shot.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son and it works great!!  We&#x27;ve tried just about every over the counter acne treatment with little to no success.  After a little research, we found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  After only two days of starting treatment, my son&#x27;s acne has cleared up.  Excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a serious breakout on my face this summer. I&#x27;ve tried everything to save my face but when the old bumps get somewhat calmed down there are always new ones popping out. Finally I tried this product. After several days&#x27; treatment, there has been a visible improvement of my face and no new breakout so far. I will continue to use it one time a day and see if it will work in the long run.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s not a miracle worker- at least not for me- but it gets the job done. My tube of clearasil also is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. In Glytone&#x27;s favor- this doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin as much, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a big white peely blotch when I apply it. Will I purchase again? meh- maybe- It&#x27;s going to take me awhile to use up this bottle, so I&#x27;m not worried about answering that question now.</li>
    <li> This is the second tube I purchased, I stopped using it after the first tube because I felt like I didn&#x27;t need it. Was using Salicyclic solutions in between but got a severe breakout two weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try this again and it&#x27;s already cleared off most whiteheads. I apply it every evening then use a blemish reducer overnight. Seems to be working well, but be warned, this is fairly strong and will cause dryness for most people. That&#x27;s just how it works, make sure you have moisturizer before heading out.</li>
    <li> This stuff works! AAA+++ Not some snake oil bs</li>
    <li> I have used many other acne gels for decades. I thought I would give glytone a shot. It has met my expectation and I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as Panoxyl Aquagel but it&#x27;s better than all the other brands out on the market right now.</li>
    <li> This stuff make your acne dry  in 2 days..</li>
    <li> i have used everything that a person can think about with no help for my acne, this product  i had results the next morning this is AMAZING</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been battling light acne on my cheeks and chin area for a few years now.  It wasn&#x27;t horrible and I really didn&#x27;t want to use anything too harsh because I don&#x27;t like putting more chemicals on or in my body than necessary.  But the organic/non-chemical-y face washes, lotions, generic acne creams, etc. just weren&#x27;t cutting it, so I wanted something a bit more powerful but not quite prescription strength (I didn&#x27;t think it was necessary for my level of acne).  This product worked really well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned - just use a tiny tiny bit only on the area that needs help, and nowhere else.  The first time I used it, I used a small amount and carelessly spread it in the genera area of my acne.  The product was pretty harsh on my skin, it was flaking for days!  I used really strong hemp-based hand lotion to keep down the dryness.  This effect was much more true of skin areas just outside the acne area - the acne area actually started seeing improvement very quickly (definitely within the first week or two).  I did not apply every day, maybe every third or fourth day, once my skin had recovered.  And once I learned my lesson and only applied the tiniest amount possible and only to the exact location of the breakouts and no further, it has been a much better experience.  I apply it maybe every other week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne has cleared up substantially, I don&#x27;t think my skin has looked this good in a long time.  Even the texture is better (I used to get more bump formation in the acne areas - even that is gone now).  So be careful and deliberate about application - it is a very powerful product, but it definitely worked for me!!</li>
    <li> I currently suffer from mild to moderate (if untreated) adult acne.  32 years of pimples, lol (mostly whiteheads in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked for me as well as any other 10% benzoyl peroxide treatments, but no better. I have currently been using this product 5 x per week (2 x per week I use a sulfur-based acne product) for 4 months continuously, and will finish my 4th tube soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying a 5th tube, because after my prolonged usage, I see no difference between this expensive product and the $4 to $5 versions available at Wal-Mart.  The stuff works fine... but there&#x27;s no magic to the other ingredients (that&#x27;s why they are called INACTIVE ingredients).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My usage of this product marks a return to benzoyl peroxide-based treatments after several years of sulfur-based treatments.  I can now state that, for me at least, there is no greater effect from either method - they both help prevent new whiteheads at about the same rate (70%), provided I wash my face with a basic soap (like Ivory) twice per day and get enough sleep.  However, the big hassle with the benzoyl peroxide products is that they stain my towels, sheets, and hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also discovered that benzoyl peroxide only works slightly better (if that) than milk of magnesia.  Yes, the stuff that costs $2 for a giant bottle at Target or Wal-Mart.  I will be returning to a regimen of 5 x per week sulfur-based product (search Amazon for options - I recommend &amp;#34;acnes sealing gel&amp;#34; or one of the cheap Mexican products) and 2 x per week milk of magnesia.</li>
    <li> Very quick and effective, cleared up my face quickly.  My only comment otherwise is that it is supposed to dry out your skin, and if your skin is very sensitive like mine, then you might experience flakey skin and dryness, nothing that a good lotion can&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> This clears up my acne very quickly. I also apply it on my nose, because it&#x27;s also very good at getting rid of blackheads. Be careful, this will make your skin very dry. I only use it on my nose and as a spot treatment. If you want to apply it all over your face, then you may want to look for some 2.5% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> Works almost as well as my prescription (and that stuff is strong!).  Be careful though, it does tend to bleach.  However, it controls acne well and for the price, it is hard to beat.</li>
    <li> just ok like other cheaper product</li>
    <li> Great product!  Clears up my breakouts fast!!  Don&#x27;t use to much, it can be over drying!</li>
    <li> Very drying. I&#x27;ve had Acne on and off for years. Tried this for a recent outbreak. Use it sparingly and keep far far away from eyes. If you sweat it will end up stinging eyes badly. As for clearing and, I find that Acnefree works just as well, is cheaper, and less irritating.</li>
    <li> I bout this due to the reviews it had and now that I have started using it I can see why the reviews were so high! I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and can see a big difference in my skin. I love it!</li>
    <li> I have a 13 year old daughter that had acne all over her face.  The doctor prescribed BenzaClin.  The sample we had worked GREAT.  But when I went to pick up the prescription for BenzaClin, they wanted $200 for it!  I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to pay that kind of price for a one month&#x27;s supply of acne \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.  The products available over the counter at the local Walmart did not work.  Finally I looked up products with Benzoyl Peroxide in them and found Glytone.  This 2 ounce tube, applied just once a day, keeps my 13 year olds complexion lovely.  She normally has sweaty hands and oily skin, but use of this product once a day does the trick.  The tube lasts about 3 months even though it is only 2 ounces.  So the cost is really not that outrageous.</li>
    <li> Tit didn&#x27;t do anything at all for my acne and also it made my face winkled. I believe there is an ingredient in it that does not do my skin justice. I stopped using it, disposed it and now my skin texture is back on track at least</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product for me and I bought it from her the first time. It just happens to be cheaper on Amazon and really keeps the pimples at bay.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have seen some effects, but probably it was more because I started to sleep regularly and eat healthy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on that product.</li>
    <li> I did a search for something similar to Differin Gel and i came upon this on amazon. Reading some of the thoughtful and detailed reviews by others who purchased this, it sounded like it was worth trying out. I am SOOOOO glad i did because it is working better than anything else i have ever used in my life. i have had serious issues with acne at different times in my life. The Differin Gel did a good job at keeping my skin somewhat managable but it is waaaay tooo expensive, and you have to pay a dermatologist to get a perscription. The Glytone Gel has been Keeping sudden breakouts to a bare minimum, somedays not even any at the end of the day. I&#x27;m used to seeing a few by bed time. I feel so much more confident when i go out. If only i had found this sooner! I wanna thank all the other reviewers for taking the time to tell their stories. The advice was more helpful than some doctors have told me.</li>
    <li> The formula works well, and my skin cleared up only a few weeks after using. However, I think it costs way too much for such a small amount. For me, the more BP I use, the better I can prevent breakouts. There is only enough for a few full face applications. And the price is hefty for only 2oz. Better to use something like Topix, which you can apply on your whole face, and you get 8oz for only $11. I think this is good for spot treatments.</li>
    <li> The best acne gel I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just trying it out so far I see some results</li>
    <li> I got this for my 13 year old daughter. She used for about 3 months and her face actually got worse. She decided to switch to just soap and water and nothing else then she started to clear up a bit. Not sure what&#x27;s up with this product but it didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
    <li> I used to have to deal with acne and breakouts all the time. I tried almost everything out there. I was about to start using proactive, but I read about benzoyl peroxide. I started using this acne gel and I found it to work the best with my oily skin. I have not had a breakout since I started using it. I use it only at night and I found it to work all day. The only thing I found out is that it bleaches your clothes if you wipe your face after working out.</li>
    <li> On Dec 1 2011, I bought this product because I was battling huge pores, bad cystic acne. I&#x27;ve been using everything from oil of olay to neutrogena products. I even schedule visits at a dermatologists. Since using this brand, my acne has disappeared and my skin looks amazing. I no longer wear foundation to cover my acne scars because my skin tone has even out and I now have my confidence back. I feel and look 18 again.</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve tried other products (for YEARS) without success, and this was the first product I&#x27;ve used that has noticeable and, most importantly, consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has cleared up my skin, and one of the things I like most about it is that if I forget to use it for a couple days and begin to break out, it works really quickly. I can apply it at night and be clear by morning. I have sensitive skin (other acne treatments usually leave me with really noticeably dry skin or sometimes even a rash), but whatever formula they&#x27;ve used for this is perfect. Effective, not drying, not irritating. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it nightly, and this 2-ounce package has lasted me 6 months. Well worth the small cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since other reviewers have included other products they use, here goes: This Glytone nightly, [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]] every morning, and [[ASIN:B0057RIM5G Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector Skin Renew, 1.7 Ounce]] every morning to reduce old acne scarring. I can&#x27;t say my skin is flawless... I&#x27;m almost 30 so I had a lot of years of red spots/scarring built up that may not ever totally go away, BUT it&#x27;s 10X better than it used to be. Breakouts are nonexistent and the red spots from old breakouts are much, much lighter since I&#x27;ve been using these three products together.</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews of this product, I had high expectations and unfortunately I was disappointed. For years, I have had considerable, persistent cystic acne on my upper back.  A dermatologist had recommended the [[ASIN:B0000Y3COC PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz - 1 Bar]] for me, which I still use daily, but that has had no effect that I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is hormonal. I found this out because while I was pregnant and breast feeding, the acne completely went away. I mean 100% gone. It was amazing. But as soon as I weaned, it was back full force. Really inconvenient for summer (or ever). So I started using this gel. I gave it 3 stars, because 60% is about the amount of my skin it cleared up. Despite using it regularly every night for a month, I am still getting new spots. It is certainly more effective that most things I have tried, but it was not a miracle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One answer would probably be to use it more than once a day, but I can&#x27;t because THIS STUFF WILL DESTROY ANYTHING IT TOUCHES. In the first few days, I destroyed a hand towel, a pajama top, and a set of sheets. Now I use all white towels and sleep in a thick white t-shirt. I wouldn&#x27;t dare put this on in the morning or all my clothes would be wrecked. It&#x27;s a bummer because twice a day might get me to that miracle level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grit doesn&#x27;t bother me, but obviously it&#x27;s not on my face. And it&#x27;s not that gritty. After one month, my tube is almost gone.</li>
    <li> It works well on getting rid of acne but it&#x27;s too strong for my skin. Not only does it dry it out but it also makes my face really red and itchy. Because of this I only use this product when I&#x27;m desperate and having a really bad breakout. However, it literally gets rid of my acne in a day, so I suffer with red irritated skin for 1 day to have a clear face the following day.</li>
    <li> Seems to work ok. The chemical bleached my towels so you have to be really careful of that. I think Benzoyl Peroxide dries out acne faster than sulfur-based products. But I still use both.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face red where ever I have applied it. Would not purchase again, sorry.</li>
    <li> helps to dry out pimples and clear them but does not prevent them, you have to keep putting this on but it makes your skin dry.  i use it now only to stop pimples from getting big and it will dry it out after forming</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years..like seriously i was monster covered with pimples on my cheeks..they were either red or white which about to explode..sometimes i would use makeup to cover it..but it will lead to more acne........... this is really frustrating!! but one day i was checking a video about how to wash your face properly, and they mentioned using any (Benzoyl Peroxide gel)... so i found this Glyton randomly on Amazon and decided to give it a try...as i tried many acne products before!!... the steps for proper washing are:-&lt;br /&gt;1)Wash your face gently with a cleanser...&lt;br /&gt;2)Dry your face very gently with a towel....&lt;br /&gt;3)apply thin layer of Benzoyl Peroxide gel on affected area and leave it for 15min...&lt;br /&gt;4)after,apply gently any face cream to moisturise your skin..since Glyton will dry it out -which is a good thing to get rid of acne!-  I did these steps morning and night..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and in a less than a week I COULD NOT believe that my ugly face is getting better..all the active acne have calmed down,,,and I finally able to face the world with my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice:&lt;br /&gt;- at first,apply it only on one spot to make sure it is good for your skin and will not cause you any irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t use it after scrubbing or waxing your face for a week..or you&#x27;ll end up in burned face :O</li>
    <li> I have adult acne that will not go away.  I need to use this steadily to figure if this works for me.</li>
    <li> I never had acne as a teenager and thought I was out of the woods as I went into college. Joke was on me! I&#x27;m in my early 20s now and suddenly was inundated with acne. I tried over-the-counter stuff, then went to my dermatologist. We tried multiple prescription creams, even several different antibiotics, to no avail. At one point I was taking 1,000 mg of amoxicillin every day trying to get rid of it. We tried different things for MONTHS, costing hundreds of dollars with no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had nothing to lose (except my acne) so I went on Amazon and looked up the highest rated acne treatments. This one stood out. I ordered it with extremely low expectations--if prescription creams didn&#x27;t work, why would this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for four days and already my acne is significantly improved. The smaller \\&quot;remnants\\&quot; of blemishes I&#x27;ve had for the last few months have nearly disappeared, and newer ones are shrinking. I wash my face, apply this grainy gel gently in a circular motion, wait 10 minutes, then put on moisturizer. It&#x27;s only been four days and I look so much better my friends have commented on it. I have no idea why this one works when supposedly \\&quot;better\\&quot; treatments didn&#x27;t, but here we are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from acne, try this. I wish I&#x27;d tried it before I spent so much money on prescriptions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Unfortunately I&#x27;ve had to stop using this product because it has bleached all my towels, sheets, and shirts. I always apply it and wait at least 10-20 minutes before touching anything else to it, but somehow it&#x27;s still bleached everything. It did work well, so I&#x27;m bummed I can&#x27;t use it, but it really did completely ruin a ton of my stuff. I wish there was a note about this on the bottle, so I&#x27;m sharing it now. If you use this, be wary of anything that comes near your face (or your fingers after you&#x27;ve applied it--even after I washed them off, it still bleached things I touched!)</li>
    <li> I used to go to a dermatologist for genetic acne and was given &amp;#34;Benzac&amp;#34;. I looked up the BP percentage and it was the same as this, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I used to get a GIANT tube of Benzac for just a few dollars, this is a tiny tube, and for the large relative price, and amount you have to use to constantly treat recurring acne, this is just not worth it over your regular OTC BP percentage. In fact, if you go to any dollar store they usually have tubes of Dr. Sheffields zit cream for about $1. You can get like 10 of them and they work noticeably as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly if you didn&#x27;t mind forking over a consistently large amount of cash to use the higher BP%, then this would work a bit better, but most people these days would rather not, including myself.</li>
    <li> Good product works very well on certain type of acne.</li>
    <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Glytone and am pleased to say that it works well. I was afraid it would irritate my skin and possibly be too harsh. Previously, I used a prescription product recommended by the dermatologist. Unfortunately, that product is no longer available, so I was glad to find a comparable product. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin and made it break out even MORE and then took two months for my skin to clear up after going back to what I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so take my review with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> great product.. finally something that actually works without any side effects.. had a bad scar on my forehead, now its almost gone</li>
    <li> I did some research and ordered this as an alternative to Differin Gel and it is working great.  My face broke out badly when I first started to use it, as expected, but now I&#x27;m a month in and my skin looks great!  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this BP gel. It gets the job done for spot treating zits and dries them up overnight or within 2 days. Beware that it is quite strong. It&#x27;s a good idea to use a water based moisturizer like Sebamed Clear Face Gel or Face Reality&#x27;s Hydrating Emulsion when using this to counter the dryness. If you have more than a few areas to treat, you should start with a 2% BP gel all over your face. Start slowly wearing the BP only an hour the first day, then 2 hours the 2nd day, until you work your way up to wearing it all night. Your skin has to get used to benzoyl peroxide products. In addition to the 2% gel, you can spot treat the bigger zits with this 10% gel. If you&#x27;re still breaking out all over when you&#x27;ve been using the 2% gel while, bump up your treatment with a 5% BP gel all over at night.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved me when I went off birth control. I never had to deal with acne when I was younger so I had no idea how to get rid if the cysts that were suddenly popping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having cystic acne (below skin, no head, large, EXTREMELY painful) THIS is the stuff you need (benzoyl peroxide.) Don&#x27;t waste your time with sacylic acid, it won&#x27;t help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did dry out my skin, but it was a small price to pay! I mixed it with lotion for my back and then used it undiluted on trouble spots. Never ever had an issue with it bleaching fabric--except for once, one shirt? I&#x27;d suggest giving it some time to dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing that this stuff doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I often apply it twice daily to about half of my face. It&#x27;s keeping inflammatory acne at bay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was a teenager and am now 30, not a good look.  This whole line is fabulous, I use the acne line with the &amp;#34;step up&amp;#34; anti aging stuff and it works together great - acne stuff keeps pimples from forming and alone.  anti aging stuff helps with scars and keeps skin smooth and pores small.&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT your average BP cream, this is a higher quality, does NOT dye and bleach my clothing towels or pillow cases.  Worth the price for that.  Sure go to the dollar store and pick up some BP cream, and then ruin your clothing when it bleaches them!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that great for me. Used other gels with same strength and those worked better.</li>
    <li> I found this product while searching for a replacement for my clindamycin phosphate gel prescription.  While at first I was disappointed that it was a cream instead of a gel, the effectiveness of this stuff quickly won me over. It works!  I&#x27;m in my mid-twenties and have had acne for ever. My skin is oily with enlarged pores. This cream controls my breakouts and has even decreases the oiliness.    However...! Two things to be mindful of:    1. While the package says to apply three times a day, that&#x27;s way too drying. Once or twice a day is better. I made the mistake of applying it too often, which resulted an a dry flaky patch that lasted several days. Take it easy with the stuff and you&#x27;ll still see good results.    2. The main ingredient is benzoyl peroxide - which means it bleaches. I noticed discoloration on my pillowcases and tshirts (I apply this on my shoulders, chest, back). So if you need to use this anywhere other than your face, make sure you don&#x27;t care too much about what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of negative reviews but you have to realize that everyone is different and some people may be allergic to benzoyl peroxide. I have actually tried an acne product that made my acne exponentially worse and realized I was allergic to an ingredient in the medication. So please, before you read the &amp;#34;most helpful reviews&amp;#34; and decide to ditch this product, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is strong and will quickly dry up RED pimples with the emphasis on red.  Benzoyl peroxide does not work well with other forms of acne.&lt;br /&gt;-You only need to use a SMALL amount for this to work. A very thin layer will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;-Works much faster than comparable 10% benzoyl peroxide ointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It moderately dries up your skin.  However, any 10% benzoyl peroxide ointment will inherently dry up your skin.  If you notice this happening, reduce the frequency of use and use some lotion with aloe vera to moisturize your skin AFTER the ointment has dried completely.&lt;br /&gt;-It is a little expensive compared to other products but in my opinion it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;This product works very well and if you use too much and/or are allergic to this, you will notice poor results and this product might not be for you. But if you use a thin layer and wash your skin before you apply the ointment, this will really reduce your red pimples quickly.  It is worth the money!</li>
    <li> I used to have REALLY awful acne, but once I started using this on my face every night, I noticed a big difference almost instantly. You don&#x27;t even need to apply it every day, but I did because my skin was pretty bad. I am now at the point where I don&#x27;t really need to use it that often (maybe once a week or so), but it is still great for quick healing of those big ones that come up at the worst times!</li>
    <li> Works quickly for mild to moderate acne.  I switch medications because my skin gets use to it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! I used to use Benzoyl Peroxide and erythromycin which worked for me, but then after a while I started breaking out again &amp; it did nothing to help me. I tried several medication form the dermatologist. My dermi pescribed another medication that cost over $400 and I could not afford that since the insurance did not cover it. SO I came on Amazon and decided to try this. BEST DECISION EVER! SO cheap &amp; it really works! It lasts me a little over three months. It dries out my acne and as long as I use it I do not have any breakouts! Love!</li>
    <li> Trust me don&#x27;t use this product. Do not believe in comments saying they&#x27;ve waited decades for this one. It&#x27;s a lie. Don&#x27;t wait until you get some dark pimple scars and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret using this and now I have to see a dermatologist and pay extra $$$$$. No cream can stop growing pimples. It&#x27;s in your genes. Yes we can prevent them but we can&#x27;t stop them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: Always consult your dermatologist. Do not use OVER THE COUNTER medication.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best product thank you very much</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me&lt;br /&gt;Wish you luck</li>
</ol>
