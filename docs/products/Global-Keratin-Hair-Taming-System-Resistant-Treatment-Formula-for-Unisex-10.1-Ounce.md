      <li>I was hesitant to buy this online, I had it in my hair once over an year ago and loved it though!  </li>
      <li>but great item</li>
      <li>works great</li>
      <li>And because I wasn&#x27;t feeling well, it was great to have my hair be invincible.  </li>
      <li>-- I am rethinking my review...as my hair looked great on my wedding day...</li>
      <li>Product is great for decreasing drying time, but dissappointed with lack of straightness and smoothness.  </li>
      <li>It smells pleasant and is not sticky like others I have tried.</li>
      <li>Really good result.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
      <li>I have been keratin-ing my hair for almost 4 years now, and this is my favorite!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>and I am so pleased with the results!</li>
      <li>It took me about 5 hours to do my hair in the comfort of my own home.</li>
      <li>and I loved it, but I didn&#x27;t love the price or having to depend on an appointment at the stylist.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very strong.  </li>
      <li>Will probably still use though as I don&#x27;t want to risk myself to harsher chemicals in more effective products.</li>
      <li>I will probably not buy from amazon on this product just to be sure I am getting the correct product.</li>
      <li>Awesome product especially if you have curly and freezy hair.</li>
      <li>I had chemically damaged hair and now I can brush it without it falling out:-)</li>
      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>The results were better than salon quality.</li>
      <li>Also leaves hair healthier and more heat resistant.</li>
      <li>Love this keratin treatment..</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and my hair is much more manageable.  </li>
      <li>Still, it is a wonderful product as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to perform</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed !</li>
      <li>Since I am able to maintain my own hair I found this to be worth the buy.</li>
      <li>But strongly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Rather than finding a new stylist and paying someone an arm and a leg or using a cheap, crappy store bought keratin treatment, I found my beloved GK taming system in Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have been getting keratin treatments in salons for the last three years and had great results.  </li>
      <li>Takes the frizz out of your leaving it silky,shiny smooth.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the product and the results although it took me three hours to complete.  </li>
      <li>I love my hair straight as when it is humid</li>
      <li>I just now tried it on my hair and sure enough the product has made my hair look better than when I get it done at the salon.</li>
      <li>Its my favorite so far.</li>
      <li>I got my first keratin treatment in 2012 and it made my hair dreams come true.  </li>
      <li>It cost $150 not including tip, but it was totally worth it.  </li>
      <li>After the first wash, and after my hair was  dry, I was very, pleased at the results.  </li>
      <li>When I moved, I found a great new stylist that does natural hair, but she only does the Brazilian Blowout and she about $400!</li>
      <li>After 48 hours I did my first workout at the gym</li>
      <li>Leave my hair smooth, soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>If rinsed out it is better but not the same.</li>
      <li>I s my first time using this product</li>
      <li>Worked very well for me!</li>
      <li>It dried into beautiful curls with lots of body and shine and is soft and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very coarse and frizzy, so I do not get silky smooth or straight hair from this treatment, but the quality of my hair is significantly improved and the curl is relaxed.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very smoothed (not completely straight though, which is fine), feels very soft and shiney, and is much more manageable.</li>
      <li>But the real test was the first wash.  </li>
      <li>Lived it made my hair super soft ans</li>
      <li>I first used Coppola, which did a fairly good job, and then a Brazilian keratin I purchased here on Amazon, which was satisfactory but not amazing.</li>
      <li>Is it as straight as the \\&quot;real\\</li>
      <li>but  it contained something very toxic, my friends eyes were sore and bloodshot for 3 days afterwards.  </li>
      <li>My client has really curly frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>My hair stayed straight, I can run my fingers through from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife absolutely loves this stuff.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it</li>
      <li>and it last nicely  one month, and by the end of second month it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other 0&lt;br /&gt;Products and I like GK the most.</li>
      <li>This product works better on my extremely curly, frizzy, fine hair than any other keratin treatment I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>The Resistant formula is the only one I&#x27;ve had that leaves my hair soft, silky and smooth.  </li>
      <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it washes out so quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought this product when my last Keratin  product was used up, this was the first time I used this particular product.  </li>
      <li>When I moved away I couldn&#x27;t find any stylist around my new house that uses it.</li>
      <li>my (African American) hair feels conditioned, soft, and as straight as if I just left the salon:).</li>
      <li>I am giving it 4 stars because of the high cost, the fact that it completely washes out of my hair in 3 months (not 5, as the manufacturer states), and because I believe that the claims about what the product can achieve are overstated.  </li>
      <li>The first salon charged $350 and my current salon charges $130 each time which is about every 2-3 months.  </li>
      <li>I recently applied it myself for the first time (rather than in a salon), and it was not difficult to obtain the same results at home.  </li>
      <li>The days following, my hair was light and flowy with lots of shine and minimal frizz...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not harsh as a relaxer</li>
      <li>The whole process only took approx 2 hours but afterwards I could not have been happier with the results.</li>
      <li>For my VERY curly hair, this is the only keratin product that works.</li>
      <li>So I told myself that I would not waste my money by getting another treatment.  </li>
      <li>And not a little rain...</li>
      <li>It was TOTALLY worth the investment to buy the taming system, clarifying shampoo, and aftercare products for less than the price of a trip to the salon.</li>
      <li>It was cheaper to buy the system and do it myself than to travel all the way back to my old stylist and have it done!</li>
      <li>The Brazilian Blowout is a long, complicated process of washing, blow drying and flat ironing twice in one session and it didn&#x27;t give me the great results that I remember with GK.</li>
      <li>This product actually leaves your hair softer than a perm does without ruining your natural hair.</li>
      <li>I cannot wash and go or wear my natural hairloose anyway because of the various textures.</li>
      <li>At about day 4, my scalp developed an allergy to the product, so going forward, I will only leave it in my hair for 2-3 days before washing.</li>
      <li>Plus, I have at least 3 more treatments left in the bottle so it should last me a year!</li>
      <li>The last product I used was toxic too,  but the fumes from this Keratin treatment were completely overpowering.  </li>
      <li>My hair has zero frizz and is soft and I no longer have to flat iron at all.  </li>
      <li>I went back the following year and got another one done, and the results were completely the opposite.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought this product when my last Keratin  product was used up, this was the first time I used this particular product.  I love my hair straight as when it is humid my hair is a frizz.  My hair colour is blonde.  My friend who is a hairdresser applies a Brazilian straightner to my hair and has been doing for a few years.  I get it done about twice a year. But this time both of us had streaming eyes, it was extremely toxic.  We both wore glasses and had the back door to the house open.  The last product I used was toxic too,  but the fumes from this Keratin treatment were completely overpowering.  My friend says she is not prepared to apply this product for me in the future and I would also never use it again.  It says it does not contain formaldehyde but  it contained something very toxic, my friends eyes were sore and bloodshot for 3 days afterwards.  I thought I would never get to rinse my hair out and get rid of the fumes.</li>
    <li> Its the best will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> I have been getting keratin treatments in salons for the last three years and had great results.  The first salon charged $350 and my current salon charges $130 each time which is about every 2-3 months.  I decided to go by my observations and used online instructions of how to do this myself to save money.  I followed the instructions down to every detail and my (African American) hair feels conditioned, soft, and as straight as if I just left the salon:). I am very pleased with the product and the results although it took me three hours to complete.  I am hoping to get faster at it over time, but the blowdrying took me a while.  I also bought and used the Babyliss flatiron and blow dryer set (on sale now on style bell) which also worked perfectly for the process.</li>
    <li> Fall down and removal hairs</li>
    <li> this I s my first time using this product and I really like it&lt;br /&gt;I did tried othe products before this one but I will keep&lt;br /&gt;using this one.and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Lived it made my hair super soft ans shiny feels like I have life to my hair again!! I had chemically damaged hair and now I can brush it without it falling out:-)</li>
    <li> I had the GK Hair taming done in a salon a few years ago and I loved it, but I didn&#x27;t love the price or having to depend on an appointment at the stylist. I am black and have natural, very long, thick, layered hair of various textures from loose waves in the back and front, to kinky dry curls in the center section. When I moved, I found a great new stylist that does natural hair, but she only does the Brazilian Blowout and she about $400! The Brazilian Blowout is a long, complicated process of washing, blow drying and flat ironing twice in one session and it didn&#x27;t give me the great results that I remember with GK. Rather than finding a new stylist and paying someone an arm and a leg or using a cheap, crappy store bought keratin treatment, I found my beloved GK taming system in Amazon. It was TOTALLY worth the investment to buy the taming system, clarifying shampoo, and aftercare products for less than the price of a trip to the salon. Plus, I have at least 3 more treatments left in the bottle so it should last me a year! It took me about 5 hours to do my hair in the comfort of my own home. Applying the product is as simple as if you were dyeing your hair at home. Blow drying and flat ironing was the longest process and I&#x27;m already used to doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely straighten my hair, but when I do, my biggest problem is that when I work out, my hair totally reverts and is ruined after all my hard work. That&#x27;s the main reason I did this treatment, I wanted my hard work of flat ironing to last and for my hair to be weatherproof and workout proof. After 48 hours I did my first workout at the gym and I am so pleased with the results! My hair did not swell into a big frizzy, knotted, tangled, curly mess after a 1,000 calorie burning workout...and I sweat pretty hard. My hair stayed straight, I can run my fingers through from root to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed my hair, my curl pattern should came back, but less bulky. I cannot wash and go or wear my natural hairloose anyway because of the various textures. I always just wear a bun or braid out or a roller set so I&#x27;m not concerned with losing my curl pattern. The GK hair taming system has dramatically reduced the amount of time it takes me to style my hair whether I’m doing a simple ponytail, a braid out, or a roller set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to invest in this miracle product and do it myself! It has literally changed my life and saved me a ton of time!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!! I got my first keratin treatment in 2012 and it made my hair dreams come true.  It cost $150 not including tip, but it was totally worth it.  I went back the following year and got another one done, and the results were completely the opposite.  Foolishly, I went back a third time and again, the results were less than desirable.  So I told myself that I would not waste my money by getting another treatment.  It wasn&#x27;t until recently that I realized that the reason the treatment was not working was because of the possibility that it was watered down.  So I did a search and came across this product.  I read the reviews and told myself to go for it.  The worse that could happen would be that I wasted another $100.  Got home from work and started the process of washing my hair with a clarifying shampoo and started the application process, followed by the blow dry and then flat iron.  The whole process only took approx 2 hours but afterwards I could not have been happier with the results. I followed the instructions to not tie your hair back or put it in a pony tail or use barretts, bands, etc....The days following, my hair was light and flowy with lots of shine and minimal frizz...I didn&#x27;t mention that I am African American with extremely tightly coiled hair. But the real test was the first wash.  After the first wash, and after my hair was  dry, I was very, pleased at the results.  Just washed my hair again, and let it air dry and I love it!!!!!  It&#x27;s my dream hair all over again. It dried into beautiful curls with lots of body and shine and is soft and bouncy.  I&#x27;ve been in humid, windy weather and all I have to do is shake my head and shape it a little bit and I&#x27;m good to go.  I will wait to see how long the results last, but for now, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Will definitely use this product again and have referred it to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this keratin treatment for about a year now and my hair is much more manageable.  I recently applied it myself for the first time (rather than in a salon), and it was not difficult to obtain the same results at home.  My hair is very coarse and frizzy, so I do not get silky smooth or straight hair from this treatment, but the quality of my hair is significantly improved and the curl is relaxed.  I am giving it 4 stars because of the high cost, the fact that it completely washes out of my hair in 3 months (not 5, as the manufacturer states), and because I believe that the claims about what the product can achieve are overstated.  Still, it is a wonderful product as long as you don&#x27;t expect it to perform miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to know: the clarifying shampoo that is used prior to the keratin will strip color.  Also, the keratin should be used in a well ventilated area, as the fumes made my throat burn (before I opened the window).  My stylist says you have to leave the treatment in for 48 hours, but can wait several days before washing if you want to.  At about day 4, my scalp developed an allergy to the product, so going forward, I will only leave it in my hair for 2-3 days before washing.</li>
    <li> The bottle was opened.&lt;br /&gt;Not the original.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> This is the best product, i am very happy with my purchase,y hair has never looked better i will buy it again, Thank you!</li>
    <li> works great they have now upgraded  the solution. but great item</li>
    <li> Love this product...my hair is fabulous!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product especially if you have curly and freezy hair. It&#x27;s not harsh as a relaxer so it just tames the hair and defends it from the humidity. Its very thick so you just need to use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second time using it so I highly recommend it and it will last at least 5 months!</li>
    <li> Takes away the frizz. Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this keratin treatment.. Its my favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I will admit it -- I am a keratin straightening junkie and then my salon stopped doing it.  I have been in hair panic mode ever since.  This stuff works.  Is it as straight as the \\&quot;real\\&quot; stuff -- no not exactly. But it doesn&#x27;t frizz-up or make me dread humid days, so close enough for me. The price...well it lasts a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  December 2012 -- I am rethinking my review...as my hair looked great on my wedding day...despite rain.  And not a little rain...lots of rain.  And because I wasn&#x27;t feeling well, it was great to have my hair be invincible.  So I am updating my review to reflect five stars.</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this stuff.  It&#x27;s way cheaper then going to the salon and the results are the same.  Only issue is the smell.  It&#x27;s very strong.  Recommend doing it in a well ventilated place.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this online, I had it in my hair once over an year ago and loved it though!  It was worth the purchase, the diy at home was so conveinient and way less expensive and with the same results.  My hair has zero frizz and is soft and I no longer have to flat iron at all.  I recommend that you use less product than you think you need though, it took forever to blow dry my hair with the keratin in it!</li>
    <li> I have used GK for years ( used to be Global Keratin). For my VERY curly hair, this is the only keratin product that works. It lasts on my hair for up to 6 months, Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever made. This product actually leaves your hair softer than a perm does without ruining your natural hair. This product also allows your hair to grow healthier.</li>
    <li> I have been using Global for years and this is not the same product as before. It feels thick and unmanageable after following the directions.  If rinsed out it is better but not the same. I will probably not buy from amazon on this product just to be sure I am getting the correct product. It smelled different too. Probably a knock off.</li>
    <li> This product works better on my extremely curly, frizzy, fine hair than any other keratin treatment I&#x27;ve used.  The Resistant formula is the only one I&#x27;ve had that leaves my hair soft, silky and smooth.  It smells pleasant and is not sticky like others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Really good result. My client has really curly frizzy hair. She said it&#x27;s the best treatment she&#x27;s had!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting the Best tx done at a salon for about 14 months now. When I realized I could do this at home , I of course purchased the product and tried it on my sisters hair. The results were better than salon quality. I just now tried it on my hair and sure enough the product has made my hair look better than when I get it done at the salon.</li>
    <li> I have been keratin-ing my hair for almost 4 years now, and this is my favorite! I first used Coppola, which did a fairly good job, and then a Brazilian keratin I purchased here on Amazon, which was satisfactory but not amazing. This stuff is great!!!!! My hair is very smoothed (not completely straight though, which is fine), feels very soft and shiney, and is much more manageable. Really happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Worked very well for me! My hair did not frizz, even with the extreme humidity of South Florida.</li>
    <li> Takes the frizz out of your leaving it silky,shiny smooth. Also leaves hair healthier and more heat resistant. I was not disappointed !</li>
    <li> Excellent product. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it, is that it washes out so quickly. My hair is so curly and I wash my hair just twice a week and it last nicely  one month, and by the end of second month it&#x27;s gone. I usually have it done every 3 months. But strongly recommend it. I&#x27;ve tried other 0&lt;br /&gt;Products and I like GK the most.</li>
    <li> Love it! Leave my hair smooth, soft and manageable. Worked perfectly for me!!</li>
    <li> I have moderately wavy hair that is somewhat course.  Product is great for decreasing drying time, but dissappointed with lack of straightness and smoothness.  Will probably still use though as I don&#x27;t want to risk myself to harsher chemicals in more effective products.</li>
    <li> I got this treatment done by a stylist 3 times last year. I love it. When I moved away I couldn&#x27;t find any stylist around my new house that uses it. Since I am able to maintain my own hair I found this to be worth the buy. It was cheaper to buy the system and do it myself than to travel all the way back to my old stylist and have it done! I can get 4 treatments out of this bottle which is perfect!</li>
