      <li>The climate I live in is humid and regular mascara tends to smudge and run.</li>
      <li>This mascara lengthen my lashes like no other, adds a ton of volume to my lashes and makes me feel like I&#x27;m wearing falsies.</li>
      <li>But as far as it staying on and lasting all day I give it a 5.</li>
      <li>Out of all the waterproof mascaras on the market, this one wins hands down!!  </li>
      <li>This must be a new formula, or else this was a really old, dried out tube.</li>
