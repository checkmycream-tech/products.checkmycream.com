      <li>Great professional product.</li>
      <li>And it leaves a light coconut scent afterward that I love.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>

      <li>The product was fine</li>
      <li>My hair no longer breaks and I can see a huge difference in growth.  </li>
      <li>These products leave my hair feeling lustrous and smooth.  </li>
      <li>so it is important to have a conditioner that has a lot of moisture to help detangle and moisturize my hair and</li>
      <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell, it just smells clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>This is a great way to try the product out before buying the larger bottles.  </li>

      <li>Felt ok using but the smell of the shampoo was just too much for me.</li>
      <li>not bad but for the price</li>

      <li>Arrived vey quickly.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft or stylish after use of Kenra.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve changed to the Euphora line (available only at salons), and my hair looks 100% better.</li>
      <li>I liked this because it was a good bargain, and I have moderately long hair and still only needed about a dime size amount of shampoo for my whole head.</li>
      <li>For my aging, fine, blonde and grey hair, this product is working good.  </li>
      <li>I have natural curl in my hair, and when I use Kenra products it make a huge difference in the texture.  </li>
      <li>Always run out of conditioner first.</li>

      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine but still dry.</li>

      <li>i love this shampoo for my dry hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m native american and black and this product is great.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is the only shampoo/conditioner my family uses.</li>
    <li> Worst shampoo and conditioner ever. Made my hair feel like straw. My daughter tried it and the result was the same. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Great product... excellent price... spectacular delivery service...  It arrived earlier than I expected!</li>
    <li> Only the conditioner came</li>
    <li> These products leave my hair feeling lustrous and smooth.  I tend to have dry hair, but not anymore!  And it leaves a light coconut scent afterward that I love.</li>
    <li> Wonderful,wonderful. Everyone should at least try these!</li>
    <li> Love this product. My hair is colored so it needs moisture. I have tried many hair care products &amp; this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Have tried too many others in my search for one that does what this product does.</li>
    <li> I have never used this brand of hair shampoos/conditions.  I am really liking this though.  I love the shampoo.  I have tried many other way more expensive brands of hair care. I liked this because it was a good bargain, and I have moderately long hair and still only needed about a dime size amount of shampoo for my whole head. It lathers great. Arrived vey quickly.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever! I love that I can easily order it on amazon and have it in just a couple of days. While I am thinking about it, it&#x27;s time to order more! If you are thinking about trying this brand do it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the shine serum and, more than that, the curl defining cream. The shampoo and conditioner smell great but my hair isn&#x27;t as moisturized as I would like. I typically use Pureology Hydrate brand shampoo and conditioner and compared to that, Kenra didn&#x27;t quite make the mark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, am I the only one with dry hair who uses MORE conditioner than shampoo per use? Why don&#x27;t they make these sets more appropriately sized (i.e. the conditioner should be at least 1.5 x the volume of shampoo.) Always run out of conditioner first.</li>
    <li> Product came opened and when I opened it part of the bottle had been wasted.</li>
    <li> I purchased this set because I needed a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner combo.  Unfortunately it was WAY too moisturizing for my hair.  And that&#x27;s saying a lot for someone with frizzy super curly hair.  It just made my hair feel dirty, and washing every other day was NOT going to be an option.  No longer using the product.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is a knock-off but it made my hair disgusting. so stringy and didn&#x27;t help moisturize by any means. save your money and buy REAL shampoo and conditioner from actual salons. Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
    <li> I purchased on a recommendation from a friend who uses this product.  I really like the way it smells.  I also tried because I have a lot of skin allergies and frangrences can be too strong.  This is a great way to try the product out before buying the larger bottles.  I would buy this product again.  Only complaint is in the shipping of product.  The bottles came with packing tape wrapped around binding together.  I live in Nevada, where it&#x27;s very hot &amp; was a sticky mess removing all the tape.</li>
    <li> I love Kenra products and this set is no exception. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong perfume smell, it just smells clean and fresh. It does not weigh my hair down at all but it gets it very soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Lasts a long time. I have been using this for about a year now.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combo for years, with excellent results. But all of a sudden it seemed it be damaging my hair, leaving it dry and unmanageable. I heard that Loreal has taken over this company (and several others) and changed to a cheaper formula. I gave it two stars because it might be perfect for someone else, and the conditioner still smells like the coconut suntan oil we all remember from our days at the beach. But I&#x27;ve changed to the Euphora line (available only at salons), and my hair looks 100% better.</li>
    <li> I use both the shampoo and conditioner and love both. I buy the larger size and pour into the smaller bottles to keep in my shower, as it&#x27;s more economical.</li>
    <li> Only disappointment was that when the package arrived, the bottles had exploded inside the mailing envelope and leaked everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great seller, great product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t place the shampoo smell but I don&#x27;t like it. The conditioner on the other hand smells like tropical coconut suntan lotion. Felt ok using but the smell of the shampoo was just too much for me. I hate leaving reviews where I didn&#x27;t get to use the product but smell is very important to me and I know it is to others that are also scent sensitive.</li>
    <li> A stylist used this Kenra shampoo and conditioner pair and the products stripped my hair terribly!!! I didn&#x27;t even recognize myself. My hair felt like a dried out horse tail. It felt horrid. After using this, my stylist kept trying to brush and blow dry my hair but the brush kept getting stuck! Even the detangler she had applied to my hair hadn&#x27;t helped, which has never happened before. The next evening, I washed with my normal at home &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner and my hair went back to being glossy and healthy-feeling again. This is by far the worst conditioner I have ever used. I would prefer the worst drug store shampoo to this disastrous product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 7 years. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff works great to keep the curl from frizzing and makes your hair look shiny.</li>
    <li> BUYER BEWARE!!! This made my hair fall out!!! After a few weeks of use I started to notice my hair was coming out in clumps and noticeably thinner! I finally realized this product was the only thing that has changed, so I did some research and found numerous others with the same issue!! I threw y bottles in the trash and as of night will be starting a new brand.</li>
    <li> I received two shampoo and no conditioner. :-(</li>
    <li> I enjoy using most Kenra products because they work really well with my hair. I&#x27;m native american and black and this product is great. It doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and doesn&#x27;t add unnecessary oils that would weigh it down. I love the smell and you don&#x27;t need a lot of either when washing your hair because a little goes a long way. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner smells great doesn&#x27;t leave any residue good for naturally curly hair</li>
    <li> After one use my hair looked and felt so much better. Since it&#x27;s been so dry this winter my hair turned brittles and beyond dry, I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. I used both the shampoo and conditioner this morning and my hair looks and feels so much better. It&#x27;s softer and isn&#x27;t static either. I will be using this from now on. They also leave your hair smelling great! I highly recommend these products. It was definitely worth my money!</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo for my dry hair. they smell great and moisturize my hair well.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and keeps my hair moisturized just as well as expensive brands.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine but still dry. These products were way too heavy for my hair. Had to give away.</li>
    <li> my favorite shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> The picture showed a shampoo and conditioner. I only received the shampoo.</li>
    <li> The Kenra products on Amazon are far more affordable than my local salon. However, I find them to be just OK. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel particularly soft or stylish after use of Kenra. In fact, I purchased another product over the weekend to replace the Kenra products. If your hair works well with most any shampoo/conditioner, this may work well.</li>
    <li> Light weight, didn&#x27;t feel like it actually cleaned my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Once my salon stopped selling it, I started ordering it online.  It is also great for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.  It makes it shiny and more manageable.  GREAT product.  I was unhappy with this seller, and I won&#x27;t purchase from them again.  The bottles were only in a sealed plastic bag.  Nothing was done to tape the lids themselves (they are the type where you press one edge and the opposite edge lifts up to dispense product).  As a result, product leaked out and was all over the bottles and inside the bag.  What a waste of money.  I&#x27;ve ordered from other sellers who carefully tape and secure the lids.  I am going to track those previous orders and use that seller, not this one.</li>
    <li> Great professional product. It left my hair very soft and manageable. Definitely reccimmend this product!</li>
    <li> Not as big as I thought, but I got some so I was very happy to get my favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> For my aging, fine, blonde and grey hair, this product is working good.  My hair has taken on a shine and has more body.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I can&#x27;t see any negatives with it.  It even smells good.</li>
    <li> Kenra products are totally awesome.  Kenra products make my hair soft and silky.  I would recommend these products to everybody.</li>
    <li> GREAT for curly and frizzy hair.  My daughter loves it too and we&#x27;ve tried all different kinds of products.</li>
    <li> First order I received was not correct....the item is to be 1 shampoo and 1 creme rinse...I initially received 2 shampoos. Called amazon and I could return or place another order for the combo unit. I placed another order as I did like the product from previous use. Would have give 4 stars if it would have been pkgd properly.</li>
    <li> After using this, my hair improved in texture and sheen.  I love the smell and will definitly buy again.  I am more than satisfied.</li>
    <li> love kenya  moisturizes my dry hair like no other.  It smells good too.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy duty, but does a heavy duty job!</li>
    <li> Ive been using the shampoo and conditioner for about 5 months. My hair went from dry and course to smooth, bouncy and manageable. My hair no longer breaks and I can see a huge difference in growth.  Along with this product and my hair vitamins I am loving the new me. I highly recommend Kenra products. Love both these products.</li>
    <li> The conditioner seems old and stale, and I have used it for many, many years now, so I know the difference.</li>
    <li> I have never used kenra, however it worked really well in my hair. I am biracial of blk and filipino and I have THICK/COARSE tight and loose curls so it is important to have a conditioner that has a lot of moisture to help detangle and moisturize my hair and this works great.</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch up my hair care and I never bought it online before. Great experience. The product was fine but I switched back to my Clear hair care.</li>
    <li> Kenra products are amazing.  I have natural curl in my hair, and when I use Kenra products it make a huge difference in the texture.  Will keep buying Kenra products.</li>
    <li> Kenra is a great product! Shampoo smells like coconut and is so light and leaves your hair so clean and smelling great! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even care about shampoo and I was impressed by how my hair felt</li>
    <li> My hair stylists recently got me hooked on KENRA. Its amazing. Smells good, makes my hair look shinier and healthy. I very rarely have knots after showering and I love it</li>
    <li> I have very curly and thick hair after the first use I noticed that my hair was very manageable.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of it. Feels very professional. I also use it in my 2 year old hair. I am buying the big bottle next time.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but my hair still seems a little dry so I have to also use a leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought these based on recommendation from a hair stylist.  for the price I think I can get to like something else at a lesser price.  not bad but for the price and the amount you get in these I would look elsewhere...</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo, makes my hair feel and smell great!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was a little disappointed that when I opened the package, the shampoo and cond were bith leaking out everywhere.  But overall, it&#x27;s great!</li>
