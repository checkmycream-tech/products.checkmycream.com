      <li>I bought these for picking up tiny watch parts for my jewelry making, and they are perfect for that.  </li>
      <li>I love this tool.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purshased this</li>
      <li>I love how it helps me pick up the rhinestones.</li>
      <li>The price was even better.  </li>
      <li>but if your looking to just use for fun or your a beginner in making nail art this is good for you</li>
      <li>This rhinestone picker picks up rhinestone and more.</li>
      <li>I use this product for many tasks including my nails.  </li>
      <li>it easily sticks to the diamonds to make crafts seem more timeless.</li>
      <li>go soooo much faster!!!</li>
      <li>Works incredibly well for picking up and placing rhinestones and other nail art.</li>
      <li>These pencils last through many, many pick-ups of nail art before the need for sharpening.  </li>
      <li>but I guess it was worth it and</li>
      <li>Worth the money; worth the wait.</li>
      <li>Even latches on to flatback pearls, gotta have the right angle though.</li>
      <li>Product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I use this type of pencil.</li>
      <li>Also doesn&#x27;t work as well with any nail embellishment that doesn&#x27;t have a flat top (pearls, studs, etc).</li>
      <li>I personally think this is more for beginners or for fun if u want to do professional work</li>
      <li>I bought this not knowing if it would really work like the description stated.  </li>
      <li>and i really needed it .</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really do the job</li>
      <li>I suppose a white china marker would have been just as good, but not as narrow a pencil.</li>
      <li>Definitely these are worth re-orders.</li>
      <li>The moment I thought it was fine, I pressed down on a rhinestone and it wouldn&#x27;t pick it up.</li>
      <li>This is such a handy little tool!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well and leaves white spots on m,y rhinestones.</li>
      <li>I think the wax is old or may be</li>
      <li>Works fine at picking up very small gems and it struggles a bit more with bigger gems but if you push a little more firm for the bigger gems, it will pick them up.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended over more expensive options - which I have tried and prefer this pencil.</li>
      <li>Well it was cheap a least ...</li>

<li> It picked rhinestones up well at first but hasn&#x27;t been working as well lately.</li>
<li> Although a white eyeliner seems to works just as well, this doesnt leave little white marks I have to erase later.</li>
<li> The rhinestones are really tiny other then that.</li>
<li> The base price was nice, but the shipping made them a bit pricey.  </li>
<li> Came with extremely speedy and prompt shipping.</li>
<li> THIS PENCIL CAME SNAPPED SLIGHTLY.</li>
<li> It was a waste of money and did not do anything for me.</li>
<li> Nothing stuck and it was pointless.</li>
<li> This item is hard to find.</li>
<li> it do what it suppose to do it not as hard.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how these work, but I know they work!!!</li>
<li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <li> The pencil works fairly well, BUT rhinestones are not included as pictured, since my pencil was ordered they have changed the picture which included stones,  another reviewer spoke of the rhinestones that were included in their order.

    <li> I receive this item broken...and have not sharpened what was left yet...I don&#x27;t know if I can sharpen what is left...Maybe someone else can review this item and let people know how it works...(:</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well and leaves white spots on m,y rhinestones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how these work, but I know they work!!! I have always struggled to pick up the rhinestone. This pencil picks up the nail decorations like they are magets picking up steel. I bought 2 because I knew I would have to wait for them for quite awhile. Worth the money; worth the wait. I will buy them again soon.</li>
    <li> Works Great. I love this tool. Although a white eyeliner seems to works just as well, this doesnt leave little white marks I have to erase later.</li>

    <li> This rhinestone picker picks up rhinestone and more. I will be ordering another as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. Nothing stuck and it was pointless.</li>
    <li> I was under the impression that you got rhinestones with these. They have changed the picture since I ordered them. I saw some people who revived some rhinestones. But the pencil itself works fantastically :)</li>
    <li> These pencils last through many, many pick-ups of nail art before the need for sharpening.  They don&#x27;t leave a residue on the art after dropping it to the nail.  The price was even better.  They shipped shortly after I placed my order.  Definitely these are worth re-orders.</li>
    <li> i choose this rating because this is a really good product and i really needed it . I love how it helps me pick up the rhinestones. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I definitely did not like this item at all! It was a waste of money and did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> The pencil came broken in half, but I think I still might be able to use it..... or maybe not.....</li>
    <li> This is such a handy little tool! The best thing ever for applying rhinestones to fingernails! It makes the process way easier!</li>

    <li> I bought this not knowing if it would really work like the description stated.  I LOVE this, and it made blinging out the shirt I was working on go soooo much faster!!!</li>
    <li> Product works but it can leave white residue on the gem or stone after being applied to the nail</li>
    <li> Just got this item yesterday and I wanted to put a rhinestone on my cheek and it worked wonderful I&#x27;m glad I purshased this it took a hott minute to get to me but I guess it was worth it and the great price too</li>

    <li> This is the first time I use this type of pencil. I sharpened it and it kept breaking. The moment I thought it was fine, I pressed down on a rhinestone and it wouldn&#x27;t pick it up. Thennnnnn, it broke again. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s done what I expected it to do. Very good for the price, I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
