### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a great quality hammer!</li>
      <li>good, every thing very good.  </li>
      <li>For me, this hammer is really great.</li>
      <li>Great hammer.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, great for reflexes.</li>
      <li>I use it at work frequently great value and quality.</li>
      <li>Good job, vendor.</li>
      <li>Nothing that screws in on this thing does so effectively.</li>
      <li>As others have pointed out already, the hammer part twists off very easily</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I love this reflex hammer.</li>
      <li>But those would cost more too...</li>
      <li>The top has to be unscrewed to change head position 90 degrees.</li>
      <li>The rod doesn&#x27;t twist as easily into one of the holes for the head.</li>
      <li>The taper is much MUCH stubbier than the illustration making it more dwarf sized than effective.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best reflex hammer.</li>
      <li>Cheap.</li>
      <li>w/ a Taylor hammer (which was way too light).  </li>
      <li>It feels comfortable and is balanced well.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this item for medical/health students as a good tool for practice, especially for boards and osce&#x27;s :)</li>
      <li>It certainly does the job, but a hammer with a collapsible handle and swivelling head might be better for some people.  </li>
      <li>The hammer has good balance - can get reflexes very easily (much better than the little tomahawk reflex hammer I used to have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>Definitely more effective than the little tomahawk reflex hammer.  </li>
      <li>You could very well die!</li>
      <li>First, let&#x27;s clarify the size of the hammer.</li>
      <li>It has a good weight to it...but perhaps even too heavy.  </li>
      <li>So what I did was scrape the sharp end down along the sidewalk, and now it has a rounded tip, which is perfect for testing Babinski&#x27;s sign.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not anywhere near as sparkly, polished, and clean as the picture illustrates.</li>
      <li>There are large notches and scratches on the hammer head with the screw head of the hammer looking rather deformed.</li>
      <li>So this hammer had no trouble fitting inside my student white coat.  </li>
      <li>: The hammer is bigger than I originally anticipated.</li>
      <li>Besides the head of the hammerbeing very easy to unscrew or slip out, i havent had any trouble with it.</li>
      <li>Easily breakable, too bad considering great functionality of collapsible length and swiveling hammer end.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the point on the end for checking sensation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a medical student and this item has been useful to me.</li>
      <li>Some reviews claim that the hammer is too big and can&#x27;t fit into the white coat pocket.</li>
      <li>Fighting with the needle nearly gave me a coronary in front of a patient!</li>
      <li>The metal handle broke from the head of the hammer instantly after fiddling with it gently.</li>
      <li>The rubber appears to be something off of an old Sherman tank.</li>
      <li>I don´t like so much, but help and work enough for the function you want it to have.</li>
      <li>This product stays together (which is vital for someone who carry&#x27;s it in their pants).  </li>
      <li>The build quality is a little strange though where the top screws into the handle.</li>
      <li>This is a super large hammer that does not fit in the white coat pocket.</li>
      <li>The opposite extreme is true of the tail end with the needle.</li>
      <li>The workmanship was pretty poor and it fell out the first week.  </li>
      <li>Other reviews already mentioned that the Babinski end is too sharp, which is true.</li>

<li> I could imagine it poking a hole through my white coat pocket or into my side when i sit down.</li>
<li> again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and works as expected.</li>
<li> This item is a total waste of money.</li>
<li> The products purchased arrived timely and as expected in terms of quality and price.</li>
<li> It is also a bit long to be accomodated in your typical lab coat.  </li>
<li> The Babinski end is so sharp it will hurt your patient if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
<li> With both ends of the tool involved the threading flaw reduces this item to near useless on two major tools.</li>
<li> If I want to test sensation of sharp and dull, well, the slightly less sharp point is simply not dull.</li>
<li> Then again, this reflex hammer could be manufactured in a jail cell out of contraband and sold before it got shaken down out of the cell block.</li>
<li> The hammer is short and small with a massive weight in the head making it unwieldy to say the least.</li>
<li> My only complaint is the construction.  </li>
<li> At least for me, this hammer measures the same in length as my Taylor hammer (7.75 inches).</li>
<li> totally unhappy but way to lazy and busy to return adn order a new one.</li>
<li> There is this needle end that you can twist off if you want to test pinpoint sensation (but this thing is sharp!</li>
<li> But you have to know that its quite dangerous to do the babinski reflex with this, because the end it´s too sharp (it really is!), and take care in the moment you have it stored in your pocket or bag.</li>
<li> The end is so sharp and the metal so heavy, I can basically kill deer with it.</li>
<li> It stays together well with glue, and if I ever need to twist it off in the future, it isn&#x27;t that difficult to break the bonds off from white glue.</li>
<li> My one issue is the point at the end, which can be unscrewed to use an even pointier point, is well a little too pointy.</li>
<li> This reflex hammer has a few pros and a few cons.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hammer.  </li>
<li> I like this hammer a lot, and will toss my old Taylor hammer because that was totally useless.</li>
<li> This makes it difficult because I would like to have two things that are similar in size and composition to test sensation.</li>
<li> The metal threading is so poorly done that its a little hard to unscrew and screw the head.</li>
<li> I could elicit reflexes blind with this thing (though i couldn&#x27;t grade them if I had my eyes closed).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve purchased a similar item previously and was disappointed, because the head would not stay screwed on.  </li>
<li> I am a medical student, and I got this hammer because it was impossible for me to do bicep and tricep reflexes</li>
<li> Not sure if it was a shipping error or what, no packing slip enclosed, just the wrong hammer for what is photographed on the Amazon page.</li>
<li> The finishing and metal is shoddy!</li>
<li> It is made to look like the head actually swivels, but the hammer head has to be unscrewed (a waste of time when you are examining a patient) and the threading is terrible.  </li>
<li> It is nearly impossible to remove the needle from the handle.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> good, every thing very good.  Es lo que esperaba,tambien fue enviado en el lapso prometido.  Considero que es una buena opcioon para comprar</li>
    <li> Love it. I use it at work frequently great value and quality.</li>
    <li> The top has to be unscrewed to change head position 90 degrees. The metal threading is so poorly done that its a little hard to unscrew and screw the head. The end is so sharp and the metal so heavy, I can basically kill deer with it. I could imagine it poking a hole through my white coat pocket or into my side when i sit down. If you buy it, please do not run with it in your hands. You could very well die! Keep away from children, especially teenagers!! Bottom line: Not recommended for use on patients. Recommend as a tool for hunters going for the jugular.</li>
    <li> Pros: Cheap. The hammer has good balance - can get reflexes very easily (much better than the little tomahawk reflex hammer I used to have).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The hammer is bigger than I originally anticipated. Slightly larger than my lab pocket but fits. You cannot just swivel the rubber head to change the angle - it must be unscrewed and screwed back on. The rubber head gets loose after a few uses - but a very minor issue as it takes all of one second to tighten it back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and works as expected. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The finishing and metal is shoddy! The hammer is short and small with a massive weight in the head making it unwieldy to say the least. The teeth and screw action are arcane and there are still finishing flecks of black, I don&#x27;t know what, on this object. There are large notches and scratches on the hammer head with the screw head of the hammer looking rather deformed. It all appears as if made in some middle school shop class and thrown in a war zone. Then again, this reflex hammer could be manufactured in a jail cell out of contraband and sold before it got shaken down out of the cell block. The rubber ring surrounding the hammer head is chalky with the mold flashing still in place. The rubber appears to be something off of an old Sherman tank. It&#x27;s not anywhere near as sparkly, polished, and clean as the picture illustrates. The taper is much MUCH stubbier than the illustration making it more dwarf sized than effective. Nothing that screws in on this thing does so effectively. It&#x27;s as if the teeth are of a different grade or threading is horrifically lose and not supposed to hold the head of the hammer in one end of the handle. The opposite extreme is true of the tail end with the needle. It is nearly impossible to remove the needle from the handle.  Fighting with the needle nearly gave me a coronary in front of a patient! With both ends of the tool involved the threading flaw reduces this item to near useless on two major tools. (Anybody can Babinski with a tongue depressor, it&#x27;s just not professional)</li>
    <li> I love this reflex hammer. It feels comfortable and is balanced well. The only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the point on the end for checking sensation. I like that it&#x27;s there but I keep it in my pocket and am always poking myself!</li>
    <li> Was gifted this to replace a previous hammer, unfortunately we were misled by the photo, I got a Tromner hammer in the mail instead. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, I&#x27;ve already ordered what I need and sending it back is too much of a hassle, but just as a warning to people who may be thinking of getting this hammer, you may not get what you&#x27;re expecting. Not sure if it was a shipping error or what, no packing slip enclosed, just the wrong hammer for what is photographed on the Amazon page. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best reflex hammer. I could elicit reflexes blind with this thing (though i couldn&#x27;t grade them if I had my eyes closed).</li>
    <li> It broke before I ever had the chance to use it. The metal handle broke from the head of the hammer instantly after fiddling with it gently.</li>
    <li> This reflex hammer has a few pros and a few cons.  I like the Babinski type of hammer.  It has a good weight to it...but perhaps even too heavy.  I thought it might have the swivel head to switch the head orientation, but it is actually threaded in two spots, 90 degrees from eachother.  The removable piece in the end of the handle for pinprick sensation is also threaded.  I had to use a pliers to forcefully thread both the head and the needle portion.  So there is the lack of quality.  It is also a bit long to be accomodated in your typical lab coat.  It certainly does the job, but a hammer with a collapsible handle and swivelling head might be better for some people.  But those would cost more too...</li>
    <li> The products purchased arrived timely and as expected in terms of quality and price. Good job, vendor.</li>
    <li> This is a super large hammer that does not fit in the white coat pocket. the rubber around the hammer fell off withing a week and i had to re glued myself. totally unhappy but way to lazy and busy to return adn order a new one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a similar item previously and was disappointed, because the head would not stay screwed on.  This product stays together (which is vital for someone who carry&#x27;s it in their pants).  Quality product.</li>
    <li> for diabetic neuropathy screening</li>
    <li> Works well in illiciting a reflex response.  The build quality is a little strange though where the top screws into the handle.</li>
    <li> Great hammer. My only complaint is the construction.  The rod doesn&#x27;t twist as easily into one of the holes for the head. I managed to screw it in there, but only after many attempts which is annoying if you are testing multiple reflexes and need to change positions.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a medical student and this item has been useful to me. Besides the head of the hammerbeing very easy to unscrew or slip out, i havent had any trouble with it. I would recommend this item for medical/health students as a good tool for practice, especially for boards and osce&#x27;s :)</li>
    <li> I don´t like so much, but help and work enough for the function you want it to have. But you have to know that its quite dangerous to do the babinski reflex with this, because the end it´s too sharp (it really is!), and take care in the moment you have it stored in your pocket or bag.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality hammer! My one issue is the point at the end, which can be unscrewed to use an even pointier point, is well a little too pointy. If I want to test sensation of sharp and dull, well, the slightly less sharp point is simply not dull. This makes it difficult because I would like to have two things that are similar in size and composition to test sensation. Otherwise, great for reflexes.</li>
    <li> I am a medical student, and I got this hammer because it was impossible for me to do bicep and tricep reflexes w/ a Taylor hammer (which was way too light).  First, let&#x27;s clarify the size of the hammer. Some reviews claim that the hammer is too big and can&#x27;t fit into the white coat pocket. At least for me, this hammer measures the same in length as my Taylor hammer (7.75 inches). So this hammer had no trouble fitting inside my student white coat.  Other reviews already mentioned that the Babinski end is too sharp, which is true. So what I did was scrape the sharp end down along the sidewalk, and now it has a rounded tip, which is perfect for testing Babinski&#x27;s sign. There is this needle end that you can twist off if you want to test pinpoint sensation (but this thing is sharp! I recommend just breaking off a popsicle stick instead)  For me, this hammer is really great. It has a solid and heavy feel in the hand, and it&#x27;s much easier to do the upper extremity reflexes.  Reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5. As others have pointed out already, the hammer part twists off very easily (it will become loose just by doing basic reflexes). Since I only use the hammer in one direction anyway, I decided to use white glue to seal the two parts. It stays together well with glue, and if I ever need to twist it off in the future, it isn&#x27;t that difficult to break the bonds off from white glue. I like this hammer a lot, and will toss my old Taylor hammer because that was totally useless.</li>
    <li> Definitely more effective than the little tomahawk reflex hammer.  This model has a pin that screws in the end of the handle.  The workmanship was pretty poor and it fell out the first week.  Probably just as well.</li>
    <li> Easily breakable, too bad considering great functionality of collapsible length and swiveling hammer end.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this hammer.  It is made to look like the head actually swivels, but the hammer head has to be unscrewed (a waste of time when you are examining a patient) and the threading is terrible.  The Babinski end is so sharp it will hurt your patient if you aren&#x27;t careful.  This item is a total waste of money.</li>
