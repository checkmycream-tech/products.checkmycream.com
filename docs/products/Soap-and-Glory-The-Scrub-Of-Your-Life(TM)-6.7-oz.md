      <li>and I love it so much.</li>
      <li>Have not found another body scrub that smells pleasant and leaves my skin balanced (not too dry, and not oily like it is without a scrub).  </li>
      <li>This stuff does what it claims in the first place!</li>

      <li>Soap and Glory is such a fun brand and their products are really effective as well.</li>
      <li>Its worth every penny.</li>

      <li>Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping ..</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth all over.</li>
      <li>It is a great exfollient, but unfortunately has not solved the KP on my arms (truthfully, I wasnt really expecting it to, those things are quite persistent).</li>

      <li>A little bit goes a long way and smells good, not over powering.</li>
      <li>I also like Pulp Friction, but this one has more of a gel with the exfoliants that Pulp Friction is missing for me.</li>
      <li>I have yet to figure out which seller on Amazon has the best prices, but at least I do not have to bug friends to ship me scrub or go through other sites at enormous prices.</li>
      <li>most scrubs you may have to use alot for it to lather your whole body, but this one only takes about half a handfull to lather my body each time.</li>
      <li>and I love that because not many shower gels/exfoliates that I have used do.</li>
      <li>it truley does make my skin less rough and has an amazing sent to it.</li>

    <li> This scrub smells fantastic - crisp and clean, kind of like laundry right out of the dryer. It is a great exfollient, but unfortunately has not solved the KP on my arms (truthfully, I wasnt really expecting it to, those things are quite persistent). It feels great on my feet and elbows, however, and I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a great shower scrub.</li>
    <li> this scrub smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Had gotten from my SIL as a Christmas gift. A little bit goes a long way and smells good, not over powering.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
    <li> This stuff really smooths my skin. Smells amazing! Wish this whole line was sold in the USA. Thanks for offering the UK inventory online.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff since I lived in London, despite sometimes paying enormous amounts to get it in the US. I use it as a body exfoliant after one of the other Soap &amp; Glory body washes. I have a few favs, but I always finish with this for my feet, elbows, and a quick all-over scrub. It is awesome, and my skin loves it. I have yet to figure out which seller on Amazon has the best prices, but at least I do not have to bug friends to ship me scrub or go through other sites at enormous prices. Just keep it available, forever please!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful wonderful amazing scrub! Oh my Lord my boyfriend and I love it so much. He is crazy in love with how it smells on me!!! It has such a rich girl sexy smell and I have the matching cream that goes with it and it smells just as sexy. I would highly highly definitely definitely recommend getting this! lol. I promise you will not regret it. The smell is really long lasting and it keeps your body smelling good ad looking clean and has your bath water and bathroom smelling awesome. It is ALL THAT trust me on this girlies! I would rate it 10 stars if I could.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it claims in the first place! The smell is strong (As in it lasts for hours after showering. The smell itself isn&#x27;t overpowering.) and I love that because not many shower gels/exfoliates that I have used do. My skin feels so soft and smooth all over. I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of the red spots ( I have some weird Keratin over production on my legs and parts of my arms.) not going away completely, but less noticeable. Which is better than nothing. I also love using this before my self tanning sessions. I find it exfoliates really well for having such small &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; and helps my tan go on evenly. I used to buy this from Sephora, but they discontinued it and this is the only place I could find it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this scrub! I think it&#x27;s great for exfoliating. I also like Pulp Friction, but this one has more of a gel with the exfoliants that Pulp Friction is missing for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think they give you enough but thus stuff does work great. Leaves you smelling delightful all day as well as getting rid of dry crabbed ugly elbows.</li>
    <li> orginally I bought this in Germany-- it was green and minty and works great. This formula from the UK is less course, but has a nice grapefruit smell. It does the job, although I like the German version Scrub Your Nose In It better.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t take a shower without it. Love how my skin feels and smells after using. My 5year old granddaughter  loves it also. She asked me to get her some for her birthday, I will.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so soft. It&#x27;s probably the best scrub I have tried. I just wish there was more in the container</li>

    <li> i love this product!! the soap and gloary company is just all around amazing. this was this forst thing ive bought from them and i was very pleased. it truley does make my skin less rough and has an amazing sent to it. i do wish the scent would linger a bit longer though.but a little does go a long way when using this scrub. most scrubs you may have to use alot for it to lather your whole body, but this one only takes about half a handfull to lather my body each time.</li>
