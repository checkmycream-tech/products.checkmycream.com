<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Packaging was intact, no rips and not crushed.</li>
    <li> I was quite sad when I was told that version of this in the red bottle was discontinued, but when I smelled this I fell in love. It is the perfect combination between sweet and sultry and I get comments on it everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> I recommend that everyone make purchases with this supplier , it is very good and fulfilled with the product and delivery.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my favorite. I get compliments just about every time I wear it. I  looked for it in a couple of stores and  could not find the intense ,they carried the lighter versions.</li>
    <li> I have been using regular Very Irresistible fragrance for years, and I decided to try stronger version. I noticed I have to be careful how I use it, so I do not end up carrying this overpowering scent around me. I am working on it. I like the general fragrance.</li>
    <li> This was not the real product!, it is some sort of knock off.  The liquid was dyed a pink color and does not even smell close to the original.  I suggest do not buy this product if you are looking for the real Givenchy Very Irresistible.  I returned the product and still waiting for my refund.</li>
    <li> Cheap knock-off or really old parfume. Very dim sent and not exactly the real one.&lt;br /&gt;You have to use 4 times more so doesn&#x27;t make up for the price.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent my wife and myself enjoy very muuch. Very affordable quality. GIVENCHY Very Irresistible L&#x27;Intense Eau De Parfum Spray not toilette.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. Its my go too for all occasions</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff. Got for Christmas gift and she wears this almost daily. I also got one of the other Givenchy fragrances for her collection.</li>
    <li> Givenchy is the nicest fragrance I have ever had</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried very irresistible by Givenchy you should.  It is not a fruity smell but a sophisticated fragrance for a sophisticated woman who knows what she likes.</li>
    <li> A great creation by GIVENCY.&lt;br /&gt;I do not regret buying it.  quite exotic.  I recommend it to any chick lady wanting to re affirm who they are.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Always get compliments of this perfume. Very irresistible, must be, cause every time I wear it men and women both notice it.</li>
    <li> The scent was alright. It wasn&#x27;t as intense that I thought it would be.  I didn&#x27;t receive an order slip in the package, so I didn&#x27;t know how to return the product.</li>
    <li> I would advise against ordering directly from Amazon on this one. First, the actual product: Givenchy Very Irresistible L&#x27;Intense is a fairly linear fragrance, composed of prune, patchouli, rose, and musk. It smells of a deep plum wine when on, with fairly heavy silage and several hours of lasting power. In all, it is a wonderful product, great for casual wear in less intimate settings or nights on the town. Sadly, the bottle I ordered directly from Amazon is either old, has been stored at high temperatures, or is not genuine, as it does not last and barely has any projection at all. The fragrance I tried in the store lived up to its name - Intense -  but the bottle I got in the mail is anything but. I&#x27;m rather disappointed, as I&#x27;ve had very good luck with Amazon products in the past. I would highly recommend this fragrance to others looking for a new scent, but would caution against ordering it through Amazon; the discount is not worth the poor quality received. Find a genuine/well stored/newly bottled scent at a proper retailer instead. The extra money is worth it in this case. Caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> The fragrance I received was supposed to replace the real one I purchased at Sephora. As soon as I sprayed the perfume, I could tell this was not authentic. For almost sixty dollars, I thought I was receiving a good deal on a product, buyer beware! I compared it to my original and it is a good fake, but a fake nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Overwhelmingly sweet and fruity. Like the filling of a plum tart. Good sillage and longevity if you like that kind of fragrance, but I felt it was very linear with little development or interest.</li>
