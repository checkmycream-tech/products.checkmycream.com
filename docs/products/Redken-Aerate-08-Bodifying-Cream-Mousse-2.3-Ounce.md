      <li>You just really have to work it into your hair good.</li>

      <li>I have fine hair, this does not leave that product feel in your hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine,</li>
      <li>Yes indeed, this is a mighty fine product.  </li>
      <li>It has a light smell</li>
      <li>My hair is thinning and very fine and straight.</li>

      <li>It smells pleasant and fades quickly so not to overwhelm or contrast your favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain how this stuff works, but it&#x27;s really great!!</li>
      <li>this product actually makes my hair look good.  </li>
      <li>I have very straight, fine hair with no body.</li>
      <li>have very straight, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Many years ago, a hairddresser used it, on a new hair cut......</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite hair goop.</li>
      <li>I like the Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair, 5-ounce much better.</li>
      <li>and you will be good as it tends to dry hair for some reason.</li>
      <li>Makes my limp, lifeless hair easy to work with and a good tool to style hair.</li>
      <li>really like this for my fine medium length air.</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser used it last time I had a cut &amp; blow-dry &amp; I liked how my hair looked &amp; felt afterwards.</li>
      <li>After years of using mousses and spray gels, I finally found something that&#x27;s heavier than a mousse and lighter than a gel but still effective.  </li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>Goes anywhere too, fits right into your bag, locker, desk.  </li>
      <li>It adds just the right amount of body and control to my hairstyles.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s the point right?</li>
      <li>The trick is to find just the right amount to use.  </li>
      <li>I have fine straight  hair and thin, it does a great job on my hair.</li>
      <li>When I did get it brushed/dried, my hair didn&#x27;t have any more volume than my regular mousse.  </li>
      <li>and I must admit it was a bit intimidating at first.</li>
      <li>I recently changed my hair style to a shorter cut on top</li>
      <li>This product gives the lift needed to keep my hair off my scalp and in a wonderful casual and sassy style.</li>
      <li>I liked it except that I had to be really careful not to use too much,</li>
      <li>You only have to use about a nickle to a quarter size of the product( depending on the thickness of the hair) and make sure you work it onto your fingers and massage it on your scalp only if you are going for just lift with a smooth look.</li>
      <li>I like it, as it bring volume and hold well my fine and low density hair.</li>
      <li>This stuff practically makes it look the same as before the loss and is not sticky or gummy in my now baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have short fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>as too much tended to make my hair feel very greasy.  </li>
      <li>however I paid too much on amazon...</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it become greasy.</li>
      <li>it gave my hair so much body and volume....</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much of the product at all.</li>
      <li>thinning hair and no product seemed to make much of a difference in volume until I tried this.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really sticky and gooey.</li>
      <li>It really puts body in my hair.  </li>
      <li>This product really didn&#x27;t do that much for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Only thing I get worried is can make your hair look greasy if too much goes in.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I recently changed my hair style to a shorter cut on top and I have very thick hair.  This product gives the lift needed to keep my hair off my scalp and in a wonderful casual and sassy style.</li>
    <li> Very bad product. All it does is makes hair sticky and dirty looking.</li>
    <li> Yes indeed, this is a mighty fine product.  Especially good for those of us with baby fine hair (dont forget about the dreaded cowlicks.)  This product takes all the work out of what used to be a daily grind.  On the down side it is pricey for the amount in the jar which is very lightweight.</li>
    <li> This is a great product so do not hesitate to order unless  you have a problem with scent. There is parfum in the product and was too strong for me.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product for my medium coarse wavy hair. It is a solid form of a mouse which I like because you can spread it throughout your hair like a gel. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair get crispy, lasts a long while  and leaves your hair touchable and soft. With bouncy curly waves of silk. A good deal if you can find one. Goes anywhere too, fits right into your bag, locker, desk.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with redkin products.</li>
    <li> Wow, is this stuff good!  I have fine, thinning hair and no product seemed to make much of a difference in volume until I tried this. The trick is to find just the right amount to use.  Too little and the results will be mediocre.  Too much and your hair is a little on the dirty side (but still lots of body).  So I would recommend using too much at first and scale down until you find the perfect amount.</li>
    <li> I have fairly thin hair and wanted a product that would give me body without added weight. Instead of a spray or foam mousse I opted for the Redken Aerate 08 Bodifying Cream Mousse and I must admit it was a bit intimidating at first. I say that because I have never used a mousse in a gel type form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am more than happy with this product it does exactly what it says it will and I plan on purchasing more! Great product!</li>
    <li> I have thin dry hair.  I read the reviews and most people seem to love this product. I just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I like the Redken Body Full Instant Bodifier Volumizing Foam, for Baby Fine Hair, 5-ounce much better.</li>
    <li> This stuff will definitely improve your hair style.  No more flat hair days.  Give it a try.  With short hair the styling options are limited but this really improves your chances of achieving something different.</li>
    <li> From Redken! I mix a little of this in my hair after my mousse, and it works so very well that I haven&#x27;t been using my volume spray as much. This is a great product. Im very pleased!</li>
    <li> Redken aerate 08 is great.This is the best stuff.  It really puts body in my hair.  it was cheaper to buy online too.</li>
    <li> Have used for a few years, works well on my short, fine hair. Not too heavy, does not weigh hair down. Lasts a long time as you do not need to use too much product.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells awesome, love this as a light mousse and will purchase again. Easy and simple to use, wonderful!</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who don&#x27;t like the feel of &amp;#34;Product&amp;#34; in my hair. But, there are times I still have to use it. When I do, I use this along with a styling gel to get the hold I&#x27;m after. But, like all product, it has a tendency to feel gummy and dirty after the first day of use. Since I only wash my hair every three days, this sometimes becomes a real negative to me.</li>
    <li> I have never found a product that worked for me like Redken Cat Sculpting Mousse.  However, this product has some of the same qualities.  I liked it except that I had to be really careful not to use too much, as too much tended to make my hair feel very greasy.  I still miss the Cat Mousse and can&#x27;t figure out why it was discontinued, especially after seeing that there are still people ready to pay up to $50 for a can.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in my search to find an alternative to traditional mousse.  This &amp;#34;cream mousse&amp;#34; has the consistency of hair gel with air bubbles in it (which does nothing other than make the product take up more space in the jar), and when you put it on your hair, it immediately turns into a hard glue.  I tried to get a brush through it while blow drying, and I could feel my hair straining not to break/rip out of my head.  When I did get it brushed/dried, my hair didn&#x27;t have any more volume than my regular mousse.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> The item I got was not the one shown on the website. I was sent a similar product Made in Canada in a black container. It doesn&#x27;t have the same effect as the original.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product at all.  I have short fine, wavy hair and it just makes my hair sticky and weighs it down.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that has given me body that lasts all day long. In the past with other products my hair would be straight and flat an hour after styling.  What&#x27;s the point right? I&#x27;ve been using curlers, iron&#x27;s big brushes for volume and nothing really worked.  After years of using mousses and spray gels, I finally found something that&#x27;s heavier than a mousse and lighter than a gel but still effective.  I recommend using your fingers and applying the product directly to the roots while the hair is damp and then dry and style as usual, you will definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> Product every single day.  You only have to use a small amount, it lasts for a long time and styles my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> I have light blonde, thin hair and most products weigh my hair down and make it greasy looking. Not this product though! It&#x27;s very light but does it&#x27;s job. I just wish it smelt a little better.</li>
    <li> Maybe I need to know how to apply it on my hair! I followed instructions but after applying and drying my hair it looks opaque and fake... it doesnt look natural!</li>
    <li> After trying numerous hair products I have finally found one that works for my thick and wavy hair.  I&#x27;ve tried gels, mousse, waxes, creams, sprays, etc. but this is one that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or heavy.  It works for me and I love it!  I&#x27;ve liked many of the Redkin products that I&#x27;ve tried, but this one is the best so far.</li>
    <li> I like all the Redken prouducts for the hair and this one helps me style my hair just right.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have used numerous products that claim they will add volume - but none works for me like this product.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hair on my head, but it&#x27;s really fine hair, so it puffs out like crazy, especially in the wind. Other products weigh my hair down, which is a waste of nice hair. This product keeps my hair in place without weighing it down. Perfect.</li>
    <li> it gave my hair so much body and volume....really great stuff a little goes a long way too so don&#x27;t overuse it or your hair will feel dirty</li>
    <li> Small amount only works good.  A big blob makes your hair very dry to look and feel like horsehair.</li>
    <li> I love Redken Aerate 08 because I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t make it go flat.  It builds volume without frizz.  I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to help straighten my curly frizzy hair (when the weather is right) or hold the perfect curl. I&#x27;ve ditched all the previous products...however I paid too much on amazon...so 4 starts.</li>
    <li> This mousse is great after you freshly wash/dry your hair. I give this a 3star rating because I wish it would last longer. On me, it looks great and does its job after you wash/dry your hair, but after a little time, my hair looks like a deflated balloon... :(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune over the last several years on hair care products that I hoped would allow me to get some control over my stubbornly limp, fine hair.  From cheap to expensive, they&#x27;ve all ended up in the trash - too sticky, too dulling, too drying, too heavy, too smelly, or even no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product actually makes my hair look good.  With it, I can brush out the random waves and bends I have and they will stay out.  It gives my hair great body, lift, and hold without hairspray (I hate hairspray) and looks natural.  It even looks good after a full night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution I would note is that it can be difficult to get just the right amount on.  Although too little will still give me slight boost, too much can make my hair stiff and unmanageable.  Also, I was out in a light rain once for a very short time and my hair turned into a gooey mess, so I don&#x27;t know how well it would work in an area with high humidity.  It has a very strong smell in the jar, but fortunately that dissipates when it&#x27;s on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product it puts a lot of volume in my hair. I have fine straight  hair and thin, it does a great job on my hair. I would recommend this product to other people and which I have already done so.</li>
    <li> It was quick shippings and adds nice volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I get worried is can make your hair look greasy if too much goes in.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, a hairddresser used it, on a new hair cut......&lt;br /&gt;with ALL DAY style, the hairdo did NOT fall or go flat!&lt;br /&gt;This is a must have hair product.  Just a small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This does add body to my hair but at the cost of a soft feel.  My hair feels drier and more frizzy when I use it.  I prefer to have less volume and have my hair at least feel soft.</li>
    <li> I love the way a small amount of Aerate 08 gives my fine, limp hair volume, bounce, and style. Since using it, I have received more compliments on my hair than ever in my life!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair goop. I cut my hair a few months ago and have been looking for the right product to give me lift and hold it in place...I&#x27;ve tried three of the other Redken numbered products, two with even higher numbers, but this is the stuff. I rub some on my fingers, bend upside down, and rub it into the roots, working lightly out a bit. Then when I stand up and fling my head back, WOW! It stays all day and brushes (mostly) out before bed. It has a light smell and I really like the bubbly gel texture.</li>
    <li> I use this on my towel dried hair before styling and follow up with &amp;#34;Powder Grip&amp;#34;.  An amazing product that I hope Redkin will continue to sell.  Makes my limp, lifeless hair easy to work with and a good tool to style hair.</li>
    <li> I like it, as it bring volume and hold well my fine and low density hair. Does not damage my colored hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Gives hair volume and stays all day long.  I have used it for several years.Not always easy to find.</li>
    <li> This works great on fine hair.  It is humid here in Kore and this works great.  Worth the money. k</li>
    <li> This stuff is really sticky and gooey. Not what I expected and makes your hair feel gummy if you&#x27;re not very careful.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!!! The absolute best thing I have ever used on my hair. I have very straight, fine hair with no body. Aerate 08 is amazing.  It gives my hair body and it holds curls all day -  doesn&#x27;t weigh down during the day.  Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product.</li>
    <li> I recently had some health issues and lost some hair. What was left was very dry and thin. On top of taking vitamins that after a month are now regrowing hair (yay!!!!!) This stuff practically makes it look the same as before the loss and is not sticky or gummy in my now baby fine hair. It does not make any more come out in brush after applying and drying as others do. It smells pleasant and fades quickly so not to overwhelm or contrast your favorite fragrances. You only need a little!!! Start I have hair below bra strap, above small of back I use about the size of a quarter rub between hands really good lotion motion and bend over flip your head upside down and start in the middle and work all throughout. Blow dry upside down . Body and shine !! I got mine delivered from \\&quot;impossible discounts\\&quot; . It is authentic.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that does what it professes to do.  I got the product quickly and in good shape. I will order it again!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser introduced me to this product and am sold on it.  It does give my thin hair body &amp; volume.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, this does not leave that product feel in your hair. Easy to use and much better than mousse.&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight, fine hair. This product gives it lift and can even curl it with an iron for body where it stays all day.&lt;br /&gt;That never happens.</li>
    <li> My stylest recomanded to me and it works perfect, and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greesy after couple of days.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It adds just the right amount of body and control to my hairstyles.</li>
    <li> All these great reviews you&#x27;re reading are true.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past week, and I&#x27;ve been getting more compliments on my hair, but no one can quite put their finger on it.  The key to using this product is to use it SPARINGLY.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain how this stuff works, but it&#x27;s really great!! You don&#x27;t have to use much of the product at all. It just sort of melts into your hair as you apply it. It poufs up your hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. In fact your hair feels lighter! It&#x27;s amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and I love how this makes it thicker without weighing it down.  I like the smell too.</li>
    <li> I have used regular mousses for years. When one of my reps told me about this product, I was over-joyed! For years I would either accidently drop the cans of mousse and break the tops or the product would liquify before I could use it all up! You only have to use about a nickle to a quarter size of the product( depending on the thickness of the hair) and make sure you work it onto your fingers and massage it on your scalp only if you are going for just lift with a smooth look. It&#x27;s great for naturally curly hair too. Of course with curly hair you want to distribute the product all over evenly. You will never use another type of mousse again once you try this one.</li>
    <li> really like this for my fine medium length air. My office is by the water and this leaves volume in my hair all day long. It smells good too.</li>
    <li> It was only about a 1/4 full.  It looked used and &#x27;metled.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This product really didn&#x27;t do that much for me.To be fair, I have to say that my hair is quite thin,  and it would take a lot to please me. However, I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of body after application, which I had hoped for.</li>
    <li> This works well on thin &amp; fine hair. Don&#x27;t use too much or it become greasy. But it gives just enough body.</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning and very fine and straight. Recently I also began to color it. I use this after shampoo and it&#x27;s like a conditioner. Not sure how much volume it gives it- I usually use volumizing powder after styling and that helps more than this does to give volume. But it seems like it conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Tames the frizz.  Just make sure you apply a small amount and you will be good as it tends to dry hair for some reason.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not really what I thought it would be but I still like it. You just really have to work it into your hair good.</li>
    <li> If you blow-dry your hair &amp; it&#x27;s thin and fine, this is the product for you.  My hairdresser used it last time I had a cut &amp; blow-dry &amp; I liked how my hair looked &amp; felt afterwards.</li>
    <li> 08 Bodifying is good but I prefer the 06 Stylling Paste.  The 08 is a little heavier. Like the 06, a little goes a long way and gives you a natural look. A nice product but I&#x27;ll stay with the 06 Styling Paste.</li>
