<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Van Der Hagen Shave Soap is a deal. The bars are well made. They have a nice clean scent, not overpowering. They lather up nice with a badger brush. My wife uses a bar in the shower for her shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic container that the bar comes works as a soap dish albeit, not a pretty one.&lt;br /&gt;Each bar lasts me more than a month.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to beat this soap at this price. It&#x27;s lasts quite a while and provides a smooth lather. I use a Van Der Hagen boars brush, a slant razor, and a Crystal Platinum blade, and I&#x27;m getting great results. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This gives a good lather and a smooth shave, and when I bought it the price was right.  All other things being equal, I prefer the Williams brand, but some level, soap is soap, and I haven&#x27;t ever regretted buying Van Der Hagen (formerly Surrey).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a budget conscious type and from what I&#x27;ve read, VDH does just as good as the $20.00 per three packs of the other ones.  Will I ever try the hoity toity ones?...maybe...maybe not.  This works fine though.  I read where you can add your own fragrance by melting the soap in the microwave then add the after shave/cologne fragrance of your choice.  I have two so far...one is Bay Rum and the other is Joop.  I may do a third with Clubman...we&#x27;ll see.  Either of the two VDH shave soaps I&#x27;ve tried (glycerine and the regular) works well for me.  Hope this review helps...happy shaves.</li>
    <li> Good quality soap and a cake lasting weeks with two shavers in the house using it.  Not overly soapy nor does it leave a nasty residue.  Plenty slick for a good shave.</li>
    <li> The best to shave with.  Nothing better.  Gives you a great smooth shave.  Also, it dosen&#x27;t leave gunk on your razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Propylene Glycol -Isn&#x27;t that bad for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No - Propylene Glycol is NOT bad for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the internet and press there has been much writing about toxins in soaps, cosmetics and an array of other personal care and household items. Because of this media attention, there has been talk from a subset of individuals about ingredients such as Propylene Glycol being one of those toxic substances that everyone should fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol C3H8O2 is a Humectant that promotes the retention of moisture. This ingredient in approved by the FDA and can be found in everything from toothpaste to coating fruits and vegetables in your local grocery store. There is no evidence that this ingredient has been found to be a toxin and most often becomes confused with Ethylene Glycol which is found in Radiator Fluid and is in fact a toxin. Because Ethylene Glycol is so dangerous to humans and the environment, an Earth friendly, nontoxic coolant has been created from Propylene Glycol in recent years. Again this is not the same as the toxic Ethylene Glycol. Propylene Glycol is a clear, colorless, viscous, slightly bitter-tasting solvent, wetting agent and Humectant. It is the most common moisture-carrying vehicle used in cosmetics aside from water. It is also found in food as a confectionery, chocolate products, ice cream emulsifiers, shredded coconut, beverages, baked goods, toppings, icings, and meat products to prevent discoloring during storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA has classified Propylene Glycol as an additive that is \\&quot;generally recognized as safe\\&quot; for use in food. It is used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain medicines, cosmetics or food products. It is a solvent for food colors and flavors. Propylene Glycol is also used to create artificial smoke or fog used in fire-fighting training and in theatrical productions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry), Propylene Glycol has not been classified as a carcinogen and has not resulted in any carcinogenic effects. It is safe for consumption and breaks down in the body very quickly therefore making it difficult to detect at all within the bloodstream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this particular soap for about two years now, and although i continually experiment with others, I keep coming back. I have yet to see another \\&quot;glycerin\\&quot; shave soap at any of the nearby stores, so I can&#x27;t say how different it is from a sister-product by another company. Additionally, I can&#x27;t seem to find this one anywhere either! (Hence why I&#x27;m looking for it here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a dermatologist, but I know know there are a lot of skin types out there, and that even the smallest differences in soaps can make a normally great shave, terrible. So we&#x27;ll take a quick look at my complexion and habits. I primarily use a straight razor, or if I&#x27;m in a hurry, I&#x27;ve got a Gillette fusion. I&#x27;m white, (not a fair-skinned type though. I&#x27;m assuming that makes a difference) and I&#x27;ve got very oily skin. Very oily as in, I really can&#x27;t be comfortable without washing my face at least 3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using a straight razor, I bought the Van Der Hagen \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot;, which I don&#x27;t like at all. I would get a lot of pimples from ingrown hairs around my neck, regardless of how lightly I shaved, and regardless of the skin treatments, astringents, aftershaves, or clearasil products I used. I even bought an electric razor to see if it was a reaction to blades. Nothing changed. I picked up several varieties of shave soaps, both canned and solid, and still the problem persisted. However, the first shave with this soap changed all of that! I was able to go back to the straight razor, and I didn&#x27;t need any skin treatment or lotions afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is like mine, or you&#x27;re looking at starting shaving with a straight razor, I sincerely suggest this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish my local stores would stock this product again, but in the meantime, I will be buying it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with little expectation as I&#x27;ve had bad experiences with other shaving soaps. I figured for a few bucks I&#x27;d give it a try as I&#x27;ve read several favorable reviews of it.&lt;br /&gt;This shaving soap is leaps and bounds better than most shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used and even better than a few pricey creams too. There are better soaps and creams out there but this product is better than anything you will find in a can and is considerably cheaper too.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin and am prone to bad razor burn but this product does a fine job protecting my skin and making for a nice shave. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding shave soap, easily comparable to the high end products like, Art of Shaving, L&#x27;Occitane, Casswell Massey Crabtree &amp; Evelyn, etc</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of Shave Soap and this is the best on the market.  It creates a nice lather and is mild on sensitive skin.  I get a better shave with Van Der Hagen&#x27;s Shave Soap than with any alternative.  I highly recommend this product from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried a few brands of solid shaving soap, and maybe 5 or 6 types of canned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of those, this has the best lather.  Granted, I can get a beautiful tower of foam out of a can, but this soap lasts SO LONG.  Also, the lather is so slippery.  No razor burn unless the razor is dulling.</li>
    <li> leaving can shave cream even better decision than leaving cartridge razors</li>
    <li> Probably the best shaving soap on the market at any price.  At this price, it&#x27;s a steal.  And if you&#x27;re as old as I am, it&#x27;s probably a life time supply...</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years but I just found it hear in a bulk pack which made more sense than buying it a bar at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good clean save and no sticky film on your face, rinses clean.  best of all no girly smell afterwards.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001A3DNXC Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap, 2.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]]&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars because Amazon says 4 stars means \\&quot;I like it\\&quot;. 5 stars means \\&quot;I love it\\&quot;. While I don&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot; it, I certainly do \\&quot;like\\&quot; it. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s cheap stuff. Certainly not a premium shave soap. But it is glycerin so it just works! Glycerin helps that blade slide across your face like a well trained ice skater does across the ice. So yes, this soap does a very good job. It also smells good to my nose. A nice, crisp lightly fragranced soap. It does take a little more water to get a good lather but remember, in the world of wet shaving, water is your friend. Also lately, this version of van der Hagen shave soap has become hard to find - this glycerin version. So if you find you like or love this soap but think you don&#x27;t need 12, you may want to consider this issue of it suddenly being hard to find. As each is individually packaged and sealed, the shelf life on these is practically indefinite.</li>
    <li> Its a lot of soap... but this is even better than the soap that comes as a single with the shaving kits.</li>
    <li> This soap works great!  Provides a slick lather for an irritation free shave!  If you have sensitive skin, or are just looking for a better shave, you can&#x27;t go wrong using this soap.  I highly recommend getting the Tweezerman shaving brush as well.</li>
    <li> Searched locally for shaving mug soap but was too expensive and small in size. This is excellent soap, large bar and great price....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of the more expensive stuff out there.  Some were creams, and others were soaps.  I&#x27;ve even tried &amp;#34;croaps&amp;#34; for goodness sake!  All of them lathered well and gave me a great shave.  Some scents were okay, others were pleasant, while some were downright obnoxious!  When everything is said and done, most, if not all of them perform their job with very little difference.  The biggest difference, I&#x27;ve found, is really the scent and the price.  I know some of you dedicated wet-shavers will disagree, but that&#x27;s my humble opinion, guys.  To each his own.  Some men like a robust scent, while other prefer something more modest.  I prefer the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Van Der Hagen comes in.  It&#x27;s the most honestly priced soap out there.  Think about it...it&#x27;s a bar of freakin&#x27; soap! When you can buy a bar of Zest for $0.75, this puck of soap really doesn&#x27;t lie about how much it costs to make.  I can take my shaving brush and whip up a great lather that is just as rich and dense as a soap that costs 8 times as much.  I come out with just as close of a shave with no irritation.  Is my face dry?  Not particularly.  Would other soaps do a better job making my face moist?  Sure.  Do I want to spend $15 for a bar of soap??  Not unless I&#x27;m crazy (which I was for a while).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does it&#x27;s job and does it well.  The scent is rather pleasant.  When I say pleasant, I mean fresh, clean and not overpowering. I suppose if you&#x27;re looking for a woman, a stronger scent would be a virtue. For me,  I really don&#x27;t have a need to smell like a barbershop in a crowded meeting room on Monday morning.  I do have &amp;#34;Cool Wave&amp;#34; aftershave my wife loves, that I use for special occasions, but that&#x27;s a different review altogether</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works great for that. I like it because it provides a good smooth shave with less drag like other shave soaps do. I have tried regular shave soaps and they tend to dry out my face and that is very uncomfortable. I have used this product for more than ten years and will not change.</li>
    <li> I used this soap years ago and gave up trying to find it where I moved to.  I even had a box to show the store managers but, no luck.  Imagine my delight when I was browsing Amazon and - there it was - I didn&#x27;t buy one &#x27;cake&#x27;, I bought a whole box.  It is a really good lathering, softening shave product and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like many of the other &#x27;cakes&#x27; I&#x27;ve bought to try.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 12 pack because I thought I would probably use one every one to two months.&lt;br /&gt;Forget that....One every five to six months....I shave every day too.</li>
    <li> It works so well I bought a case of it. I will not be running out of it for a while. Blade shaving is almost as fast and my electric razor and a great deal closer.</li>
    <li> This is a simple glycerine soap. The scent is light and pleasant. The lather produced provides great glide. This soap along with most pucks, should be soaked in some hot water while you shower so it is ready post shower for shaving. This softens the top layer to make loading easier especially with softer brushes. Lather can be made trivially on the face or hand. Bowls work fine but your hand will give you a better guide to slickness. If you skimp on the water the lather can be sticky which is why I deduct one star. There is definitely a sweet spot for the water content but it is not too narrow a range. Storing it in the open or under a lid is fine. It tends to stay a bit softer with a lid on needing less time to soften before loading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also since the scent is mild, it wont interfere with stronger after/pre shave products.</li>
    <li> I had tried Van Der Hagen&#x27;s \\&quot;Deluxe Shave Soap\\&quot; before, only to find out that after around 30 minutes my face would break out into a rash. I switched to this soap and I have never had a more comfortable shave. It smells great and feels great when lathered up on the face, especially if you have sensitive skin like me. The only downside of this is that it won&#x27;t last as long as non-glycerin shave soaps. Mine lasted 1 month with 1 2 pass shave every day. Definitely recommended for those who have trouble with irritation.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I have found glycerin shaving soap. The price is right and the shave is great.</li>
    <li> A while back I got a shaving set since I liked so much and knowing that only came with one soap. I decided to get what it maybe a life time supply  of soap for me.</li>
    <li> I have bought 4 bars of this shaving soap and every time the bar get about halfway gone it falls apart, just turns into liquid.  I have used many different shaving soaps and this is only one that falls apart.  It&#x27;s a nice soap but no better than Mug or any other inexpensive soap.</li>
    <li> As I sit here on the verge of purchasing my third package of Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap, I contemplate the desirability of the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying the Van Der Hagen two years ago, I had recently made the move to the more traditional wet shaving, and had tried several different shave soaps. I really liked the Colonel Conk varieties that I tried, but they struck me as very expensive for the durability of the bar. I tried a bar of Tabac, which lasted a very long time, but was more harsh, and had a much less pleasant smell than the Colonel Conk. The third time made all the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Van Der Hagen Glycerin has many of the same pleasant qualities as the Colonel Conk, and a pleasant smell, but in a more affordable package. In fact, this package of twelve bars lasts me almost exactly one year (I purchased my last package on June 27 2011, and opened the last bar several days ago) at five shaves a week. I do notice that the package price is about a dollar higher this year than last, but all in all, I still think I&#x27;m getting a great buy at what comes out to be under two dollars a month, for one of the most important pieces in a great shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a female, with sensative skin.  I started using shave soap out of necessity at my significant other&#x27;s (all he had!) and loved it!  I always recommend it every chance I get!  It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for those unsightly underarm bumps that women can get.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every cream or gel for men and women, and this by far, exceeds all other products by a long shot.  The price is great too!  One of these usually last me 3-6 months of daily shaving (legs, too)!</li>
    <li> For guys out there like me, who are always on the lookout for the best means for the best shave, I can tell you that, in my experience, you cannot get nearly as good a shave using canned shaving gel or cream as you can using an old-fashioned badger-hair brush and good shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, shaving soap is *not* regular soap, but will seem to have the consistency of soap when first applied from the brush to the face. To begin, get a good lather going in the bowl, then work the brush on your face till the lather looks like shaving cream from a can. (The thickest lather will collect at its base; get this on your face and sort of paint it on.) Now you are ready to enjoy the best shave of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the above sounds like too much trouble, then you probably have tougher skin than I do, or don&#x27;t care if your skin looks irritated after shaving. As I see it, though, whatever method you use, shaving takes time -- maybe two minutes, maybe five -- and given that your face has to last you your whole life, you might as well take the time to treat it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the cost: a single bar of Van Der Hagen&#x27;s shave soap will last you longer than a single can of shaving cream, so on top of being a very good product, it is an economical choice as well.</li>
    <li> Good product for a fair price.</li>
    <li> Best VDH soap I&#x27;ve tried. Very good lather and super slick. Great price point. I alnernate between this, my Art of Shaving sandalwood tub and my persario menthol.</li>
    <li> I buy a box of 12 every few years, and is inexpensive compared to buying singles at the pharmacy.</li>
    <li> My skin dislikes shaving and I like a very close shave. This glycerin shave soap does an excellent job on both counts. It works up a great lather and lasts a long time. Best of all, no cans to throw in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. It used to be available from Walgreen&#x27;s but now I have to order it over the Internet. It is very gentle but makes a nice warm lather. The only negative is the plastic packaging is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I like it so much that I gave 6 to one of my best friends. He truly loves it too.</li>
    <li> Recently starting using a safety razer.  This is my first shave soap.  I have had good luck with it so far, lathers well and feels good on my face.  It has also has lasted longer than I expected.</li>
    <li> When we purchased it we weren&#x27;t aware that the first (and therefore largest quantity) ingredient is propylene glycol which is known to have negative health effects according to several websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Amazon would list the ingredients of products so that it would be easier to make an informed decision. Instead, we&#x27;ll be returning it.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve had just one shave with this particular soap.  I really like it.  Lots of lubrication to prevent razor burn.  Fragrance is there but not obnoxious.  Lathers up nicely.  Compares to the proraso shaving cream.  Much better than the Williams I was using.  I noted some concern in re: propylene glycol.  I read one review that defended its use.  So I went to the same website he did.  It is not to be confused with ethylene glycol.  Only thing I saw negative was that it could cause skin \\&quot;irritation\\&quot; with prolonged use. Of concern?  Possibly.  I am going to continue using it and see.  Doesn&#x27;t cause cancer though which is most important I believe.&lt;br /&gt;Update one year later:  I still like this soap.  Also compares with the Col. Conk which I got with the shaving mug.  Sometimes I put a little Proraso on top of the soap and lather up.  Nice!</li>
    <li> I prefer to shave with a double edge razor instead of the modern cartridge razors and, while canned creams are extremely convenient, they do not offer the same level of glide and protection a good soap offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is excellent; not good for the price, not good for beginners, good, period! It is very easy to lather, creates a thick and slippery lather, and does not dry the face. It works as good as (and often better) than some soaps and creams that cost an arm and a leg. The scent is pretty much non-existent so it won&#x27;t clash with your aftershave or cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another big plus is that you can find it locally at big box retailers, I prefer to buy it here because the package deal is quite good but you can still find it locally if you are so inclined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to consider is that it goes FAST! You will definitely see the bar go down in size  after 1 shave. While this soap is still cheaper than other imported brands it is not as cheap as it seems since it goes fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest going to Walmart or Walgreens and picking up 1 puck to see if you like it, and if you do then go ahead and buy the 12 bars here, you don&#x27;t want to get stuck with 12 bars of shaving soap if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Excellent lather and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The stores where I live don&#x27;t carry this or the selection is very limited.  Buy in large quantities to amortize the shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;This is the glycerin version and its great, same white smooth lather.  note use warm water and a good badger brush, you&#x27;ll never go back to the cold can stuff.</li>
    <li> dries out my skin. bough the pack of 12, stupid me, used 1, gave the rest to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get much better than the value this soap will give you.  It lathers better than most expensive shaving soaps I have, and it works like a charm.  Minimal effort...MAXIMUM results.  There isn&#x27;t much of a scent to the VDH Glycerin soap, but it smells decent enough.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to try one of the best shave soaps available.  It is easy on your wallet, and wonderful for your face.</li>
    <li> Makes a nice lather and gives a good shave. Smells fresh too. Better than most of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had difficulty finding mug soap in the local drug stores or markets and when found there is usually a limited selection.  I came upon the VDH glycerin soap when the shaving soap I had been using and not caring much for was out of stock.  I tried the glycerin soap and found it to far excel the old soap in that it stayed moist for enough time for me to rinse out the mug and brush and complete my shave without drying out.  The old soap dried out and had to be re-moistened several time before I could finish shaving so although it may seem like a minor consideration for a task that we have to endure daily it&#x27;s a nice break to find a product that works so effortlessly and well.  I just bought a package of 12 so am sold on the product.  Nigel B</li>
    <li> This is a reasonable price for a life time supply of soap. It provides an excellent lather with a shaving brush</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower with a rubber mug and a long handled brush for about 35 years. I have allergies and can&#x27;t use perfumed products, but with Van DER Glycerin Shave Soap I&#x27;ve had no problem. Apparently this product has not been reformulated in as many years.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Fred Meyer for a little over $2 if I remember right. It was about 1 month ago. I&#x27;ve used it the last few weeks and have got good shaves from it. I can&#x27;t tell it apart from the white version of this puck soap. It has a different smell and is orange. This glycerin soap is a bit harder to find in stores. The box says different stuff than the white version. One positive of this orange soap is that you can&#x27;t see any blood from your brush if you nick yourself. I use a Merkur or Edwin Jagger safety razor and a Van Der Hagen brush from their bowl/soap/brush shave set. This is a good soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry out on your skin like some puck soaps do. No difference between the white and orange version that I can tell. This one is glycerin. Have at it. Be sure to pick up a safety razor if you can. They are fun and make shaving a lot more easier and cheaper in the long run.</li>
    <li> I like this soap alot. I purchased this as a refill and I think I will not need more for over a year. Cant beat it. Very clean for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Shaving soap of this caliber can be incredibly expensive - fortunately thru Amazon one can save 10s of dollars with this bulk buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this 12 pack and stop shaving anything but my neck beard so it&#x27;s lasted me something like 4 years. A little bit of this goes a long way.  The only disadvantage to this is that the scent is usually gone by the time the bar is gone (the scent is very light and pleasant - masculine without being too much so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice on use - get a badger hair brush and apply as little water as possible. You want the tip of the brush to do most of the lathering and by using less water the soap lathers thick and you get a much better shave.</li>
    <li> Saved a bundle on buying in bulk.</li>
    <li> Van Der Hagen glycerin shaving soap, is the best I have used.  It gives me the lather I want and I have less shaving rash.</li>
    <li> What else can be said about this shave soap?  It doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin, has a pleasant smell, and makes my shaves smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started the old wet shaving routine, and must say shaving has never been better for me!  After seeing some tips for making the perfect hot lather for wet shaves, I purchased the Mr. Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer to keep my VDH Glycerin lather hot. Before I shower, I switch the warmer on, whip up the shave soap with some hot water, then apply with my brush to shave after showering.I can do as many passes as I want to, always with the perfect hot lather now thanks to this routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more shaving gels for me!</li>
    <li> This is a step up from the Williams soap available at most drug stores.  It produces a rich, thick lather with minimal effort, lubricates well, and has a pleasant scent.  Helps to minimize shaving irritation and ingrown hairs.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with the soap is that the lather does not last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite kind of shaving soap. We were happy to find that we can buy it in the multi bar pack so he is not hunting in the stores for it.  He has even give some away to friends and family who are now converted, too.</li>
    <li> Foams up nice, but the bar is considerably smaller than the mug that I got in the Van Der Hagen set, and smaller than the soap that came in the set.  I purchased this thinking it was the same, but no.  It foams decent, but the shave is not as smooth as some of the other soaps I have used.</li>
    <li> I have used proraso and tabac soaps but this soap is my favorite. It is very reasonably priced, last a long time, and does not leave a film on my shaver like the other soaps. You also get a very comfortable shave from using this soap.</li>
    <li> I have used this soap for two years already with no complaints. The soap fits perfectly in the bottom of a coffee cup and I find that it lasts no less than a month of daily use. It doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin or have too strong of a scent. This is a glycerin soap which is supposed to moisturize and be gentle on your skin. I believe it.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shave soap as his &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; shave soap.  I bought this 12-pack on sale at Amazon and he said it is a great price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a few years ago and I&#x27;m on my 3rd bar of this since buying it.  So far each bar has lasted me 11 months of daily shaving.  At this rate this package of 12 bars will last me 11 years.  You can&#x27;t beat 11 years of shave soap for this price.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive shave soap in the past, as well as shaving creams, and this gives as good a shave as anything I&#x27;ve used.  9 years from now if this is still available when I need more, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> This soap does exactly what it needs to do.  It helps provide for me a close, smooth shave with minimum razor burn as long as I&#x27;m careful with the number of strokes.  Subtle but pleasant scent is a plus.  It can also produce a nice, thick lather with the right amount of water.  Plus, what a great value!  A 12-pack will last for months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have commented on it leaving less film on their razors.  Honestly, this hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me since I regularly soak my razor in baby oil.  But, I certainly haven&#x27;t noticed more film, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Was using the Art of Shaving product line before started using this product but now am being more budget conscious. Not five star quality but good for the price and will continue using for now.</li>
    <li> The product description is missing a few items. Each soap arrives in a self-contained plastic container. So, your soap dish isn&#x27;t needed.This pack of 12 will last me, I think, until I die.&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers nicely in most water conditions (hard &amp; soft). And it&#x27;s easy to go back for more.&lt;br /&gt;You can leave the plastic container to breathe to dry out the soap before you close the plastic container, or you can close in a rush and deal later.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the best deal I&#x27;ve seen on glycerin shave soap.</li>
    <li> The 12 pack for $22 is one of the best deals around. I expect it to last me at least two years. One of the many perks of switching to DE shaving is deals like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap itself, it has a nice, rather neutral scent (not particularly masculine but not feminine either) and makes a rich, creamy lather.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this.</li>
    <li> I collect shaving mugs, so this twelve pack was great to be able to fill a dozen mugs at once.  Provides outstanding lather.  The scent is subtle and nice.</li>
    <li> This was my second order for the shave soap.  It doesn&#x27;t give much bubbles as do the canned ones you get in products like Barbasol, but I can see where I&#x27;m shaving much better and get a better shave with it and now my other half, Dan, loves it too!  Great price for a great product,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous mug shaving soaps for over 25 years now.  This is the second glycerin soap I&#x27;ve used and so far it&#x27;s worked well.  It lathers up on my face, lifts my whiskers and provides a smooth glide for my razor.  The price was good and with 12 boxes I&#x27;ll be set for years to come!  Not much scent (if any) which some people may prefer or not.</li>
    <li> This glycerin soap is the best I have ever used. It is quick to foam (unlike the regular white Van Der Hagen, which I find very poor in this respect). And the resulting foam with the glycerin soap is rich and stays moist while you shave (unlike Colgate soaps that dry out too quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I have some Surrey brand glycerin soap I bought about a year ago and it is the same as this; in fact, it even says Van Der Hagen as the manufacturer on the box.</li>
    <li> I used a whole case of the non-glycerin version of this soap and decided to try something a little different when that ran out. It&#x27;s not necessarily any better just different. The only complaint I really have about the glycerin soap is pretty superficial. The soap is so slick it slides all over the place and is difficult to get out of the little plastic container. Other than that, it&#x27;s way better than the grocery store shaving products most guys use.</li>
    <li> Great shave soap.  Provides a substantial lather that doesn&#x27;t break down too quickly.  Provides enough lubrication for a few passes of the razor and rinses clean away once I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part, I started the first puck in July and should still get another month out of it.  At that rate I should have 8 years of shaving soap for $24!  Beat that cans-o-gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the technique some have suggested, I don&#x27;t work up a good lather in the mug, I swirl around a dozen times or so to pick up some soap then build up the lather directly on my face.  It&#x27;s worked for me for 20+ years and probably helps the soap last so long.</li>
    <li> I love this soap, although it is almost impossible to get anymore. I used to buy the soap (non-glycerin) version from a huge retailer for $.96, but the recently stopped carrying and the brand they brought in is almost $4. Not that it is overly expensive, but jumping to a 4x price is ridiculous and I wasn&#x27;t going to pay it. Luckily Amazon has enough vendors that I can almost always find whatever I&#x27;m looking for and find a price that isn&#x27;t ridiculous. found a 12 pack of soap or glycerin soap for a great price and bought that. The 12 pack should last me up to three years. Pick either version and you&#x27;ll be happy, cut the glycerin version helps with a tough beard as it is more slippery and acts like that lubricating gel strip that comes with many razors, but only works about 3 or 4 times before it is gone.</li>
    <li> Smells clean and works up a great lather! Personally I melt 2 pucks into my favorite Col Ichabod Conk Ceramic Mug.</li>
    <li> I started using Shave Soap In March of this year (2014).  I fell in Love with using it right away.  I started using the Van Der Hagen Shave Soaps shortly there after.  First I used their &amp;#34;Deluxe&amp;#34; Shave Soap which was excellent.  Then I tried their &amp;#34;Luxury&amp;#34; Scented Shave Soap, which was just as good if not slightly better.  &amp; Now I juuuust started using their &amp;#34;Glycerin&amp;#34; Shave Soap this week.  I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE this one the BEST!!!!  The lather is by far the BEST out of the products they have.  And the moisturizing effect it has on my face is excellent!!!  And it allows me to get a GREAT shave.  I have NEVER had a razor literally glid over my face &amp; give me THE BEST shave at the same time!  One of my ex-girlfriends came over &amp; was woundering why I was using a &amp;#34;Nutrigina&amp;#34; bar for shaving.  And I explained that it was a Shave Soap puck that was made similarly to one of that particular brand.  She loves it &amp; what it did to my face.  And the smell is nice, not overpowering, &amp; very masculine.  So overall, this particular Van Der Hagen Shave Soap Puck is THE BEST out of their line of Shave soaps</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this glycerin version of Van Der Hagen in local stores and missed using it.  Great budget shave soap for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricing at time of order was on par with local stores I used to see it in -- excellent buy for those who are looking to stock up.  A 12-pack of this shave soap lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> The best. Will be ordering again. Bars are long lasting, good lather, excellent lubricity for the razor.</li>
    <li> Good quality and packaged well for storage and shipping.</li>
    <li> This soap works up a decent lather and cant be beat for the money but I have become too much of a shaving snob lately and this just wont cut it anymore.  I will not be buying more of it, unless I get laid off again.</li>
    <li> Soap is protective, lathers well and is scented but not overpowering for men who prefer to wear a scent after shaving. The bars last forever it seems. Husband shaves daily for work and one bar lasted nearly one year! Bought the largest package now and know we will b set for years to come. Great buy, Great prices.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 2 months now and have been very pleased with the results.  I do shave in the shower, which helps, but  can tell this is a better product than the shaving soap I had been buying from Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> Lathers up nice and seems to be gentle on my face. I have a sensitive complexion and it works well for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son, he said it made his face feel smooth after shaving with it.Will rate this five stars.</li>
    <li> I melt this down and put it into deodorant type twist tubes. It the best soap for face lathering and you get a great shave every time.</li>
    <li> My daily soap. Great value. The scent is extremely mild. I buy 12-packs and always have a new puck available and ready.</li>
    <li> Great price and a great all around shaving soap.</li>
    <li> This stuff is spectacular. It&#x27;s one of the only shave soaps that doesn&#x27;t irritate, or have an obnoxious scent. However, with that said, its becoming darn hard to find, throwing me into a panic to stock up.  Now I can rest assured that I probably have enough to last me 3-4 years. Hmmm...maybe I should consult my life insurance life expectancy and stock up for the long haul? &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best for classic shaving with a double edge safety razor, of modern day blades. Because of the glycerin base it is super soft and creamy, giving you a gentle shave. Great for sensitive skin too! A 12 pack usually lasts me year!</li>
