      <li>Everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to different lotions, but I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
      <li>love this lotion, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, arrived before expected.</li>
      <li>I really find this lotion to be extremely good..  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s lovely celulite was significantly smoother and my skin softer.  </li>
      <li>I tried one of Vivete&#x27;s other product - the Vibrance DeCollette product and was very happy with it-  </li>
      <li>I like the way it smells, and it glides on easily and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>IT SMOOTH YOUR SKIN AND GETS RID OF CELLULITE</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lotion is light and soaks in quickly.  </li>
      <li>moisturizing but light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them all and this lotion is special.  </li>
      <li>For the first summer in over 20 years I looked forward to putting on a bikini!</li>
      <li>that aside, this stuff is definitely worth trying out if you aren&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
      <li>AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT ...</li>
      <li>Amazon provides a much more economical price than my local dermatologist office.</li>
      <li>very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I love it, definitely has helped to tighten my skin after liposuction</li>
      <li>The fragrance is pleasant but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>Most of the other firming creams that were $10-15, such as Nivea, worked a lot quicker and better, so I&#x27;d say hold off and try the Nivea Goodbye Cellulite firming serum or the Jergen&#x27;s Skin Firming Lotion.</li>
      <li>Nice as a lotion, but didn&#x27;t really notice my skin getting any less dimpled.</li>
      <li>SO IT REALLY GOES INTO THE SKIN ...</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>As for my skin texture did absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>really helps with the smoothing process of my skin...</li>
      <li>I love all of my vivite products and this one does the job as expected.</li>
      <li>THIS LOTIONS REALLY WORKS</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 34 and actually my thighs look better than they did in my early 20s.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not creamy, it&#x27;s very thin feeling and takes a good amount working into the skin to absorb (which is fine</li>
      <li>Again the skeptic, I didn&#x27;t let myself get too excited, but started to religiously use it twice a day.  </li>
      <li>This was the only product I was using to make sure that no other product would interfere which it.</li>
      <li>only only downside to this stuff is that it feels more like a gel or serum rather than a lotion.</li>
      <li>My weight has been flip flopping for the past few years, so it&#x27;s really important for me to have a really good firming lotion.</li>
      <li>I bought it for it&#x27;s high concentration of AHAs and antioxidants.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice thick firming lotion.</li>
      <li>People new to AHA lotions may want to start with a different lotion with a lower AHA percentage first.</li>
      <li>I also first purchased from doctors office, half the price here, don&#x27;t wait, worth it.  </li>
      <li>Keeps your skin looking young.</li>
      <li>Although nothing completely gets rid of cellulite, this lotion does improve the skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.  </li>
      <li>it has never felt so soft and hydrated.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only downside is the expense, because if I use it daily I don&#x27;t even get a month&#x27;s worth of product.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t find that this has any &#x27;firming&#x27; effect, but regular use of this higher percentage AHA lotion keeps my dry skin much softer.  </li>
      <li>Comes in larger portion for all over body usage which makes it more affordable that it might seem if you calculate the cost per oz (on discount) and compare with other similar AHA lotions.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;ve found that it leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized - not exactly seeing the firming part as much yet</li>
      <li>Great product, a little expensive though</li>
      <li>but this, this I spent decent money on and it works.</li>
      <li>She game me this for free, and I was skeptical, but this is incredibly effective for smoothing skin, addressing those bumps, and keeping skin moisturized.</li>

<li> She game me this for free, and I was skeptical, but this is incredibly effective for smoothing skin, addressing those bumps, and keeping skin moisturized.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m horrible about being consistent with any kind personal care product, often I only used it once a day.  </li>
<li> so I will never have the arms and neck of a younger woman but other people have noticed a difference in my appearance.</li>
<li> Used after each shower or bath, your skin will stay plump and not be dry looking or dry!</li>
<li> Keeps skin soft, not sure I can tell about tightening, but like the feel  of it</li>
<li> Continue to order as see results in terms of I,&lt;br /&gt;Roving quality of skin particularly on very dry skin.  </li>
<li> My belly still has a long way to go, but seeing that the other areas respond so well</li>
<li> I went to see a dermatologist for a little Botox, and she noticed my bumpy upper arms...</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t care if I pitch the last few pumps of St. Ives or whatever,</li>
<li> I have been using this for over two weeks and it does seem to help firm the problem areas, the only thing I don&#x27;t like like is the scent, sort of smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue.  </li>
<li> I trust Paula and the other scientists on that site, so I decided to give it a try.</li>
<li> It made my skin look dryer than any other body cream I have used.  </li>
<li> I had to apply powder over the lotion-ed area because it area was slightly tacky even after drying.</li>
<li> After three weeks I thought I noticed a slight change.  </li>
<li> I had little fuzz fibers all stuck to me and</li>
<li> That little stomach flab that interferes with buttoning your pants...gone.</li>
<li> I use a  scrub all over my body a few times a week,and then use this lotion,i had some dry,bumpy bits on my body but this has smoothed it and my skin feels lovely,if i works for cellulite then i will give it 5 stars.</li>
<li> i just started using this a few days ago,and it makes my skin so soft,i dont know yet about its effects on cellulite but time will tell.</li>
<li> But after just  a few weeks, my crepey, ashy skin seemed smoother, plumper, healthier.</li>
<li> I use this everyday.  </li>
<li> Like another reviewer, I guess my only complaint is the stupid bottle.  </li>
<li> Seriously, if you use this and do an exfoliating scrub 4 times a week in the shower, your skin will glow too!</li>
<li> The previous reviews gave me some hope, so frustrated and desperate</li>
<li> Way to expensive for what it did to my skin.</li>
<li> Plus, my arms and that weird underarm side softness is firmer.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product always improves my skin tone and look - I try to use it on my legs and arms daily.</li>
    <li> very happy with the results and I will buy it again..</li>
    <li> This produce was giving to me to us after i had Lipo and it works very well to keep your skin firm ,so I started using it on my us on your neck and hands.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily buy this product because of the Firming in the title. I bought it for it&#x27;s high concentration of AHAs and antioxidants. It got a great review by Beautypedia--they gave it a BEST rating--which is saying a lot!! I trust Paula and the other scientists on that site, so I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s only downside is the expense, because if I use it daily I don&#x27;t even get a month&#x27;s worth of product. So I&#x27;m always checking to see when it goes on sale on Amazon. But after just  a few weeks, my crepey, ashy skin seemed smoother, plumper, healthier. My body glows! I use it on my face too. Friends at my yoga studio definitely noticed, and so did my boyfriend. For the first summer in over 20 years I looked forward to putting on a bikini! Seriously, if you use this and do an exfoliating scrub 4 times a week in the shower, your skin will glow too! My skin seems thicker, denser, younger, firmer all over---head to toe. I love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Item as described and was delivered on time.. I love the product and do see results.  I&#x27;m using it on my arms and neck.  I&#x27;m 70 so I will never have the arms and neck of a younger woman but other people have noticed a difference in my appearance.</li>
    <li> Great price and shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years morning and night.</li>
    <li> I went to see a dermatologist for a little Botox, and she noticed my bumpy upper arms... keratosis pilaris. I didn&#x27;t even know it was a thing. She game me this for free, and I was skeptical, but this is incredibly effective for smoothing skin, addressing those bumps, and keeping skin moisturized. Truly incredible product.</li>
    <li> love this lotion, not greasy.  Keeps skin soft, not sure I can tell about tightening, but like the feel  of it</li>
    <li> IVE TRIED SO MANY PRODUCTS ..THIS LOTIONS REALLY WORKS IT SMOOTH YOUR SKIN AND GETS RID OF CELLULITE ..I PUT IT ON ALSO BEFORE  I WORK OUT SO IT REALLY GOES INTO THE SKIN ...IT REALLY WORKS AND THE PRICE IS RIGHT ...</li>
    <li> Keeps your skin looking young.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an M.D. forte products with glycolic acid and it works really well a great price and lots of compliments on my skin</li>
    <li> I think this works well.  Doesn&#x27;t smell great but also doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I bought one for my mom too.</li>
    <li> I love it, definitely has helped to tighten my skin after liposuction I use daily with a waistcincher. I will buy it for life!</li>
    <li> great product for keratosis pilaris.  moisturizing but light and absorbs quickly.  will continue to purchase this product in the future.  Amazon provides a much more economical price than my local dermatologist office.</li>
    <li> I really find this lotion to be extremely good..  I am very pleased with the results from using this lotion</li>
    <li> great product for someone uses consistently.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t find that this has any &#x27;firming&#x27; effect, but regular use of this higher percentage AHA lotion keeps my dry skin much softer.  No over-whelming cover fragrance either.  Comes in larger portion for all over body usage which makes it more affordable that it might seem if you calculate the cost per oz (on discount) and compare with other similar AHA lotions.  This one has 15% AHA and a pH of 3.2 so is perfect for higher level exfoliation.  People new to AHA lotions may want to start with a different lotion with a lower AHA percentage first. Make sure to use suncreen with it.</li>
    <li> I tried one of Vivete&#x27;s other product - the Vibrance DeCollette product and was very happy with it-  So I thought why not try this one even though it was costly.  It does not do what it promised.  It made my skin look dryer than any other body cream I have used.  Got much better results with Eurcerin body cream.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic at heart, but I recently lost 60 pounds in four months and was left with some extra skin.  The previous reviews gave me some hope, so frustrated and desperate I ordered this lotion.  I&#x27;m horrible about being consistent with any kind personal care product, often I only used it once a day.  My target area was around my belly, but I was using it just about everywhere.  After three weeks I thought I noticed a slight change.  Again the skeptic, I didn&#x27;t let myself get too excited, but started to religiously use it twice a day.  On week four, I couldn&#x27;t ignore that this was helping.  My big surprise was when I turned around in the mirror and saw that my backside and it&#x27;s lovely celulite was significantly smoother and my skin softer.  I&#x27;m 34 and actually my thighs look better than they did in my early 20s.  Plus, my arms and that weird underarm side softness is firmer.  My belly still has a long way to go, but seeing that the other areas respond so well, I ordered a second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is light and soaks in quickly.  The fragrance is pleasant but not overwhelming.  Like another reviewer, I guess my only complaint is the stupid bottle.  This style drives me batty.  I don&#x27;t care if I pitch the last few pumps of St. Ives or whatever, but this, this I spent decent money on and it works.</li>
    <li> My weight has been flip flopping for the past few years, so it&#x27;s really important for me to have a really good firming lotion. I&#x27;ve tried tons of different creams, gels, serums and lotions. This is by far THE BEST I have tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 days, and the difference in my skin is INSANE. Everywhere. It totally firms. That little stomach flab that interferes with buttoning your pants...gone. Any discoloration or bumps on arms and legs from shaving or whatever...gone. I just ordered a second bottle, I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;The only only downside to this stuff is that it feels more like a gel or serum rather than a lotion. It&#x27;s not creamy, it&#x27;s very thin feeling and takes a good amount working into the skin to absorb (which is fine cuz I massage all my problem areas vigorously to help fight cellulite). I don&#x27;t mind all that, however, it does leave your skin kinda sticky or tacky to the touch for quite awhile after applying. I put a hoodie on within the hour of applying and when I took it off I had little fuzz fibers all stuck to me and wiping to get off just made the fuzz smeary. So, just take precaution.&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, this stuff is definitely worth trying out if you aren&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;Oh and also, Vivite is all made by Allergan who owns Botox, Latisse and the Lap-Band.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  Although nothing completely gets rid of cellulite, this lotion does improve the skin&#x27;s texture and appearance.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This surprisingly started off well then after a while started to clog my pores. I literally, had big acne in my inner thighs. This was the only product I was using to make sure that no other product would interfere which it. Way to expensive for what it did to my skin. As for my skin texture did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice thick firming lotion. I like the way it smells, and it glides on easily and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was worth the extra money. Most of the other firming creams that were $10-15, such as Nivea, worked a lot quicker and better, so I&#x27;d say hold off and try the Nivea Goodbye Cellulite firming serum or the Jergen&#x27;s Skin Firming Lotion. Everyone&#x27;s body reacts differently to different lotions, but I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
    <li> Product works great..really helps with the smoothing process of my skin...I&#x27;m post surgical. I had to apply powder over the lotion-ed area because it area was slightly tacky even after drying.</li>
    <li> Nice as a lotion, but didn&#x27;t really notice my skin getting any less dimpled. Used it on stomach and thighs</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion that smooths the skin.  It is a bit pricy but I like the results.  Another great product from Vivite.</li>
    <li> As always, Amazon has a great price for the Vivite products.  Have used this since it replaced MD Forte and am very pleased with the&lt;br /&gt;results.</li>
    <li> This firming lotion was recommended by a plastic surgeon and i&#x27;ve found that it leaves the skin feeling very soft and moisturized - not exactly seeing the firming part as much yet....... i think twice a day is definitely needed and continued use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them all and this lotion is special.  Used after each shower or bath, your skin will stay plump and not be dry looking or dry!</li>
    <li> i just started using this a few days ago,and it makes my skin so soft,i dont know yet about its effects on cellulite but time will tell.I use a  scrub all over my body a few times a week,and then use this lotion,i had some dry,bumpy bits on my body but this has smoothed it and my skin feels lovely,if i works for cellulite then i will give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Really does firm skin. You have to try this!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works just as said!! Will be buying another bottle. Skin is so moisturized.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the bomb!  I love all of my vivite products and this one does the job as expected.</li>
    <li> Continue to order as see results in terms of I,&lt;br /&gt;Roving quality of skin particularly on very dry skin.  Love it</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion. Very moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Great product, a little expensive though</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on Tuesday, Sept 25 and it is now Sunday. September 30th and my skin looks and feels wonderful. I can tell a BIG difference in my skin,  it has never felt so soft and hydrated.  I also first purchased from doctors office, half the price here, don&#x27;t wait, worth it.  Use it all over, you will notice the difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over two weeks and it does seem to help firm the problem areas, the only thing I don&#x27;t like like is the scent, sort of smells like Elmer&#x27;s glue.  I will keep using it though because it works :)</li>
    <li> Excellent product, arrived before expected. very fast shipping. product was as described..</li>
