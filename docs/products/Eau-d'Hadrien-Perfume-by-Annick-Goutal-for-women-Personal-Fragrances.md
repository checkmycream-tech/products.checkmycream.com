      <li>Sublte elegance at its best!!!</li>
      <li>This was perfect; as described for a fair price; arrived promptly.  </li>
      <li>It was either fly to Paris or go to Neimans, and I couldn&#x27;t afford either of those.</li>
      <li>The inital application transports you to lemon heaven,ohh soo nice!</li>
      <li>Hadrien layers brilliantly with most fragrances...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not as good a value, even though it was well priced.</li>
      <li>When I sampled this one in a store, I absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>because off all the great reviews it has and because I love lemon.</li>
      <li>Person receiving gift very pleased.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume, so there is nothing for me to dislike about it except the price!  </li>
      <li>Love their service!</li>
      <li>A perfect blend of citrus-not too intense nor too dull--reminiscent of the orange trees all over Spain.  </li>
      <li>Great fragrance, first saw it in a high-end department store catalog.  </li>
      <li>Thrilled to be able to buy in U.S. tho available on line from Annick Goutal in Paris.</li>
      <li>Always receive compliments on its lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Eau D&#x27;Hadrien EDT since the 80s, when I discovered it in France and fell in love with the aroma.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing fragrence.</li>
      <li>I purchased Eau D&#x27;hadrien at Jacqueline in San Francisco and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Daughters favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>But I still love it</li>
      <li>My favorite perfum is Bonpoint (with alcool)&lt;br</li>
      <li>But the scent is so refreshing - citrusy but not overpowering.</li>
      <li>I would not be able to recommend for anyone to purchase perfume from Beauty Encounter for this reason.</li>
      <li>so I couldn&#x27;t see paying even more for the perfume version.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance, and have been wearing it for years.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and that fact that I saved a few of my every weakening US dollars, makes me happy too!</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, and I love this scent!</li>
      <li>I decided I needed a new fragrance and this one is great.</li>
      <li>Many offices request fragrance free while working, however I have never been asked to stop wearing this fragrance for any reason.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance itself is light, lemony and refreshing without being overpowering or too strong.  </li>
      <li>I received the item in a timely manner but the bottle was not the right kind.  </li>
      <li>I have been buying this item for several years for my wife and she looks forward to the beautiful bottle</li>
      <li>Just the ultimate in light beautiful scent.  </li>
      <li>Therefore, shes been using it up much more quickly</li>
      <li>However, there&#x27;s another component to perfumes that must be taken into account to accurately assess their quality.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance is powdery and light.  </li>
      <li>It is a light, almost too light, summer fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The bottle, like all Goutal bottles is nothing special.</li>
      <li>The top notes fade quite fast...</li>
      <li>It is a blend of lemon, grapefruit and cypress -- light, airy and fresh smelling.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
      <li>It is more of a summer fragrance, but I occasionally will layer it with a stronger, more winter fragrance.</li>
      <li>Item exactly as described and OEM packaging!  </li>
      <li>The bottle we received is the right scent.  </li>
      <li>Lovely fresh, clean - perhaps floral/citrus fragrance that wears so well everyday or for special occasions.    </li>
      <li>Scent doesn&#x27;t last more then 10min</li>
      <li>The perfume was in a sealed box and exactly as described by the seller.  </li>
      <li>will definitely order more.</li>
      <li>I first had the opportunity to smell this fragrance in the Annick Goutal shop where the perfume is made in Paris, France.  </li>
      <li>My son brought back the soaps from Europe and I love them.  </li>
      <li>I got a bottle and still love it, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it has a pretty short life.  </li>
      <li>I keep buying this because I like it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the initial scent is really heavenly if you like citrus.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s uplifting citrus scent is subtle and sexy and always appropriate.</li>
      <li>It is classic, elegant and lighthearted all at the same time.</li>
      <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t detect the musky scent someone else mentioned.  </li>
      <li>If you want the real thing, I recommend that you purchase it in store.</li>
      <li>it is very versatile.     </li>
      <li>Not bad, but it is not the same scent.  </li>
      <li>Was able to purchase it here for half the price.  </li>
      <li>I will say it wasn&#x27;t quite the same, and it also seemed to fade pretty fast</li>
      <li>very old lady-ish.</li>
      <li>First smelled Eau d&#x27;Hadrien at Saks a week ago and the the perfume I received in my mailbox was the same.</li>
      <li>The only thing that discerns one Goutal fragrance from the next is a simple paper tag that hangs from an elegant ribbon in the neck of the bottle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this light, summery fragrance for a number of years, and always bought it from Nordstrom, but now, I can get it for FAR less on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love it, a little heavy for very hot weather.</li>
      <li>Since this is a known scent to us and not a new experience, we&#x27;re aware of what to expect for lasting time and the only conclusion we can come to is that what was sent us was not the full strength of the Annick Goutal product. .  </li>
      <li>I believe this to be either old or counterfeit, or both.</li>
      <li>It goes on intense, but melds into your skin shortly after.</li>
      <li>In the past she&#x27;d put on this scent and would get a good half day of time where it could be noticed.  </li>
      <li>But in about twenty minutes you&#x27;re past the top and middle notes and the drydown begins.</li>
      <li>It is exactly the same fragrance without the hassle of how to get a glass bottle back into the US without have it confiscated by Airport security.  </li>
      <li>The lemony smell lasts only minutes, and smells like watered down cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say within a half hour, and then it seems to pretty much disappear entirely, I don&#x27;t even notice any mid notes</li>
      <li>The only downside is that even at the parfum level, this fragrance has little staying power (the eau de toilette will fare less potent).  </li>
      <li>But since these fragrances are only sold behind the counter, you are most likely getting an untouched bottle.     </li>
      <li>The shop is very close to Muse de Orsee and as you walk down the street the sweetest smell envelopes you.</li>
      <li>It smelled old (too much alcohol in the scent) compared to what I have purchased in the past.</li>
      <li>This is not uncommon among citrusy type fragrances -- most do not last very long.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read that citrus in general has notoriously weak staying power, and that is certainly true here.  </li>

<li> It does not look like an expensive perfume bottle.  </li>
<li> but it is increasing difficult to find since Goutal died.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Daughters favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfum is Bonpoint (with alcool)&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatly I can&#x27;t find it in the US&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only perfum I found that is closer to the Bonpoint</li>
    <li> I like pretty much only citrusy scents, florals make me feel ill.  When I sampled this one in a store, I absolutely loved it.  I got a bottle and still love it, but I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it has a pretty short life.  The top notes fade quite fast...I&#x27;d say within a half hour, and then it seems to pretty much disappear entirely, I don&#x27;t even notice any mid notes and I certainly don&#x27;t detect the musky scent someone else mentioned.  I keep buying this because I like it better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the initial scent is really heavenly if you like citrus.  I&#x27;ve read that citrus in general has notoriously weak staying power, and that is certainly true here.  I just wish this one lasted a bit longer given the cost...I&#x27;ve gone thru a 3.7 oz bottle faster than anything else I&#x27;ve had.  I sampled the perfume in the store recently, just to see if it lasted longer or seemed any different.  I will say it wasn&#x27;t quite the same, and it also seemed to fade pretty fast so I couldn&#x27;t see paying even more for the perfume version.</li>
    <li> I buy this Gardenia Passion not Eau D&#x27;hadrien listed above for my mom.  She always gets compliments on it wherever she goes &amp; it&#x27;s the one perfume that I am not allergic too.  It&#x27;s a refreshing fragrence.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, and I love this scent! The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because of the bottle design...very old lady-ish. But the scent is so refreshing - citrusy but not overpowering. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have the EAU DE PARFUM of this fragrance. It is the perfect summer fragrance. It is a blend of lemon, grapefruit and cypress -- light, airy and fresh smelling. It goes on intense, but melds into your skin shortly after. It is more of a summer fragrance, but I occasionally will layer it with a stronger, more winter fragrance. Hadrien layers brilliantly with most fragrances... it is very versatile.     The only downside is that even at the parfum level, this fragrance has little staying power (the eau de toilette will fare less potent).  After a few hours, it vanishes. This is not uncommon among citrusy type fragrances -- most do not last very long. This is why I give this product 4 instead of 5 stars ... no staying power.     The bottle, like all Goutal bottles is nothing special. It does not look like an expensive perfume bottle.  The only thing that discerns one Goutal fragrance from the next is a simple paper tag that hangs from an elegant ribbon in the neck of the bottle. Also, Goutal fragrances do not come in shrink-wrapped boxes. This is the only fragrance house I know of that packages this way. Not a big deal, just sometime you may wonder if anyone has stolen a spritz from your bottle before you bought it. But since these fragrances are only sold behind the counter, you are most likely getting an untouched bottle.     I love this fragrance, and have been wearing it for years.  It is classic, elegant and lighthearted all at the same time.</li>
    <li> I first had the opportunity to smell this fragrance in the Annick Goutal shop where the perfume is made in Paris, France.  The shop is very close to Muse de Orsee and as you walk down the street the sweetest smell envelopes you. If however, you are not willing to fork over 150 euros for a bottle of this perfume...simply buy it here on Amazon.  It is exactly the same fragrance without the hassle of how to get a glass bottle back into the US without have it confiscated by Airport security.  It is a light, almost too light, summer fragrance.  I am very pleased with my purchase and that fact that I saved a few of my every weakening US dollars, makes me happy too!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother in law and she thinks this is the BEST perfume!!!!  She LOVES it!!!</li>
    <li> It smelled old (too much alcohol in the scent) compared to what I have purchased in the past. This scent is hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this perfume.  I bought Eau D&#x27;Hadrien because off all the great reviews it has and because I love lemon.The inital application transports you to lemon heaven,ohh soo nice! But in about twenty minutes you&#x27;re past the top and middle notes and the drydown begins.It turns into a musty musky cypresy mess that I very much dislike,with almost no hint of lemon:(  Definitely try before you buy.</li>
    <li> I believe this to be either old or counterfeit, or both. As others have stated the scent is off. I&#x27;m so annoyed, my husband bought this for me as a gift. This is stealing from people in my opinion. You cannot return it because it is a non-returnable item according to Amazon. How convenient.</li>
    <li> I regret this purchase, and because it&#x27;s flammable, I can&#x27;t return it. The product is either old or fake.  The lemony smell lasts only minutes, and smells like watered down cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Just the ultimate in light beautiful scent.  Wish it stayed on me longer though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this light, summery fragrance for a number of years, and always bought it from Nordstrom, but now, I can get it for FAR less on Amazon. Love their service!</li>
    <li> I love it, a little heavy for very hot weather. But I still love it&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely order more.</li>
    <li> Many offices request fragrance free while working, however I have never been asked to stop wearing this fragrance for any reason.  This is a delightful product, I have been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> Great gift for your mother!</li>
    <li> My number 1 fragrance for everyday.  It&#x27;s lite &amp; lemony.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Eau D&#x27;Hadrien EDT since the 80s, when I discovered it in France and fell in love with the aroma. It&#x27;s uplifting citrus scent is subtle and sexy and always appropriate. Always receive compliments on its lovely fragrance. Note that other forms -- lotions, perfume, shampoo, etc -- are not as appealing but you can&#x27;t go wrong with the EDT.</li>
    <li> I received the item in a timely manner but the bottle was not the right kind.  Very disappointed.  I have been buying this item for several years for my wife and she looks forward to the beautiful bottle but this time she was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Discovered on last trip to Paris.  Lovely fresh, clean - perhaps floral/citrus fragrance that wears so well everyday or for special occasions.    Thrilled to be able to buy in U.S. tho available on line from Annick Goutal in Paris.</li>
    <li> Have been using Annick Goutal Leau Hadrien for years but it is increasing difficult to find since Goutal died.  This was perfect; as described for a fair price; arrived promptly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this scent before for my wife and I know she loves it and it works for her skin type, etc.  The bottle we received is the right scent.  However, there&#x27;s another component to perfumes that must be taken into account to accurately assess their quality.  That component  is &amp;#34;lasting time&amp;#34;… or how long the scent lingers after application.  In the past she&#x27;d put on this scent and would get a good half day of time where it could be noticed.  The bottle of Eau D&#x27;hardrien we received from Beauty Encounter hardly lasts any time at all on her.  Therefore, shes been using it up much more quickly and it&#x27;s not as good a value, even though it was well priced. Since this is a known scent to us and not a new experience, we&#x27;re aware of what to expect for lasting time and the only conclusion we can come to is that what was sent us was not the full strength of the Annick Goutal product. .  I would not be able to recommend for anyone to purchase perfume from Beauty Encounter for this reason.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as described.  It was either fly to Paris or go to Neimans, and I couldn&#x27;t afford either of those.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, first saw it in a high-end department store catalog.  Was able to purchase it here for half the price.  The fragrance itself is light, lemony and refreshing without being overpowering or too strong.  Sublte elegance at its best!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Eau D&#x27;hadrien at Jacqueline in San Francisco and fell in love with it.  When I saw that Amazon sold it for half the price, I was a tad suspicious, but decided to give it a try.  I received the bottle today and it is definitely not the same fragrance. Not bad, but it is not the same scent.  This fragrance is powdery and light.  No citrus undertone. If you want the real thing, I recommend that you purchase it in store.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume, so there is nothing for me to dislike about it except the price!  The usual, classic container.</li>
    <li> Item exactly as described and OEM packaging!  Item received in time for Christmas gift giving. Person receiving gift very pleased.</li>
    <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last more then 10min</li>
    <li> Was apprehensive buying this perfume from Amazon (Beauty Encounters) because of the previous reviews, but was pleasantly surprised.  The perfume was in a sealed box and exactly as described by the seller.  As for the scent itself--HARMONIOUS.  A perfect blend of citrus-not too intense nor too dull--reminiscent of the orange trees all over Spain.  First smelled Eau d&#x27;Hadrien at Saks a week ago and the the perfume I received in my mailbox was the same.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over for this ftagrence.  Finally found it.  Bought 2. I&#x27;m in heaven</li>
    <li> My son brought back the soaps from Europe and I love them.  I decided I needed a new fragrance and this one is great.</li>
