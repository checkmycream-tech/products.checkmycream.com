      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this eye primer!</li>
      <li>Eyeshadow stays on all day, but i would&#x27;ve liked that it didn&#x27;t contain parabens</li>
      <li>and i can say after using it for more that a week that IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS UD PRIMER.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a saying that beauty knows no pain, but there must be a better product out there.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this and will buy it again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d rather have more of a thick/sticky primer that conceals all the discoloration on your eyes, as well.</li>
      <li>I tried wearing the primer without any shadow to make sure nothing else was causing the irritation, and the burning persisted.  </li>
      <li>, i love the packaging, the way how it goes on so smoothly(at</li>
      <li>so most eyeshadow</li>
      <li>but I love the packaging soo much better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
      <li>I also love that it&#x27;s in a squeeze tube.</li>
      <li>I love this eyeshadow primer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more when it runs out, but you get quite a bit in the bottle.</li>
      <li>more than two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Basically, it&#x27;s a good buy that does exactly what you&#x27;re purchasing it to do.  </li>
      <li>The colors pop a bit more, and it&#x27;s still easy to blend eyeshadows</li>
      <li>I use it alone on me and my clients when i am just using a daytime look, or more neutral colors and thats fine.</li>
      <li>it works good but just dont put lotion or cream on your eye lids before applying this defeats the whole purpose.</li>
      <li>The eye shadows stayed on pretty nicely for the day, although, they did seem to fade away by the end of the day.</li>
      <li>The consistency is smooth and creamy and easy to work with.</li>
      <li>so even if I put a light layer of foundation</li>
      <li>I am used to gliding on eye shadow smoothly after primer application and it looking richer. .</li>
      <li>For my money, this is a very affordable, effective primer.  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I found this first.</li>
      <li>A small amount, about 1/4 inch line is perfect for both eyes.  </li>
      <li>I love this primer so much.</li>
      <li>My eyelids are very oily and my shadow won&#x27;t stay more than two hours without any sort of primer.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#60;3 Great consistency, very effective and not sticky or heavy at all like I expected.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
      <li>I put it on in the morning with my Coastal Scents 88 Warm eyeshadow palette which I also bought at the same time and the eyeshadow looks fresh all day until I shower in the evening.  </li>
      <li>It feels kind of heavy on my eyes, but it evens out my eyelid color, makes my lids look brighter, and somewhat makes the color of my eyeshadow look a /little/ bit better.</li>
      <li>Color stays fresh and put.</li>
      <li>I really was excited for this product</li>
      <li>and I always try to close it with the product right up in the nozzle.</li>
      <li>its good costal scents primer help my eye shadow last for 4 hours then you will have to touch up your eye shadow again but thats normal</li>
      <li>On the average day, this will keep my eyeshadow set a good 12 hours.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased eye shadow primer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>First time using this primer.  </li>
      <li>I will be back for more when this tube runs out.</li>
      <li>first try</li>
      <li>I was expecting more of a matte-ish type application, that possibly covered up the veins and what not on your eye, as well.</li>
      <li>Now I make sure to regularly massage the tube just to ensure the product comes out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in the caribbean and here is very hot and humid all the time,after using this Coastal Scent Matte primer</li>
      <li>I tested on my hand and arm, with and without the product, and when I went to wipe it off it pretty much stuck.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall - highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Much cheaper than a lot of brand name eyeshadow primer and dear lord it lasts forever.</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>As a primer, this product works very well.  </li>
      <li>My eye shadow and eye liner stay on all day and I have very oily lids which has always been a problem.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t worry about bacteria much because it&#x27;s in a squeeze bottle</li>
      <li>I works really well</li>
      <li>primer doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, and as I mentioned it blends in nicely.  </li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, you need to use at least 1/4\\&quot; ribbon of product to get a good coverage on each eye.  </li>
      <li>After I wash the primer off my skin is fine, but while it&#x27;s on a constant mild burning sensation rims my eyes punctuated by stinging in my actual eye every so often.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this over UDPP and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great packaging and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>very little product goes a long way, so for me this product is a great deal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sensitive skin and some make-up drop me wrong, but this first drop me great.</li>
      <li>I also highly recommend the eyeshadow palettes offered by Coastal Scents.</li>
      <li>but I am highly allergic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a primer to give me 10 hours of eyeshadow coverage, and thus far have been largely unsuccessful.  </li>
      <li>At the very least, Coastal Scent&#x27;s primer really helps their own brand of eye shadow to really pop.  </li>
      <li>This could obviously be the eye shadows, but they&#x27;re pretty high quality.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona with temps in the triple digits, so</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found some other primers to be too dry to be at all effective.  </li>
      <li>I am not usually not allergic to anything</li>
      <li>The last time I wore eyeshadow without primer (because I was rushing and totally forgot), the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t even last for more than an hour.</li>
      <li>I especially like this product because it is more liquid-like than other products which seem thicker and paste-like and Shadow Worx dries in seconds.  </li>
      <li>product itself, when not separated, is a tan-colored heavy cream that smoothes on the eyelid easily.  </li>
      <li>This eye primer works very well, but allowing it to dry for a little bit helps it work even better.</li>
      <li>This one doesn&#x27;t last all day, maybe half a day at most.  </li>
      <li>It helps my eyeshadow last longer and certainly helps with creasing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used several products in the eye shadow base catagory.  I especially like this product because it is more liquid-like than other products which seem thicker and paste-like and Shadow Worx dries in seconds.  My eye shadow and eye liner stay on all day and I have very oily lids which has always been a problem.  I also use it on my lips before I put on my lip liner, I only have to touch up my lipstick after I eat lunch.  I have bought it for friends and for my daughter and they like it too.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the UDPP but I love the packaging soo much better.  The UDPP is soo annoying to get out of the bottle but this one is a squeeze tube and cheaper then UDPP as well!!  Will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and oily lids so most eyeshadow primers(like Too Faced,NYX HD and Mary Kay)crease after a few hours or just dont work at all.I bought this primer cause UD primer is too expensive and hard for me to get since i dont live in the states,i have to say i had my doubts,but after reading what other people thought of it,i took a change and got it and i was not dissapointed ITS A VERY GOOD EYESHADOW PRIMER and i can say after using it for more that a week that IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS UD PRIMER. I live in the caribbean and here is very hot and humid all the time,after using this Coastal Scent Matte primer my eyeshadows stay all day,dont crease and my eyeshadows looks like i just did my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the product,totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used lots of other brand name products before but nothing kept my eye makeup stay on all day as this one.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is my Grail of eyeshadow primers.  My eyelids are very oily and my shadow won&#x27;t stay more than two hours without any sort of primer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a primer to give me 10 hours of eyeshadow coverage, and thus far have been largely unsuccessful.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from the cheapy to the expensives, and nothing quite held up.  MAC&#x27;s shadestick was my previous go-to, but MAC discontinued their shadesticks and replace it with something else that simply does not work as well.  So, I went back on the hunt looking for anything to help my eyeshadow last more than two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with the not so good about this product.  The primer arrived in a &#x27;separated&#x27; state.  When I first tried to use it, a sort of clear, oily substance came out that was clearly not meant to be a primer.  This also happened after I hadn&#x27;t used it for about a week.  Now I make sure to regularly massage the tube just to ensure the product comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself, when not separated, is a tan-colored heavy cream that smoothes on the eyelid easily.  I usually wait a few minutes to give it time to meld to my skin before applying eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staying power:  On the average day, this will keep my eyeshadow set a good 12 hours.  The only caveat is that if my allergies are acting up, I tend to rub my eyes and they water a lot - so it doesn&#x27;t last as long.  If the primer prevented the eyeshadow to come off when wet and being rubbed, that would be a bad thing anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, and as I mentioned it blends in nicely.  The colors pop a bit more, and it&#x27;s still easy to blend eyeshadows in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very little product goes a long way, so for me this product is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - highly recommended!</li>
    <li> So I recently ordered this.  Let me just say that I have never used a eyeshadow primer.  I have oily eyelids so the eyeshadow I&#x27;d use would never stay on for very long.  I would do my eyes in the morning before work and by the time it was time to go home, my eyeshadow was practically gone or runny and creasing.  So I decided to give this a try.  Let me tell u this actually works!!  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days now.  I put it on in the morning with my Coastal Scents 88 Warm eyeshadow palette which I also bought at the same time and the eyeshadow looks fresh all day until I shower in the evening.  Thats a long time!!  I will def continue to use this and it has a great price.  I will be back for more when this tube runs out.</li>
    <li> its good costal scents primer help my eye shadow last for 4 hours then you will have to touch up your eye shadow again but thats normal but i&#x27;m going try urban decay ORIGINAL/SIN EYESHADOW PRIMER POTION next just give it a try when i used it on my mother her eye shadow lasted her 8 hours for her so it work differently on different skin types this was my 1st primer i ever used but i&#x27;m going to give it to my mother once i try another brand i will let yall know which one is the best</li>
    <li> Happy I tried this.  No creasing.  Color stays fresh and put. Great product for your money.  Will purchase again when needed.  Fortunately, this seems to last a while since you need very little each application. All very good.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  It last all day and works like a charm.  My skin is extremely oily and eye shadow normally does not last throughout the day and it&#x27;s fades or only shows in the crease of the eye.  Not anymore.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past week and its well worth the $$$$.</li>
    <li> good! makeup lasts all day! I make-up at 6am and get home at 10 pm is still fresh and in perfect condition. I am sensitive skin and some make-up drop me wrong, but this first drop me great. brings much product as used in small quantities lasts a very long time</li>
    <li> For my money, this is a very affordable, effective primer.  I understand that not everyone likes primers that are slightly oily (which this one unquestionably is) but I&#x27;ve found some other primers to be too dry to be at all effective.  At the very least, Coastal Scent&#x27;s primer really helps their own brand of eye shadow to really pop.  Basically, it&#x27;s a good buy that does exactly what you&#x27;re purchasing it to do.  Grade: B</li>
    <li> Great packaging and a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m glad I bought this over UDPP and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see myself using this small tube for at least a year -well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have used eye primer before that worked great, but I have not been able to find it.  I saw this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I live in Arizona with temps in the triple digits, so going outside does not help the eyshadow staying put.    That being said, I used the tiniest amount, and I saw no difference.  Now, I use maybe a line that is about a quarter of an inch and everything stays put perfectly.  My other product literally took a dot on each eye and worked.  It could be that I am trying this product in the worst month.  I am happy with it.  A small amount, about 1/4 inch line is perfect for both eyes.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased eye shadow primer, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I tested on my hand and arm, with and without the product, and when I went to wipe it off it pretty much stuck. Even when I used a baby wipe it took a few passes to get it all off. Considering the spots I put shadow on without primer vanished with hardly any effort, I say this stuff is well worth the money. I&#x27;ll probably buy more when it runs out, but you get quite a bit in the bottle. I also love that it&#x27;s in a squeeze tube. &amp;#60;3 Great consistency, very effective and not sticky or heavy at all like I expected. I posted pictures in the customer gallery!&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Here I am about 5.5 years after posting this review, and I am STILL using the same bottle that I bought so long ago. I don&#x27;t worry about bacteria much because it&#x27;s in a squeeze bottle and I always try to close it with the product right up in the nozzle. I cannot recommend this product enough. Much cheaper than a lot of brand name eyeshadow primer and dear lord it lasts forever. I also highly recommend the eyeshadow palettes offered by Coastal Scents. We&#x27;re talking damn near MAC quality at bargain prices and, again, I&#x27;ve had my 88 color shimmer palette for longer than I care to admit. I am not paid by this company nor have I been approached in any way to leave reviews, I am just so enamored by the price and quality of their products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this baby for over a year and I&#x27;m only 1/2 way through. I have oily lids and this helps keep them matte even with eyeshadow. As a primer, it works absolutely perfect. My eyeshadow lasts all day without smudging, fading or creasing. The last time I wore eyeshadow without primer (because I was rushing and totally forgot), the eyeshadow didn&#x27;t even last for more than an hour. I don&#x27;t know how I survived without primer before. The consistency is smooth and creamy and easy to work with. I love this product. It&#x27;s my holy grail eye primer.</li>

    <li> I love this eye primer! It is the best one I have compared to MAC and NYX. My eyeshadow lasts all day. I will purchase another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I really was excited for this product but I am highly allergic. It took me two days to realized this but by day 2 my eyelids were red, puffy and my eyes watered so bad. I am not usually not allergic to anything but I am this. :(</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have no complaints, i love the packaging, the way how it goes on so smoothly(at first try i thought it was too slippery, but by the time you apply to the other eye it dries!)It last allll day and a very little goes a lonnng way!! I think ppl confuse this as a base for eyeshadow, but it&#x27;s just a primer to keep your product on longer. I use it alone on me and my clients when i am just using a daytime look, or more neutral colors and thats fine. When i want a more pop of colour, i use a white base over it. Its almost a year and i still have the same tube and its only half way. Just ordered another. LOVESSSS IT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> If you notice that in the middle of the day you need to touch-up your eye shadow, try this primer.  It keeps your eye shadow on all day.</li>
    <li> I had bought some primer from a shopping network.  It was gummy and sparkly.  I LOVE this and will buy it again.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> I love this primer so much. I bought it based on reviews and price, not knowing exactly what I wanted but knowing that I was tired of finding all of my eyeliner (even the Revlon Colorstay) gone or smudged everywhere by day&#x27;s end. I wear contacts and I rub my eyes a lot, and this primer has made such a difference. I also had a horrible day recently where I fought with a loved one over IM and cried for hours (yes, so very teenage) . . . and the eyeliner stayed put. Now that&#x27;s an endorsement!</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m not a huge primer expert, so I&#x27;ll just state what I&#x27;ve observed. The primer seems like an oil-based product. I was expecting more of a matte-ish type application, that possibly covered up the veins and what not on your eye, as well. However, it rubbed on the eyelid as if you were applying lotion. So, I used a concealer and this primer, to get a total blank canvas. The eye shadows stayed on pretty nicely for the day, although, they did seem to fade away by the end of the day. This could obviously be the eye shadows, but they&#x27;re pretty high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d probably purchase something else in the future to have something to compare this product too. I&#x27;d rather have more of a thick/sticky primer that conceals all the discoloration on your eyes, as well.</li>
    <li> As a primer, this product works very well.  My shadow lasted without creasing and with only slight fading after a full day of wear.  However, it burns my eyes and eyelids, which are not particularly sensitive to irritants.  After I wash the primer off my skin is fine, but while it&#x27;s on a constant mild burning sensation rims my eyes punctuated by stinging in my actual eye every so often.  I tried wearing the primer without any shadow to make sure nothing else was causing the irritation, and the burning persisted.  There&#x27;s a saying that beauty knows no pain, but there must be a better product out there.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Makeup Artist and have oily lids this product keeps my eyeshadow in place for hours, no creasing or smudging . I use it on all my gigs, especially when I&#x27;m doing dramatic smokey eyes!</li>
    <li> It its not what I though it would be. Its greasy and the eye-shadows does not stay all night. I did not work for me.</li>
    <li> I love this primer! Usually when I apply eye shadow, it stays on my lids for about 20 minutes and leaves no evidence that it was ever there in the first place. When I use this primer, the shadow lasts for hours, usually through my entire 8-hour work day (previously unheard of). Definitely recommended for anyone with oily eye lids.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin so even if I put a light layer of foundation my eyelids will crease. I hated it I had tried the UD priming potion and was going to buy but I&#x27;m glad I found this first. I works really well I cant imagine doing my makeup without it!</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeshadow primer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s silky and a little goes a long way.  It helps my eyeshadow last longer and certainly helps with creasing.  It&#x27;s my new favorite.  My only piece of advice is to shake it up if you leave it for a while between uses.</li>
    <li> This eye primer works very well, but allowing it to dry for a little bit helps it work even better.</li>
    <li> I have always had these annoying oily eye lids and always have problems with messy eye shadows. I was trying to find a good eye primer that is not too expensive but works well on my skin type. I used this eye primer today before  putting on make up . It has been 8 hours and I still have gorgeous and  beautiful eyes. Totally pleased !!</li>
    <li> First time using this primer.  It&#x27;s just ok.  Not 5 stars,  It dries weird causing the eyeshadow on top to look weird after applied.  Not drastically noticeable but I notice it.  I am used to gliding on eye shadow smoothly after primer application and it looking richer. .</li>
    <li> I have used Urban Decay and Too Faced eyeshadow base before trying this brand.  This one doesn&#x27;t last all day, maybe half a day at most.  By the end of the day my eyeshadow is a smeared mess using this product.  I&#x27;m going back to one of the others.</li>
    <li> I only gave this primer four stars because I have never used an eye primer before and have nothing to compare.  I purchased this because of the price as I didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive brand if I didn&#x27;t like it.  This works for me.  As another reviewer mentioned, you need to use at least 1/4\\&quot; ribbon of product to get a good coverage on each eye.  I use this six-seven days a week and still have about a fourth of the tube left.  I hope Amazon gets this back into stock before I run out.</li>
    <li> it works good but just dont put lotion or cream on your eye lids before applying this defeats the whole purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow primer.  I&#x27;ve always had problems making my make up last and with this primer my eyeshadow lasts all day without dulling or creasing.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> But it&#x27;s not great either. It&#x27;s okay. It feels kind of heavy on my eyes, but it evens out my eyelid color, makes my lids look brighter, and somewhat makes the color of my eyeshadow look a /little/ bit better. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It does what its supposed to.  My eye makeup stayed put all day long - even after a workout!  It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
