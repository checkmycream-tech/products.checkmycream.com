### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product !</li>

      <li>But ever since I have been using this product, my pores are surprisingly tighter and cleaner...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good and it does what it says it does</li>
      <li>A good alternative to a scrubbin cleaner.</li>
      <li>but they still work just as good.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t listen to other reviews, the best of the best, lowest price ever on the internet, and great price with quality</li>
      <li>While the Clarisonic is probably more thorough, the Wave is a great alternatve if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I use the wave every night and my face looks and feels so much better!</li>
      <li>Plus, you can use your own soaps and cleansers with these sponges.</li>
      <li>(it&#x27;s like $2 for 100) and use my own soap.</li>
      <li>First time: I was really impressed how smooth and clean my face felt and</li>
      <li>Works well soin looks feels better.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE for skin brightening, tone, smoothness and clarity.</li>
      <li>It is more versatile and doesn&#x27;t involve the additional cost of the cleansing pads</li>
      <li>So I use the Wave in the evening followed by a moisturizer, much better</li>
      <li>took the plunge its OK</li>
      <li>After reading Wave reviews on Amazon going from 2008 until 2/2011, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
      <li>This is my FAVORITE for skin brightening, tone, smoothness and clarity.</li>
      <li>I purchased this wonderful little device and love it!</li>
      <li>I love my wave, it is so easy to use, and I love that I can use it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>My skin seems more elastic and is audibly squeaky clean.</li>
      <li>:) I think my ten bucks delivered a good return.</li>
      <li>It soaps up well, gives skin a clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>:) I really like this</li>
      <li>On the days I don&#x27;t use the Wave, I use a mild non-abrasive cleanser.</li>
      <li>Finding reasonably priced refill pads is \\&quot;interesting\\&quot;, even AMAZON \\&quot;eligible for FREE super saver shipping\\&quot; ones sold out quickly...</li>
      <li>, it deep cleans, my skin looks wonderful, massaging vibrations relaxing as long as it just glides over chin and cheek bones and doesn&#x27;t rest there to give you the shakes.</li>
      <li>She tried the spinning one, and doesn&#x27;t enjoy it nearly as much.</li>
      <li>worth it,&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does add a level of novelty and is fun to use.</li>
      <li>Wave Shine-free Blemish-free &#x3D; light orange with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)     Clean and Clear</li>
      <li>It really helps smooth out my skin and make it a lot less red which makes me happy!</li>
      <li>A few quick rounds around the face and your good.</li>
      <li>The Wave is small and compact and is great to take along when you travel.</li>
      <li>if thing would last more then a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Review from first Neutrogena Wave purchased...</li>
      <li>Shine-free Blemish-free &#x3D; light orange with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser &#x3D; lilac pads with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)...</li>
      <li>Also a good product to use to exfoliate your skin when you want to self tan or just before you shave to exfoliate the dead skin.</li>
      <li>I dont personally feel like it works any better than normal face wash.</li>
      <li>won&#x27;t go to waste and you&#x27;ll still be able to use the product!</li>
      <li>it comes to my face, I&#x27;m leery about entrusting it to someone making a fast buck.</li>
      <li>Getting used to the ergonomic fit in the palm of the hand took a bit compared to the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal vibrating thing I&#x27;ve been using...</li>
      <li>and I really like how it comes with 14 pads and a battery</li>
      <li>so you are ready to go when you take it out of the box.</li>
      <li>really waterproof,&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>When it comes to my face, I&#x27;m leery about entrusting it to someone making a fast buck.</li>
      <li>I bought this to see if it would help clear up my skin after working in a hot humid environment.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy cleansing my face on shower, it gives my complex skin a lovely soft touch...</li>
      <li>My face does dry easily, so I use a mild facial lotion after each application.</li>
      <li>research calling BOTH Neutrogena AND Clean and Clear found:&lt;br /&gt;Pads - Wave Deep Clean &#x3D; white w/cleanser that DO NOT foam</li>
      <li>/&gt;Purchased this as a backup to the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser And the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal devices which have been discontinued by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</li>
      <li>This totally worked for me and has been well worth $10.</li>
      <li>Biore strips or anything else I did could never really get my pores clean.</li>
      <li>It is very waterproof, and has different pads that you can use with it, it is very versatile.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I could definitely feel the ultra softness of my face</li>
      <li>Deep Clean Foaming &#x3D; blue w/foaming cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Wave</li>
      <li>I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
      <li>the only reason i&#x27;ve given it 4 stars is because although i love the device itself I noticed my skin felt tight after so i researched it and found the cleansing soap it uses has menthol which irritates the skin.</li>
      <li>Considering the price I paid back then (about $13 dollars), I think this does a pretty decent job when it comes to topical cleansing.</li>
      <li>I must admit i do have some allergies and my skin is somewhat sensitive.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin SO SOFT.</li>
      <li>Gentle Exfoliating &#x3D; white w/orange microbeads</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s early death, so I</li>
      <li>Not harsh or drying.</li>
      <li>however, my face felt softer right away and after a few days of using the Wave, my face had cleared up and was so much smoother/softer.  </li>
      <li>It has totally helped with my main problem area--my nose.</li>
      <li>Still makes my skin super soft and now it doesn&#x27;t feel tight!</li>
      <li>I already felt that I won&#x27;t be able to use this everyday, because I could feel that it was drying my skin out a little...</li>
      <li>Although it says \\&quot;gentle enough for daily use\\&quot; after 3 days, twice a day my face was very dry and had chemical peel</li>
      <li>I always had little break outs and when I first used this the next day I had a lot of break outs.  </li>
      <li>Have to watch how long you use, especially those with sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It soaps up well, gives skin a clean feeling.  Not harsh or drying. A good alternative to a scrubbin cleaner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wonderful little device and love it! I really enjoy cleansing my face on shower, it gives my complex skin a lovely soft touch...I guess it is gentle on oily skin for daily use, but for complex skin type I would recommend it to be used on weekly basis.</li>
    <li> I always had little break outs and when I first used this the next day I had a lot of break outs.  however, my face felt softer right away and after a few days of using the Wave, my face had cleared up and was so much smoother/softer.  I use the wave every night and my face looks and feels so much better!</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for about a year. Considering the price I paid back then (about $13 dollars), I think this does a pretty decent job when it comes to topical cleansing. I use it once or twice a day on my face and neck. The texture of my skin has improved. I cleans gently and removes dirt and make-up, as well as removing dead skin cells. The difference between a soap and water cleansing and the Wave used in combination with the cleansing pads is fairly dramatic. My skin seems more elastic and is audibly squeaky clean. Skin creams absorb quicker. My completion seems brighter. The Wave requires batteries, but they have only had to be replaced 3 times over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin but have not had any negative reaction to the cleaning pads.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a Clarisonic cleanser for almost ten times what this cost. The Clarisonic does an excellent job, doesn&#x27;t require batteries, and can be used in water. It is more versatile and doesn&#x27;t involve the additional cost of the cleansing pads but it does require the replacement of its brush pads every 3-4 months. The price between the pads and the brush head is a virtual wash. While the Clarisonic is probably more thorough, the Wave is a great alternatve if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. The Wave is small and compact and is great to take along when you travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this for less than I would have gotten it at the store by at least $5. The first time I used it I could definitely feel the ultra softness of my face and I really like how it comes with 14 pads and a battery so you are ready to go when you take it out of the box. I would recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Would not recommend the buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target about a month ago.  It comes with cleansing pads.  I found the pads were a little irritating to my skin, so, I had some facial buff sponges from Studio Tools that I bought at Target (priced under $2.00 for 12 count)and they stick to the disk also and work great.  Plus, you can use your own soaps and cleansers with these sponges. So, if you have this product and can&#x27;t find the cleansing pads, just use the ones that I buy at Target that way you&#x27;re money won&#x27;t go to waste and you&#x27;ll still be able to use the product! Also a good product to use to exfoliate your skin when you want to self tan or just before you shave to exfoliate the dead skin.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3K7535WY09140]]DISCLAIMER: I like Amazon not just for buying products but for the reviews. Before I make a purchase I like to look at what people think, not just go head and make a purchase. I look at several sites, but I like Amazon the most because I feel people are little more educated in their reviews, and if other people do the same things as I do, then this hopefully will help.</li>
    <li> I saw this thing at Target and decided to try it out for 10 bucks.  I use Sonicare for my teeth and have seen how well that works, so I figured why not for your face. First time: I was really impressed how smooth and clean my face felt and the glow I saw. I already felt that I won&#x27;t be able to use this everyday, because I could feel that it was drying my skin out a little...That wasn&#x27;t a problem. I use this product every other day while in the shower. On the days I don&#x27;t use the Wave, I use a mild non-abrasive cleanser. It has totally helped with my main problem area--my nose. Biore strips or anything else I did could never really get my pores clean. But ever since I have been using this product, my pores are surprisingly tighter and cleaner...no more disgusting clogged pores &#x3D; more confidence. My face does dry easily, so I use a mild facial lotion after each application. This totally worked for me and has been well worth $10. I recommend this product, but you need to find what frequency of use works for you.</li>
    <li> So usually i dont get really bad break outs i bought this product to keep my skin clear like it usually is. I must admit i do have some allergies and my skin is somewhat sensitive. This product made my face breakout horribly! It only took a few days and booom my face was a mess! I didn&#x27;t even bother to try to get my money back i just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This face washing device simply vibrates on your face. I dont personally feel like it works any better than normal face wash. It does add a level of novelty and is fun to use.</li>
    <li> My skin is bumpy and red, which is caused by a disorder I was born with. It really helps smooth out my skin and make it a lot less red which makes me happy! :) I really like this</li>
    <li> I bought this from Walmart and I have been using it for a while. I absolutely love it. It makes my skin SO SOFT. the only reason i&#x27;ve given it 4 stars is because although i love the device itself I noticed my skin felt tight after so i researched it and found the cleansing soap it uses has menthol which irritates the skin. I was so upset and I looked everywhere for a different pad that would work with this device and not irritate my skin. I now just use regular cotton rounds you can buy from any store (it&#x27;s like $2 for 100) and use my own soap. the cotton rounds are a little big for the device but they still work just as good. Still makes my skin super soft and now it doesn&#x27;t feel tight! I love it!</li>
    <li> this thing bruised my face and had it dry, cracked and tight. I threw it in the garbage. YUCK!! Worst product I&#x27;ve ever used from neutrogena. Had to moisturize like crazy for two weeks to get my face the way it was before using the wave. I guess the cleanser they used on the pad did not agree with my skin.</li>
    <li> My face enjoyed this product!!! I&#x27;ve always used Neutrogena to help me fight acne, this helped too. great facewash!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good and it does what it says it does but I don&#x27;t use it in the shower. It&#x27;s already difficult to find refill pads regularly at a decent price and some have been discontinued already. Getting used to the ergonomic fit in the palm of the hand took a bit compared to the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal vibrating thing I&#x27;ve been using...is discontinued and it&#x27;s refill pads also so the pricing when found is totally outrageous AND not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Review from first Neutrogena Wave purchased...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this as a backup to the Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser And the Neutrogena Total Skin Renewal devices which have been discontinued by Johnson &amp; Johnson. After reading Wave reviews on Amazon going from 2008 until 2/2011, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect:&lt;br /&gt;1. the pads foaming or not,&lt;br /&gt;2. skin reaction,&lt;br /&gt;3. really waterproof,&lt;br /&gt;4. worth it,&lt;br /&gt;5. if thing would last more then a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the plunge its OK, it deep cleans, my skin looks wonderful, massaging vibrations relaxing as long as it just glides over chin and cheek bones and doesn&#x27;t rest there to give you the shakes. Although it says \\&quot;gentle enough for daily use\\&quot; after 3 days, twice a day my face was very dry and had chemical peel \\&quot;frost\\&quot; that eventually peels off. The cleanser makes my skin crave moisturizer. So I use the Wave in the evening followed by a moisturizer, much better :) I think my ten bucks delivered a good return. Reviews have me afraid to use this in the shower, contributing to it&#x27;s early death, so I haven&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wave came with a refill coupon, the Neutrogena site ran out with no info about replenishment :( Finding reasonably priced refill pads is \\&quot;interesting\\&quot;, even AMAZON \\&quot;eligible for FREE super saver shipping\\&quot; ones sold out quickly...sign up to be notified!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional research calling BOTH Neutrogena AND Clean and Clear found:&lt;br /&gt;Pads - Wave Deep Clean &#x3D; white w/cleanser that DO NOT foam&lt;br /&gt;Wave Deep Clean Foaming &#x3D; blue w/foaming cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Wave Gentle Exfoliating &#x3D; white w/orange microbeads (others have mentioned pink microbeads too)&lt;br /&gt;Wave Shine-free Blemish-free &#x3D; light orange with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean and Clear Blackhead Eraser &#x3D; lilac pads with 1% Salicylic Acid (discontinued)... use 3 times a week&lt;br /&gt;Total Skin Renewal &#x3D; cream pads w/mushroom extract (discontinued) ... use 3 times a week.

    <li> I love my wave, it is so easy to use, and I love that I can use it in the shower.  It is very waterproof, and has different pads that you can use with it, it is very versatile.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted to try this, so I ordered it as a surprise. It seems that she is always washing her face. Sometimes I wake up at night and hear the sounds coming from the bathroom. She says &amp;#34;every woman should have one of these&amp;#34;  She tried the spinning one, and doesn&#x27;t enjoy it nearly as much. Great product !</li>
    <li> I used it for three weeks with its cleanser pad. it was great. My face was brighter and less acne.</li>
    <li> I bought this to see if it would help clear up my skin after working in a hot humid environment. I ordered a refill pack with this item, and got the wrong ones. I decided to try the pads sent with this item, and it literally burned my face. I looked like I was sunburnt for days. The pads don&#x27;t lather up, and it&#x27;s rough on the skin. This thing has now joined the gang of unwanted products under my sink. I was not pleased with this purchase at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other reviews, the best of the best, lowest price ever on the internet, and great price with quality</li>
    <li> Works well soin looks feels better. Have to watch how long you use, especially those with sensitive skin. A few quick rounds around the face and your good. Feel good on your face as well.</li>
