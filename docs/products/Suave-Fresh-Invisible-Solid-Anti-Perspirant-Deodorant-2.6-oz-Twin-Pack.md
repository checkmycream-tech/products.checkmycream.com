      <li>good price for my favorite deoderant</li>
      <li>NICE</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t stink so it seems good :)</li>
      <li>and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best deodorant to get.</li>
      <li>perfect great priceI will buy again works great better than some of those more expensive brands</li>
      <li>Works great, and the price is comparable to a local purchase WHEN I CAN FIND THE NICE SCENTS ON THE SHELF!  </li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again but for the price, it was ok.</li>
      <li>but I prefer something a bit stronger for activities that require more protection.</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant that&#x27;s why I purchased</li>
      <li>My favorite deodorant for years.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, too!</li>
      <li>I love this brand works well</li>
      <li>Most are about 15-18 %.</li>
      <li>What more could I ask for?</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, they go on smooth and don&#x27;t stain your clothes.  </li>
      <li>Best idea in a long time.</li>
      <li>But this Fresh Scent is pleasant, not too strong, and fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.</li>
      <li>Easy for subscribers.</li>
      <li>It starts out as a strong fruity floral.</li>
      <li>I like that the smell isn&#x27;t strong or too fragrant.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the powder fresh scent in the past and liked it the best.  </li>
      <li>but it is important.</li>
      <li>At first I thought this deodorant was okay, but after a couple days I noticed it stopped working a couple hours after putting it on.</li>
      <li>CLEAN SMELL I&#x27;LL</li>
      <li>It does what it should do, it smell good and keep me dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to deodorant for some reason, most deodorants I buy give me body odor</li>
      <li>Different people may like it more!</li>
      <li>Worth the price..teen loves it</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s not all day protection because the \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; is too acidic and sort of reminds me of BO.</li>
      <li>So, when I&#x27;m feeling not so fresh at the end of the day, I wonder which one it is I&#x27;m smelling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I ordered the fresh scent and it has a chemical smell.  </li>
      <li>Suave is a decent affordable deodorant that does it job good enough.</li>
      <li>(If you put your clothes on right after application, then yes, it will get on your clothes)</li>
      <li>Make sure you get the Suave that says &amp;#34;24-hour Protection&amp;#34; because it works much better than the other Suave deodorant!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work that great and definitely doesn&#x27;t last 24hrs - won&#x27;t buy again</li>
      <li>is pretty good if u wearing  black clothing.</li>
      <li>Now I get exactly what I want, automatically with Subscribe and Save.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only brand I can buy. :)</li>
      <li>and we have  used these products many of times from our local grocers with no problem.   </li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s dry and invisible, but I&#x27;m not seeing the all day protection and fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It is fine as far as function, but the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent is really overpowering and too perfumey.  </li>
      <li>This is not as effective as other deodorants in preventing sweat and odor.</li>
      <li>my family no longer wants me to order personal items from Subscribe  and Save any more.</li>
      <li>However, the main ingredient is not the same as most deodorants.</li>
      <li>It was priced very well.</li>
      <li>got it as a gift.dont really know how it is.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
      <li>I use this deodorant and it works very well for me.</li>
      <li>Very satisfactory product.  </li>
      <li>but I like this product just as much , for a much cheaper price.</li>
      <li>Nice price for a double pack, cheaper than local retail.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough for everyday use</li>
      <li>Not quite as strong as other antiperspirants</li>
      <li>Suave Invisible Solid Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Fresh scent works for me.</li>
      <li>I love to shop for everyday things online from amazon.com.</li>
      <li>They usually provide all day protection, have a pleasant scent and are dry and invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap but not worth it.</li>
      <li>For those of you that don&#x27;t like the original diffrent deodrants due to its strength, try this one!</li>
      <li>think I&#x27;ll switch back to powder fresh scent when I get the chance to go back to the supermarket.</li>
      <li>I like Suave products, in general.</li>
      <li>Works better than its more expensive competitor, Secret.</li>
      <li>I did not see the point in paying almost 2 times as much for the same active ingredient.</li>
      <li>The % of active ingredient is the main reason for my switching.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite deodorant for years.  Excellent price on Amazon subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Does a good job and at a great price</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think a lot of people pay attention to the active ingredient but it is important. Most are about 15-18 %. The % of active ingredient is the main reason for my switching. The price is great too. I did not see the point in paying almost 2 times as much for the same active ingredient. So I switched to Suave. I have used their products off and on for as long as I can remember. Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this deodorant was okay, but after a couple days I noticed it stopped working a couple hours after putting it on. Very unpleasant.</li>
    <li> It does what it should do, it smell good and keep me dry.</li>
    <li> I used to use only Secret but I like this product just as much , for a much cheaper price. Plus this pack of two is an excellent deal.</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I only received one twin pack of this item. 1 ct. It should of been two twin packs two counts for the price I paid. The picture even showed two count</li>
    <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> This is a really great deal on this deodorant!  I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot on this type of item and was amazed at how well this Suave 24-hour protection worked!  I think it works just as well as deodorants that are twice the price!  The scent is nice, they go on smooth and don&#x27;t stain your clothes.  Make sure you get the Suave that says &amp;#34;24-hour Protection&amp;#34; because it works much better than the other Suave deodorant!</li>
    <li> Worth the price..teen loves it</li>
    <li> I like Suave products, in general. I don&#x27;t mind other Suave deodorants. They usually provide all day protection, have a pleasant scent and are dry and invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh scent Suave is giving me trouble. Sure, it&#x27;s dry and invisible, but I&#x27;m not seeing the all day protection and fresh scent. I think it&#x27;s not all day protection because the \\&quot;fresh scent\\&quot; is too acidic and sort of reminds me of BO. So, when I&#x27;m feeling not so fresh at the end of the day, I wonder which one it is I&#x27;m smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll switch back to powder fresh scent when I get the chance to go back to the supermarket.</li>
    <li> The same product I have been buying in brick and mortar stores for years.  Very satisfactory product.  I&#x27;ve purchased the powder fresh scent in the past and liked it the best.  But this Fresh Scent is pleasant, not too strong, and fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with your perfume.</li>
    <li> I do not know if I got a bad batch but I ordered the fresh scent and it has a chemical smell.  I have ask others to smell this Deodorant and they all said the same thing I said. it has no  smell at all just chemicals. I have had this Deodorant before and it does not smell this way  I think that I just got a bad Batch. and I ordered 6 of them and they all smell like chemicals.    Update March 1, 2015  This Product has been tossed in the trash Something is seriously wrong with this   Product and all 6 Deodorant has been tossed in the trash. I just think I got  a bad batch. my family no longer wants me to order personal items from Subscribe  and Save any more. we had to throw the tooth paste away as well and we have  used these products many of times from our local grocers with no problem.   these items are obviously Manufacturers rejects.</li>
    <li> I use this deodorant and it works very well for me. It smells great and it works all day. It&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> It is fine as far as function, but the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent is really overpowering and too perfumey.  I tried for a week or so, and decided to get rid of in favor of a different scent.  Different people may like it more!</li>
    <li> got it as a gift.dont really know how it is.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t stink so it seems good :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to deodorant for some reason, most deodorants I buy give me body odor or if I use the same brand for too long I will get body odor. For some reason Suave never gives me body odor even though I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and it smells nice. It&#x27;s cheap, too! It&#x27;s the only brand I can buy. :)</li>
    <li> good price for my favorite deoderant</li>
    <li> When I catch it (the lower price)....it is a great value!</li>
    <li> Does not stop the sweat and I am not an overly sweaty person. Would not buy again. Cheap but not worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite deodorant that&#x27;s why I purchased</li>
    <li> I works for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my clothing. (If you put your clothes on right after application, then yes, it will get on your clothes) I have tried more expensive brands and cannot tell a difference.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deodorant to get. It&#x27;s great protection and I never have to worry about it  sweating away throughout my day.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great. Good price as well</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great deal!</li>
    <li> Suave is a decent affordable deodorant that does it job good enough. It&#x27;s good enough for everyday use but I prefer something a bit stronger for activities that require more protection.</li>
    <li> Works well for me! I am a no fuss type of person when it comes to deodorant. If it works then I am happy. No need to spend a lot of money on an item like this if you can get results at this cost!</li>
    <li> This is not as effective as other deodorants in preventing sweat and odor. However, the main ingredient is not the same as most deodorants. For those of us allergic to aluminum zirconium, this is the best product out there with an alternative main ingredient!</li>
    <li> The reviews on this product made me not one to purchase  it, but everyone is different so I gave it a  try is pretty good if u wearing  black clothing.</li>
    <li> I could see myself wearing this. For those of you that don&#x27;t like the original diffrent deodrants due to its strength, try this one! I really like it. It starts out as a strong fruity floral.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, I didn&#x27;t realize it was a twin pack! Extremely great price!</li>
    <li> It seems as if you have to keep scrubbing to get all the residue off of your skin. Other than that it works.</li>
    <li> perfect great priceI will buy again works great better than some of those more expensive brands</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Suave antiperspirant / deodorant for years. It is effective and a good value.</li>
    <li> This was part of my monthly order. It was priced very well. If you are having problems with odor get some of this.</li>
    <li> I love this brand works well</li>
    <li> Great price for a 2 pack of deodorant (I paid around $1.30 per deodorant). Can&#x27;t beat that! And it does what a deodorant is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great price. I like to stock up on these with subscribe and save. They work great and smell great. Not quite as strong as other antiperspirants but I do think they work nicely. My husband even uses them on occasion.</li>
    <li> Nice product..good smell!</li>
    <li> Excellent value, works great very mild nice scent that doesnt  compete with your perfume etc</li>
    <li> Best deal out their right now.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured, perfect.</li>
    <li> NICE CLEAN SMELL I&#x27;LL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
    <li> Easy for subscribers. Good price.</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  I love to shop for everyday things online from amazon.com. Best idea in a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price is very good!</li>
    <li> Great value, and I like that the smell isn&#x27;t strong or too fragrant.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  Works better than its more expensive competitor, Secret.</li>
    <li> Works great, and the price is comparable to a local purchase WHEN I CAN FIND THE NICE SCENTS ON THE SHELF!  Now I get exactly what I want, automatically with Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> Suave Invisible Solid Anti-Perspirant and Deodorant, Fresh scent works for me.</li>
    <li> Great price of great product delivered right to my door.  What more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> I like Suave products and this was especially nice, coming with two in a set.</li>
    <li> Works well, smells good but not at all overpowering.</li>
    <li> product did not work for me</li>
    <li> Nice price for a double pack, cheaper than local retail.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve was disappointed in the scent. I won&#x27;t buy it again but for the price, it was ok.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great and definitely doesn&#x27;t last 24hrs - won&#x27;t buy again</li>
</ol>
