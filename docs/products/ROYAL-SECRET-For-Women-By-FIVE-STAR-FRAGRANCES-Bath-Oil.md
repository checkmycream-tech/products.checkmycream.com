<li> Would purchase it again without the high price tag on other colognes.</li>
<li> The product I received was a clear liquid with a hint of perfume smell that did not replicate the original Royal Secret fragrance even remotely.  </li>
<li> only reason this scent is not a classic</li>
<li> Will continue buying it as long as they have it for sale.</li>
<li> It will be a complete waste of your money.  </li>
<li> It may have been around a very long time, but I feel undressed without it.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as the bottle that I had previously.  </li>
<li> Please, by all means, read some of the comments by other users at fragrance.net.&lt;br</li>
<li> I received thick white substance that doesn&#x27;t even flow, not oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This is NOT a true Germaine Monteil made product but</li>
<li> Oils are my preference; just need a little bit, and the fragrance lasts all day.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Secret fragrance since the 60&#x27;s -- back with Germaine Montei made it.  </li>
<li> Just a little watery not the original base of oil, but still does the job.</li>
<li> Weak, watered down, not the dark bath oil I used to get.  </li>
<li> This  Eau De Royal Secret was not the one I expected to receive, this oil bath doesn&#x27;t smell like anything or at least the scent I was expecting.</li>
<li> The smell sucks !</li>
<li> I bought it, I&#x27;ll keep it because it is very hard to return things.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> Have been using Royal Secret over 30 years</li>
<li> I have used Royal Secret for over 30 years</li>
<li> The picture shown on site is a false representation of what you will receive.  </li>
<li> Sorry.</li>
<li> And, it stays with you, even the day after, you can faintly detect it.</li>
<li> What is wrong with the manufacturer?</li>
<li> and I am extremely disappointed.</li>

    <li> Not the real &amp;#34;McCoy&amp;#34; -- the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; oil is brown - this was clear -- not the same fragrance either.  I have used Royal Secret for over 30 years so I KNOW the true fragrance.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Please anyone that is considering purchasing DON&#x27;T!  It will be a complete waste of your money.  The picture shown on site is a false representation of what you will receive.  This is NOT a true Germaine Monteil made product but instead a very cheap, fake, attempt to pass off as the real thing.  The product I received was a clear liquid with a hint of perfume smell that did not replicate the original Royal Secret fragrance even remotely.  Do not purchase.</li>
    <li> I have worn Germaine Monteil perfume for over 30 years! Nothing compares to the original but this will do. I still get complements from people asking what perfume I am wearing but there is a difference. This original perfume was darker and more of an oil based perfume and this one is more yellow. I will continue to buy this as this is as close as I have found to the original. Wish it would come back!</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance ever since it came on the market. Years ago I wore the eau de toilette but eventually had to give it up because medications changed my body chemistry and played havoc with the alcohol-based formulation. And then, I got a brilliant idea: The bath oil would probably stay true on my skin. And it does!!! Just a drop or two warmed on the wrist and rubbed gently between breasts and at the waist (NEVER on the neck!) and I&#x27;m in my own exotic environment all day. Thank you so much for keeping RS bath oil on the market. And kudos for the quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royal Secret fragrance since the 60&#x27;s -- back with Germaine Montei made it.  Love the scent, especially in oil form.</li>
    <li> I want more. why did you discontinue this perfume? I have been using it for over 30  years and everyone that smells me wants the name, They all love it. What is wrong with the manufacturer?</li>
    <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve ordered this product because I loved it. This is not what I ordered. I ordered perfumed bath oil. It looked just as it was pictured. I received thick white substance that doesn&#x27;t even flow, not oil.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I like it and I am extremely disappointed. I bought it, I&#x27;ll keep it because it is very hard to return things.&lt;br /&gt;But why didn&#x27;t you send me what I ordered????</li>
    <li> This fragrance was one of my deceased mother&#x27;s favorites. Wearing it always brings back wonderful memories. It&#x27;s long-lasting fragrance is classic. I recommend it for anyone looking to make a fragrance their own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance since early 1982. It may have been around a very long time, but I feel undressed without it. I&#x27;ve even had a guy stop me to ask the name of my perfume because it smelled so good.</li>
    <li> The best kept secret of the ages. This is such a wonderful perfume. I get so many compliments and no one has ever heard of it., It&#x27;s a complex blend of earthy, clean and exotic-- so timeless and unforgetable!</li>
    <li> Nice to have a long-lasting oil..i use it as perfume, not for the bath.  lasts much longer than most perfume sprays.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this bath oil and was glad to be able to find a reasonable price online.  I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same as the bottle that I had previously.  A bit strong.  It certainly looks authentic so far as packaging is concerned.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance--it is my signature!  Hope it is never discontinued.  It&#x27;s like Channel--enchanting.  And, it stays with you, even the day after, you can faintly detect it.</li>
    <li> Have been using Royal Secret over 30 years and I am still asked almost every day what is the scent I&#x27;m wearing.  I love it, and it appears so does everyone else,</li>
    <li> I use to wear this fragrance over 35 years ago. I kinda stole it from my Grandmother. It smells exactly as i remember it.</li>
    <li> very nice smells like powdwe, last all day and get a lot od complements on it.  will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is another product which is no longer available in our local stores.  Oils are my preference; just need a little bit, and the fragrance lasts all day.  Thanks Five Star.</li>
    <li> I love itn its very hard to findcso I was trilled.</li>
    <li> This  Eau De Royal Secret was not the one I expected to receive, this oil bath doesn&#x27;t smell like anything or at least the scent I was expecting. The smell sucks !</li>
    <li> Like I remember it to be. Lot of lasting scent with this fragrance. I can still smell hours later. I like that, a lot. Strong sexy scent. Great for evening wear. I love this for the bath to start things off.</li>
    <li> The perfect product that I needed with very fast mailing</li>
    <li> Weak, watered down, not the dark bath oil I used to get.  My fault, didn&#x27;t notice where it says 25% on front of box.. I use this as perfume by dabbing on my skin...</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Just like the original.  They require more words to post a review and I think I&#x27;ve said it all.</li>
    <li> Pretty close to the original fragrance. This is an old cologne which is very soft and feminine. Would purchase it again without the high price tag on other colognes. Just a little watery not the original base of oil, but still does the job. I get compliments all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again while you can still get it.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and lasts!</li>
    <li> Favorite fragrance of all times. Back in the 90&#x27;s, it was not made.....SO wonderful to be able to indulge in this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> I want everyone to try and fall in love with this scent like me and my husband and then maybe they will bring back the shower gel and come up with some powder as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this scent is not a classic is they just didn&#x27;t advertise.  Please, by all means, read some of the comments by other users at fragrance.net.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so grateful that someone somewhere did something to keep this scent alive and available.  It&#x27;s HEADY.</li>
    <li> I have used their product since 1962 and will continue to use it .  I always get complements on how nice I smell .  They always ask me for the name  of my perfume.....it has a soft scent.</li>
    <li> Purchased this Royal Secreto bath oil for my mother who has worn it since the 1970s. It was exactly the same. She loved it! And she has a keen sense of smell. Thanks to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Have worn this fragrance for years, so glad to have found it on this website. I get complements every time I wear..</li>
    <li> Delivery was timely &amp; product was brand &amp; new nicely sealed.  So glad to have found this bath oil &amp; the Royal Secret fragrance after so many years of thinking it was totally obsolete.  Will continue buying it as long as they have it for sale.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother in law. She loves RS from Germaine Monteil and now this edition from 5Star. For her, it&#x27;s the same as the original.</li>
    <li> Bought this oil for a older friend who says she can not keep the young guys away. Friend constantly gets hit on when she wears this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Have been using it for forty years and continually get complements.</li>
    <li> Have loved this product for years!</li>
