### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderful stuff.</li>
      <li>It lessens redness and it is the GREATEST thing for zits.</li>
      <li>This zaps zits wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>I use it morning and night with wonderful results.  </li>
      <li>Also the soap is good for spot treatment!</li>
      <li>They all smell great, but this one smells great and cleans your face like no soap I&#x27;ve ever seen.  </li>
      <li>This is the best cleanser because it&#x27;s basically really nice and quality soap and it drys out the acne.</li>
      <li>But this stuff is Phenomenal!!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It gets rid of the oil and makes your face feel soooo good.</li>
      <li>but its prolly good for oily skin.</li>
      <li>and it had alot of good reviews</li>
      <li>But what I loved is that as soon as I used FF</li>
      <li>Fantastic!!</li>
      <li>soap is amazing.</li>
      <li>Its amazing.</li>
      <li>So if you want to have nice skin</li>
      <li>scent is nice though...?</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic, lasts forever, and gets your skin to that perfect level of clean.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Thanks, Lush, for a great product!</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, during an event at the Lush store in Dallas I happened upon this wonderful soap, and boy, oh boy, does it work!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with Lush products.</li>
      <li>So far, this has worked best for me! :)</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not getting any better and, honestly, my face feels slightly more greasy after using this product than from what I feels like after using it&#x27;s counterpart, Coal Face.  </li>
      <li>great, exactly as described</li>
      <li>split this product with my sister and we agree it cleans your face without leaving your skin feeling \\&quot;tight\\&quot; [like many products designed for oily skin].  </li>
      <li>But one thing, when I receive this product, there was no petal thingy on the top of it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would find the magic bullet for my acne,</li>
      <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>even more information on this product, check out lush.com&#x27;s online forums.</li>
      <li>Follow on cheeks &amp; neck with favorite moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>and my skin tone more even.  </li>
      <li>Rinses very clean.   </li>
      <li>There are a lot of good natural items in here, like rose and calamine and calendula.</li>
      <li>But, it is a good soap for really damaged or irritated skin, like sunburn, etc.</li>
      <li>i think it gives a great variety of dif ingrediants against acne that you dont normally get which makes it worth giving a shot...</li>
      <li>It actualy made me break out into these huge under the skin bumps.  </li>
      <li>Fresh Farmacy is great for oily sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>great smell...leaves your skin feeling clean but not dry</li>
      <li>i think this is a fabulous cleanser ...</li>
      <li>but anyways i dont think tht&#x27;s really important.</li>
      <li>LUSH&#x27;s Fresh Farmacy is one of LUSH&#x27;s best sellers for a reason: it works!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling cool and clean, and it zaps existing acne away in a flash.</li>
      <li>The smell is less than fantastic, but Fresh Farmacy is the ideal remedy for skin with ANY problems.</li>
      <li>love this bar so much</li>
      <li>facial bar is extremly good for people with problematic and irritated skin.  </li>
      <li>Feels incredibly gentle, but gets my face very clean.  </li>
      <li>and i live in the great white north with horrid winters thats so important</li>
      <li>I would think that if you have super oiley skin it would work out for you.  </li>
      <li>Farmacy Cleanser is great for both young and mature skin types.</li>
      <li>this soap had more of a benadryl effect on the skin I would love it, but instead it make me break out in tiny pimples everywhere - allover.</li>
      <li>My routine  Fresh Farmacy  </li>
      <li>After reading dozens of reviews on Fresh Farmacy I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>As far as the way Fresh Farmacy works, I LOVE it.  </li>
      <li>I love all things Lush</li>
      <li>Farmacy can be drying, but I use moiturizer right after I wash my face</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t working without the right cleansing/toning system.  </li>
      <li>Voila - a clean feeling that also leads to a clean and clear face.</li>
      <li>When my Fresh Farmacy arrived, I used it that first day with immediate results.</li>
      <li>Just a clean face that&#x27;s steadily clearing up.</li>
      <li>After discussing my options with the extremely attentive and helpful Lush salespeople in the store, I settled on the Fresh Farmacy Cleanser and Tea Tree Water toner.  </li>
      <li>People are different and I have tried all of the popular methods to cure my acne and all were mainly chemical.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tried storing it in a sealed container, but that may actually work better.</li>
      <li>after my first wash (yes, my first)</li>
      <li>This is the first product that clears my acne without having to buy any spot products.  </li>
      <li>I bought this soap because of all of the great reviews that I&#x27;ve seen it get plus because I have abnormally oily, acne prone skin for somone in her late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Most oily-skin or acne oriented products make my skin red and irritated, but sensitive-skin creamy stuff is too greasy.  </li>
      <li>Skin is clean, clear.  </li>
      <li>my skin felt clean and soft.  </li>
      <li>I thought at first it was because Coalface was drying me out and too much exfoliation</li>
      <li>it really relaxed me when i washed my face before i slept...</li>
      <li>Very unpleasant.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it has REALLY helped me ...</li>
      <li>Smell is absolutely heavenly...great for removing makeup.   </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t get as much lather out of it like I used to.  </li>
      <li>I use prescription acne medication, and this stuff gets the grease and make-up off my face (unlike most gentle gleansers) without drying my skin (like every other bar of soap).  </li>
      <li>Your bar will last several months to a year or more depending on how often you use it.</li>
      <li>and there every once in awhile, particularly at my TOM.</li>
      <li>This is the only cleanser I use on my face now because it  makes it so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product along with the Tea Tree Water toner to anybody who has been struggling with stubborn breakouts.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
      <li>Afterwards my skin feels calm, not red like it used to after cleansing</li>
      <li>I was really hoping this would be the miracle to clear up my skin.</li>
      <li>and I used my entire bar of Fresh Farmacy.  </li>
      <li>this product i tried on a whim to try a new brand</li>
      <li>I look like a new person and everyone I know has complimented me on  </li>
      <li>It absolutely will dry up pimples and keep sensitive skin calm.</li>
      <li>After getting back in my Fresh Farmacy/Tea Tree water routine for just two days I&#x27;m already almost clear again.  </li>
      <li>However, since it keeps my breakouts in check, and leaves my face squeaky clean, that is certainly not a dealbreaker.  </li>
      <li>If chemicals haven&#x27;t been working for you try natural and try Lush!!    </li>
      <li>I usually use Coal Face and love it</li>
      <li>Thank you, Lush!</li>
      <li>but I never keep a lot of it in stock because I noticed that unless the bar is fresh from LUSH, it starts to turn a whiteish pink color and gets kind of hard.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that for the first time in a long time I feel like I finally found the right combination for my skin.  </li>
      <li>The calamine lotion in the soap really seems to work on drying up the pimples, yet the soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  </li>
      <li>my skin has been clear ever since.</li>
      <li>I was using cetaphil and the gaggle of prescription creams recommended by my dermatologist, and then a friend recommended Lush.  </li>
      <li>Ever since I went off the Pill and was diagnosed with PCOS, I have been suffering from adult acne.  </li>
      <li>I dont and never have had sensitive skin so this might be a determining factor in why this product hasn&#x27;t given me \\&quot;miracle\\</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This little bar works wonders on oily, break-out prone skin in the T-zone.   I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and still get those blemishes that I&#x27;d hoped to leave behind after my 20&#x27;s.   One-third through first bar of this product, no more breakouts.  I&#x27;m converted!!   Smell is absolutely heavenly...great for removing makeup.   I use it morning and night with wonderful results.  Skin is clean, clear.  Just lather up hands and wash face.  Rinses very clean.   Follow on cheeks &amp; neck with favorite moisturizer.  Thought Lush had stopped making this little jewel and I just about freaked!</li>
    <li> I have acne all over my face; but after I use this product, my acne are all gone. I was surprise with this product because i&#x27;ve been using a lot of other product but it didn&#x27;t work. To make this last long, I cut them in small pieces so it wont melt. But one thing, when I receive this product, there was no petal thingy on the top of it. but anyways i dont think tht&#x27;s really important.</li>
    <li> yes, I said it. But this stuff is Phenomenal!! after my first wash (yes, my first) my acne all but cleared up! I also use this soap in conjunction with philosopy hope in a bottle, and I find that the combination of the two works wonders. If I had known about this stuff 5 years ago? forget it!</li>
    <li> I would not suggest this to people who have very-very allergic skin. This made my skin breakout like an allergic reaction - but im not allergic to anything except advocado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are allergic to advocado - this product may be made in the same plant as advocado - so buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this soap had more of a benadryl effect on the skin I would love it, but instead it make me break out in tiny pimples everywhere - allover. Very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice though...?</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser because it&#x27;s basically really nice and quality soap and it drys out the acne. Also, when I use it I massage it all over my face and it gives my skin smoothness and firmness. So if you want to have nice skin this cleanser realy takes care of it.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap because of all of the great reviews that I&#x27;ve seen it get plus because I have abnormally oily, acne prone skin for somone in her late 20&#x27;s.  I usually use Coal Face and love it but since I&#x27;ve started using this I haven&#x27;t noticed anything different that from what I was getting with Coal Face.  My acne hasn&#x27;t cleared up any more-it&#x27;s not getting worse-but it&#x27;s not getting any better and, honestly, my face feels slightly more greasy after using this product than from what I feels like after using it&#x27;s counterpart, Coal Face.  I dont and never have had sensitive skin so this might be a determining factor in why this product hasn&#x27;t given me \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; results like it has others but I don&#x27;t think that I will be adding this product to my next Lush order...I&#x27;ll stay posted if something miraculous happens, however.</li>
    <li> When I used this soap, my face became really red and itchy.  So, I&#x27;m assuming that I&#x27;m allergic to it...which is weird because as far as I know I&#x27;m not allergic to anything.  It also made me breakout worse.  I was using both this and Coalface.  I thought at first it was because Coalface was drying me out and too much exfoliation so I just used FP.  My face was so red!  So I went back to Clinique in the morning and Coalface at night and the redness and dry patches are gone.  Too bad.  I was really hoping this would be the miracle to clear up my skin.</li>
    <li> This is such a bargain. What I do is I break off tiny pieces from the bar and mix it with water in my palm and rub all over my face. Your bar will last several months to a year or more depending on how often you use it. Fresh Farmacy is great for oily sensitive skin. It gets rid of the oil and makes your face feel soooo good. It lessens redness and it is the GREATEST thing for zits. This zaps zits wonderfully. Try using it as a spot treatment. Its amazing. It was the only thing that worked for my oily skin and acne after a few years of trying various products and drugs. For those of you with dry skin, try Aquamarina, its alot like Fresh Farmacy but isn&#x27;t as drying (ff is slightly drying to get rid of the oil) it has all the benefits of FF except its supposed to moisturize.</li>
    <li> My skin manages to be both acne-prone (I&#x27;m over 30) and hyper-sensitive.  Most oily-skin or acne oriented products make my skin red and irritated, but sensitive-skin creamy stuff is too greasy.  This cleanser is perfect for me.  Feels incredibly gentle, but gets my face very clean.  Afterwards my skin feels calm, not red like it used to after cleansing, my pimples go away a lot faster, and I could swear my pores look smaller and my skin tone more even.  Wonderful stuff.</li>
    <li> I had bad acne in my teens (was on accutane and the works), then it seemed to wane a bit through my early-mid twenties, until a year or two ago it came back with a vengeance.  I&#x27;m in my late twenties.  I was using cetaphil and the gaggle of prescription creams recommended by my dermatologist, and then a friend recommended Lush.  After discussing my options with the extremely attentive and helpful Lush salespeople in the store, I settled on the Fresh Farmacy Cleanser and Tea Tree Water toner.  I have to say that for the first time in a long time I feel like I finally found the right combination for my skin.  I am continuing to use my prescription topical in the evening, but I have been using that for months and it wasn&#x27;t working without the right cleansing/toning system.  I had to use cetaphil this weekend for three days because I was out of town, and after that short amount of time I started breaking out again.  After getting back in my Fresh Farmacy/Tea Tree water routine for just two days I&#x27;m already almost clear again.  I didn&#x27;t think I would find the magic bullet for my acne, but-- knock on wood-- I&#x27;m hoping this is it.  I only gave it four stars because, unlike some of the other reviewers, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent.  However, since it keeps my breakouts in check, and leaves my face squeaky clean, that is certainly not a dealbreaker.  I highly recommend this product along with the Tea Tree Water toner to anybody who has been struggling with stubborn breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have spot breakouts around my mouth and on my chin - I have tried everything.  This is the first product that clears my acne without having to buy any spot products.  I have not found it drying at all.  The smell takes a little getting used to, but now I really like it - probably because I associate it with a pimple-free face.  Highly recommend this one.</li>
    <li> LUSH&#x27;s Fresh Farmacy is one of LUSH&#x27;s best sellers for a reason: it works! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This facial bar is extremly good for people with problematic and irritated skin.  It gets it color from the soothing calamine powder, which everybody knows works wonders for itching. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this bar so much but I never keep a lot of it in stock because I noticed that unless the bar is fresh from LUSH, it starts to turn a whiteish pink color and gets kind of hard.  That&#x27;s why I rated this bar a 4.  As far as the way Fresh Farmacy works, I LOVE it.  I ust took off one star because as I get to the ending part of a piece, I noticed the bar is really rough and I don&#x27;t get as much lather out of it like I used to.  I&#x27;ve never tried storing it in a sealed container, but that may actually work better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re suppose to let it dry out completely before storing, but my boyfriend just throws it in a zip lock bag when he&#x27;s done using it.  He doesn&#x27;t seal the bag, but it keeps enough moisture in it to keep the bar moist, not mushy.  I may try this way and if it works, I will update this review. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh Farmacy and Coalface (see my review) are still the only facial cleanser I use and my skin has been clear ever since.</li>
    <li> this product i tried on a whim to try a new brand and it had alot of good reviews so i figured id give it a whirl..im in my early 20s and i hardly ever and i mean EVER have a clear day..not bad but always 1-3 pesky zits..i started to use this and didnt see immediate results but the smell is HEAVENLY it really relaxed me when i washed my face before i slept...and im about half way through my first bar and it has REALLY helped me ...i am sitting here clear as a bell (im using other products in combo)but i think this is a fabulous cleanser ...great smell...leaves your skin feeling clean but not dry and since i have ecsema and i live in the great white north with horrid winters thats so important i think it gives a great variety of dif ingrediants against acne that you dont normally get which makes it worth giving a shot...and hey if you use it for a while and it doesnt work use it on your arms and shoulders and you will be calmed throughout the day or night!</li>
    <li> I have pretty average skin. I&#x27;m slightly oily in the T-zone and dryer on my cheeks, and I get small blemishes once in a while.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This soap is amazing. My skin has never looked better. My pores are smaller and zits are non-existant. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can also use it as a spot treatment. Just rub a little on your finger and apply to the spot.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fresh Farmacy can be drying, but I use moiturizer right after I wash my face and it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> I love all things Lush but this did not work out as planed.  I have acne but it tends to come and go.  I have never settled on a product so when I bought this I was hoping it would help.  Well it did not. It actualy made me break out into these huge under the skin bumps.  After I used the bar my face felt too tight, and the bar it&#x27;s self sort of dried out a bit and this is durring a south Louisiana summer.  I would think that if you have super oiley skin it would work out for you.  after about 2 weeks I started using something else and it all cleared up.</li>
    <li> Farmacy Cleanser is great for both young and mature skin types. This is the only cleanser I use on my face now because it  makes it so soft and smooth. A little goes a long way just pinch off a piece with your fingers and mix it with water in your hands.</li>
    <li> Ever since I went off the Pill and was diagnosed with PCOS, I have been suffering from adult acne.  For someone who never had acne as a teenager or a twenty-something, suddenly having big breakouts as an adult can be very discouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, during an event at the Lush store in Dallas I happened upon this wonderful soap, and boy, oh boy, does it work!  The calamine lotion in the soap really seems to work on drying up the pimples, yet the soap doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.  After using this for about a week in conjunction with tea tree oil as a spot treatment, I am noticing a dramatic reduction in acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Lush, for a great product!</li>
    <li> After reading dozens of reviews on Fresh Farmacy I decided to try it. It&#x27;s definitely lived up to its reputation as an acne killer. I don&#x27;t have a big acne problem - just a few annoying zits here and there every once in awhile, particularly at my TOM. When my Fresh Farmacy arrived, I used it that first day with immediate results. By the next morning, the one emerging pimple I had was noticeably reduced. And I just made it through my PMS without a single blemish. It&#x27;s a miracle! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve seen warnings for people with sensitive or dry skin, I would say that those may be true only for people with severe issues. I have relatively dry skin, and fairly sensitive skin that reacts to some other products I&#x27;ve used, but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> This is not a good everyday soap even for someone like me who has a lot of breakouts. But, it is a good soap for really damaged or irritated skin, like sunburn, etc. The name says it all. I just wonder why no one else ever thought to put calamine lotion into soap before this!?!</li>
    <li> I have moderate acne and I used my entire bar of Fresh Farmacy.  This was no miracle; I still have acne.  But what I loved is that as soon as I used FF my skin felt clean and soft.  It didn&#x27;t prevent my acne from occuring, but it did calm the acne that I had and made it less red.  I would suggest rinsing well after you wash your face with FF so that there is no residue left on your skin.  So far, this has worked best for me! :)</li>
    <li> I have pretty bad acne, and have been looking for a powerful cleanser for troubled skin for quite some time now. This product is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling cool and clean, and it zaps existing acne away in a flash. Also, it&#x27;s relieved the oil on my face. I haven&#x27;t found this to be over-drying, and I have somewhat oily/normal skin that&#x27;s prone to dryness in the winter. No dry skin here! Just a clean face that&#x27;s steadily clearing up. I&#x27;m so impressed with Lush products. I can&#x27;t get enough of them.</li>
    <li> The smell is less than fantastic, but Fresh Farmacy is the ideal remedy for skin with ANY problems. I&#x27;ve been a longtime devotee of Lush, and I received a sample of it with an order last year. I used it to wash my face and was amazed by how well it cleaned - and calmed - my dry, eczema-prone skin. Initially the texture and smell of the bar turned me off, but I&#x27;ll never doubt this little bar of goodness ever again! Combine it with Ocean Salt scrub a few times a week for obscenely soft and glowing skin. Thank you, Lush!</li>
    <li> great, exactly as described</li>
    <li> I recently ordered a bunch of LUSH products sort of on a whim.  They all smell great, but this one smells great and cleans your face like no soap I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I use prescription acne medication, and this stuff gets the grease and make-up off my face (unlike most gentle gleansers) without drying my skin (like every other bar of soap).  It smells fantastic, lasts forever, and gets your skin to that perfect level of clean.  I did not notice any change in my acne, however, as noted by other reviewers.</li>
    <li> This is an ugly soap, made of calamine with flower petals on top. It absolutely will dry up pimples and keep sensitive skin calm. There are a lot of good natural items in here, like rose and calamine and calendula. There is also detergent (sls) so your skin may find this drying. But it does work.</li>
    <li> this cleanser over dried my skin, and i hated the smell.  but its prolly good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> This product is unreal! I have moderately bad acne for someone in her 20s. This product has done for me what no prescription or ultra expensive professional product has done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What I do is wet my face and my hands, then I rub my bar on my hands then put it on my face and rinse. Voila - a clean feeling that also leads to a clean and clear face. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the idea put forth by another reviewer about on-the-spot with this. I usually use other Lush products, but I&#x27;ll give that a try. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For even more information on this product, check out lush.com&#x27;s online forums.</li>
    <li> This product is a must, for those of us with oily skin!  &lt;br /&gt;I split this product with my sister and we agree it cleans your face without leaving your skin feeling \\&quot;tight\\&quot; [like many products designed for oily skin].  Controlled my oily shine!</li>
    <li> People are different and I have tried all of the popular methods to cure my acne and all were mainly chemical. Like Murad and Proactive, also everything the dermo prescribed. And it would all work for a week and then my skin was awful again. Or it would destroy my skin. If chemicals haven&#x27;t been working for you try natural and try Lush!!    My routine  Fresh Farmacy  Tea tree water  Enzymion moisturizer  Ocean salt couple times a week.    The farmacy soap is drying but followed with the other products that goes away fast. Also the soap is good for spot treatment! This has saved my skin. I look like a new person and everyone I know has complimented me on  how different I look. This routine has changed my skin. Wanted to pass along the info.  10 stars if I could do it.</li>
    <li> Use this product for over a decade! Fantastic!!</li>
