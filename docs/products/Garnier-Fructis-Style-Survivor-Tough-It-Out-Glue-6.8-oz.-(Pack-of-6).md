      <li>Glad I could get it online</li>
      <li>Sincerely,  The guy you just dumped...AGAIN. :-$</li>
      <li>I found this stuff after they (Garnier) discontinued their Brilliantine Shine Wax; which was even more awesome (but for very different reasons).  </li>
      <li>So many products out there, but this is the one for me.</li>
      <li>Well, with this product (and the right stylist), I&#x27;ve been able to do just that!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll find something else that, yes, may not be as good and just live with it...    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, has great all-day hold, flexibility and stays put all day long.  </li>
      <li>Great for any condition whether it be a humid day or a dry day.</li>
      <li>I had tried this hair glue on clearance at my local drugstore and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Plus this seller ships super fast!</li>
      <li>This is the only product that holds my hair perfectly and it isn&#x27;t too stiff or too smelly.</li>
      <li>A little hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>I love big hair and this &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; as I call it works.</li>
      <li>So yeah, I guess I&#x27;m in the same boat as most of the people reading this.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used to keep my hair thick and styled which remaining soft.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend it for anyone that wants this type of product to style your hair...</li>
      <li>No longer available at local stores.  </li>
      <li>It holds my unruly hair very well.  </li>
      <li>I can stand my hair straight up if I wanted to with this glue.</li>
      <li>The trick is to shape as quickly as possible cause it dries up pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>I wash my hair, let it dry, apply a tiny amount of the product, and I&#x27;m able to get my hair to do exactly what I want it to do without a struggle - it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
      <li>I loved the Tough it Out Glue.  </li>
      <li>Compared to other products, it is a fantastic deal.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and thin and I live on the Gulf Coast where we have very high humidity.  </li>
      <li>He has short salt and pepper straight hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried several products and this one really holds.</li>
      <li>Stays in place with a surprisingly soft feel.  </li>
      <li>it holds very well, isnt greasy and can be restyled the next day by using water.  </li>
      <li>I started using this product because Redken stopped producing their product Concrete and this was the closest product on the market that produced the same results.  </li>
      <li>The ONLY hair product that takes my unmanageable curly-wavy hair and makes it straight all day long in any weather.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it is apparently discontinued and can no longer be purchased in stores.</li>

<li> My husband has even used it on his long beard to help hold it in place.</li>

<li> Holds well and lasts all day long</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere other than Amazon lately, but at least I can still get it.</li>
<li> Love this product - too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> It lasts a long time as you only need to use a small dab of the product.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a few years now and can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
<li> I use it when my hair is still wet from the shower, comb it through</li>
<li> Provides lift and volume like none other.  </li>

<li> Now I have a little stockpile.  </li>
<li> Just a little dab is all my husband uses to get the hold he likes for his hair.</li>
<li> Amazon never lets me down!  </li>
<li> When using Survivor Glue, my hair does not get limp from the humidity.</li>
<li> He is a fussbudget when it comes to styling products and says this one isn&#x27;t too stiff or greasy.</li>
<li> The only alternative that I can think of being (after I tried and returned every flawed product from their current line), gross stupidity and or severe Attention Deficit Disorder.  </li>
<li> Do you just have it out for me or merely for all people with spiky hair in general?  </li>
<li> so I looked to Amazon and as usual they came through.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m tired of going on these little treasure hunts for the lost gel, wax, glue or pomade of yours that doesn&#x27;t suck.    </li>
<li> Seriously Garnier, just find a decent styling product that your customer&#x27;s like and then bloody well stick with it.  </li>
<li> Seriously though, just bring this and the Shine Wax back.and</li>
<li> Tough It Out</li>
<li> The stores in my area no longer carried the Garnier Fructis Style Survivor Tough it Out</li>
<li> Seriously Garnier, again?!  </li>
<li> Sorry it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make these anymore.</li>

    <li> Best stuff for my hair.  No longer available at local stores.  Now I have a little stockpile.  Glad I could get it online</li>
    <li> I stumbled across this product one day, and was instantly a fan. It provides great holding power, and styling ability. In addition it has a very mild pleasant smell. The biggest advantage is it&#x27;s price. Compared to other products, it is a fantastic deal. Sorry it has been discontinued. But, if you can find it, grab it up, and use it.</li>
    <li> Great product and shipment!!1</li>
    <li> But I did find it here and bought 6 of them!!  I love this stuff!! Hope Garnier still continues to make this.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and thin and I live on the Gulf Coast where we have very high humidity.  When using Survivor Glue, my hair does not get limp from the humidity.</li>
    <li> The ONLY product that works for my short frizzy curry hair!  May it NEVER be discontinued!</li>
    <li> Just a little dab is all my husband uses to get the hold he likes for his hair. He has short salt and pepper straight hair. He is a fussbudget when it comes to styling products and says this one isn&#x27;t too stiff or greasy. He can touch his hair and it won&#x27;t mess the style. Unfortunately, it is apparently discontinued and can no longer be purchased in stores. Thank goodness we found it on Amazon and for a fair price!</li>
    <li> I have VERY thin, lifeless hair but have always dreamed of being able to &amp;#34;piece out&amp;#34; my style. Well, with this product (and the right stylist), I&#x27;ve been able to do just that! I wash my hair, let it dry, apply a tiny amount of the product, and I&#x27;m able to get my hair to do exactly what I want it to do without a struggle - it&#x27;s a miracle! A little hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go. I had found a tube of it at a department store, but then it disappeared. Thank God for amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Great product for fine, lifeless hair.  Provides lift and volume like none other.  Stays in place with a surprisingly soft feel.  Love this product - too bad it has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> So many products out there, but this is the one for me. Holds without drying out and killing my hair like the alcohol based products do.</li>
    <li> Garnier Fructis Style Survivor Tough It Out Glue, 6.8 oz. (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;thanks for offering this, very good product</li>
    <li> I have yet to find another product that works in my hair as well as this one. Lasts all day long, even though the humid days. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere other than Amazon lately, but at least I can still get it. Thank you for holding this product.</li>
    <li> Holds well and lasts all day long</li>
    <li> So yeah, I guess I&#x27;m in the same boat as most of the people reading this. I found this stuff after they (Garnier) discontinued their Brilliantine Shine Wax; which was even more awesome (but for very different reasons).  I loved the Tough it Out Glue.  It&#x27;s light, has great all-day hold, flexibility and stays put all day long.  I wore it in my hair every day for over a year.  I realized recently that I was running low  but upon my visit to the grocery store, I found that they were out. So, unperterbed, I tried a different store...and another and so on until I realized that no one had ANY left in stock ANYWHERE and actually took the time to look online and found out that it had also been...wait for it...discontinued.  Seriously Garnier, again?!  Do you just have it out for me or merely for all people with spiky hair in general?  Do we make your hair feel inadequate in some way?  The only alternative that I can think of being (after I tried and returned every flawed product from their current line), gross stupidity and or severe Attention Deficit Disorder.  Seriously Garnier, just find a decent styling product that your customer&#x27;s like and then bloody well stick with it.  I&#x27;m tired of going on these little treasure hunts for the lost gel, wax, glue or pomade of yours that doesn&#x27;t suck.    That being said, I&#x27;m buying this case of the stuff now...but after that, I&#x27;m gone.  I&#x27;ll find something else that, yes, may not be as good and just live with it...    Probably.    Seriously though, just bring this and the Shine Wax back.and I promise I&#x27;ll love you forever.    Sincerely,  The guy you just dumped...AGAIN. :-$</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for a few years now and can&#x27;t recommend it enough. The trick is to shape as quickly as possible cause it dries up pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for my needs. Guaranteed to keep your hair in place. Wish this product had not been discontinued by Garnier.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair gel!!!!</li>
    <li> Of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried this is the best for holding my spikes through wind and rain on the golf course or wherever I may be.  I looooove it!</li>
    <li> This is a superb hair product for people with allergies to dyes and perfumes.  It holds all day no matter what the humidity level is.  Plus this seller ships super fast!</li>
    <li> Great gel works for my curly hair.</li>
    <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make these anymore. This is the only product that holds my hair perfectly and it isn&#x27;t too stiff or too smelly. Great for any condition whether it be a humid day or a dry day.</li>
    <li> The ONLY hair product that takes my unmanageable curly-wavy hair and makes it straight all day long in any weather.</li>
    <li> I love big hair and this &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; as I call it works. I have tried several products and this one really holds. My husband has even used it on his long beard to help hold it in place. I can stand my hair straight up if I wanted to with this glue. The stores in my area no longer carried the Garnier Fructis Style Survivor Tough it Out Glue so I looked to Amazon and as usual they came through.</li>
    <li> I started using this product because Redken stopped producing their product Concrete and this was the closest product on the market that produced the same results.  I like short hair and at times like to spike it up...some of the products on the market today are too waxy and leave your hair greasy feeling, but this product doesnt.  Well, now I cant find this product in any of the stores, so when I saw this on Amazon, I jumped at the opportunity to buy it in bulk.  Would recommend it for anyone that wants this type of product to style your hair...it holds very well, isnt greasy and can be restyled the next day by using water.  It lasts a long time as you only need to use a small dab of the product.  Im very happy about being able to find this and very pleased about the packaging and the arrival of the product.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had tried this hair glue on clearance at my local drugstore and loved it.  It holds my unruly hair very well.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find more anywhere.  Amazon never lets me down!  I bought a 6 pack when I saw it.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used to keep my hair thick and styled which remaining soft.  I use it when my hair is still wet from the shower, comb it through and I&#x27;m done.</li>
