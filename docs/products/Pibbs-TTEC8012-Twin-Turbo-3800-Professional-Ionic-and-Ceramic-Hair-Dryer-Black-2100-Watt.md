      <li>This is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>I had one of the first Pibbs blow dryer models, it was 1300w.</li>

      <li>The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it!</li>
      <li>But those are the same things that make it better.  </li>
      <li>It gets quite hot and really moves the air.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>excelent fast.  </li>
      <li>Also this dryer has a shorter &amp;#34;snout&amp;#34; much like the 3500, so</li>
      <li>I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So needless to say, a good hairdryer is important to me.</li>
      <li>during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I&#x27;m throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients&#x3D; fast money;)</li>
      <li>Very much the way the infrared light you put your wet nails under dries your nails quicker than just air drying them will.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I wish there was a comb our brush attachment other than that works</li>
    <li> Wonderful Hair Dryer. Gets very hot.</li>
    <li> The best blow dryer,I am a professional and it does the job for me,it&#x27;s light,and strong.</li>
    <li> Love this dryer! It&#x27;s lightweight, powerful and quiet (compared to the other models). I use this at work as a professional hair stylist and will be purchasing a second for use at home. The cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to constantly rotate my client. It gets quite hot and really moves the air.  Highly recommend! Several other stylists at work had followed suit and also purchased this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it! Not heavy and small. Dries hair super fast. Perfect for my clients with textured hair.</li>
    <li> I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I&#x27;m throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients&#x3D; fast money;)</li>
    <li> Powerful as expected. Same as the bigger one that lasted me 15+ years in a salon! Love the size, easier on the wrist!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRYER.....IT IS SO LIGHT AND EFFICIENT......&lt;br /&gt;IT IS THE BEST HAIR DRYER I EVER HAD.....</li>
    <li> Has no power like my old one.. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this dryer because is hot and powerful. What I don&#x27;t liked after 4 days,the low heat setting stopped working. I had to send back .</li>
    <li> being a professional hairstylist i got so tired of expensive blowdryers that dont dry the hair any better than the cheap ones. THEN, i read the reviews for this dryer and again i thought, yeah right. SOOO, i bought it and i must say, this blow dryer rocks. it dries the hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! FINALLY, i found one that delivers on its promise</li>
    <li> A great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair, therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair!</li>
    <li> these dryers are the best, last forever</li>
    <li> I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. I was a little disappointed. It takes a little longer to dry instead of the faster way the review mentioned. It is also not as hot as my regular cheaper blower.</li>
    <li> Great for blowouts!!!</li>
    <li> This dryer will dry your hair in record time. Excellent product!  Your hair looks silky and smooth and not damaged.</li>
    <li> Takes much less time to dry my hair.  This is a high quality product with more power than others found in department stores.</li>
    <li> excelent fast.  love it</li>
    <li> The best hairdryer you can buy!</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it.  My hair actually feels healthier these days, with the use of this dryer.  Minor point: it is easy to accidentally turn off the dryer while holding it, as those buttons are right on the handle. I wish those buttons were somewhere else, but I love the dryer.</li>
    <li> It is great  so far I hope it is going to last</li>
    <li> Very happy with this blower dryer so far. Everything works just right. Small, light. Long power cord is great benefit too.</li>
    <li> I have just used it once, but it worked great. Dried my hair in about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Not enough power and doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  Next time I need one I will go back to Solano product.</li>
    <li> Good product for good price! Im stylist and im happy work with!!!!</li>
    <li> Very powerful and light hair dryer</li>
    <li> Excellent hair dryer. Very quiet. I have thick, curly hair and live in humid Florida. This dryer straightens my hair without frizz and without any product. Very happy with this dryer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer!!! My hair normally takes 20 minutes to dry, took only 5 minutes with this product... what power!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone and they loved it. I even tried it out myself and want one of my own. Pricey, but amazing!</li>
    <li> Is this the same as twin turbo 3800 model?</li>
    <li> This hair dryer has got great power!&lt;br /&gt;It takes me less time to blow out my hair now. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am a very busy hairstylist and my other twin turbo broke so i purchased this one and i am in love with it. It is very powerful and gets the job done fast. Well worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing amount of air that comes out of it! My wife and I love it... My waiting time to go out is cut in more than half!! Highly recommended. Feels solid like you are getting your money&#x27;s worth. Has a nice long cord too..</li>
    <li> it was awesome!! i love the blow dry its amazing!! very happy with it!!! yayyyyyyyyyy my hair is ffaaaabbbuulloooouusss!! im like a professional hairdresser with this tool!!</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. Powerful and dries hair in minutes. My daughter has full head of long curly hair and it takes a lot less time to dry her hair and help straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this blow dryer. For those of you who have curly hair and have issues with bigger dyers, this is the one for you!</li>
    <li> This is a powerful, lightweight, fast working hair dryer.  I like it.</li>
    <li> Strong and hot for quick hair drying and styling.  Thought it would be quieter though.</li>
    <li> Best hair dryer ever. worth the money</li>
    <li> This hair dryer smoothes out your hair and drys your hair super fast. My hair dresser has the 3200 and when I saw the 3800 I thought it will be better and it is and it is. My hair is coarse and it drys super fast.</li>
    <li> this hairdryer is a super product!  i would recommend this item to everyone! it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes..</li>
    <li> I love it is the best</li>
    <li> Like all the twin turbo dryers, this one is built to last. The dryer feels solid and the materials are high quality, it&#x27;s also much lighter than my 3200 (and smaller). I&#x27;m an editorial stylist and I&#x27;m hard on my tools but my twin turbos always last for years (and they&#x27;re repairable). A few things to mention, the nozzles on my dryer are very hard to get on and hard to rotate when in place (perhaps they just need to break in?) Also this dryer has a shorter &amp;#34;snout&amp;#34; much like the 3500, so if you&#x27;re used to having a more traditional dryer like the 2700 or 3200 it will take a bit of getting used to. Very nice dryer with great hot air output, the best as far as i&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> product of very good quality, 100% satisfied with your purchase recommend this product to all my friends and customers amazon demanded of such items.</li>
    <li> I had one of the first Pibbs blow dryer models, it was 1300w. I saw a lot of dryers before getting this one. In the country where I live, almost every hair studio uses the taiff hair dryers, but when I asked, every hair stylist told me that its problems where that its cord tends to break and the color tends to get out. I had my hair dryer for almost 8 years, and had never had that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryers leaves my hair shinny and smooth, its awsome! It dryes my hair in 25 min, with the old one I spend like 40 or 45 min to dry it. The cord is extremely long. The only thing that I didnt like was the weight, my older hair dryers weights twice less than this one, but still its better. Im not a hair stylist and I could dry my hair like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best thing of all, is that it doesnt get too hot. All the hair dryers get extremely hot so that your hair dryes quickly and gets prettier, but this one doesnt get enough hot to burn your hair, but it does dry it fast and beutifull!!</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is very good, unfortunately  this dryer blew up on me In less than on month.  Please people read the policy,  before you buy read the return policy from this company.  The stars is for the product</li>
    <li> It came quickly. It&#x27;s lightweight and powerful. I like it.</li>
    <li> Even quieter &amp; faster drying than my previous model by pibbs! Happy! I&#x27;d highly recommend it to professionals &amp; for home use.</li>
    <li> One of the best we bought. Not the lightest but the air it outputs is great.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the investment. Professional results every time I use it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;A fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Disclosure - I am not a professional hairdresser. I do have curly hair and it takes me *forever* to dry my hair. I&#x27;ve gotten Brazilian Blowouts in the past which helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, a good hairdryer is important to me. My hairdresser recommended this one as the best one for professionals so I thought I&#x27;d get it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is quieter than my other blowdryers which is a HUGE plus for me. I can hear the phone/TV etc when I&#x27;m drying my hair. The other major plus is that my hair dries faster and smoother. That&#x27;s obviously its biggest selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quibble? This dryer is nice and small but it&#x27;s a little heavier than I thought it would be. I guess this isn&#x27;t an issue for my hairdresser but I had to rest my arm while drying my hair. This is especially a problem when drying the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, recommended but understand this is not a lightweight hairdryer. I&#x27;ve owned literally dozens over the years and this is one of the heaviest I&#x27;ve had but it&#x27;s also one of the best.</li>
    <li> I am not one to leave reviews on merchandise, but I feel compelled to do so here.  I LOVE this hair dryer.  I&#x27;ve seen some complaints about it being heavy, and I guess it is a little on the heavy side.  However, it&#x27;s also smaller than the average hair dryer, so it kind of averages out.  This hair dryer will take a little getting used to because there are some things that make it different.  But those are the same things that make it better.  Namely, you will notice it&#x27;s not nearly as hot as other dryers.  The reason for this is that it relies on ceramic infrared technology to dry the moisture out of your hair.  Very much the way the infrared light you put your wet nails under dries your nails quicker than just air drying them will.  (This is not to be confused with the UV light you put your nails under to harden gel nails....there are no dangerous UV rays in this.)  Sooo, because there&#x27;s less heat (and that does take some getting used to), it does FAR less damage to your hair.  This is EXACTLY what I was looking for.  In addition, it releases ions that provide great shine.  Additionally, it produces significantly less noise than most hair dryers.  The only negative thing I have to say about this dryer (and it&#x27;s really not a negative) is that it claims to cut drying time in half and I have not noticed this to be the case.  It may have shaved a few minutes off my hair drying time (I&#x27;ll take it!), but nowhere near 50%.  I am VERY happy with this product and I recommend it highly.  I took a chance buying it because I really wasn&#x27;t sure it would live up to the claims...but I was not disappointed.  Oh, and one more thing:  It claims to last 7-10 years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and this is my go to hair dryer in the salon and at home! It&#x27;s the best!! Well worth the money! My last one lasted over 5 years (and I work 6 days a week)</li>
    <li> Excellent  dryer repeat buyer  saw it for less money did not get a deal on it</li>
