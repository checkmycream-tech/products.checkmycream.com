      <li>Cheap hair dryer that just works..</li>
      <li>Plus free Shipping.</li>
      <li>It is attractive enough looking</li>
      <li>Light weight and dries well.</li>
      <li>The price was right, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
      <li>But for the money it&#x27;s super cheap and it works.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work week due to the cheap price, but it is a great dryer.</li>
      <li>I am happy with the product and it works as expected.</li>
      <li>Works great and half the cost of the store.</li>
      <li>Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don&#x27;t need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower.</li>
      <li>this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth 20 bucks.</li>
      <li>As far as the quality it is ok.</li>
      <li>a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     </li>
      <li>Not a fan of this, spend the extra $$$ and buy a better dryer</li>
      <li>most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter.</li>
      <li>so it will not get too hot</li>
      <li>Its a good quality hair dryer with standard features and low priced.</li>
      <li>He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works better than expected.</li>
      <li>this hair dryer works very well.</li>
      <li>this a very inexpensive hair dryer</li>
      <li>Good price ..nice dryer..took quite a while to travel around the US to get here but at least it made it for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I love this blowdryer, it comes with two attachments, a concentrator (to concentrate the air flow) and some other thing that I have no idea how to use.</li>
      <li>cord is a bit short, the heat not as hot as I&#x27;m used to, and the low setting is still pretty strong.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;cool&#x27; button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp.</li>
      <li>Dries hair quickly and quietly!</li>
      <li>quick drying, simple</li>
      <li>Only setting for temperature is Low or High with a separate cool button.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.</li>
      <li>Only one speed - always high.</li>
      <li>no adjustments beyond &amp;#34; Low - Off - High.</li>
      <li>It has two speeds with low and high heat, and</li>
      <li>When I first turned this product on my hair was wet.</li>
      <li>It really help a lot for me and easily dry your hair.</li>
      <li>Does not have multiple temperature and speed controls like my old hair dryer (Low, Med, High), but it does the job well.  </li>
      <li>you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.</li>
      <li>Good product only two speeds and cold shot button.</li>

<li> i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on.</li>
<li> once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair.</li>
<li> i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut).</li>
<li> It was cheaper to buy it from Amazon($8) and wait a few days then buy one similar to it at the local CVS($20) and at Walmart($15).</li>

    <li> this hair dryer works very well. this a very inexpensive hair dryer and I have been told it will not last very long. i do not use it to dry my hair(buzz cut). i use it for household projects, when i need to dry whatever i am working on. most recently, i used it to adhere plastic over my windows to keep out the draft during the winter. once in awhile you need a hair dryer in the house, even though you do not use it to dry your hair. this hair dryer is powerful and will do the job.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works better than expected.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product and price!</li>
    <li> Works great for price.</li>
    <li> Best blow dryer ever!! I thought that an $8 blow dryer would be a rip off but the reviews convinced me that this was a steal and it totally is! I love this blowdryer, it comes with two attachments, a concentrator (to concentrate the air flow) and some other thing that I have no idea how to use. I thought there would be some fault with this product but it exceeds my expectations. It was cheaper to buy it from Amazon($8) and wait a few days then buy one similar to it at the local CVS($20) and at Walmart($15). I love like it. Buy one from here for $8 if you can!!</li>
    <li> Works great and half the cost of the store. Plus free Shipping.</li>
    <li> Not sure what features might be missing to make this hair dryer sell at such a low price. It does everything I need it to, plus has two attachments I&#x27;ve never used (pinpointer and curler?) The &#x27;cool&#x27; button actually gets cool pretty quick and feels a little cooler than the ambient temp. Doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;medium&#x27; setting but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s worth 20 bucks. If you don&#x27;t like the color blue, well you&#x27;re outta luck. Guess since it isn&#x27;t foldable, it may not be good for travel. Whatever, it blow dries my hair at home when I need it to and does a good job at that. Will update review if it spontaneously melts or explodes.    BTW, review is based on the price I paid for it. The price seems to fluctuate a lot so wait until a seller offers it for 10 dollars or less. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty much the same deal as any other blow dryer.</li>
    <li> nice price, nice color, and the attachments are perfect.</li>
    <li> Good price ..nice dryer..took quite a while to travel around the US to get here but at least it made it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Cord is to short. Its okay  of a dryer for the price</li>
    <li> Its a good quality hair dryer with standard features and low priced.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a family hair dryer. Got a great deal and works good.  We also like the color.</li>
    <li> We actually bought this for drying the dog after his baths. He likes it a lot better than the others because it is much quieter on the low speed than what we used before.&lt;br /&gt;If you are in a hurry though, the high setting blows a lot of air, just not quite as much as your typical politician.</li>
    <li> Great price for an adequate hair dryer.</li>

    <li> Excellent buy! Dries hair quickly and quietly!</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and it is cheap.</li>
    <li> For just $7.99 &amp; FREE Shipping (without even buying over $35.00) this is another very best buy, praise the Lord! Sturdy, powerful, and comes with 2 attachments (that I don&#x27;t need), and the lowest price anywhere online (or anywhere I know of ) for this level of dryer/blower. It has two speeds with low and high heat, and a cool switch, which, like other ones i have tried  still blows some warm air, not the ambient temp.     These run off 120v AC,  which is needed for the heating element, though  I assume that like other ones  inside is a 12v DC blower motor. These likely do not cost much to make, but some can be very expensive. Why pay more?</li>
    <li> Great little dryer and the price was great</li>
    <li> Easy to handle.  Good power.  Does not have multiple temperature and speed controls like my old hair dryer (Low, Med, High), but it does the job well.  Only setting for temperature is Low or High with a separate cool button.  Only one speed - always high.</li>
    <li> great deal! great product for the money!</li>

    <li> I am happy with the product and it works as expected.</li>
    <li> Very basic, but very good pricing.</li>
    <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Simple to use - no adjustments beyond &amp;#34; Low - Off - High. What more can a person want!</li>
    <li> Really great product for the money!</li>
    <li> Great dryer, it&#x27;s fast and it was a great buy.</li>
    <li> perfect for me.  quick drying, simple</li>
    <li> More than anything about this product I like the price. As far as the quality it is ok. It is attractive enough looking but it&#x27;s cord is a bit short, the heat not as hot as I&#x27;m used to, and the low setting is still pretty strong.

    <li> Great hair dryer, no complaints, great price.</li>
    <li> Very good dryer to buy on a budget!</li>
    <li> FOR THE PRICE, IT&#x27;S AWESOME .it does what is suppose to do.I would recommend  this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> When I first turned this product on my hair was wet. When I turned this device off my hair was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because I was looking for the cheapest product available. It worked perfectly and does appear to be a quality product. I have been very happy so far.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work week due to the cheap price, but it is a great dryer. Light weight and dries well.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to like.  It&#x27;s a hairdryer with good wattage.</li>
    <li> Great price, standard shipping, nice product</li>
    <li> I Love my Conair Turbo Hair Dryer. It works great and makes my hair look and feel better. I recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Works like a hair dryer. What can I say? The price was right, that&#x27;s for sure. Of course, I haven&#x27;t owned it long so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. It came with everything needed for me.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer for such a cheap price.  I would recommend anyone who is on a budget to get one of these.</li>
    <li> Cheap hair dryer that just works..</li>
    <li> GREAT product love the color</li>
    <li> Works extremely well!</li>
    <li> Great dryer for my hair.  Felt drying time faster</li>
    <li> For the price paid, it is an  excellent buy.  I bought 3 so I would not worry about having a bad hair day without a hair dryer.  This hair dryer is simple and get the job done.  Either hot or cold.  Would be great if a third option available for hotter air.</li>
    <li> Good quality product--Used it as a heat gun for hours on end--Has a protection overload so it will not get too hot--It works great for its original intended use of drying hair too.</li>
    <li> Good product only two speeds and cold shot button.</li>
    <li> awesome look, good hairdryer</li>
