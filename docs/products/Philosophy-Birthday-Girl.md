<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect! Quick and in good condition thanks!</li>
    <li> I shipped  this as a gift because of the fantastic reviews on Amazon. Today I was in a dept. store and I saw this and I was able to test the product. The lip gloss was thick and sticky. I can&#x27;t imagine ever putting this on my lips - it was like glue. The smell was horrible too. I am embarrassed I sent this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Got this as a birthday gift for my best friend and she LOVED IT! Normally she does not like lip glosses, but the lip gloss that came with this set, she adores. She says it leaves her lips so soft and she loves the scent of both items. It did not take but a few days to arrive and I will definitely recommend this item to others. Completely worth the price! If I could is give 10 stars!! ❤️</li>
    <li> I read the description and thought that 3 items came with the gift, but it is just like the picture - just the 2.  I was a little disappointed because it was $20!  I could have bought a much better gift.</li>
    <li> Smells so good while you are taking a shower. Once you rinse off, you will not smell like cake!</li>
    <li> Product was way to small</li>
    <li> I use philosophy products all the time.  This was purchased for my nine year old granddaughter who loved it.</li>
    <li> A great gift for my niece. We love philosophy already and this was her first introduction to it, she loved the scent! Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend for her birthday, and she really loved the smell and the whole box. The box is really cute, but the whole present was much smaller than i had expected it to be...overall my friend loved it :)</li>
    <li> Great gift for not alot of money</li>
    <li> great for yourself or give as a gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lip gloss for myself in the past and also for my teenage neices. The lip gloss lasts a long time and literally feels like it&#x27;s melting into your lips. It&#x27;s wonderful smell and taste make it a gift-giving favorite of mine for Birthdays. This gift is perfect for a teenager and everyone loves the scent! [[ASIN:B004S0ETHI Philosophy Birthday Girl, 8-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> smells good.nice bd pres</li>
    <li> It is a gift that I bought to a birthday girl and she loves it! The price is fair and the material in side beyond the value.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my best girlfriend for her birthday, she said she likes it a lot.  I got it because I think Philosphy makes good products and I thought the packaging was really cute for a birthday gift. Since my friend is happy I&#x27;m glad I got this for her and would not hesitate to purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift, and I felt (and smelled) like a treat when I used it. It wasn&#x27;t always great for my oily skin. So, I used it sparingly, which made it even more of a treat.</li>
    <li> Our niece loved this set for her birthday! The scent is definitely cake &amp; is perfect for our 7 year old girly girl!</li>
    <li> Of course I realize the description has the size of the product included, but for whatever reason, I really thought it would be a &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; bottle of the soap/shampoo/bubble bath than what it is, which is somewhere between full size and travel size. All in all, I feel like I overpaid, even if Philosophy products are generally more expensive than, say, Bath &amp; Body Works. I probably would have gotten a better deal had I waited for a buy two get one free sale at Ulta.</li>
    <li> Birthday girl loved this idea and pampered herself with it on her special day lovely smell and made skin so soft.</li>
    <li> This was a great birthday gift for my mom. The scent of the body wash is comparable to whipping up a vanilla cake and sticking your face in the bowl and inhaling-- in a good way, of course. The scent only stays with you in the bath. That is to say, when you hop out of the tub, you won&#x27;t smell like a cupcake. I think that&#x27;s fantastic if you&#x27;re the type of person who enjoys wearing perfume. There&#x27;s no cross scent funkery.&lt;br /&gt;While she really enjoyed the product, I was floored by absolutely tiny the product inside is for the price. The description of course does include the ounces of the product inside, it&#x27;s just difficult to visualize. Being annoyed by the product size however is my problem and at this point, I&#x27;m just venting so uhh, five stars!</li>
    <li> Packaging was excellent! Arrived on time. What a cute and inexpensive little treat to send a birthday girl! No need to add gift wrap as the container is so decorative!</li>
    <li> Got it as a gift for my cousin. She liked it~&lt;br /&gt;Thought the 3-in-1 would be a little bigger...&lt;br /&gt;Cute packaging though~</li>
    <li> I need this night guard so much !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this for one of my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday.  Just gave it to her 2 days ago and she was delighted.  She loves the vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for sending this item quickly. I was able to get it to a friend in time for her birthday. Product was just as described, brand new and unopened. Thanks again!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect item to keep handy in your gift closet when you need &amp;#34;a little something&amp;#34; for someone&#x27;s birthday. Friends of my age have enough &amp;#34;stuff.&amp;#34; Consumables are the way to go. Everyone needs shampoo/body wash. This fits all bills.</li>
    <li> Great Birthday Gift. This was a gift for my niece who really enjoyed it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance that just fills the shower in the morning.  Another 5 star Philosophy product.  A little of the product goes a long way and it&#x27;s an added plus that you can use it as a shampoo.  The lip gloss moisturizes dry lips and tastes fantastic.  You will feel like you just took a bite of birthday cake.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Philosophy! Was perfect for the - birthday girl! I can always depend on Philosophy for a good quality gift.</li>
    <li> I sent this for a gift and it was the highlight of the birthday girl&#x27;s day. I should have sent myself one.</li>
    <li> Great little birthday gift to keep so you don&#x27;t have to do an emergency shopping trip. The scent is mild, and we have received positive comments every time!</li>
    <li> I gave this to my friend for a birthday gift.  She said she loved it, but I never tried it myself.</li>
    <li> So I love philosphy products and you know the big sizes they have at the stores. When I saw this item I thought it was going to be the same size. I purchased it for my friend for her birthday and when it arrived it was definitaly much smaller than the normal sizes you see at the stores. It is not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Birthday gift for our 13yr. old granddaughter. She loved. Said that her dog loved the smell, too. Will do it again.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. She let me rub her booty! 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Such a cute gift set for my 10 year Granddaughters Birthday! Smells so good!</li>
    <li> Gave this as a birthday gift to a girl friend of mine. She loves Philosophy and was pleased.  How could one not be happy surrounding yourself with vanilla birthday cake.  Yum!</li>
    <li> Perfect for a gift. It has such a cute casing. I didn&#x27;t even wrap it, I just put it in a gift bag and my aunt was head over heels. To this day she keeps telling me that for every other holiday, this is all she wants. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> My sister was quite surprised by the uniqueness of her gift. She loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This makes shopping easy and pleasant, knowing the receiver will be thrilled, and it arrives adorably wrapped.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister, it arrived quickly and in tact. It smells wonderful and my sister was very pleased. The lip gloss is amazing! its like wearing a cake on your lips! YuM!</li>
    <li> Nice to give as a gift.</li>
    <li> My niece loved the product</li>
    <li> The Philosophy Birthday Girl has a great vanilla scent and lasting bubble.  The clear gloss makes your lips shine, feel conditioned and look great.  A special gift for someone who is celebrating a birthday or yourself!  It is very well packaged and I enjoy the Philosophy because of the great product and terrific smell.</li>
    <li> Love philosophy&lt;br /&gt;My daughters will love this for their birthdays</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price I got for it instead of there actual site. Worth the money and a great a gift for a mom, a sister, a coworker, etc.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful.....</li>
    <li> i just love all philosophy prodcuts  they are great i have tried alot of their items never been diappointed they have amny great beauty and personal items</li>
    <li> Sent this to a friend for her birthday and she loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 was the gift message was missing.</li>
    <li> Package is so cute and product smells wonderfull! I am very pleased with the product, as is the friend it was gifted to. Would most definately order this product again. Recommend it to anyone looking for a nice gift to give a loved one. Who would love a birthday cake scented bubble bath, shampoo, and body showetr gel combo? Plus to top it all off, it comes with a sparkly lip gloss in the same scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite gifts to give or receive. The price was very good and received quickly. The person receiving the gift was very happy and couldn&#x27;t wait to use the product.</li>
    <li> Nice present. Arrived in excellent condition. The items fit nicely in the decorative box. Yes it is a little more expensive, as the bottle is smaller than the giant sized, but the box is great and a wonderful birthday gift.</li>
    <li> My 21 year old niece loved it!  Great gift idea.</li>
    <li> I got this set for my birthday on year. I have to say, the lip gloss was way better smelling than the shower gel. I used up all of the shower gel as I am always trying new shower gels and body washes, but the scent faded quickly. The lip gloss is wonderful! Normally I prefer lip gloss wands, but this one is the only one I like in a tube. I have other lip glosses by Philosophy as well. This is a perfect birthday gift! I really appreciated getting it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. For the cost I expected it to be amazing. I do love the lip gloss. But the shampoo wsnt what I thought it would be. It left my hair greasy and no pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this duo. It works wonders and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better scent.</li>
    <li> Awesome product great for a birthday present.</li>
    <li> The smell makes you want to eat it</li>
    <li> Great gift for friend</li>
    <li> Good quality, mother in law loved as a birthday gift</li>
    <li> given as a birthday gift to a friend. Packaging was real cute.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be your birthday to enjoy this treat, but it&#x27;s definitely a nice gift for a birthday girl. I got it for my friend and she really liked it. It smells sweet but not overpowering. This is a great way to put together a coordinated gift set without going broke.</li>
    <li> Great, but not as sweet smelling as hoped.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my best friends and she absolutely loved it. Especially the flavored lip gloss. It also came in a cute gift box with a custom birthday card.</li>
    <li> I brought this as a birthday present.  My friend loved it. The scent was not too overpowering. It is a really nice present for $20.  You really do not need a gift bag or to wrap it.  I just added a card and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. This is the first time I have used Amazon to send a gift to a third party and the lip gloss is missing. I feel helpless to solve the problem because I am several states away, and I feel bad that the gift she received was not perfect. I can&#x27;t find any information to contact the manufacturer so I will have to go to the store and buy the missing piece and ship it myself. I am very frustrated!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful little set:) I particularly like the shower gel/ bubble bath! It goes on smoothly and leaves your skin feeling soft. Before using Philosophy I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing! My baby soft skin thanks you Philosophy! The shower gel/bubble bath has a cake recipe on the front too cute and what a great idea. The lip gloss is really thick and has gold shimmer.</li>
    <li> Daughter absolutely loves Philosophy but she&#x27;s 13 and it&#x27;s waaaay too expensive for what little you get.  Sorry but I won&#x27;t buy her anymore of this liquid gold.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but it would make a wonderful gift.  I love Philosophy products and this one does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient loved it. The smell was nice, and she LOVED the lip gloss. The set is a bit pricey, but worth it. It came in such a cute container too!</li>
    <li> For the price, the soap/shampoo/bubble bath does not smell like anything. There is not even a hint of vanilla to the liquid. The lip gloss does taste wonderful so in essence, I paid some $24.00 for a tiny tube of lip gloss. I will not be buying anything else from Philosophy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my step-mom for her birthday and she absolutely loved it! Great gift idea for the hard to buy for or when you are just plain out of ideas.</li>
    <li> I ordered this thinking that I was purchasing a very good-smelling product. However, as another reviewer noted, the bath wash smells stale and almost unpleasant. It DEFINITELY doesn&#x27;t smell like birthday cake. I was especially disappointed because of the expensive price. Also, the lip gloss was very sticky.</li>
    <li> It was a gift I sent for a birthday present.  She loves it and thought it was a unique idea.</li>
    <li> Really small. Packaging is cute though.</li>
    <li> Upset that this is &amp;#34;prime&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve waited over a week for this. Had I known I would have just went to ulta and bought it for my friends birthday. This didn&#x27;t save me time!!</li>
    <li> This was awful never got the product the box was empty!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my niece for her birthday and she loves the scent.  I know she smelled good because after she had worn the scent for a little while everyone asked her what she was wearing because she smelled like a gummy iced cookie.</li>
    <li> These smell sooo good!! I got this for my aunt and almost kept it lol!! She loves it :)</li>
    <li> Sent to my mother in law as a quick belated birthday present. Hubby forgot to remind me the day of!!! She texted that she loved it and that it&#x27;s never too late. This with two day shipping equals a great last minute birthday gift. Looking forward to sending Here Comes the Bride to a future bride friend if I can&#x27;t come up with anything else.</li>
    <li> Packaged well, love the scent and lip shine.</li>
    <li> Great gift. Simple and easy but smells divine!</li>
    <li> cute for a young lady.</li>
    <li> Originally, I went to Macy&#x27;s in my area to purchase this as part of my sister&#x27;s birthday gift.  Of course, they had many things except this.  This is a great to give by itself or in a gift bag with a few other items.  Philosophy makes great products, and I and the people I gift them to are always happy to receive a lovely, high quality product.</li>
    <li> The body wash in this set smells NOTHING like vanilla birthday cake.  In fact, it barely smells like vanilla.  It smells more like an old, stale, vanilla candle that&#x27;s been burned too many times.  The lip gloss, however, is great.  Smells just like vanilla cake batter/icing.  However, the lip gloss by itself is not worth the price for the whole gift set, so I&#x27;d pass on this if you&#x27;re wanting something that smells great.</li>
    <li> I was actually disappointed to see the lip gloss was a miniature and not a full version my only interest was really in the lipgloss but I thought the bundle was a good deal I will most likely send this back as the lipgloss will only last about a week or two. :(</li>
