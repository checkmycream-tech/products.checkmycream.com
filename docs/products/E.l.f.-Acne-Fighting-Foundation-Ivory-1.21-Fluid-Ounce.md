      <li>It dried very nice.</li>
      <li>I ordered the shade ivory, I&#x27;m not very pale right now (i use fake tan) and it still looked good, I just used a bit of bronzing powder over top to warm it up</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but its not something I would personally recommend for everyone.</li>
      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After using this for a long time it&#x27;s my favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>It is thick, covers nicely, and eliminates the need for a primer!</li>
      <li>I have combo skin and was hoping to cover some mild mild acne and light scars, but all it did was give me blotchy patches of dried out looking foundation.</li>
      <li>Which is all I could ask for from such a cheap foundation.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if it really works for acne skin since I used it once, the color is waaaaay darker than it should.</li>
      <li>they are def high quality!</li>
      <li>this foundation is when i tried a new BB cream or during my time of the month!</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll only have to touch up your most red blemishes after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that quality doesn&#x27;t always match a high price tag, and this E.l.f.</li>
      <li>might be interested in trying Elf&#x27;s Acne Fighting Foundation in Porcelain which seems to be the next lightest (and also the very lightest shade)</li>
      <li>Since my skin appears to be normal color</li>
      <li>And if I have a particularly flaky day with this on my face it can look pretty gross.</li>
      <li>I was concerned that the Ivory would be too dark for me because one of the reviewers said that it was too dark for her fair skin and turned it orange.</li>

<li> Lasts a long time and shrunk acne when on</li>

<li> While hiding blemishes (or any other facial horrors) it fights them as well.</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin and definitely not for combination skin like mine because it tends to be a little patchy in some areas.</li>
<li> This was a little yellow for my skin.</li>
<li> My undertones are definitely pink</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing, i recomended to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> Im in love with ELF products they aren&#x27;t too expensive by they are def high quality!</li>
    <li> Other acne-fighting foundations seem very thin, and barely cover acne. This fights acne PLUS it wears like a thick, photo-ready foundation. Put on one layer and you&#x27;ll only have to touch up your most red blemishes after. Much better than Neutrogena skin clearing products which I used for years. This tube also lasts for MONTHS even wearing it each day!</li>
    <li> Love the coverage and feel of this foundation! My favorite makeup find in years and it helps my skin look flawless</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it really works for acne skin since I used it once, the color is waaaaay darker than it should. So if you&#x27;re buying ivory just keep in mind it is not gonna look ivory at all. More like buff or even a bit darker than that.</li>
    <li> it was ok. Not too bad, but the texture is very thick and its quite drying. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin and definitely not for combination skin like mine because it tends to be a little patchy in some areas. Also the color selection isn&#x27;t great, came out a little orange. It&#x27;s not horrible, but its not something I would personally recommend for everyone. It&#x27;s pretty good for the price though, I will say that.</li>
    <li> I like the color, and the feel of this foundation, but it does the same thing that powder does to my skin: highlights my wrinkles around my eyes, and enhances my pores. I keep going back to my tinted face lotion, but it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t draw my eyes to my wrinkles and pores.  :(</li>
    <li> I have auburn hair and fair coloring. My undertones are definitely pink but I&#x27;m not pale and freckled like most redheads. This was a little yellow for my skin. But it blends in just fine so no biggie.  And now that it&#x27;s the peak of summer it&#x27;s a little light, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be a great shade once fall rolls around.  I recently got a sudden adult acne breakout which I&#x27;ve never had before. So in attempt to narrow down what caused it it I threw out all of my makeup brushes and my facial makeup. But after about two weeks of going makeup free I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore. My face was only getting worse and seeing just my reflection in windows was enough to make me want to cry. Which is how I ended up buying this. It isn&#x27;t a very heavy cover up, but it does just fine. You can still see my blemishes (I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a makeup in the world that could hide those), but it hides all the red blotchiness. While it isn&#x27;t healing my acne, it also isn&#x27;t aggravating it either. Which is all I could ask for from such a cheap foundation. I use a beauty sponge to apply it all over my face and then I use the residual foundation in the cap as concealer and apply it with a concealer makeup brush. I wash all of my makeup application tools AT LEAST once a week. I&#x27;ve started using an acne treatment with benzoyl peroxide which makes my face CRAZY flaky and dry, even combined with a high quality moisturizer. And if I have a particularly flaky day with this on my face it can look pretty gross. Since my skin appears to be normal color it just looks like I&#x27;m shedding like a lizard. So if you&#x27;re using a treatment that causes your skin to flake sometimes just be careful putting this makeup over it because it can look kinda gross. If you can stand it going makeup free might be better. But if I&#x27;m having a good non-flaky day this is just fine and disguises the wreck my face has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this for a long time it&#x27;s my favorite foundation. I went to a dermatologist and got my acne under control. It was a rough road but it&#x27;s gone now. So with acne free skin this is fabulous for me. It looks so natural on my face. I can apply it with clean fingers, or a beauty sponge, or a foundation brush. All applications look very natural. If I want a more makeup-y look I sometimes use a powder over it. Otherwise I just leave it be and use concealer to touch up trouble spots. Looks like my skin is just naturally smooth. Love it.under control. It was a rough road but it&#x27;s gone now.

    <li> This is actually a wonderful product It goes on undetected giving you a flawless face. While hiding blemishes (or any other facial horrors) it fights them as well. I&#x27;ve noticed the ones i had before using this are almost completely gone. I will definitely buy this again. :D Score 1 for E.L.F</li>
    <li> Has helped my acne tremendously</li>
    <li> It does cover fairly well but can&#x27;t be used with a blender without looking cakey and sitting in all the pores. Works best when used with a primer.</li>
    <li> The product was on time and well packaged. It came in the mail box in a small box in bubble wrap. The foundation itself is really awesome. The color actually matches my face perfectly. Medium to full coverage. Didn&#x27;t seem to get rid of any existing acne i may have had, but i have been wearing the foundation for a few weeks every day and it definitely keeps new breakouts from occurring! The only tome i have broken out since i have had this foundation is when i tried a new BB cream or during my time of the month! I Definitely recommend this product and for the price?? Amazing!! Better than my MUFE mat velvet +. Which is 30$ more!</li>
    <li> I bought this through the online elf website. I was concerned that the Ivory would be too dark for me because one of the reviewers said that it was too dark for her fair skin and turned it orange. It didn&#x27;t turn my skin orange, but it is still slightly too dark for my skin. However, it does clear acne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best fitting shade of foundation I&#x27;ve ever found for my skin tone is:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Laura Mercier Smooth Finish Flawless Fluide, shade&#x3D;Vanille&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;(My skin tone is very fair with neutral / slightly warm undertones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might be interested in trying Elf&#x27;s Acne Fighting Foundation in Porcelain which seems to be the next lightest (and also the very lightest shade) but I&#x27;ve seen from reviews that it is too light for even the fairest of skin tones. I&#x27;d like a shade in between.</li>
    <li> I have a very fair complexion, When first applying this it looked too dark. I continued to apply, let dry, then applied the translucent mattafying powder, and blush as I usually do. It dried very nice. After about 15-20 minutes in had melted into my skin very nicely, and matches my skin tone just fine. Love it has tea tree oil in this as well. DO NOT BUY ELF Cosmetics on Amazon, buy them off of there website, it is WAY CHEAPER.</li>
    <li> The product covers nicely and goes on super smooth. The only issue I have is that it is not pale enough for my very pale skin.</li>
    <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since before I started wearing foundation. I&#x27;ve tried other acne fighting foundations and bb creams and none deliver like this. It is thick, covers nicely, and eliminates the need for a primer! Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I loved the foundation texture, however it is much lighter than the picture. I am considering buying a darker one.</li>
    <li> I love the feel of the foundation on my skin but this does not cover or hide my pores</li>
    <li> love it. has a medicinal smell, but it doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;the foundation itself glides on smoothly after my primer and I love it!</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, I apply with a flat top kabuki and it looks great. I ordered the shade ivory, I&#x27;m not very pale right now (i use fake tan) and it still looked good, I just used a bit of bronzing powder over top to warm it up</li>
    <li> I have used so many different foundations over the years -- from department store pricey to dime store cheap. I&#x27;ve noticed that quality doesn&#x27;t always match a high price tag, and this E.l.f. Acne Fighting Foundation is the best I have ever used, surprisingly at the lowest price. I purchased this and other items directly from E.l.f. during one of their mega-sales. I stocked up on all kinds of goodies, and I thought I&#x27;d give this a try based on the rave reviews from other customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was beyond pleasantly surprised -- I was astonished. All I can tell you is that when I first applied it, I was not impressed at all. However, as I used my fingers to even out the application the product seemed to disappear into my skin. For me, the color match was excellent, and there is a range of shades to experiment. If you can&#x27;t find one that matches you just right, it is definitely worth buying the next shade to create your own blend until E.l.f. expands this line. My skin looked immediately smoother, the pores looked somewhat smaller, the color seemed much more even -- I just loved it. Furthermore, as the day wore on, I did not need any reapplication, my skin still looked fresh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this E.l.f. foundation to anyone, wether or not you have problem skin. Just FABULOUS! Really!</li>
    <li> Covers nicely. And hide blemishes you may have. It isn&#x27;t too thick like some products maybe. Ships quickly.</li>
    <li> Not worth your money or time applying it. I have combo skin and was hoping to cover some mild mild acne and light scars, but all it did was give me blotchy patches of dried out looking foundation. It is thick and does seem to have the consistency of concealer but... I will not walk around looking patchy. No way. I&#x27;ll stick to buying more expensive foundations because I know the quality is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try it (due to the raving reviews on YouTube that are PAID REVIEWS) Don&#x27;t be surprised when its nothing that its claimed to be.</li>
    <li> Not the best, going try a matte one next time</li>
    <li> Feels nice on my skin but I didn&#x27;t get to play around with it too much as it&#x27;s clearly too orange for my pale skin. &#x3D;[</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Lasts a long time and shrunk acne when on</li>
</ol>
