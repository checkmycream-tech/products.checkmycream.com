<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought for mother in law she loved it</li>
    <li> my Filipino friend told me about this perfume and i smell it on her and liked it. one day, i went on trip with my family and we went shopping and i just test the perfume on my hand but didn&#x27;t buy it because  i am not sure if this is the same perfume. on our way back home, every body including me notice how wonderful my smell was. the next day i went shopping again and bought the perfume.  i used this perfume for years and i was working in the hospital. doctors was always asking me not to change it, because it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I purchased this for my Sister along with the body lotion and she absolutely loves it!  I will be purchasing another set for her as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many like it. My wife tried it in store and it seemed OK, so I bought it and now I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of it. It turns my stomach inside out with the excessive sweetness. The worst of it? I was not aware that AMAZON DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS ON PERFUMES \\&quot;for safety reasons\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> This is a gift, so I cannot comment on the product itself, per se. However, based on some reviews I was worried about getting a good deal for the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34; This definitely is the Eau de Parfum and is quality sealed, shipped directly from and sold by Amazon. My mother-in-law is going to love it.</li>
    <li> It smells amazing! It is a very floral smell consisting of mostly jasmine. The scent lasts all day and is not overpowering when first applied.</li>
    <li> This was a surprise gift for my mom and she was very happy to receive.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Product is good but not impressed with shipping time.</li>
    <li> My wives favorite! Bought it for her birthday and we have both enjoyed it. Will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely scent.  It is aptly named - \\&quot;Pleasures\\&quot; - and I can&#x27;t rate it high enough.  Lovely.</li>
    <li> This is a floral and feminine scent. I find it appropriate for someone my age (20), and daytime use :). It isn&#x27;t strong or weak, and lasts all day. As I was wearing it, a bee came and landed on my collarbone and tried to collect pollen. I suppose it must be made of natural ingredients if it fools a bee!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my mom and she loved it.  i&#x27;m a little skeptical when it comes to buying perfume online, but was very pleased.</li>
    <li> If you like a feminine and floral scent - which isn&#x27;t always easy to find - this is a charming, romantic fragrance. Love a spritz of this. Like to use it along with the powder and lotion and layer the fragrance. It&#x27;s an enchanting scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this scent for years and still love it and always have people tell me I smell good.  I would (and will) buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Was worried about getting in time for Christmas with the storms and planes grounded. They came through in plenty of time. Perfect size as a gift.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this sent. I got it for her for Christmas and she was thrilled. Not an old lady smell! Sophisticated and pleasant.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this fragrance for years.  This is the second time I have bought it from Amazon.  Thank you saving me some money and keeping my wife happy.</li>
    <li> I love Pleasures by Este Lauder, have used is for 15 years, Amazon.com is my go-to online shopping. My purchases arrive earlier than anticipated and they are exactly what I orderd. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love everything about it: the fragrance, the size of the bottle and the price. Actually, I thought the bottle was going to be much smaller, and so I was positively surprised when I received the package. Definitely a good deal for the money.&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance: I don&#x27;t like it when a parfum is too heavily scented or too sweet. This one is flowery and light - perfect for spring.</li>
    <li> My new favorite perfume! I&#x27;m super picky about perfumes and recently I&#x27;ve been on a search for the perfect smell. This is light, pretty, and flowery. It fades as the day goes on, but my husband can still smell it at night. I like how subtle it is. It reminds me if a younger woman&#x27;s version of Miracle by Lancome. Get it, and see for yourself :)</li>
    <li> Love it and arrived all in good shapenot much else to say but really good good good good product. th</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this spray--requested it as a special extra Christmas gift-------I was happy to buy Estee Lauder for her</li>
    <li> This fragrance smells so good, and lasts so long. I&#x27;m a fan of floral smells that are not too sweet, and this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This scent smells great on my girlfriend and she loved receiving the gift. She wears it on special occasions and it always gets my attention.</li>
    <li> keep this in stock very good perfume I will be buying another bottle soon your prices are much better the department stores I can try at home alone first to see if I like it I&lt;br /&gt;I did and will  buy more</li>
    <li> I got this perfume based on the ratings and when I received it, it smells too flowery. I like the soft smell type perfume, this smells very strong for me.</li>
    <li> It arrived sealed in the classic pink box. The wife loves this perfume. It&#x27;s a clean and light scent that is very bearable.</li>
    <li> And she smell wonderful, this was 13 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get a small bottle just in case I didn&#x27;t like it I would give it to her and.....Oh my god smell amazingly fresh, not strong but like a fresh bouquet of flowers. I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It arrive brand new. :-)</li>
    <li> I have used Estee Lauder fragrances for years.  Pleasures is the one my husband likes best.  It is light and just makes you happy.  It is wearable in all seasons and temperatures.  It just makes you feel good to know you are wearing such a wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> The perfume is my daughter-in-laws favorite and it was a great deal . I always try to order these type items from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon as I usually save a lot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s possibly the only one she wears, and won&#x27;t give her an allergy attack. The fragrance is very neutral, it&#x27;s not overwhelming, its young and fresh, and not too mature smelling either. And can be worn both during the day and at night.</li>
    <li> Great product for women. I bought this for my mom for mothers day and she really loves this smell. It is however for more mature women. Seeing how my mom is 53 years old so i wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to women in their 20&#x27;s</li>
    <li> A wonderful savings for my favorite perfume. Always paid quite a lot for it, but was very happy with the price and promptness in shipping.</li>
    <li> not great - for some reason when I tried it on in store I thought it had a stronger sent, more fresh/floral. It&#x27;s just ok, very light on me and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is amazing and was affordable as well. My product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected. Whenever I wear my Pleasures perfume, I always get &amp;#34;umm, you smell good, what is that you&#x27;re wearing!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! I use everyday all day long and always get compliments when ever I put it on. Awesome!! It&#x27;s Amazing</li>
    <li> I purchased as a Christmas gift for my Mother. She will wear nothing else and loves it. Will purchase again..</li>
    <li> Best price I could find.  Department stores are way higher.  It&#x27;s a favorite of mine.  It even beat the prices at the outlets.</li>
    <li> One of my wifes favorite, so of course it was a big hit for Xmas.</li>
    <li> Really nice!! I loved it</li>
    <li> I love this perfume on my wife. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Estee Lauder. Great all around company and great products. If you are not sure about this perfume pick up a free sample at Macys or Neman&#x27;s!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the day progresses the perfume smells different in a good way. You are not stuck with one boring scent.</li>
    <li> Very Feminine and refreshing !!! I always liked it!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. Good price, cheaper than at stores! Go Amazon!</li>
    <li> Nice scent.  I ordered this one by mistake, but it was nice.</li>
    <li> Huele a diablo, ni se les ocurra regalarselo a sus novias...</li>
    <li> I used to use Pleasures, it was wonderful and I was asked the name, one man wanted to get it for his wife.  I have tried to enjoy it again but it seems the scent has gone in this bottle.  My husband said he could not smell it even after I put on a lot for that reason.  I cannot smell it on my wrist or inner elbow just after I apply it.  I purchased some for him and it has a very nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janice Haines</li>
    <li> I love the scent of Pleasures compared to so many other colognes/parfums that I have sampled.  Friends ask what cologne I am wearing and I tell them.  Then I tell them I purchased this at Amazon!  Good work Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the perfume on my wife. She said that people love her smell too. Actually, it&#x27;s been her perfume for a long time , which she alternately uses with another perfume (NR&#x27;s LduTemps). But she said she noticed that here in the U.S., LdT smells differently - somewhat stronger. Whereas with Pleasures, its the same in Manila &amp; any other asian countries &amp; the U.S. - flower based &amp; sweet.</li>
    <li> The fragrance reflects a carefree yet sophisticated personality.The spray is not too strong nor too light. It is fresh, floral; great for day and evening.</li>
    <li> The name for this perfume is fitting.  It is such a pleasure to know that you just smell wonderful when you use it!</li>
    <li> This product smells like heaven on earth. It is feminine and sensual and It is my go to scent for feeling beautiful. I love this scent and have come back to it over the years. I received this as a bday present and it it just delicious.</li>
    <li> One of my fav perfumes! Great price.  I get compliments on this perfume every single time I wear it.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Yes, it was authentic.  Fantastic price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> The product was diluted. This is not original. Bought it for my sister and the difference between what was bought at the mall is vast. This hardly lasts an hour no matter how much you spray on. The store bought product lasted the whole day with just a few drops.</li>
    <li> Very strong at first but it smells nice later.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again.  I have tried to return this defective bottle of perfume.  But I have not been contacted back.  Very un-professional!!!</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful, and intoxicating scent I have ever smelled.  Not strong, very mild and sexy.  I will buy more of this as gifts for the holidays, but only to my best friends.</li>
    <li> It smells great!!! The bottle is super easy to use. The size is also amazing! I Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Our 29 year old daughter loved this gift from us. Nice frangrance for a young woman. That&#x27;s all I know.</li>
    <li> Even though this is an old fragrance...it still smells delicious!  It lasts all day too!  I have received many compliments too!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my fianc&amp;eacute;. It&#x27;s her favorite perfume, she loved it! Made me look great in her eyes :)</li>
    <li> Have loved this fragrance for many years, it has a very nice soft clean fragrance,  I would highly recommend this to any stylish woman</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this before now, and I loved it then, and I love it now. Great fragrance. The only complaint I have is that my husband bought this for me for mother&#x27;s day with Prime, and it took almost two weeks for it to arrive. I think that is absolutely ridiculous. Why pay for prime when things won&#x27;t arrive when you say it will?</li>
    <li> My son bought my first bottle of Pleasures because he doesn&#x27;t like a real strong scent. It has a lasting aroma, but doesn&#x27;t knock you down. I get many compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume!  One of the best scents every made. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order it again when my supply gets low.</li>
    <li> Had an old smell to it. Could not give as gift had to buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  I have been wearing it for years</li>
    <li> My mothers favorite perfume.. Wonderful price and was perfectly delivered..</li>
    <li> My daughter in law asked for this for Christmas.  This is her favorite perfume.  I will probably re-order for her birthday</li>
    <li> Always worth the money and again, this saved me a trip to the mall.  Good price and I got to avoid the mall.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume in the past and loved it but it has been a while. It doesn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it.  Anyone else might love it.</li>
    <li> Just what was detailed in the description and for a great price! It was ordered for a gift and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Pleasures is a \\&quot;fair trade\\&quot; product meaning you are not supposed to get a discount to purchase it, but it was $15 less and no tax or shipping...Can&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
    <li> I ordered three bottles of Pleasures for Christmas presents , one being for myself.&lt;br /&gt;Items came very well wrapped,  delivered by usps .&lt;br /&gt;You have to appreciate Estee Lauder perfumes, all the perfumes that I have ever tried( Beautiful, Youth Dew) do not fade away after wearing for several hours. Pleasures has a sweet fragrance, somewhat flowery and it is a good choice for any age...Beautful is another Estee Lauder Perfume that has a very nice fragrance and well worth trying...</li>
    <li> If you like this perfume it&#x27;s self explanatory. LOL. I will say however that this was the cheapest I was able to find at the time of purchase.  And was prime eligible as well so Shipping was free and fast.  My sister was very pleased to get it.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pleasures&amp;#34; has become my all-time favorite scent. AMAZON provides the best price in comparison to department store and special orders from perfume websites.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite sent.  Pleasures has a light foral sent.  It smells like Springtime to me. I absolutely love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my most fav fragrances.  Got a good deal on it, and it was new in box.</li>
    <li> THis is the perfect scent for me.  I noticed a lady next to me at the Nutcracker wearing it.  Loved the smell.  And the shipping was fast and efficiently pkged.</li>
    <li> Love this scent!! Come wrapped in plastic to show its never been used. I gifted it but opened the plastic just to make sure it sprayed. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It shipped super fast, which was great, but the 1 star is because this perfume smells like 200 year old lady. Not even a lady that old would be wearing this. Not a pleasant scent at all.</li>
    <li> Have worn Pleasures for years and it is still my favorite! Price was better than those at the outlet malls.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as wanted. Very satisfied with product and service.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife... arrived on time and the package was good. Met my expectations.  Happy !</li>
    <li> I wore this fragrance yesterday with my &amp;#34;Sweet Pea&amp;#34; bath and body works lotion.  A woman in my office asked me what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  She loved it.  Then late last night around 9:00 p.m. I was at an Office Depot and the sales guy asked me about the fragrance.  I was surprised he could still smell it after wearing it 12 hours!  So ladies, this is not a bad purchase for a long lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my Wife for her birthday. She loves it, and I love the smell of it on her.It&#x27;s a win-win situation for me...</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting. Thank you.</li>
    <li> i dont think this perfume was original, or if it was it has been kept on the shelf too long. I know really well how Pleasure smells but this has very faint smell that goes away very quickly.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend drives me crazy with this fragrance</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> Speaks for itself. The wife loves it so I love it.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this perfume as a gift for my godmother and all I can say is that she told me that she gets asked what she is wearing because she smell really good!  It&#x27;s so soft and lovely to the nose, not offensive like some perfumes can be and when you get older you want to draw attention to you not scare folks off.  LOL  She loves it and that&#x27;s what mattered to me!</li>
