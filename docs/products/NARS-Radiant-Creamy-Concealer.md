      <li>The color is perfect for my fair to light skin with neutral undertones.</li>
      <li>Works perfect for highlighting and contouring if you use it lightly and blend.</li>
      <li>I do not set it with a powder so that it doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s radiant finish, I sometimes use a setting spray over it, but it lasts a good 6-8 hours without touch-up without the spray anyway.</li>

      <li>I have been very pleased with this concealer.</li>

      <li>I had been using Amazing Concealer brand for years, but I like this better.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best concealer I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I ordered this concealer because I read an article saying it was the most amazing ever.  </li>
      <li>Nars Radiant is the best so far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin without any caking, and it covers up any under eye darkness more effectively than Amazing Concealer.  </li>
      <li>.it&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s color, doesn&#x27;t oxidize, and has good staying power.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I love this concealer..</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>(who all insisted that your line is 100% safe for celiacs) before committing.</li>
      <li>I just bought this product recently and I have to say that it is one of the best concealers that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>has better</li>
      <li>Love it .</li>
      <li>I have been through many products throughout my life</li>
      <li>Love the coverage, texture, and wear.</li>
      <li>The consistency is so smooth and one swipe does the trick!</li>
      <li>Creamy, doesn&#x27;t budge easily.</li>
      <li>The color is bright and the pink undertones really do a good job of highlighting.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very creamy and pigmented consistency, which surprisingly works fabulously with my oily/combo skin type.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong).</li>
      <li>It is smooth, creamy, yet hides the imperfections under my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think a concealer could replace my Maybelline Fit Me</li>
      <li>Gluten free is not a fad.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure that you get your 100% right shade so that you have no issues.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure she was in her 20&#x27;s, so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty wonderful, but make sure that you have a heavy duty moisturizer to go with it!</li>
      <li>I read about it on a beauty blog I follow and as suggested it covers very well and the color seems to fit many skin tones.</li>
      <li>Plus, the applicator is so easy to use you can be totally inexperienced with makeup and still get an amazing result!</li>
      <li>I just bought a huge amount of NARS at a big event because the company was claiming to be 100% gluten free, testing to be sure, safe for celiacs.</li>
      <li>but really, I find that with most concealers</li>
      <li>Being a NARS product, it was a little pricey ~ I have found drug store products that work just as good or better.</li>
      <li>(hereditary)&lt;br /&gt;Coverage great and natural, I don&#x27;t have to have foundation on, just use the concealer and look natural still.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>It has a great texture, and goes on easily without pulling on the delicate under-eye area.</li>
      <li>It is medium coverage, and while I would prefer full coverage, this is better than having cake-y dry fine lines from a full coverage concealer.</li>
      <li>It really does not go into fine lines, but the coverage is medium.</li>
      <li>Creamy Concealer is by far my favorite concealer.</li>
      <li>Sephora has been competely sold out of this shade since right after this product was released</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I like it better than my benefit face paste, but it&#x27;s a nice alternative.</li>
      <li>Because if you&#x27;re going to spend the money, you might as well make sure it actually looks like your skin when you wear the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty great…</li>
      <li>This is exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>so I was super excited to find it here for the exact same price.</li>
      <li>I thought that I aged about 10 whole years with this concealer on, opposed to not wearing anything (Clarins Instant Light Brush on Perfector is lightweight and light-reflecting and perfect for an aged eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Amazing product for covering dark circles.</li>
      <li>While it does still crease a tiny bit, it is MUCH better than many other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>It does not settle into fine lines like ALL other concealers I have tried (unless you use too much of course), and it leaves a radiant finish that looks like real skin because it is dewy and not matte which also helps reflect light away from this area.</li>
      <li>The other great thing about this product is it lasts for so long.</li>
      <li>tacked off a star because it can make me a little bit oily on a warm day</li>
      <li>This stuff will hold up really well.</li>
      <li>I usually apply some concealer with the wand, lightly blend in a tapping motion with my fingers, and then smooth the edges with my beauty blender.</li>
      <li>It gives medium to full coverage which I definitely need without looking cakey.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of high quality concealer brands -</li>
      <li>The coverage is medium; enough to highlight and get rid of dark circles, but not so strong that you look really made-up.  </li>
      <li>If you are on a budget, this concealer is worth every single penny.</li>
      <li>long lasting, nice to use on other blemishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
      <li>I need something that will look natural and not slide off, and it works.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, so basically whenever I wear makeup</li>
      <li>I have dark circles and this covers them nicely without being heavy.  </li>
      <li>It seems to be okay for light to medium dark circles, but it&#x27;s not effective on really dark circles.</li>
      <li>I have never loved any concealer more in my entire life.</li>
      <li>This concealers formula is also so rich and creamy while not being too thick or cakey at all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high end and drug store brands to mask my pretty bad dark under-eye circles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I remember watching a Lauren Curtis video on youtube and she was raving about this concealer. I was curious to try it out. I also saw other beauty gurus such as Shaanxo and Jackie Wyers using this concealer in their looks. Soon after, I went to the mall and picked this up at Sephora after being matched to the correct shade. I have never loved any concealer more in my entire life. I now see what all the talk is about. This is incredible. I can apply the tiniest amount and it will be enough coverage. This concealers formula is also so rich and creamy while not being too thick or cakey at all. I am currently on my second tube. The other great thing about this product is it lasts for so long. Even with everyday use! If you are on a budget, this concealer is worth every single penny. Plus, the applicator is so easy to use you can be totally inexperienced with makeup and still get an amazing result! Will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> Love it . looks good till end of day :)</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product off amazon, I bought it at Sephora. I have been through many products throughout my life and I have not been able to find something that works perfectly. I have combination skin with really dry areas that concealer usually accentuate and oily areas that cause concealers to slide off. I just bought this product recently and I have to say that it is one of the best concealers that I have ever used. I am going to a wedding soon and I am one of the bridesmaids and I have to do my own makeup. I need something that will look natural and not slide off, and it works. I was just at the bachelorette party for 5 hours with just putting on the concealer and it looked like I had just applied it when I got back home. It gives medium to full coverage which I definitely need without looking cakey. This has to be the greatest concealer ever.</li>
    <li> Love this product.hides imperfections wonderfully</li>
    <li> This concealer is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, and while you are paying a pretty penny for it, I find that it easily pays for itself. It&#x27;s a small tube, but it lasts a fairly long while (I use mine three or four days out of the week; I&#x27;ve had it since January and it&#x27;s still going strong). I have really sensitive skin, so basically whenever I wear makeup I break out depending on how long I need to wear said makeup. I found that this stuff doesn&#x27;t break me out, so long as I remove it at the end of the day. It&#x27;s a very creamy and pigmented consistency, which surprisingly works fabulously with my oily/combo skin type. It seems as though it would work wonders for dry skin types as well. Another pro: you can use it anywhere on your face. Underneath the eyes, on blemishes, even to even out eyelids-- this stuff is greatly universal.&lt;br /&gt;I tacked off a star because it can make me a little bit oily on a warm day and I may have to powder once or twice...but really, I find that with most concealers and we can&#x27;t expect a miracle in a tube (although this is seriously the closest to it).&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: yes. Get this little gem of awesomeness. It is all sorts of lovely, and compact (great for travel), and pigmented, and...ahhh. I love this stuff. If you&#x27;re unsure of your shade, however, I would recommend hitting up a counter and getting matched up for a color. Because if you&#x27;re going to spend the money, you might as well make sure it actually looks like your skin when you wear the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I ordered this concealer because I read an article saying it was the most amazing ever.  It&#x27;s pretty wonderful, but make sure that you have a heavy duty moisturizer to go with it! It&#x27;s not going to conceal well if your skin is dry.  Also, make sure that you get your 100% right shade so that you have no issues.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty great….it&#x27;s true to it&#x27;s color, doesn&#x27;t oxidize, and has good staying power.</li>
    <li> Creamy Concealer is by far my favorite concealer. The consistency is so smooth and one swipe does the trick! I have dark circles that are pain to cover up but this concealer does the trick without using any other product. I am in the color honey which is perfect for lighter medium tones! It doesn&#x27;t look too yellow or too pink. It doesn&#x27;t crease at all and hydrates under the eyes! You guys have to get your hands on this 💙</li>
    <li> Best concealer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;And I used many.&lt;br /&gt;I have dark circles under my eyes. (hereditary)&lt;br /&gt;Coverage great and natural, I don&#x27;t have to have foundation on, just use the concealer and look natural still.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have dark circles and this covers them nicely without being heavy.  It has a great texture, and goes on easily without pulling on the delicate under-eye area.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best concealer I have ever used. I have dark circles almost every morning and it gives me the best coverage while making my eyes look so bright. I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I saw a beauty blogger use this under her eyes and the minute I bought it I tried the same thing. Um, NO! I&#x27;m almost 40 and I&#x27;m pretty sure she was in her 20&#x27;s, so let me just say that I&#x27;m not going to use this for under my eyes. I thought that I aged about 10 whole years with this concealer on, opposed to not wearing anything (Clarins Instant Light Brush on Perfector is lightweight and light-reflecting and perfect for an aged eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, it&#x27;s a kick-ass concealer for spots and other places! This stuff will hold up really well. I can see why it&#x27;s so popular! Creamy, doesn&#x27;t budge easily. It has already taken the place of my other &#x27;go-to&#x27; concealers and I&#x27;ve only tried it once.</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with this concealer. I read about it on a beauty blog I follow and as suggested it covers very well and the color seems to fit many skin tones. I&#x27;m not sure I like it better than my benefit face paste, but it&#x27;s a nice alternative.</li>
    <li> I hate to use the product name to describe the product but this product it truly radiant and creamy! I got this shade (vanilla) because I wanted it to be a bit lighter than my skin and it is PERFECT! It goes on great, stays all day, doesn&#x27;t crease, doesn&#x27;t move, opens up my eyes and face. It&#x27;s just amazing. I didn&#x27;t think a concealer could replace my Maybelline Fit Me but this one takes the cake hands down. I will repurchase again and again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many concealers and this is without a doubt, the best one yet.  It is smooth, creamy, yet hides the imperfections under my eyes.  I am very happy with this product. You should try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many high end and drug store brands to mask my pretty bad dark under-eye circles. Nars Radiant is the best so far. I apply a dab or two under each eye and blend it just above the hollow only using a soft smokey eyeshadow brush. It does not settle into fine lines like ALL other concealers I have tried (unless you use too much of course), and it leaves a radiant finish that looks like real skin because it is dewy and not matte which also helps reflect light away from this area. I do not set it with a powder so that it doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s radiant finish, I sometimes use a setting spray over it, but it lasts a good 6-8 hours without touch-up without the spray anyway. It is medium coverage, and while I would prefer full coverage, this is better than having cake-y dry fine lines from a full coverage concealer.</li>
    <li> I bought this due to all the raves. It really does not go into fine lines, but the coverage is medium. Shiseido&#x27;s concealer (the comes in a tube) has better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;The color too yellow for me, although I chose one with pink undertones. Maybe I should try it UNDER foundation, and then I wouldn&#x27;t mind...</li>
    <li> I just bought a huge amount of NARS at a big event because the company was claiming to be 100% gluten free, testing to be sure, safe for celiacs. Now, a week later the NARS corporate position has flip flipped, which explains why I&#x27;ve been so sick, tired, and even spent a day with a horrifying migraine...and I couldn&#x27;t figure out how I could be getting glutened when I was so careful. I didn&#x27;t just believe the blogger hype - I read everything I could find on your line and then talked extensively to three of your makeup reps (who all insisted that your line is 100% safe for celiacs) before committing. Gluten free is not a fad. Your company&#x27;s policy flip flop made me and many other people literally sick. Would you allow a teeny bit fo nuts into a product, then market it to people with a nut allergy because you don&#x27;t use nut ingredients?</li>
    <li> I love this concealer.. Lasted a long time</li>
    <li> YOu will be radiant….I promise</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of a YouTube Beauty Guru (can&#x27;t remember which one)and I would say it is about average at covering dark circles under the eyes.  It seems to be okay for light to medium dark circles, but it&#x27;s not effective on really dark circles. Being a NARS product, it was a little pricey ~ I have found drug store products that work just as good or better.</li>
    <li> Solid under eye concealer, creamy, does not results in creases, long lasting, nice to use on other blemishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product thank you.</li>
    <li> Wonderful concealer that provides a great coverage and lasts a good while. I have repurchased in other shades for highlighting and contouring.</li>
    <li> This is exactly as pictured. Amazing product for covering dark circles. Sephora has been competely sold out of this shade since right after this product was released so I was super excited to find it here for the exact same price. The color is perfect for my fair to light skin with neutral undertones. Not too pink and not too yellow.</li>
    <li> Love the coverage, texture, and wear. I usually apply some concealer with the wand, lightly blend in a tapping motion with my fingers, and then smooth the edges with my beauty blender. The best concealer!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, it was not creamy, it was very dry maybe it has been around a long time, it caked while I was applying, I lost my money&lt;br /&gt;will stay away from NARS  Nena</li>
    <li> I have fair skin. I had been using Amazing Concealer brand for years, but I like this better. It&#x27;s light on the skin without any caking, and it covers up any under eye darkness more effectively than Amazing Concealer.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. It&#x27;s the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of high quality concealer brands - in fact, it&#x27;s one of the only makeup items I splurge on!  This is one of my favorites that I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The coverage is medium; enough to highlight and get rid of dark circles, but not so strong that you look really made-up.  If you wanted a stronger coverage, you could just layer the product which it does nicely.&lt;br /&gt;- The creasing is minimal.  While it does still crease a tiny bit, it is MUCH better than many other concealers I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;- The color is bright and the pink undertones really do a good job of highlighting.&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way...this tube will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;- Works perfect for highlighting and contouring if you use it lightly and blend.</li>
