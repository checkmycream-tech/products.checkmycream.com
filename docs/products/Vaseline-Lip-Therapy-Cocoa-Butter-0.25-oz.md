      <li>As soon as it&#x27;s on it feels better than the stick!  </li>
      <li>I love too that they put this Vaseline lip therapy, cocoa butter flavor (yum!)</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love this product!</li>
      <li>So I tried it, and found that I liked it as well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells nice and the taste lingers a while</li>
      <li>I did not find it effective for my needs.</li>
      <li>One downside is that you need to get this on your finger to apply it, meaning you need a tissue or something handy to wipe your finger on when you are done.  </li>
      <li>Great way to update the staple Vaseline and make it even more appealing.</li>
      <li>What I especially liked about this product was the ease with which it went on your lips, very smooth and consistent.  </li>
      <li>My nurses recommended good ol&#x27; Vaseline Petroleum Jelly as the best treatment for chapped lips, especially for those as chapped as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Vaseline Lip Therapy comes in a cute \\&quot;mini\\&quot; plastic container which closes with a nice \\&quot;click!\\</li>
      <li>It really helps soothe and protect my lips and tastes good too!</li>
      <li>love love the product.</li>
      <li>You have done such a wonderful thing by making this product.</li>
      <li>A lip balm stick seems better for me.</li>
      <li>It protects better, allowing the lip to heal, and lasts longer.  </li>
      <li>I love this lip butter.</li>
      <li>...wish they had more</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I love the cocoa butter smell.</li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m glad i did.</li>
      <li>and I love teeny containers of stuff...</li>
      <li>OK.  </li>
      <li>You could save money by sipping motor oil, I suppose, and it would be about as healthy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m financially satisfied</li>
      <li>Well, ok, who cares about rabbits, anyway.  </li>
      <li>so-so product in a tasty flavor and more convenient packaging</li>
      <li>I think for me it will be most useful to use overnight to moisturize since it seems to have good staying</li>
      <li>Even so, how this lip therapy is better than any $0.99 chapstick, I have no idea.</li>
      <li>, I love this!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>So trying this cocoa butter Lip Therapy in a pot seemed like a sure thing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super cute!  </li>
      <li>and it is notable at how strong the smell is with the cocoa butter making it smell like a tanning salon.  </li>
      <li>I also love the size easy to put in my purse to carry with me.</li>
      <li>Vaseline remains one of the best items out there when you have dry, cracked lips.</li>
      <li>The mini-Vaseline container is cute for gimmick&#x27;s sake, but it&#x27;s not as functional or as easy to dispense as a reliable stick or tube, and those sticks and tubes fit into the side pocket of my purse better than this</li>
      <li>other than that this is a great product and is so good for your lips</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily portable and will fit well in a purse or pocket.</li>
      <li>Vaseline Lip Therapy is another fine product.</li>
      <li>(a tissue is more than adequate.</li>
      <li>Once I tried it, I became a huge fan.</li>
      <li>The scent is a light cocoa.</li>
      <li>the lid is surprisingly secure.</li>
      <li>Since I&#x27;d rather have a great product in a tube or larger jar, than</li>
      <li>This might be important for some.</li>
      <li>My lips stay moist and crack free.</li>
      <li>and it stays germ free.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great thing if you use it a lot or have a big family!</li>
      <li>Ok, everybody likes things that come in miniature right?</li>
      <li>Originally, that is why I bought this stuff.</li>
      <li>Like many people have said, it is pretty sticky (and seems to get stickier with time)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok but seems pretty waxy.  </li>
      <li>this product has such a nice scent to it but besides that it works wonders for your lips!</li>
      <li>Or my clean hands greasy.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t notice any special medication in the ingredients (unless cocoa butter has a medicinal effect)</li>
      <li>but none have worked even when I put in full time effort to keep my lips covered.</li>
      <li>Really smooths and soothes the lips, smells totally awesome, and the small size makes it easy to carry around.  </li>
      <li>The container is a super mini version of a tub of Vaseline.</li>
      <li>Hopefully Vaseline will find a way to put cocoa butter into their original formula and still keep the nice consistency and then package it in tiny jars.  </li>
      <li>I took it with me on vacation to Las Vegas a month ago when it was still very hot</li>
      <li>I can live with, but $23.92 is way over the top.</li>
      <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite lip balm, the cocoa butter leaves her lips feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>The container is the perfect size, it opens well with a tiny little tab on the lid, and it&#x27;s easy to get a finger in there to get some product.</li>
      <li>The cocoa butter smell is appealing, and it does make your lips feel soft and moisturized.</li>
      <li>and I love the subtle pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It works just as well, and the cocoa butter does not create a flavor worth paying for.&lt;br</li>
      <li>anything you put on your skin will be absorbed into the bloodstream.  </li>
      <li>I liked the tiny jar as it fit very well into my make-up bag or a pocket and the taste was good and chocolatey, but I&#x27;m only giving this new product 3 stars.  </li>
      <li>This packaging is adorable and it sits on my desk within easy reach when I need relief for dry chapped lips.</li>
      <li>It not only moisturizes your lips, but, quickly makes them feel better.</li>
      <li>If your skin is dry, you could heat beeswax to liquid, and mix in olive oil, to get a nice cream, that isn&#x27;t toxic.  </li>
      <li>makes my lips very soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>More importantly, I live in the desert so am always on the lookout for new moisturizing products for my lips and skin.</li>
      <li>(7g), which is more than your standard stick lip balm.</li>
      <li>so they stay soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>But the Vaseline Lip Therapy actually works much better than the Chap Stick</li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product, especially for bedside use.</li>
      <li>The modern American home has more toxic chemicals in it than a chemistry lab in 1900.  </li>
      <li>As mentioned in the title, the little mini-Vaseline jar this comes in is very cute.</li>
      <li>There are two drawbacks: First, applying goop with a finger can contaminate the jar, so use clean hands or a fresh cotton swab, and don&#x27;t double dip.  </li>
      <li>I am glad I got a one-count sample from Vine, because I can&#x27;t imagine how long it would take me to go through eight of these...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Originally bought this product at a local drug store, but it must have been a promo because it disappeared. I searched, found it on Amazon .  It really helps soothe and protect my lips and tastes good too!</li>
    <li> If you like Vaseline, you&#x27;ll probably like this product, as it&#x27;s simply Vaseline with cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night to protect my lips, and it really does seem to soften them overnight. After trying it a few times, I&#x27;ve decided not to wear it during the day--it feels a bit stickier and thicker on my lips than I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is very cute--it&#x27;s a mini Vaseline container. It&#x27;s easily portable and will fit well in a purse or pocket. The only drawback is that it lacks the simplicity of a stick lip balm--you will probably get some under your fingernail when applying, so if that&#x27;s something that bothers you, this probably isn&#x27;t your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product, and it has become my go-to night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I tried the Vaseline Lip Therapy Cocoo Butter,0.25oz for two reasons.  The taste of cocoa butter intrigued me and I wanted to try the tiny jar, since I already use the regular Vaseline Lip Therapy in the tube.  I liked the tiny jar as it fit very well into my make-up bag or a pocket and the taste was good and chocolatey, but I&#x27;m only giving this new product 3 stars.  Sadly, the Cocoa Butter Vasline Lip Therapy is not as soft and spreadable as either the regular Vaseline Lip Therapy in the tube, or regular Vaseline in the larger size jars.  The consistency of the Cocoa Butter Vaseline Lip Therapy was stiff and not very pliant, which made the \\&quot;goo\\&quot; difficult to spread onto my lips and it didn&#x27;t sink in very well, either.  Since I&#x27;d rather have a great product in a tube or larger jar, than&lt;br /&gt;a so-so product in a tasty flavor and more convenient packaging, I&#x27;m sticking with the \\&quot;original\\&quot; Vaseline.  Hopefully Vaseline will find a way to put cocoa butter into their original formula and still keep the nice consistency and then package it in tiny jars.  I&#x27;ll try again, then!</li>
    <li> I already have been using Vaseline Lip Therapy Advanced Formula in the tube for a long time.  It took my dry, cracked lips and made them soft again.  So trying this cocoa butter Lip Therapy in a pot seemed like a sure thing.  It&#x27;s ok but seems pretty waxy.  I use it before bed and put it on with a brush.  I don&#x27;t like dipping my finger into pots like this.  I probably will keep buy Vaseline--just the tube variety instead of this one.</li>
    <li> I have some chronic chapped lips so I am constantly applying Chap Stick during the wintertime.  When it comes to chapped lips I usually use Chap Stick because it comes in stick form making it easy to apply.  This is actually the first non-Chap-Stick lip therapy I have ever used.  Opening up the tub and it is notable at how strong the smell is with the cocoa butter making it smell like a tanning salon.  As expected, applying the Vaseline by finger is a little sticky and even after I wipe my finger off; the finger still feels a little greasy.  But the Vaseline Lip Therapy actually works much better than the Chap Stick I have been using all my life.  It even works for longer.  It does claim that it will give you glowing lips, but I did not notice any difference (and since I am a guy, I really do not care), but it does do exactly what I want it to.  I just wish it would do it without the greasy residue on my finger.</li>
    <li> I have this and he rosy lips version and my favorite thing about them is the wonderful scent.  When I put it on I can smell the cocoa butter, but not overwhelmingly.  Two of the stars are for this cent, the third star is for the packaging.  I like the cute little jars this comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is much too sticky for me. My finger ends up sticky and I get annoyed that my lips stick together.  I think for me it will be most useful to use overnight to moisturize since it seems to have good staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad product, but it is not smooth like regular Tube of Chapstick type lip stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this elsewhere, so this review has nothing to do with this specific distributor.</li>
    <li> love love the product. ordered bulk for a reason. dislike the shipper.  ordered and 8 count, received only ONE! very unhappy</li>
    <li> the package is so cute and mini and the chapstick is perfect the smell is coconut tropically and this is the only chapstick that works on my lips i swear by it</li>
    <li> This came in a sealed perforated box with a tray.  However, there were only 7-Count not 8 as advertised.  The tray was designed to hold 8, bad quality control from manufacture.</li>
    <li> Ok, everybody likes things that come in miniature right? I know I do! Originally, that is why I bought this stuff. Once I tried it, I became a huge fan. It isn&#x27;t nearly a thick as I thought it would be, and it leaves your lips amazingly soft without any oily residue. My one complaint is that the lid on the container pops off quite easily, making it unsuitable to go in your pocket or loose in a purse. It can make quite a mess if you mistakenly let it loose in a purse and the top gets jostled off. Otherwise, I love this product!</li>
    <li> I wear a CPAP with a full face mask at night, and my lips sometimes get dry and uncomfortable.  I put this stuff on in an extra thick layer, and my lips stay soft all night long.  During the day, it can be used sparsely to lock in moisture without a leaving behind a heavy residue.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product&#x27;s versatility and performance. There are two drawbacks: First, applying goop with a finger can contaminate the jar, so use clean hands or a fresh cotton swab, and don&#x27;t double dip.  Secondly, excess product will remain on your finger, so you&#x27;ll need to deal with that (a tissue is more than adequate.</li>
    <li> The product works as advertised and does seem to reduce lip dryness over time.  I needed a tissue when applying since the product is somewhat sticky as one would expect.  I am more likely to carry a lipstick shaped chap stick in my purse -- easier to apply when on the move -- but overall this seems like a useful product, especially for those who live very cold or windy climates.</li>
    <li> Tiny amount for such a large price. Product is thick and I just do not like it. I did not find it effective for my needs.</li>
    <li> The container is a super mini version of a tub of Vaseline. Very cute and the lid is surprisingly secure. The product itself is very moisturizing. The scent is a light cocoa. Long lasting moisturizer without being greasy like regular Vaseline. Can be used alone as a gloss or with a lip liner to add color.</li>
    <li> This is a very small container of lip balm. It feels like a slightly thicker version of classic Vaseline.  Seems to do the job of relieving chapped lips without objectionable flavor or feel.</li>
    <li> The packaging is new and different, a tiny pot that has a very tight sealing lid, with the disadvantage of having to stick your finger in to apply the balm. Which then has the side effect of moisturizing fingernail beds!&lt;br /&gt;Other than the pot itself there is nothing new or exciting about this lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and the taste lingers a while but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize any better than other lip therapy, infact I&#x27;ve used others that do moisturize better.&lt;br /&gt;If you only need a product like this for occassional use it&#x27;s fine, if you have issues with chronic dry lips I would not recommend this balm.</li>
    <li> Vaseline Lip Therapy comes in a cute \\&quot;mini\\&quot; plastic container which closes with a nice \\&quot;click!\\&quot; It has a net weight of .25 oz. (7g), which is more than your standard stick lip balm. The balm has a thick Vaseline texture which goes on smoothly and with a scent which reminds me of a milder version of Carmex. My usual choice of lip balm is the stick form because I don&#x27;t like using my finger as an applicator. This might be important for some. Overall it&#x27;s a good product, especially for bedside use.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and feels good, and is easy to apply. Use daily if you have dry lips, or use just to feel moist. Great product, compact for travel too.</li>
    <li> What I especially liked about this product was the ease with which it went on your lips, very smooth and consistent.  Had a nice, subtle aroma as well.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> I am assuming that the cost of this product applies to a set of 8, rather than one tiny container I got for this Vine review, because $2.99 per 0.25 oz I can live with, but $23.92 is way over the top. Even so, how this lip therapy is better than any $0.99 chapstick, I have no idea. Like many people have said, it is pretty sticky (and seems to get stickier with time), it has a nice smell (not taste though) and it has an unsanitary and inconvenient package (you have to put your finger into the mini-tub). Can&#x27;t say I would buy it.</li>
    <li> This tiny version of the Vaseline tub is very portable and easily fits in a pocket or handbag. The cocoa butter smell is appealing, and it does make your lips feel soft and moisturized. My only complaint is that the tub is just big enough to put your fingertip in to scoop out the product, and it always gets stuck in my nails-- not very pleasant. However, my teenage son really likes this product as it fits easily in his pocket and doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;girly.\\&quot; He has very short nails and doesn&#x27;t have the same problem I do dispensing the product. I would buy this product again, but in the lip balm version for myself.</li>
    <li> When I got this, I had been having dry, peeling, chapped lips for about six months. This was the product of intensive chemotherapy, radiation, and a bone marrow transplant. I have tried all sorts of products to fight that over that time. My nurses recommended good ol&#x27; Vaseline Petroleum Jelly as the best treatment for chapped lips, especially for those as chapped as mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works, but it&#x27;s just petroleum jelly flavored (or enhanced or whatever you want to call it) with cocoa butter. It&#x27;s going to be a lot more expensive in quantities of a quarter-ounce. I&#x27;d recommend skipping the cocoa butter \\&quot;Lip Therapy\\&quot; produce and just buying an inexpensive and much larger container of Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (or a store brand). It works just as well, and the cocoa butter does not create a flavor worth paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a couple of treatments that come out in lipstick form that work as well or almost as well as petroleum jelly, but this review isn&#x27;t about those. Petroleum jelly works as well as anything, so this product works great. It&#x27;s just that you ought to just go buy petroleum jelly alone because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s sticky and less useful than a tube because your finger also gets sticky (hint: all chapstick is sticky, we just normally don&#x27;t notice because it&#x27;s in tubes), but this stuff works wonders.  Last year, my lips got irritated with every chapstick except for my very basic Burt&#x27;s Bees and the plain cherry stuff.  This year, around the same time, even those products began to irritate me.  The plain vaseline didn&#x27;t exacerbate the irritation, but it didn&#x27;t help heal, so I bought this on a whim after reading some boards where participants mentioned that cocoa butter can help with irritated lips - and it works!  I would rate this a 4, except that it is literally the only chapstick that works for me right now, so that easily trumps any other chapstick, even tubed ones, in my book. However, if they made this in a tube, you wouldn&#x27;t catch me complaining.</li>
    <li> The description clearly says 8 count.  I only received one.  The product is exactly as described and exactly what I wanted.  But I wanted all 8 tiny cute little jars of Vaseline.  Hoping Amazon will send the other seven. . . to be continued.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Amazon customer service confirmed the discrepancy of 8 count listed vs only one delivered.  They said the listing of \\&quot;8 count\\&quot; would be changed and that only one tiny jar was the intended quantitiy.  So I paid ~$11 for one tiny jar.  Beware.  They did \\&quot;fix\\&quot; the problem with a promise to correct the online description and gave me a credit for future purchases.  I&#x27;m financially satisfied but I still only have one timy bottle and won&#x27;t buy another for ~$11.00.</li>
    <li> I feel almost bad about this, because I don&#x27;t really have anything critical to say about the product. It&#x27;s Vaseline, and it works like Vaseline. I prefer lip therapy products that absorb a little better, but it is what it is and it does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. My lips felt softer after using and it definitely protects against windy days near salt water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My problem is the container. I found the top difficult to get on and off and the size and shape of the container a challenge for the size of my fingers (which I didn&#x27;t think were particularly large until I tried to get this product out and onto my lips). The mini-Vaseline container is cute for gimmick&#x27;s sake, but it&#x27;s not as functional or as easy to dispense as a reliable stick or tube, and those sticks and tubes fit into the side pocket of my purse better than this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is fine, but until the container is easier to deal with, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my other products.</li>
    <li> Vaseline lip therapy is awesome!  I love too that they put this Vaseline lip therapy, cocoa butter flavor (yum!) in a little tub just like the big Vaseline.  It&#x27;s super cute!  The top comes over reasonably easily though, so is not great for the purse (mine would come off when kept in there), but this little Vaseline lip therapy tub is PERFECT for putting right next to the bed, on a bedside table, for use during the upcoming winter: definitely recommend the Vaseline cocoa butter lip therapy!</li>
    <li> I replaced my use of Chapstick with this based on what I saw on the show The Doctors about using petroleum jelly instead of Chapstick...I love this ...wish they had more</li>
    <li> The description clearly says 8-count. However, I only received one item. This .25 ounce jar is what I expected; however, the quantity of 1 instead of 8 is unacceptable.  I would not pay this price for one (.25 ounce) of Vaseline Lip Therapy, Cocoa Butter.</li>
    <li> I love this lip butter. makes my lips very soft and smooth. I also love the size easy to put in my purse to carry with me.</li>
    <li> I had been experiencing problems with chapped lips lasting for months on end for years. So far I have tried over 30+ different chapsticks and lips balms but none have worked even when I put in full time effort to keep my lips covered. One night my friend came over and gave me this... she said to put a extra amount on before I sleep and to keep my lips covered with it during the day. Ever since then I have had no problems with chapped lips. Thank you Vaseline! You have done such a wonderful thing by making this product. My chapped lips used to get so bad from me biting them that I had large cuts and in one night this product almost fixed at, by the second day it was no longer a problem. My lips stay moist and crack free.</li>
    <li> I guess these are travel-sized, but I wish they were larger containers with screw-on caps, or sticks. It&#x27;s a decent product, keeps lips moist for a couple of hours.  But I need something that is not going to lose its cap in my hiking backpack.  It would be best in stick form - with what we know about our own germy hands, and the many bacteria we acquire throughout the day, I do not cherish the idea of placing my finger into the tiny plastic jar and then applying it on my lips.  (I have long nails, so the product annoyingly gets caught underneath my fingernails.)  Also not thrilled with the cocoa butter flavor - it becomes rather \\&quot;mouthy\\&quot; after a bit.</li>
    <li> I normally use Chapstick, but, I thought I would try this product. It not only moisturizes your lips, but, quickly makes them feel better. The one thing I was not sure about was using my finger to apply it, but, as long as your finger is clean, that&#x27;s no problem. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This packaging is adorable and it sits on my desk within easy reach when I need relief for dry chapped lips. Made with pure petroleum jelly and rich cocoa butter it softens and sinks in to give your lips the moisture they crave and I love the subtle pleasant scent. Great way to update the staple Vaseline and make it even more appealing.</li>
    <li> Winter is harsh on my lips. I usually use some sort of chapstick-like lib balm with mild success.  Then I tried \\&quot;Vaseline Lip Therapy, Cocoa Butter\\&quot;  Whoa!  As soon as it&#x27;s on it feels better than the stick!  It protects better, allowing the lip to heal, and lasts longer.  And there&#x27;s a pleasant cocoaish taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice any special medication in the ingredients (unless cocoa butter has a medicinal effect) so it could be that I should have been smearing vaseline on my lips during winter all along.  Whatever.  This works and I was happy to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price seems high - note that you can get by with a TINY application.  You don&#x27;t have to stick half the jar on your finger.</li>
    <li> I remember my grandmother using Vaseline for one remedy or another when I was a child. It&#x27;s just one of those products that you should have around the house just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vaseline Lip Therapy is another fine product. The container is small enough to fit in a pocket or purse and is very inexpensive compared to some of the other \\&quot;designer\\&quot; lip balms on the shelves now. The product works great; much better than chapstick, IMO. It has a very pleasant scent and does not feel \\&quot;waxy\\&quot;. It also provides a glossy look to your lips. I recommend that you put away your stick and give this a try. You will be pleasantly surprised by this product of the Vaseline family.</li>
    <li> Really smooths and soothes the lips, smells totally awesome, and the small size makes it easy to carry around.  Your 13 year old won&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually one for lip balms, so I gave this item to my partner, and his exact words were \\&quot;Ummmm, I love this!\\&quot; So I tried it, and found that I liked it as well. And it works very well to soothe dry lips. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Vaseline remains one of the best items out there when you have dry, cracked lips. Since we&#x27;re heading into the season where that&#x27;s common, it&#x27;s good to be on the lookout for something that works. I&#x27;m not going to write paragraphs on this one. It works. The cocoa butter scent isn&#x27;t obnoxious either (unlike some lotions). If you have cold sores or whatever, this should do the job.</li>
    <li> I have always used Vaseline as lip backup. Now they have put it into a tiny container, added a heavenly scent and made it thicker.  Its just what you would expect from Vaseline. My kids love the little container and it always seems to disappear from my purse.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in the title, the little mini-Vaseline jar this comes in is very cute. More importantly, I live in the desert so am always on the lookout for new moisturizing products for my lips and skin. This Vaseline has a nice, light scent that is very pleasant and keeps my lips moist without leaving them shiny. Because of this, my son actually uses it too - quite a feat since usually he refuses to use lip moisturizers. I gave him my jar and bought myself another. Since I sleep with a fan on, when I wake up in the morning my mouth is usually very dry. I used this before bed and my lips were noticeably less dry than usual.</li>
    <li> Petrolatum is an ingredient.  This stuff goes on your lips.  OK.  I have to wonder how many rabbits spent months screaming, as this stuff was dropped into their eyes, to test it for safety.  Well, ok, who cares about rabbits, anyway.  This stuff is not for lubricating cars.  This stuff is apparently designed to be put on your, check this out, lips.  50% of lipstick is swallowed, as it is, and... anything you put on your skin will be absorbed into the bloodstream.  Cancer involves liver breakdown, due to overload of fat soluble toxins.  This product just adds to the toxins in your body.  If you need a moisturizer, there is one thing that works well: water.  Water moisturizes.  If your skin is dry, you could heat beeswax to liquid, and mix in olive oil, to get a nice cream, that isn&#x27;t toxic.  Apply it after a shower, and you hold the water in.  The modern American home has more toxic chemicals in it than a chemistry lab in 1900.  Maybe that&#x27;s why 1 in 25 Americans got cancer, in 1900, and over 1 in 3 get it now.  D&#x27;ya think?  If you want to be healthy, it starts with not doing what makes you unhealthy.  You could save money by sipping motor oil, I suppose, and it would be about as healthy.</li>
    <li> Love the cocoa butter scent in this lip therapy! The product works really well, hydrating and lasting a long time. I&#x27;ve been using this little container of lip therapy for a month and it&#x27;s only 1/3rd empty. I took it with me on vacation to Las Vegas a month ago when it was still very hot and I was a little dehydrated, and I only had to use it once a day plus again after showering or washing my face. My husband is always grabbing it out of my purse. The container is the perfect size, it opens well with a tiny little tab on the lid, and it&#x27;s easy to get a finger in there to get some product. Really, if you look at it in the store it looks clumsy, but it&#x27;s not. This is definitely a product I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Vaseline and I love teeny containers of stuff...so this was bound to be a hit. It&#x27;s the perfect size for your purse or nightstand. The scent is very subtle and not greasy feeling. You don&#x27;t need much to cover your lips, so even this tiny container will last a long time. I am glad I got a one-count sample from Vine, because I can&#x27;t imagine how long it would take me to go through eight of these...but it&#x27;s a great thing if you use it a lot or have a big family!</li>
    <li> I work outside every day and when it turned windy and cold I appreciated the Vaseline Lip Therapy.  My lips got so chapped they hurt when I brushed my teeth.  Now, throughout the day, I dab my little finger in the Vaseline and put it on my lips so they stay soft and smooth.  The faint scent of cocoa butter is nice, too.  I will buy Vaseline Lip Therapy, Cocoa Butter for myself and my family.</li>
    <li> great product..fast shipping</li>
    <li> This Vaseline Lip Therapy is moisturizes your lips. This is my wife&#x27;s favorite lip balm, the cocoa butter leaves her lips feeling very soft. She also loves the container because she can put it on our son&#x27;s lips and her lips and it stays germ free.</li>
    <li> This is a nice alternative to chapstick style limp balms. The compact container is convenient.  It seems to work as well, and seems to last longer than other lip balms I have used.  One downside is that you need to get this on your finger to apply it, meaning you need a tissue or something handy to wipe your finger on when you are done.  In this regard, it is a little less convenient than tube-style applicators.</li>
    <li> I love the cocoa butter smell. It&#x27;s subtle, but nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be shocking to see just how small the container is, since we&#x27;re all used to seeing large Vaseline containers. This feels like a baby. But it makes sense, since you&#x27;re just using it for your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that I prefer not getting my dirty fingers involved in my lips. Or my clean hands greasy. A lip balm stick seems better for me.</li>
    <li> ever since i hit my teens i&#x27;ve had an obsession with chapsticks, lip balms, you name it. i recently came across this product in cvs and i&#x27;m glad i did. this product has such a nice scent to it but besides that it works wonders for your lips! its not too chalky like some of the other balms which is a plus but it is a little greasy on your fingers after applying to your lips. other than that this is a great product and is so good for your lips</li>
