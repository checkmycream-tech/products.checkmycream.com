<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This tool was great in helping me get the thick hardened plaque buildup off my dogs teeth. It takes effort though!</li>
    <li> This actually  works,  its a little thicker than I expected but it does its job!</li>
    <li> it sort of works... I am just afraid of hitting the gums.  Not to bad..and great price.  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charlie-the-chihuahua-CGC-DSA-TT/411435205668991?ref&#x3D;hl</li>
    <li> It is just fine. Nothing more to say.</li>
    <li> Works great for cleaning the tarter off of my dogs teeth.  Easy to use, easy to clean, and made of solid construction.</li>
    <li> I actually use this tool to clean grease and grit from under my fingernails.  Perfect for this since the tool has a right hand and left hand slanted edge.  My husband has used one of these for years.  He said it was the best thing ever for clean up after working on old motors.</li>
    <li> I was worried about quality when purchasing items like this online. No need to worry, quality was wonderful. Was able to remove heavy buildup.</li>
    <li> This tool works pretty good. It takes a little work, and my dog is very helpful by remaining still. I didn&#x27;t get all the tartar off on the first try, it&#x27;ll take a few times to get all the plaque off. Still better than spending big $$$ at the vet.</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for sculpting clay or clean hard to reach areas in the house or on tools. I was looking for a tiny but sturdy way to clean out the patio door grooves (where the wheels slide) this is the tool. The item was delivered fast-which is fantastic as I like things yesterday. The vender Military South did an excellent job and replied right away to concerns and questions. I would use them again.</li>
    <li> A professional tool shipped and received as advertised.  The use of this tool has saved&lt;br /&gt;hundreds in vet dental care cost.  The trips to the vet have been also greatly reduced.&lt;br /&gt;100% pleased with the tool ordered, service received and results obtained.</li>
    <li> Not recommend for small dogs. My toy poodle doesn&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too big</li>
    <li> This plaque scraper worked perfectly. My teeth now have that professional dental cleaning feel!</li>
    <li> seems to be well made.</li>
    <li> Strong and reasonably priced but the tip seems too thick.  Scraper from CVS worked better but broke plastic handle.</li>
    <li> This little baby works great.  I have Italian greyhounds and the downfall of the&lt;br /&gt;Breed is bad teeth.  This scraper works wonders to get the plaque off their teeth&lt;br /&gt;In between vet visits. The cupped and angled tips are the right design for the job.&lt;br /&gt;Best thing I have found to date.</li>
    <li> With the help of a calm, patient dog, I have begun to remvoe the thick tarter on his teeth with this tool. It does a great job.... just be cautious of the gumline.</li>
    <li> It did the job , thanks</li>
    <li> The blades are flat and large, so cannot get into small crevices, which is what I purchased the tool for. It is good for generally cleaning tartar off the larger surfaces and around the gum line.</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product and try to scale your dog&#x27;s teeth unless you are a trained canine dental tech!  As a former (human) dental tech, I know the damage that you can cause in a mouth that is COOPERATIVE, let alone a wriggling DOG! You can get your dogs&#x27; teeth professionally cleaned, by trained techs, without anesthesia, for around $100 at various vet offices and pet supply stores. Call around, especially to holistic vets, or Google \\&quot;gentle dental\\&quot; or \\&quot;anesthesia free dog tooth cleaning.\\&quot;  You wouldn&#x27;t buy a \\&quot;Neuter Your Dog at Home\\&quot; kit. Please don&#x27;t take a chance on hurting your poor doggies, maybe causing bleeding, infection, broken teeth, pain, fear, and goodness knows what else.</li>
    <li> great for scraping lead of my revolver.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - well crafted.  It also shipped much soon than I expected</li>
    <li> This is not what I expected when I bought it. I thought it was a pointy probe that would fit between the teeth. Instead, it is more like a flat screwdriver that is sharper for scraping flat surfaces. Either I made a mistake and didn&#x27;t realize what I was getting or the picture didn&#x27;t depict it properly. I&#x27;ll keep it and just reorder another probe someday.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to use, does not work well. Takes a very long time to actually scrape any plaque off my dog&#x27;s teeth, would be better if it were pointed with a hook.</li>
    <li> Does as advertised.  Cleans our dogs teeth very well.  Sturdy tool that has held up well for the past 6 months or so.</li>
    <li> Works great, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have a 9 pound Papillon and the double end is not necessary for such a small dog. It was hard to see how large each end was so I went with double ended just in case. But one end is much too large to use and the small end isn&#x27;t exactly \\&quot;small\\&quot;. Any smaller would probably risk injuring the dog, however. It works well with a patient dog (or in short doses each day).</li>
    <li> Awesome company, awesome product</li>
    <li> Works great to get pieces of tartar off of your pets teeth. My cat has only 2 teeth that get tartar and I hate having to bring him to the vet to be sedated just to get a dental done! Love it!</li>
    <li> Amazed how It does clean tartar and plaque</li>
    <li> Bulky and hard to use. The blades are large and I didn&#x27;t find them particularly easy to use.</li>
    <li> Had been using a natural dental cleaner from PetZ that works great!  Just a little impatient so I went on you tube and found out about these and how to to your dogs teeth yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked great!!!  be patient and gentle and wow, both my Great Danes teeth look like they just came from vet and no anesthsia which is always hard on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can just stay on top of brushing with the Petz</li>
    <li> This tool fit my specific needs; was priced right; and was not available at any of the local &amp;#34;brick &amp; mortar&amp;#34; sources.</li>
    <li> Seems to be everything that was stated in the description.  I&#x27;ve only used a few times in the past week, but I do see a difference, though one tooth will need extra care.</li>
    <li> Works great to get tarter off dogs teeth...</li>
    <li> This tool is as advertised.  There isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.  It is good quality and works well for the purpose I bought it for.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be too shape but it is actually a blunt end and I am not getting to the tarter the way I would think I would have been able to do. I am starting at the gum and going in a downward motion but it is not taking anything off the teeth and I can feel it with my nails. I think my nails do a better job. I just think the scaper would be a healthier way than using my nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using human tartar scraper that you often see in dentist&#x27;s office to clean my dog and cats&#x27; teeth for years since they were puppy/kittens. It&#x27;s significantly tougher to clean more defiant cats&#x27; teeth but it helps to use a large towel to wrap the cats in a burrito fashion and strap the cat burrito with an adjustable belt (OK PETA, I don&#x27;t need a call). If you&#x27;re squeamish or lack the dexterity to do this, you&#x27;ll need to spend hundreds a year to keep your pets healthy through regular vet visits, and be under the expense and mercy of anesthesia&#x27;s side effects. I&#x27;ve just tried this new tartar scraper that doesn&#x27;t look like a captain&#x27;s hook, and I noticed that it allows for a safer scraping angle and it&#x27;s much easier to use than a hook shaped scraper with a pointy end. Healthy gums won&#x27;t bleed as much and the pets won&#x27;t flinch dangerously if the gums are not painfully inflamed from accumulated tartar, so I end up semi-torturing my beloved pets pretty often with the towel burritos for their sake. They get to keep their healthy teeth longer (along with overall systemic health) and I get to enjoy their fresh breath and avoid vet expense and unnecessary risks.</li>
    <li> not what i expected. disappointed</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the sharp/pointy type of scraper for human teeth, but it&#x27;s not - I found out after purchasing that it&#x27;s actually for DOGS, not PEOPLE! There was no mention of that fact in the page title, but I did notice later that it says canine in the details. Not sure why Amazon categorized it as #2 in Health &amp; Personal Care &amp;#62; Personal Care &amp;#62; Oral Hygiene &amp;#62; Dental Picks instead of Pet Supplies...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t take off any stars for my personal mistake, but I DID give it only 4 after trying it out on our dog - it&#x27;s too large to get in between chihuahua teeth or into the grooves of molars, but works really well for chipping stuff away from the exposed front &amp; back. Just be careful not to whack the gums when you&#x27;re trying to work on &amp; hold onto a tiny dog in panic mode!</li>
    <li> great pick for servicing scuba gear.  Use it for removing O-rings.  Strong, not really bendable, which is good.</li>
    <li> Helps keep my teeth cleans</li>
    <li> love this. we bought to scrape our dogs back teeth, they had some build up... it got it all off.</li>
    <li> A bit too thick and too wide for me.</li>
    <li> Care and practice are required for good results. Practice on a hard flat surface like a piece of wood to learn correct angle to hold tool for maximum cleaning ability. Be extra careful not to cut your pets gums. If your pet allows you to brush their teeth,chances are they will be ok with this tool as well.</li>
    <li> We wanted to improve our dental care for a 13 year old cairn terrier. It&#x27;s risky to use general anesthesia on a dog this old for teeth cleanings. So we brush daily and apply a topical tartar control. This new tool has already been useful in removing stubborn tartar. Our vet says his teeth are in extraordninary shape, and our pet has not had a cleaning under anethesia in four years. This tool performs exactly as we hoped it would.</li>
    <li> My 4-lb Maltese has terrible teeth. We brush her teeth every night now, but the plaque is still really thick and ugly. One night, my girlfriend held her down while I scraped her teeth. By using the squarish end, putting the edge just below her gumline, and pulling down, I was able to chip off huge chunks of plaque, revealing white teeth underneath. On her molars, I chipped off a piece that was 3-5mm in diameter. Even on her front teeth, I was able to chip off some of the gross dark colored stuff. It took forever and I was not able to clean between teeth or in the creases in the middle of the molars, but it was pretty painless and didn&#x27;t draw any blood.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried this tool on my German Shepherd. I suspect this may not end well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to clean my 2 yr old- 35lb dog&#x27;s teeth.  The smaller side is the right size for her mouth... haven&#x27;t had any use for the larger one yet. It&#x27;s good for carefully scrapping extra tartar off on the occasion, but please be careful to get this professionally done if your dog&#x27;s teeth are in bad shape!  I&#x27;ve had no quality issues and am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a new scaler so from the pic online it looked curved, just what i have been searching for. It&#x27;s not curved,it&#x27;s angular. My dog&#x27;s molars are a good size, he&#x27;s a 79lb Greyhound, this tool is way too big and dull.There is a $5 processing fee if returned, so I kept it. It might be the right size for a much bigger dog, maybe a Mastiff or Irish Wolfhound</li>
    <li> Easily fits in my hand. The edges are sharp and strong. It doesn&#x27;t bend when I press it against my do teeth.</li>
    <li> Love it! Ralph has pearly whites now🐶</li>
    <li> I appreciated good delivery time of the product.  I have tried and and it was doing OK and will just use some skill.  I consider buying another product to help with the tartar problem also and will browse at the pet store.    Thanks for service of sending the product.  John Coffey</li>
    <li> Love this! use to get the tarter off the back of my front teeth!</li>
    <li> Use this about once a month and makes my teeth feel really clean and tarter free!</li>
    <li> Package was partially open -- not great quality but still useable.. just not for teeth. Maybe a cuticle pusher.</li>
    <li> Really works on my dogs teeth.</li>
    <li> As of this writing this item was not included with my coffee shipment, nor was there an invoice in the box received 14 April 2014.</li>
    <li> Strong and sharp, like it should be. It also came with a nifty sleeve to protect it or u, not sure which one.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> This, combined with some informative professional videos, saved me hundreds on dental cleanings for my two dogs. My dogs and I are happy!</li>
    <li> The dental scraper is just fine.</li>
    <li> Not so great for teeth though. and thats what I originally bought it for.</li>
    <li> This scraper is much too thick, wide and overall bulky to use in the average human mouth.  I have used others which worked much better.</li>
    <li> Good value and excellent quality.</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as described by Millers Forge. It comes in a vinyl pouch to protect it between uses. It is VERY sharp, so use caution when cleaning your dog&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> The best dental tool I ever owned; everyone should own one of these!</li>
    <li> This is made out of high quality metal. You do not have to use much force or pressure on your teeth to get rid of plaque or tartar. This is a great tool for oral hygiene that can be coupled with brushing and flossing.</li>
    <li> Use your Plax, brush regularly, floss and use this baby to scrape away the gunk! Allows you to get between the teeth</li>
    <li> It does what it is meant for.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dog.  Good quality but he wont really let me get in there so he may end up going for a dental at he vet anyway, nice scraper though.  It&#x27;s not going to get in between your teeth, only the large surfaces.</li>
    <li> This product works well but it is important to go very slowly in the direction away from the gum.  Have a moistened cosmetic wipe between the scraper and the exposed parts of the dog&#x27;s mouth so that it will slide into the wipe instead of the dog if you lose control.  I wipe off my dog&#x27;s teeth with the cosmetic wipe after I am done.  I do very little at a time and mainly use it to remove material softened by the water additive and gel.  My fingernails are too weak or they would be a better alternative.  This is a very sharp tool.  In time, food and water additives along with gel would remove tartar.  This just speeds it up.</li>
    <li> I used it on my Chihuahua rescue and she tolerated it very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2 other dogs that I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet.</li>
    <li> Reviews indicated that they were sharp I found them a little dull will have to dress the ends up on a stone to make work.</li>
    <li> Not the best for small dogs... Wish it was a bit thinner of a tip. It works on the big teeth though</li>
    <li> Appears to be exactly the same as my Vet uses.&lt;br /&gt;Both ends are the same.&lt;br /&gt;They are angled to scrape the tarter off and you pull it down on the tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Top of the scraper is designed such that it is not sharp. So...you&#x27;re able to gently push up the gum and get start the scrape just under the gum line, which is where the real problem usually will start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: You MUST have your dog trained so that they will let you do this. It&#x27;s important to start them as a puppy and MAKE them lie still while you examine teeth, paws, ears, etc. A daily routine of simply going thru the motions whether you do any &#x27;doctoring&#x27; or not is imperative. It&#x27;s makes it extremely easy when you do need to work on them. Even my vet is amazed at how well they let him dig, poke and prod when there&#x27;s a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this pick I&#x27;m usually good for about 2-3 teeth of serious scraping before they&#x27;ve had enough.&lt;br /&gt;Bu that&#x27;s enough that once you get them cleaned, maintenance is minimal.</li>
    <li> good quality, use at my animal sanctuary where I have 1300 animals of 22 species, including 600 cats and 50 dogs.  We&#x27;re able to do a good enough &amp;#34;dental&amp;#34; on many of the animals meaning that we are saving lots of money on vet bills !!</li>
    <li> fast shipping, great price, as advertised.</li>
    <li> What can I say?It does whaat it&#x27;s supposed to but nothing.exciting. Made well but nothing to write home about. Good price.</li>
    <li> This works very well on my teeth and is much higher quality than the plastic-handled one I used to use.  I deducted a star only because I prefer that the blade not be angled.  With the angle, you have to switch hands to move from one side of your mouth to the other.</li>
    <li> The product and service were just fine. I just ordered something I thought was different, but it was not the sellers fault.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful! Love using it to get the tartar from my hard to reach spots between my teeth!</li>
    <li> I was not sure that I would be able to find what I was looking for but to my surprise I did and my husband was very pleased. Thank You</li>
    <li> Works on my dog&#x27;s teeth after I got him to sit still long enough.</li>
    <li> Product came as promised and described, good value on the product.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it with success. Listing was accurate</li>
    <li> This tartar scraper has jagged edges and flat tips. not useable.</li>
    <li> good product for the money</li>
    <li> It is square on the ends not round and is hard to get between teeth. Great quality though.</li>
    <li> good tool for scraping...</li>
    <li> cuz the vet wants 600 to clean his teeth and i&#x27;m not paying that kind of money when my dog will let me do it my self it worked like a charm on the tartar on his teeth we sat for 7 hrs trying to get the tartar off his teeth cuz it was so caked on i&#x27;m well aware that not all dogs let their owners pick at their teeth but mine does cuz he trust me and if you have a dog like mine this is a decent replacement for vet cleaning and letting a stranger put your dog under anesthesia so complete strangers can clean his teeth</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be.  The material is nice and strong.  It will defiantly last a long time.  However, I like the tooth pick type the best.</li>
    <li> Very good quality.  just be careful when you use into your mouth!  they are SHARP!</li>
    <li> I bought this tool for my dog as I noticed the littlest bit of plaque forming on his teeth.  He is a little over three and I wanted to get a jump on this a avoid paying a vet to do the same thing I can-not to mention at a much greater risk (putting him under).  Plaque pops right off and my dogs teeth look lovely.  I brush once a week as well, which is incredibly important.  This tool is sharp enough to cut gums deep-so use with common sense and caution.  If your dog isnt likely to sit still for a tooth brushing-your dog wont sit still for this-and could get hurt.  My dog has begun to enjoy it as he gets treats after and he knows to what to expect.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  It works well--got all the tartar off that would not come off with a tooth brush.  Very reasonably priced too.</li>
    <li> These are OK but they are not beveled at the ends they are flat.  So great for pets that wriggle around on you.</li>
    <li> this is a nice scrapper because it has both a broad edge, and a point that can get into tight gaps</li>
    <li> Worked perfect on my Bernese Mt. Dog. I wish one of the ends was a little narrower.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly.  I bought it for work on other things, but first used it to remove what I suspected was some plaque on my teeth.  It served that purpose well, and will help me with hobbies.  Strong item!</li>
    <li> I have a 10lb terrier mix that had really bad tartar. He is a sweet dog and lets me clean his teeth without much difficulty. Works like a charm for me...pulled off some huge tartar chunks and made his breath a lot better. Going to try and do this about once per week.</li>
    <li> Cleaned all the tartar buildup on my three bottom front teeth.</li>
    <li> a well made tool with good balance.  It works as it should.</li>
    <li> wonderful item, speedy delivery</li>
    <li> Great for at home dental care while waiting for tour next dental appointment.&lt;br /&gt;It is a professional tool so use safety.</li>
    <li> good piece of instrument</li>
    <li> Bought this to clean the dogs teeth and it works very well.  It&#x27;s sturdy &amp; comes with a little carry case.  I&#x27;d recommend it for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Removes tartar with ease.</li>
    <li> This is not even close to what the dentist uses and it does not work effectively....don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Excellent, used on my dog.</li>
    <li> I took my doggie for a no anesthesia cleaning at the local pet shop. Took 10 minutes: $200. I think will be good for little spot removing between cleanings. Of course, if you have to be anything more than very, very gentle, leave it to the trained technicians. This is a good seller! Check the scraper ends for burrs before use. A useful tool!</li>
    <li> Scrapes teeth.  As expected.</li>
    <li> This product was a good price and will do what I need it to do for my dog. I would definitely  recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Play with your dog checking his / her teeth &amp; gums. After she / he trusts you to do so scrap 1 or 2 teeth until your pup gets used to you scraping his / her teeth. Great tool, way cheaper than letting the vet do it.</li>
    <li> A great item to have if calcium builds up on your teeth with-in a 6 month period after having you teeth cleaned. I keep my teeth clean from calcium/tarter after about 4-5 months of seeing the dentist, I have a higher calcium level, so this and the pic that goes in between the teeth are great to have. It&#x27;s strong, sharp and sturdy. I save money from having to have my teeth cleaned 3times a year, 2 times it free.</li>
    <li> This item is actually dangerous, the edges are not properly filed.  I would not even use it on my horse (If I had one).  Too much troulbe to return, will be used to carve my name into wood.</li>
    <li> Having already paid a fortune to have my dogs teeth professionally cleaned over a year ago, you would think that I would have kept up with brushing every day so the plaque wouldn&#x27;t build up again. I didn&#x27;t, and the plaque and tartar is back! I don&#x27;t want to pay to have them done again, so I bought this. It does great with scraping off the built up plaque and tartar, but he will only allow me to do if for a few seconds at a time. So I brush his teeth every day and that seems to soften stuff enough to scrape off quickly. It&#x27;s tough to get close to the gum-line without scraping his gums, so you&#x27;ll need a different tool for that.</li>
    <li> Must use gently... better to have the Vet do it.</li>
    <li> Works well and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> This works great! I use it on my teddy bear and it gets that stubborn plaque off with minimal effort. The edges are sharp so you have to be careful. I found holding a dental wipe under the area you are working on works very well to not only protect gums but also to provide a spot to wipe plaque from scraper on. It fits in hand nicely and seems sturdy and durable. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Made in China but seems to be good quality and works great.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend this tool.</li>
    <li> A LITTLE WEIRD ANGLE BUT WORKS!</li>
    <li> cheap metal! not sharp</li>
    <li> This dental descaler is safe to use with young, hyper dogs because it has no sharp edges like the tools your dental hygienist uses.  You can remove most plaque from your dog&#x27;s teeth with this without risking puncturing the gum area, provided you are careful.  However, it won&#x27;t reach into that pocket on the molar--for that you&#x27;re going to need a used one from your dentist&#x27;s office. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This descaler will also come in handy for removing hard water stains from porcelain because it will not scratch the glaze but with remove any mineral build up better than an abrasive cleanser, and will reach into corner areas as well.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Not much to say about a tooth scraper now is there? Its very very sharp!</li>
    <li> Better than paying a vet to clean my dog&#x27;s teeth...</li>
    <li> Works as described. I bought two. One of them had a rough end on the scraper. Wasn&#x27;t worth returning though.</li>
    <li> My dog hates it but it works well! :)</li>
    <li> This tartar scraper will scrape all those nasty plaque away in areas of teeth other than in-between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth will feel noticeably cleaner after using this. This item is somewhat sharp but not dangerously sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two edges. The angled edge is better for lower teeth cleaning. The straight edge is better for upper teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1)Comes with two types of edges that allows optimal angle for scraping of plaque in all areas of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;2)Very effective when used properly and meticulously. You will have cleaner teeth and cleaner breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)Not effective for in-between the teeth scraping. There are other tools that will allow you to clean in-between teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should not replace regular dental checkups, but removing plaque using scrapers such as this will allow your teeth to remain relatively free of plaque.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel, professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bough this to keep my dog&#x27;s teeth clean and it does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Not sharp enough to cut my dog&#x27;s gums, but was able to scrape all that plaque off. My dog has much better breath and pearly whites again. Now to get her to stop stealing poop from the litterbox.</li>
    <li> So much easier to use then I thought it would be.  My vet always compliments my toy poodles teeth.</li>
    <li> I couldn’t figure out how to use it?</li>
    <li> I used the red formula plax with this scraper and I was able to clean all the hard tarter that was attached to my teeth for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> Great tool to use. It is strong and does not give or bend when you press the end into a tooth. The edges are not sharp which is great, so if your hand slips it won&#x27;t cut gums. The scraper quickly and easily removes stubborn plaque and tarter with only the slightest pressure. This is a big tool though, so don&#x27;t plan on being able to clean between teeth.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more of a pick style item. This is an angled scraper. Works very well for removing tartar from teeth and around my fixed retainer.</li>
    <li> IMHO, although I&#x27;m no professional, I did not find this tartar scraper of the quality my dentist uses, which was what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
    <li> Was worried that, because it was inexpensive, it would be made of cheap metal. It is not! It is solid and sturdy and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting but it is ok. I needed something to get into small cracks for restoring antiques and the ends of this tool are too big for what I was expecting. I know I am not using it for intended use but just keep in mind photo is difficult to gauge size on here.</li>
    <li> This along with the other dental tools allows me to lightly clean up trouble areas which regular brushing and flossing lacks my intended result.</li>
    <li> Used once, works ok , I&#x27;d  purchase one again</li>
    <li> I saw this scraper in pictures, it look difference from I got before, so, I try it! when I received package, it look same what I order from amazon before, because the pictures was not clear at all! so, I return it with perfect condition, but only gave part of refund to me! I will not buy anything again! if I can see pictures more clear, I will know same as I got from them, I will not get second one again!</li>
    <li> Watched my vet a couple times, and thought I can do this. And guess what? No problem, tartar comes off easy with this tool. No more paying the vet!</li>
    <li> Just what I was searching for....great plaque remover! This scraper is high quality suited for a dentists&#x27; office. It&#x27;s nice to have it  to use at my convenience.</li>
    <li> Nice scraper, good quality.  A little too long, though, it makes it hard to manipulate.  But it does the job.</li>
    <li> Great dental scraper, purchased to keep my dogs teeth clean, so vet doesn&#x27;t have to put my dog under anesethic (sp) to clean teeth!</li>
    <li> Breaks and scrapes off hard plaque and tartar for my small dogs teeth. This product is stong, light and sharp, with smooth flat edges to clean your pets teeth. This is great for my small chihuahua in some ways who doesn&#x27;t like to chew anything to help keep his teeth cleen, so I have to help him.</li>
    <li> I bought this to scrape my dogs&#x27; teeth.  Both of them had a bit of tartar built up on them.  I talked to a couple of vets and they wanted near $1000 per dog to clean their teeth so that was out.  Looking for another option, I bought this and a couple of other dental tools.  My dogs are calm enough to let me scrape their teeth for the most part.  The outsides of the teeth were easy.  It is a bit more of a chore to clean the insides since that is more invasive.  This tool did the majority of the work and took off the tartar quickly.  This is a great buy when compared to the vet who would want to put my dogs completely out so that they could have their teeth be cleaned.</li>
    <li> if you have excess wax</li>
    <li> Handy for a lot of uses</li>
    <li> Needed something to get rid of all the tartar in the back of my teeth. I absolutely hate going to the dentist and it has been years. Stumbled upon this and read the reviews and decided to purchase for my older dog. Got it in, changed my mind and used it for myself. Worked very well! I can feel all the grooves in my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to write this review until I saw the product description: \\&quot;Stainless steel professional canine tartar scraper.\\&quot; Um, oops. I hope I didn&#x27;t damage my teeth or gums or something. But for me, it worked so well, I convinced my boyfriend to let me clean off all his tartar. He hasn&#x27;t been to the dentists in years either! (We are college students without dental insurance). I do have sensitive teeth and one of my tooth is a bit more sensitive now (although it was the one giving me the most problems in trying to rid it from the tartar build up). I plan on asking my future dentist how safe it is to clean one&#x27;s own teeth from time to time before dental check ups and if I had messed up while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could any body recommend a HUMAN version? Also maybe something for the top of the grooves on your teeth? &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The goal was to scrub the teeth with it to prevent deposits... It feels though very rogue. I mean it supposed to, right? But I had one of these in the past. It was made with much better materials or perhaps finishing. This feels like one of the contractors tools, not dental instruments. Also, the angle the tips aligned wasn&#x27;t very useful for me although, it does the job.</li>
    <li> Well made. Sturdy. Would buy again</li>
    <li> very poor quality of the steel metal.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use at home to keep tartar at bay (between dental cleanings).  It&#x27;s a good product if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
    <li> Do your own cleaning between Dentist visits!  I was amazed at how much tartar came off of my teeth after cleaning!  This tool works!</li>
    <li> This item would work better if the blade were a little narrower in size. Over all the product works as described.</li>
    <li> It seems that most prefer to use this tool with pets, but I bought it for us humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the picture on amazon is not that clear.&lt;br /&gt;It is actually about 1/4 inch wide and angled at the blade.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is not very sharp and safe to touch with a finger.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove tartar from my teeth after repetitive scraping.&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, I am quite pleased.  Make sure you clean the tooth&lt;br /&gt;with hot water or alcohol later.  the metal appears to be good quality and almost professional grade.  It holds very well. One side is left handed and the other is right handed.  Thus, it works for different angles and sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I assume that the blade can be sharpened later with a dremel.  Out of the box, the blade is sharp enough to remove most tartar.</li>
    <li> I wanted something very pointy.  This was to broad and thick.  I have one from years ago that worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Thought this was a dental tartar scrapper. Unless you have real big teeth, you don&#x27;t want this one.</li>
    <li> I worked at a dental office and worked with professional scrapers and this one did not have the same shape as those.</li>
    <li> I love it, but it is a bit too big for my small dog</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my very small dog, but she doesn&#x27;t sit still long enough for me to do and scraping safely. It&#x27;s a good tool, but not for a squirmer.</li>
    <li> Not what I was excepting</li>
    <li> ZERO to negative stars would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;I am horrified to get this Tartar Scraper with sharp jagged edges on the end.  I would never use this on a pet or human.  It was not even packaged, just loose in the shipping envelope.  You should be ashamed to sell this defective and harmful product.  I am attaching a picture of the sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will will scratch your tooth and ruin your enamel coating. This item should not have been marketed.  It is obviously an unpackaged manufacturer reject.</li>
    <li> You must know what you are doing when using this device. I use it to clean the tartar off the sides of my dogs&#x27; teeth, but be careful. It does what it is supposed to do and the angles on end of this tartar cleaner are more effective than some of the others that I have seen.</li>
    <li> This will be a handy multi-purpose little tool for cleaning and scraping in small spaces.  Needed it to scrape paint from small, tight spaces behind a messy painter.  Shipped super quick.  Good seller.</li>
    <li> Item was available for Prime. This is always a plus! My hubs is Military and we got stationed in the Country. I swear by Prime these days. Great price. Great quality. Item was new and just as described.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t as sharp as I had hoped it would be but it did come very quickly and was a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  Idiot-proof!  I&#x27;m a tea drinker, and this little tool allows me to keep my teeth free of tea stains.</li>
    <li> It was not for humans. It was way too big and thick to use. Not good! It wasn&#x27;t a professional tool.</li>
    <li> I do not like to go to Dentists, once a year is enough. Their prices are to high. I scrape along my gum lines ones a week and it works.</li>
    <li> I brought this  for my toy poodle teeth scraping tartar remove. It&#x27;s great work. Better than spending big money at the vet.</li>
    <li> This is very low quality tool. One of those that you can get off ebay for $1.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s marked &#x27;Pakistan&#x27; and &#x27;stainless&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;I sterilized it by boiling and left it to dry. It got rust just from that.&lt;br /&gt;I used to clean dog&#x27;s teeth with a screwdriver (sic) the steel is better on it for sure :-)</li>
    <li> It meets my expectations for scraping tartar off my teeth. Also, autoclave (heating the instrument in my oven) to sanitize.</li>
    <li> The ends are way too thick and big to do any type of teeth cleaning with. It works great to scrape crud off showers though. At least I have found a better use for it.</li>
    <li> I really needed something to get the  tartar between my teeth. this product does not accomplish that. Far too thick to go between teeth.</li>
    <li> Good quality, works as advertized. I would recommend the scraper to ahyone. Could be used by hobbyist for detail work.</li>
    <li> I find that soft tartar builds up on my lower incisors and this instrument helps to gently scrape it off in between dental checkups and cleanings.  It&#x27;s not for use every day, but every couple of weeks it helps my teeth look their best.</li>
    <li> Great item -- everyone should have and use one.</li>
    <li> I bought this tool with hopes that I would be able to successfully use it on at least one of my dogs. They are complete opposite sizes, one small and one very large. Both have a lot of dental tartar and build up. They are well behaved and sit very still for me to to things like this to them so that is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that I noticed when I removed it from the packaging was how sharp each end was. If your hand slips at all, this could potentially be very dangerous in your dog&#x27;s mouth. Still, I carefully tried it on each of my canines but it made no difference. It was not able to chip off any of the plaque or remove any tartar and I was afraid to put too much force into it as I didn&#x27;t want to damage their gums in the process.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would not recommend this tool to anyone else.</li>
    <li> It works like it says it should. I use it on all my dogs.I recommend it for anyone who has a hard time brushing the dogs teeth every day.</li>
    <li> The product is what it says it is, but I had no success in cleaning what little plaque my dogs teeth have. The plaque is not soft enough to scrape and it is by their gums. You&#x27;d have to chip away at it. I feared pressing too hard and then slipping with the metal tip or my dog moving and I&#x27;d wind up cutting my dogs mouth. Good luck with that. My dogs teeth are in very good shape so I&#x27;ll stick to brushing their teeth almost nightly.</li>
    <li> Great product, works great, very easy to use.  Delivery was great.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to scrape plaque from my dogs teeth, should last a lifetime. My dog is not happy but it helps keep his teeth cleaner.</li>
    <li> This was bought to scrap tarter off my dogs teeth. Please be careful with it, it seems a bit sharp near sensitive gums, and moving dogs. I put a small amount of apple cider vinegar in the dogs water a couple times a week, small like less then a teaspoon. It cleans their teeth, and makes scraping the tarter off a little easier</li>
    <li> This is high end manufacturing. I use these to clean fossils. They are the best of the best in terms of standing up to scraping bone, stone, and coral. In addition, they will scrape tartar! They don&#x27;t rust and hold up to the test of time. I recommend this for sure!</li>
    <li> cannot use this on a dog and my dog is very good about getting his teeth brushed. This can be dangerous. I should have sent it back and got my money back/</li>
    <li> Works well. Getting the dog to stand still is the only problem.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly as pictured.  It works well to remove built up tartar from our dog</li>
    <li> My senior dog&#x27;s teeth were getting quite a bit of tartar near the gums. He&#x27;s well tempered, so I decided to try this double sided scrapper to attack the worse of it. The slanted edges works well, and depending on his position, I can easily  switch the blade angle. I lay his head in my lap, pull his lips back and go to work. He just lays there and takes it like a champ. He lets me know when he&#x27;s had enough, and I let him go. Best to do a little at a time so he&#x27;ll tolerate it at all!</li>
    <li> Tool seems well made, but you&#x27;d have to have huge teeth for it to be of much use. The semi-sharp edges are 3/16 of an inch wide.</li>
    <li> Love it , very effective and easy to use . Cleaned my dog teeth, he was comfortable with it . Great product clans well.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s the best scraper we have purchased. The wide scraper helps us get more tartar off faster than others. Which is great when your dog has problems staying still! Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this little guy to scrape the tartar off my teeth. It is very sturdy, and does the job!</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This works great for scraping tartar off teeth.  My dentist asked me what I was doing different because there was such a big difference in the amount of tarter on my teeth.  I told him and he said keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> What to be said about a tooth scraper..? Made of steel. Sharp ends. Scrapes things. Worth the money. You can learn to clean your own teeth.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be like the scrapers the dentist uses but the ends are actually bigger and flatter so its not easy to get in between your teeth in the small spaces. Sturdy though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great tool. Nice weight to it.  The service was super fast.  Appreciate that and the professional tool. The edge is not as sharp as another one I have but that  makes it better  for  a lot of uses...</li>
    <li> This tool works very well for scraping tartar off my dogs&#x27; teeth (one cooperates better than the other).  I also use a Norwex microfiber cloth to clean off the plaque and protect the gums from being damaged by the scraper.  I like that the handle is easy to grip.</li>
    <li> This really works. We purchased it to use for our dog. We kept him steady and the tartar just came off when we used this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money</li>
    <li> all i have to say is wow!</li>
    <li> too sharp, not square like the picture on the ends.</li>
    <li> love it! I use it to clean my pooch&#x27;s teeth and no effort is needed. the build up just fall off with easy</li>
    <li> For $5 it will do. Dull instrument. Had an air bubble one one of the ends.</li>
    <li> The cover is translucent with a blue trim along the bottom on edge. It fits my Epson wf3520 perfectly. (I suspect the cover will fit most Epson Work force series printers).</li>
    <li> It is critical for pet owners to get check their pet&#x27;s teeth periodically. It is one of the most neglected areas of a pet. You should examine every tooth in your pets mouth. If they are really bad, get your pet a Non-Anestesia Professional Cleaning for around $50-$100 bucks. They are widely available now. There is no need to put your dog under anesthesia unless they need extractions. This is a great tool to use in between the non anesthesia dental cleanings. If you use this like every 2 months, starting after a cleaning, you can remove the tarter as it starts to harden, but before it gets stuck on bad. Just run the tip on the tooth, gently toward the gumline, slowly, until you feel the groove in between the top of the tarter and the gums. Once you are in there, pull down, away from the gumline, in a firm motion, chipping off the tarter.</li>
    <li> This helps to keep off the tarter.  It is good because it is not sharp where it could hurt your enamel</li>
    <li> use it for dogs and my husband</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Tartar Scraper&amp;#34; is a great tool to have on your work bench for cleaning your weapons or any other equipment. Just be careful when your working on your weapons.</li>
    <li> I use this on my dog. Works fantastic</li>
    <li> I have five dogs.  This is easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hurt the dogs.  Looks great and a big help in keeping tartar away!</li>
    <li> arrivied in 2 days.  works safely. clean after use. I keep it sitting in alcohol.  It did not occur to me to use it on my Chihuahua.  it took some tartar off without drawing blood. she seemed quite pleased afterwards now i will have to clean her mouth with a drpper of peroxide so that bacteria do not drfit into her heart valves,  dog is resting happiyl right near me.</li>
    <li> This does a great job removing tartar build up on my Golden Retriever&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Difficult to use in a small dog.</li>
    <li> No problems this seller scraper as expected and fast .</li>
    <li> Best quality and best price.</li>
    <li> Quality instrument that works surprisingly well at removing stuff from dog&#x27;s teeth.  Has sharp points that can affect dog&#x27;s gums, so care is needed, as always with many things.</li>
    <li> I use this to clean a small motor fan that gets fly ash (coal) built up on it.</li>
    <li> Did not receive the item that I ordered, but what I did receive works perfectly for what I needed, so I saw no reason to return it.</li>
    <li> - Rushed my order and didn&#x27;t realize this was a double end with two flat sides.&lt;br /&gt;- Good quality for what it is, and I&#x27;ll keep it, but next time I&#x27;ll read the description!</li>
    <li> !For this product to work your dog will have to be patient while you are in his mouth with it, however if you have a well trained dog that will sit still for you this product is AMAZING!! It took me less then 10 minutes to get all the gunk off my dogs teeth, and they look better then I think they ever have. I was told by the vet a week before getting this that he was going to need a dental cleaning. I did not want to put my dog through that, so I figured I would try this instead. It save me over $300 doing it myself. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> We are very happy with this double ed tartar scraper.  The item was just like in the picture and description.</li>
    <li> good product for removing plaque</li>
