      <li>The seller Is great</li>
      <li>Great seller, but I did not care for the product.</li>
      <li>My best friend recommended this after I commented on how amazing her skin looked.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels so exceptionally great on the skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel great and makes it glow.</li>
      <li>I wanted to find a very good Vit C serum and done a lot of research, at 20% it is very strong, and yes can tingle a lot, but its doing the job, always use a Vit A with it.</li>
      <li>My facialist had encouraged me to use a Vitamin C serum on my face to help nourish the skin, reduce the aging process, helps with brown spots and all kinds of good things.  </li>
      <li>The price seemed good to me, but like they say, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I am happy:)</li>
      <li>I love the product and it was at a great price.</li>
      <li>There are so many great sellers on Amazon, but these that will not refund your money give me the feeling that their products may not be what they say they are, and they just want your money, once they have it, you as the buyer are out of luck.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more luminous and bright.</li>
      <li>another charged $80 for this brand and their own brand.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency and smells nice though.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product and got exactly what I was after, no fuss, no delay, the service was great.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use Vitamin C in ages because even looking at the stuff would give me a rash.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff-</li>
      <li>I noticed my skin looks more radiant and glows.</li>
      <li>I love Obagi products and also use the exfoliating lotion along with the C Serum.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about to reorder it and encourage everyone to read more about adding C serum to their regimen.  </li>
      <li>I use it under my moisturizer which is the Exfoliating Lotion and LOVE both together.  </li>
      <li>that being said Obagi Professional C is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This absorbs quickly into the skin so no waiting before applying makeup.</li>
      <li>This product is an amazing addition to my nightly \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; facial skin ritual.</li>
      <li>I started with the 15%, which I recommend because you really build up the abilty to tolerate the more intense Vitamin C.</li>
      <li>Love the Obagi Professional C Serum -</li>
      <li>I purchased because of the Obagi name, which I have used other products from this line and loved them.</li>
      <li>If you are new using this product then it is good to staret at a low percent rate.  </li>
      <li>I do like the serum very much.  </li>
      <li>It really glows!</li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the serum.</li>
      <li>I use a derma roller 0.05mm and straight after use Obagi Vit C serum and a topical A cream as well, my skin looks smooth and fresh, i do this twice a week, and i now have people wanting to know what i do,</li>
      <li>As we all know that Vitamin C is essential to combat the free radicals on skin that then turn to wrinkles....</li>
      <li>I really do not believe that this was an authentic Obagi product.  </li>
      <li>Although the product seems to be the real deal I haven&#x27;t gotten any results.</li>
      <li>It really seems to have helped get rid of scaliness and dryness</li>
      <li>I am not going to some other person to pay $300 to derma roll my skin when you can buy and rebuy over and over the rollers when you need them for very cheap, i use mine 10 times then throw away.</li>
      <li>Make sure they are clean and spray a little antiseptic spray over it and let dry.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product.  </li>
      <li>I am very sensitive.</li>
      <li>the product arrived fast and in the same condition as described would recommend buying this product.</li>
      <li>Having used it routinely in the morning on a daily basis for quite some time now, I know that it is very helpful in keeping my skin younger than if it was not part of my beauty regimen.</li>
      <li>I went to Amazon and found the same exact thing for half the price.  </li>
      <li>One nice difference is that it doesn&#x27;t go bad quickly which Vitamin C can do by other brands...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Obagi products and also use the exfoliating lotion along with the C Serum.  My facialist had encouraged me to use a Vitamin C serum on my face to help nourish the skin, reduce the aging process, helps with brown spots and all kinds of good things.  Every time I would go to a spa and get a facial, the technician would say the same thing.  The spa I went to charged about $120 for Obagi C Serum, another charged $80 for this brand and their own brand.  I went to Amazon and found the same exact thing for half the price.  I use it under my moisturizer which is the Exfoliating Lotion and LOVE both together.  It really seems to have helped get rid of scaliness and dryness I&#x27;ve always been plagued with.  I use the C Serum on my hands as well and feel it has made a difference in the softness of my hands and cuticles.  I&#x27;m about to reorder it and encourage everyone to read more about adding C serum to their regimen.  One nice difference is that it doesn&#x27;t go bad quickly which Vitamin C can do by other brands...I bought one from my facialist and it went bad quickly before I could use 1/2 of it.  When you&#x27;re paying $40-80 for a product, you don&#x27;t want it to go bad before you can use it all up.</li>
    <li> Love the Obagi Professional C Serum - the product arrived fast and in the same condition as described would recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I use this serum in the morning before applying a moisturizer. My skin has noticeable improved in clarity and texture. I would recommend for all women especially 30 plus.</li>
    <li> This product helped me exfoliate my skin; I have a smoother skin overall visibly obvious. The only downfall was the burning feeling and slight irritation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and got exactly what I was after, no fuss, no delay, the service was great.  I love the product and it was at a great price.</li>
    <li> I use a derma roller 0.05mm and straight after use Obagi Vit C serum and a topical A cream as well, my skin looks smooth and fresh, i do this twice a week, and i now have people wanting to know what i do, well thats all i do. I am not going to some other person to pay $300 to derma roll my skin when you can buy and rebuy over and over the rollers when you need them for very cheap, i use mine 10 times then throw away. Make sure they are clean and spray a little antiseptic spray over it and let dry. It works, a little painful at first, but it works. I wanted to find a very good Vit C serum and done a lot of research, at 20% it is very strong, and yes can tingle a lot, but its doing the job, always use a Vit A with it.</li>
    <li> As we all know that Vitamin C is essential to combat the free radicals on skin that then turn to wrinkles.... that being said Obagi Professional C is a great product.  It is affordable and works perfectly as a night time serum for my face. I would recommend it in a heart beat.</li>
    <li> This serum (20% C serum) is wonderful.  Obagi products always deliver.  The lines and wrinkles will start to soften almost within a few days.  I will  continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> Great seller, but I did not care for the product. It broke me out really badly...I cannot use C serum on my skin. Not the seller&#x27;s fault though, which is why I gave it five stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and I notice that my skin has improved . It&#x27;s more luminous and bright.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff- I haven&#x27;t been able to use Vitamin C in ages because even looking at the stuff would give me a rash. I am very sensitive. I started with the 15%, which I recommend because you really build up the abilty to tolerate the more intense Vitamin C. My best friend recommended this after I commented on how amazing her skin looked.</li>
    <li> I noticed my skin looks more radiant and glows. This absorbs quickly into the skin so no waiting before applying makeup. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  PERHAPS OTHERES WILL SEE A BENEFIT BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN A DIFFERENCE.  SORRY.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the serum. I am 4 weeks into doing the Nu Derm system and I am using this 3x a week. It makes my skin feel great and makes it glow. I am happy:)</li>
    <li> This product is an amazing addition to my nightly \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; facial skin ritual. It arrived on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Try it out, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product.  I am using it to brighten my hyperpigmentation, and I am already seeing a difference in the texture and shade of my skin.  It really glows!</li>
    <li> If you are new using this product then it is good to staret at a low percent rate.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I do like the serum very much.  Having used it routinely in the morning on a daily basis for quite some time now, I know that it is very helpful in keeping my skin younger than if it was not part of my beauty regimen. I started with 10% and gradually worked up to 20%. It is a bit pricey considering that this soul desires to use too much,,,,,covering the neck, chest, and face.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so exceptionally great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product. I purchased because of the Obagi name, which I have used other products from this line and loved them. I don&#x27;t feel like this was an Obagi product in the bottle.  It had a horrible rancid smell, not a citric one like people I know that have used this product. I really do not believe that this was an authentic Obagi product.  It made me break out within a week of using it, and was extremely oily.  The seller will not refund your money, which I feel is so wrong when customers buy online. There are so many great sellers on Amazon, but these that will not refund your money give me the feeling that their products may not be what they say they are, and they just want your money, once they have it, you as the buyer are out of luck. The price seemed good to me, but like they say, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Although the product seems to be the real deal I haven&#x27;t gotten any results. Maybe It hasn&#x27;t been long enough. It has a nice consistency and smells nice though. I only gave 3 stars because of lack of results. The seller Is great and I believe the product Is Obagi brand.</li>
