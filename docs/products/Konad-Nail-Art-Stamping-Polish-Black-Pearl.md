<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff worked like it says, so that&#x27;s always good, but honestly I had just as good results using $1 and $2 black polishes so it may not be worth the hype.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a beginner, perhaps you should start with this stuff as I hear it makes stamping easier....but unless you have some insatiable desire to own Konad brand polish you may as well just use Sinful Colors or Wet n Wild...works just as well IMO.</li>
    <li> I had purchase the Konad stamp previously, and was very disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work as described. I watched the tutorial video from YouTube and still didn&#x27;t work. I saw that the Konad polish went down in price,so I decided to give it a try. Same result. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish for stamps, its like real paint almost, you don&#x27;t need alot</li>
    <li> My daughter like this but not for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Rosie</li>
    <li> I love how opaque this polish is and highly recommend it, along with the Konad white special polish, for people that are new to nail stamping.</li>
    <li> Hard to use at first but with practice you get the hang of it.  Works better than regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I am new to the konad stamping systems. After watching tons of review videos on you tube I decided to purchase the items through amazon for a better price. I must say I am EXTREMELY hooked! It is really not that difficult to use at all. The nail polish is INSTANT dry! When placing on the discs to stamp, make sure you cover a good layer. I tried to use less thinking it would be less wasted when I scrape it but it doesn&#x27;t stamp as well that way. Make sure a good thicker layer is on and then scrape and stamp. I loved it! And it only took about 5 minutes to do all my nails the very first time :)</li>
    <li> I purchased the Konad special polish in black and white, and they work great! I haven&#x27;t tried using normal polish with the stamping yet, but I&#x27;m sure it would work fine. But the \\&quot;special polish\\&quot; definately does have a different texture to it. It looks very shiny at first but it becomes matte once stamped.    The only down side is that a top coat seems to smear and blur the designs. So when I use a top coat, I don&#x27;t \\&quot;glide\\&quot; it over my nail like I would with a normal polish. I kind of just \\&quot;blob\\&quot; and \\&quot;drip/drop\\&quot; it on and that seems to do the trick. So try doing that or maybe use Zoya \\&quot;Hurry Polish Drying Drops\\&quot; instead of a top coat. You&#x27;re supposed to use it over a top coat, but I feel like this helps make your polish last longer anyway.     Overall, I think that the special polish in black and white are a good investment but other colors aren&#x27;t neccessary. Other reviews that I&#x27;ve read and watched on youtube say that normal polish works just fine :)</li>
    <li> I loved this item. The only thing is that is too black so I have to use like 3 cottons to clean all the back but other than that I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great polish. It is super thick, is tough to dry out, and is a staple in your konad system.</li>
    <li> The polish is of a true deep black color, it makes sharp and accurate shapes while stamping. Dries very fast when applied on the nail. In spite of being rather expensive for its volume, its quality really worth it.</li>
    <li> Comes in a different bottle than in the picture, but that doesn&#x27;t matter at all. This works fantastically with the Konad plates (and imitation brands as well). I recommend you use this with stamping plates as opposed to regular nail polish simply because this kind is very thick and plastic-like. You couldn&#x27;t use it to paint your nails regularly, but it&#x27;s exactly what you need for stamping plates.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with the Konad stamper. I have only used it once and find that it makes a difference when using regular polish. You should definitely use their polish with the stamper for superior results. Don&#x27;t go getting cheap when using the Konad...use their polish and notice the difference.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. No problems, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it even dries in the stamping plate.</li>
    <li> The Konad special nail polish is thicker, consistant, and most of all...expensive. So I was hesitant to purchase this polish for my Konad stamping kit. I was using China Glaze polishes for a little while with the stamping kit and decided to try out at least one polish of the Konad. I purchased the black first. This stuff is like plastic! This is great! The design is crisp, and perfect everytime I stamp it. People say it takes a lot of practice, but it&#x27;s really easy for me, at least. The polish is super thick so more is picked up on the stamper. I loved it so much, I ordered the white polish too.    And free shipping? Who doesn&#x27;t love that?    If you&#x27;re stamping your nails, I suggest getting at least the black and white Konad polishes. You will see a difference!</li>
    <li> Good polish for nail stamping…but there are many other polishes that work just as good.</li>
    <li> I Definitely recommend this polish compared to regular polishes. It stamps on and stays on very well. I would buy this again. Only thing I wish the bottle contents was more.</li>
    <li> Good polish for stamping</li>
    <li> Used it for many tutorials and they came out great. Make sure to get the konad stamping set though because it doesnt work too well with others.</li>
    <li> Best black out there for nail stamping.</li>
    <li> i am very new at stamping and i bought a $6 plate from walmart, i could not get it to work at all but i used this polish and it worked perfectly!!!</li>
    <li> Works really good I recommend it!</li>
    <li> I use this Konad polish for my stamping and have used others, but really do prefer the Konad because it is very darkly pigmented! My stamping always turns our great, Plus I use Seche Vite as a Top Coat and NEVER get any streaking, Just try to float your top coat on with out the brush touching or dragging the surface; take it from this Nail tech, it works!</li>
    <li> Thank u so much it came so fast and the product is amazing love it 😬</li>
    <li> I bought this polish for stamping. I wanted to see if I could find  something better than Sally Hansen \\&quot;blackout\\&quot;. Where \\&quot;blackout\\&quot; worked  great. I was very happy when I bought this polish. The stamps this polish makes  is so much nicer.</li>
    <li> It works great on all of my plates. It&#x27;s nice and thick. You don&#x27;t need much at all. The quality is there. I have yet to find a black polish that works as well as this one. And I haven&#x27;t found any that are as vibrant as this one. It&#x27;s worth the little bit extra. I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Konad has a great product... although it is a bit high....and now I know of other polishes that are from the drugstores and stamp just as well....any polish that says quick dry will work great !</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re asking yourself why you need to order the Konad special polish and cannot just use regular polish, check out youtube. Type in \\&quot;Konad with regular polish\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll see that you CAN use it with regular polish BUT IT WILL BE TRANSPARENT. Basically this polish is super thick and pigmented so that when you transfer the image from the plate to your nail it stays true to color. If you use a regular polish you may still be able to get the image to transfer, but if you place it over a color polish it will be very transparent and you won&#x27;t be able to see it very well. There are some people out there that use thickening agents in regular polishes to attempt making their own Konad like polish, but personally I find that too much to bother with. And the polish actually does last a long time. If you&#x27;re new to Konad I suggest starting out with Black and White, then adding more colors as you need to. I&#x27;ve found the black and white are the colors I almost always use anyways! Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Came in quick and works amazing love it</li>
    <li> Came fast, works great, I love it :)</li>
    <li> I liked this nail polish. It does what the label says it will do and works great for transferring the design. I did not like how it smears when I apply a top coat even after its fully dry. I think you may need to use a light spray sealer first to prevent this.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different black nail polishes for stamping to compare to the Konad.  The ones that cost less than the Konad aren&#x27;t thick enough for stamping and are too transparent for me.  Those that are thick enough cost as much or more than the Konad.  The Konad polish is not transparent and works great!  I&#x27;d recommend having at least one Konad polish color in your collection.  And try different polishes and colors to find what works best for you.  Happy stamping!</li>
    <li> Dries fast, very opaque. Almost seems like a sticker when stamped on the nail. A little hard to clean up the edges after stamping, but has great staying power.</li>
    <li> This is the best black for stamping.  I have used various other blacks and while some work &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; nothing really compares to the opacity on the konad black stamping polish. (If others have found another good black, Im always open to suggestions.) My only complaint is the cost (hence knocking one star off).  I plan to continue use of konad black for stamping and will purchase again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as it&#x27;s supposed to but remember - you can use ANY thick polish for nail stamping. We&#x27;ve discovered that! Don&#x27;t think you have to be married to this product. We have a nail salon.</li>
    <li> This item does exactly what it is supposed to do. If you need something like this, you will not be disappointed in this item.</li>
    <li> This is a must have polish in your Konad Stamping Kit.  The Black is very dark and is a must have.  When I have used other blacks polishes on my Konad the black polish ALWAYS shows up too light.  Konad polish is designed especially for the stamping plates.  It doesn&#x27;t dry as fast.  When you stamp your design on your nail with this polish is is dry to the touch.  I found waiting about 4 minutes before applying a top coat would ensure that your design doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as I had many of the Konad plates and I had tried to use the regular nail polish but seemed to thin. After reading the reviews I decided to spend a little extra and try this one out. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m not using it correctly but it seems like it&#x27;s as good as the regular nail polish, I was thinking I was going to get a thick one but it seems like it&#x27;s not doing the job for me. A friend of mine has this same Konad Special Polish and it seems much more thicker than the one I have.:( I was looking forward to doing my nails.</li>
    <li> I received this faster than i expected! I&#x27;m very happy with it, I would recommend buying Konad black/white polish for stamping. Normal black/white polish doesn&#x27;t go on as dark and it may turn out a bit thinner than the Konad brand.</li>
    <li> Great stamping polish works great ... I recommend purchasing it ...U will not regret it ... It was a very fast shipping I was happy about that....</li>
    <li> This nail polish is great for art work.  It goes on smooth yet covers great without being too thick.  The color is very much like the image</li>
    <li> I received my nail polish earlier than expected and i am very pleased with this polish it was very well wrapped and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy this konad nail polish. it was also not as expensive besides the shipping and handling.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something to be said about the Konad stamping polish.  Although you can use regular mail polish on stamping plates, this Konad black works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Much much much easier and better to use then regular nailpolish. its worth it.  it just takes a few tries to get it right and it does get a bit messy.</li>
    <li> fast service and great prodect</li>
    <li> The polish is thick and stamps well.</li>
    <li> I love my Konad kit! The black is a must have for the collection, but I only gave it 4 stars because it smears every time! I used this on my little sister and she waited overnight to put a clear coat on top and it still smeared! It doesn&#x27;t ruin the design because the smearing is minimal, but if you&#x27;re a perfectionist you will notice it.</li>
    <li> Definitely want to use this black when stamping. It works best compared to other black polishes. I&#x27;d also buy the white, too. It&#x27;ll show up better!</li>
    <li> i love it is a really good nail polish and is what i was looking for thanks i really like it.</li>
    <li> lets just put it this way a konad product does not disappoint when it comes to quality this is very good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great for stamping</li>
    <li> If you are nail stamping, you need this product.</li>
    <li> I love it! Great color works with almost anything and it has a great consistency! I would order black and white, they are musts! :)</li>
    <li> Polish works ok.  Dries very quickly.  That&#x27;s good and bad.  good when setting up on your nail...bad when you are trying to get the polish transferred from the stencil plate to your fingernail.</li>
    <li> This black stamping polish works GREAT! I think if anyone is having a hard time- try a different stamper. I&#x27;m fairly new to this stamping and I tried what I had at home and it was ok. But when I ordered this polish it came out the FIRST TIME clear. I did butterflies and flowers so far and everyone loves them! Can&#x27;t wait to get my daughters here to do more! This polish does work great and I&#x27;m buying a couple more- I&#x27;m going to need it!</li>
    <li> Love this stamping polish. I wish it was made in more quantity other than the 10ml. Would also like it if it was a tad bit cheaper, but will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully I had bought some from my local beauty supply and hated the product but the konads are amazing. I actually bought this black Konad a white and a green Konad and they all work great.</li>
    <li> This polish works great with the nail stamp plates, used to decorate your fingernails. It is priced nicely and of good quality.</li>
    <li> This is my first stamping polish</li>
    <li> This item arrived pretty fast and perfect. The stamping effect is awesome and is way better than using regular polish. The image shows up way better. With regular polish I always got a faded image and with the Konad Special polish the images are perfect. I will continue to only use Konad Special polish when Im using my Konad stamping plates. So far Konad is a trusted brand in my household.</li>
    <li> Great black polish to use for stamping, a must have when you are starting off with Konad plates! This and white are the best purchases to get to start off.</li>
    <li> I thought why not?  I am glad that I did, because it works well with the art plates I got from Konad. Yes, I recommend to buy.</li>
    <li> I liked this nail polish. It does what the label says it will do and works great for transferring the design. My only dislike about this prduct is that it smears when I apply a top coat even after its fully dry.</li>
    <li> Picks up great!  Opaque.  Better to just scrape the excess off your skin with your nail or a stick, as using acetone smears and stains your skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I just started nail stamping and was having trouble using regular nail polish. After several tries I&#x27;ve finally got it down, however I really didn&#x27;t need to buy this polish to stamp. With that said it is thicker than regular polish so it does go on a bit better. I wont be returning this because it does have it&#x27;s use. I&#x27;m just glad now to know I can use different brands; I just wont get the same exact effect if it&#x27;s thinner.</li>
    <li> works as perfectly as I thought it would, only advice, do not keep the top off close it every time after each use to keeep it fresh.</li>
    <li> Great stamping polish. It dries a bit too quick for me but all in all I like using this product.. Thanks for your service.</li>
    <li> This black is a must have for your stamping collection.  Comes out opaque and dark.  I have tried other regular blacks but this really does the job!</li>
    <li> Bad! Try MDU ..  Super Great polish for stamping</li>
    <li> Works so much better than regular polish. I would recommend if you like stamping.</li>
    <li> I am new to nail art so went with the tried and true nail stampign polish. It is great. transfer well, nice dark and opaque.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the month to start with a product designed for nail stamping.</li>
    <li> This polish is a must have for stamping. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but worth every penny. I have tried stamping with other polishes and almost gave up because I was unable to transfer the design. I finally decided to order the konad polish and I can say without a doubt I love stamping now! I had to watch a few tutorials from YouTube first but I got the hang of it on my first try. I&#x27;m so excited and anxious to try different designs now.</li>
    <li> Product is as good as it gets.mlove the color works good will buy again when i run out! Happy stamping.</li>
    <li> Great for nail stamping.  But you do NOT have to use this for stamping if you don&#x27;t want to (there are other blacks out there that work just as well).  It is a little thicker than most regular polishes, therefor it works great for stamping.</li>
    <li> Good product, but too pricy</li>
    <li> Works very well drys quickly.</li>
    <li> This works so much better than nail polish for stamping images onto nails.  I would recommend this product over any others.</li>
    <li> The polish wasn&#x27;t protected in any way and was lucky it wasn&#x27;t damaged.. I almost appears used in the sence of the bottle and not in the original packaging.. since the item didn&#x27;t specify in original packaging I&#x27;ll let it slide</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for nail art, but remember, dont use the polish directly on the nails, by mistake used it as a base and stained my nails a bit :-( , but used in the drawings are beautiful</li>
    <li> This is the most opaque black polish I&#x27;ve used for stamping but you really have to be quick when you&#x27;re using it. I have never experienced another polish that dries as fast as this one. It takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s worth it for the results. For a beginner I would stick to another black polish till they get comfortable with stamping.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to really use it due to the plates that I ordered being crap. They are too shallow to hold the paint in the grooves</li>
    <li> It smears and bleeds after I apply the top coat no matter how long I waited for it to dry.  I even bought the ORLY Sec N Dry in the hopes that a quick dry top coat will alleviate this problem but no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very opaque and prints wonderfully but you do have to seal your design with top coat and that is when it disappoints.</li>
    <li> best stamping polish on the market. invest in Konad</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, great product.</li>
    <li> This is the WORST Polish I have EVER used. I use cheapo polish to stamp (Revlon, Orly, OPI, etc but mainly Revlon) and thought that maybe this time I would just try the Konad polish, since I love their kits so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s HORRIBLE. It doesn&#x27;t come cleanly off onto the stamp, the design is funky when it does. It just doesn&#x27;t stick right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the money and use drugstore polish.</li>
    <li> Nice polish. Works great with the stamp.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with how fast this product was delivered. I am very excited to get to use this on my new plates that I should be getting tomorrow. It is just what I needed and wanted. Would order again.</li>
    <li> This works well. I&#x27;ve been having a blast working with nail stamp art. Super fun and easy to do once you get used to it. Great color, very opaque. Love Konad products.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.I love doing my nails with anything Konad. I hope anyone who&#x27;s interested in Konad trys it out.Trust me it&#x27;s easy to use.    -Starbar OUT!</li>
    <li> I love my Konad nail polish!!! It does the job its suppose to do and nothing less. This polish is a little more Matte than a regular polish which is cool too. It came in a timely manner and WORKED!! What more could a girl ask for?! &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I own the black and white polishes and am very impressed with he quality, thickness and pigmentation of the polish. I use these for my stamping also from Konad.</li>
    <li> I was pleased to find that this product was still available for such a great price.  I have a big collection of konad products and I continue to be surprise by them.  My experience with this seller was great.  The expected delivery date was much sooner than anticipated.  I can not wait to purchase more items.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to nail stamping so I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one. I bought high quality gear so my nails would turn out well. When I tried picking up the polish with my konad stamper it did not work. I tried with another non-stamping polish and it actually worked.</li>
    <li> This is awesome and it applies well. My problem with it is that even though you allow it to dry for a long time, as you apply a top coat, it SMEARS. Very disappointing after you see how beautiful it was before (pic of nails before the smearing).</li>
    <li> Gotta love Konad stamping polish!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand of stamping polish before and I just hope this is the same quality as the one I am running out of. I will reach for this over any other black polish. Makes awesome stamping images. Rich black and crisp.</li>
    <li> love my konad nail polish it is awesome got it for a great price shipping was fast i am one happy costumer!</li>
    <li> item shipped fast and was exactly what was expected just waiting for the stamps now but works good with the ones we have</li>
    <li> OMG came on time and love it so going to buy more of the nail polish^o^</li>
    <li> Obviously, it&#x27;s the best balck stamping polish, but you can use any black polish too.&lt;br /&gt;The result is only slightly better with this one that only you can see.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, white conad polish is must have.</li>
    <li> Love it! It works perfectly fine on my designs. I will need to buy another one soon. Good rate!! @</li>
    <li> This by far is one of my favorite stamping polishes. The shipping was great and got item as expected. This is great at picking up images on any stamping plate and comes in lots of different colors. If you have not tried this stamping polish yet I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Another winner from Konad. Just received this a few days ago and its absolutely perfect. Its just thick enough that the transfers are amazing, but not so thick that it doesn&#x27;t settle into the etching on the plate. Stamps are clear and beautiful, even on plates I thought were crap originally. I&#x27;ll gladly purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let people tell you that regular polish will work with the stamps bc it doesn&#x27;t. I tried so many diff reg polishes with my stamps before I finally gave in and bought the stamping polish. This stuff is awesome and works on the first try! Also don&#x27;t get the cheap knock off stamper and scraper buy the konad one. You&#x27;ll be happy you did :)</li>
    <li> Does not show up as well as I would like.</li>
    <li> If you are a beginner at stamping, im definitely recommending this nail polis. it is so easy to do stamping with it, plus it is very opaque and doesnt smear when you add a top coat. Im a beginner myself and im pleased with this nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product at a reasonable price.  Have been using for several weeks without a problem. Produces a clear opaque stamping.</li>
    <li> Still getting used to it; so I need some practice but once I get the hang of it, I&#x27;m sure to love it even more.</li>
    <li> This polish is great for stamping! I tried quite a few different brands of black (Sally Hansen, China Glaze, Wet n Wild) before committing to buy this. I&#x27;m very glad I made the switch. The other polishes were alright, some worked better than others, but they weren&#x27;t ideal for stamping. They were too thin, too translucent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konad Stamping polish is very thick and very opaque. It&#x27;s perfect for stamping. Your designs will stamp very crisply and neatly. This color shows up very well against a variety of base coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can certainly make do with other polishes but the Konad polish really is formulated specifically for stamping. You don&#x27;t need all of Konad&#x27;s special polishes but I recommend at least getting the black and the white. They will truly increase the quality of your stamping.</li>
    <li> Konad black is always the Same...perfect :) I got this for a great price too so I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Will buy again from amazon if I need it.</li>
    <li> The black is a true black and not an off black which was nice to find out.  It is a strong polish that does not chip easily.  I would buy more colors of this when I need them and they work great with the Konad and other brands of design plates of nail art.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> Everyone who stamps needs to at least experience stamping with Konad&#x27;s Black and White Polish. Fabulous. Shows up on nails great.</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. Have other colors, this is a good addition.  I will probably add more in the future.  Amazon came through again with a good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I ordered the White and Black of the Konad Stamping Polish.  Although they work well for stamping they are still fairly expensive for what they are.  I have been doing some research about other brands that will work for stamping and intend to get those once these run out.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON MY STAMPS.  I TRIED REGULAR NAIL POLISH AND IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK WELL AT ALL SO TRIED THE BLACK AND IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have color options for stamping. It really does not even compare to regular polish. If you use stamps, you need this polish.</li>
    <li> Worked great with the Konad stamping kit.</li>
    <li> I wish Konad dried quicker. It never fails that I end up smearing when using the top coat. I&#x27;ve used a variety of polishes for stamping and this one, is always a problem in dry time.</li>
    <li> works really well with stamping plate and last long time under a good top coat</li>
    <li> Does not work for stamping, it&#x27;s too thin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard reviews on YouTube for this and decided to try it.  You should too -- you&#x27;ll get beautiful opaque stamped designs with this black; great, sharp detail and perfect transfer to the stamp and nail.</li>
    <li> This product is really nice, thick polish that works well with stamping</li>
    <li> Great brand! The polish works perfectly because of its consistency! I love it! Will be buying more in different colors!</li>
    <li> Perfect for stamping!</li>
    <li> So far, the best black for stamping. Have tried many, and this one really does the job. Many others a good, but this is my favorite. Will keep buying.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, pleased with product.</li>
    <li> This  works great for light colored polish to stamp on those awesome images!!! Thank you for such a great product!!! Happy New Year!!!</li>
    <li> Will deff order again</li>
    <li> This works exactly as advertised.  Never use on bare nails.  This has a really thick viscosity specially made for the Konad plates.</li>
    <li> Nice black stamping polish.  I have had the same bottle for a few years know and it is beginning to get extra thick but it still works.</li>
    <li> This polish is gorgeous when used with Konad plates.  The fine etching on the plates is just right for the viscosity of this polish.  I tried it on my cheaper plates and it was a bit overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and a Konad white at the very least.</li>
    <li> Jh hbkhb khbk hbjh bkj bib jh bib jh bib khb khb khbk hbj hbkhb kh bkj bi hbj bkj b</li>
    <li> Most of the stamping kits say that they will work with any nail polish. Not true this nail polish works perfect. The vendor got it to me really quick and I love it.</li>
    <li> The ink was messy, smelled loud, and did not stamp on that easy. I could use regular nail polish easier. I say regular nail polish because it works just as well, if not better. Besides you can select from an array of colors with regular nail polish. Don&#x27;t waste on money on the stamping polish, it&#x27;s not worth it. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT. I HAVE COMPARED IT TO OTHER BLACKS LIKE SALLY HANSON OR WET N WILD AND IT HAS A CRISPER COLOR TO IT.</li>
    <li> Great stamping polish. Fast time and great packaging</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of purchasing a polish specifically for the nail art stamp plates since I&#x27;ve heard other people using regular nail polish and getting nice results.  But the texture or smoothness of this product works great for stamping.  Very opaque and dries fast, but not before you stamp it.  Once I did all of my nails I could put a top coat nail polish on right away.  Top coat is recommended if you&#x27;re using this product, probably to help protect it and make it last longer.  Was happy to find it for a lower price than other sites.</li>
    <li> Tried other polishes for stamping but this is the one to get!!. Works great and will continue buying this brand!</li>
    <li> This works well, but you could easily use any black polish for a top stamp.</li>
    <li> i had it for a long time and it still is dark and not changed or anything i love konad!!!</li>
    <li> Pretty fast shipping well packaged.  I have used several times and I love it, stamps very well clear crisp transfer. Fast drying time make sure you use top coat.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have seen You Tube videos&lt;br /&gt;on this product. And I finally&lt;br /&gt;had to buy it.I do my own nails&lt;br /&gt;now and I received it today. It was&lt;br /&gt;fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I am happy with product, even though I have not used it very often. It does last on nail without me having to redo design.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> If you can&#x27;t find another thick black to stamp with this works well.  It is a very small bottle though so not really worth the money unless you have no other choice.</li>
    <li> I should have bought the Konad when I first got my stamping plates! I was ready to give up. Glad I didn&#x27;t. The polish picks up the patterns perfectly even fine details. Love it!</li>
    <li> Got it quickly. It&#x27;s awsome. Came in good condition, and works great.</li>
    <li> Works good for stamping. The bottle is smaller then expected for how much it costs but it works. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am so far impressed with this polish!  It is thicker than usual lacquer so it fills in my stamping plates better.  The design comes off much darker and clearer on the nail than regular polish.  I would definitely recommend using a polish designed specifically for stamping to achieve the best results!</li>
    <li> You do need this polish for stamping. After many failings I ordered this and it work great. Fun to learn. And show off.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Excellent for the people who like stamping their nails. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great polish for stamps but expire quickly after 6 months. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I do not see so good, it does not stick well.</li>
    <li> Works well, a bit expensive I think but does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> not really satisfy it doesn&#x27;t really work on my nails I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m doing it right or wrong but I tried so many times different nails different types of styles but nothing</li>
    <li> Works great, but there was no brush on the black one so I had to use one of my own.</li>
    <li> The black works great but the color is hard to get off the skin and it stained the scraper.</li>
    <li> Excellent polishes! Perfect for stamping nail art. Images are clear and detailed. I have used several other brands of polished with my Konad and MoYou stamping plates and the images were not as clear as with these Konad polishes. Order arrived in a timely manner. Will definitely order from seller again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using a designated stamping polish (I usually just use regular polish). The black is deep and rich. The image transfers beautifully. Works great on all my different sized plates. Will definitely be ordering additional Konad colors</li>
    <li> i have nail plates that are not konad and regular nail polish was not working. so i decided to try this on the plates and it works excellent.</li>
    <li> This really is different and it really is necessary. It makes the whole nail stamping thing work.</li>
    <li> Regular polish works just as well ....</li>
    <li> I received my order really fast and came in just like described.  Thanks so much for quick and great service.</li>
    <li> The price it was good ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok okok okok  ok ok</li>
    <li> Quality is great..still getting the hang of the whole nail stamping thing I tried using&lt;br /&gt;A regular black polish an it couldn&#x27;t compare id recommend getting the konadin black and white</li>
    <li> Great polish for stamping, a must for it really. Very black when stamped, easy to use, cute fancy bottle. Brand new in package. If your a stamper I would at least get the black and white for your collection, it will make a HUGE difference! Warning tho you may become addicted after that lol</li>
    <li> I bought this to go with my stamping plates, regular polish doesn&#x27;t work that great but the Konad polish works wonderful.</li>
    <li> It is a little thin so it takes a couple of coats as most nailpolishes do but looks great afterwards!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo202XAEXFK4RX2]]hi everyone  I love this nail polish! I&#x27;m getting it in white and blue and next I want to get pink. Its amazing how well it works. Other nail polish doesnt work..I&#x27;ve tried before I bought this but its way worth it.</li>
    <li> I need to order more.  Black comes out great on all my stamp nail designs.  I really need to add this to my wish list.</li>
    <li> The polish is think enough to stamp well.  Color is true.  The price is a little high for the small bottle, but if you use it only for stamping, it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> I had been using regular polish for stamping, but after hearing raves about this polish being much better for stamping, I have to agree. It&#x27;s a lot more opaque, and seems to take a tad longer to dry, which gives you a few more seconds when transferring the image to your nail. As for the reviews that say it smells really bad, I honestly didn&#x27;t notice. It smells like regular polish to me.</li>
    <li> Purchased with Stamping art image plate, should complement other colors, adds depth to design, easy to use, dries fast, good for teens and tweens</li>
    <li> Konad polish for stamping is incredible and doesn&#x27;t compare to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; polish! Try and you will see it doesn&#x27;t smear and puts down a plastic like stamp unlike anything I know of. If you are using reg. polish to stamp with, wait till you see the difference! The image is so sharp!!!!! You will be lovin it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Full brand new nail polish from Konad (certified with Konad authentic seal) and works just as described! The price was also excellent! I will definitely be buying from them again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this 2 days ago fully expecting it to arrive the first week of October, surprise when I got it today (not even October  The polish works great and it&#x27;s a good amount, will buy again when it&#x27;s empty.</li>
    <li> This polish is extremely messy but it works for the Konad art.  I would suggest trying some of the other colors too.  Only the Konad polish works for stamping the art because I&#x27;ve tried using other brands but nothing else work.</li>
    <li> This was purchased as a gift, so I cannot verify the quality of the product, however, my transaction was great.  Item arrived quickly, was as described, and was a fair price.</li>
    <li> its konad stamping polish! need i say more!! lol. awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know why I needed a special polish for stamping but now I know why ! It&#x27;s the right consistency and works amazingly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and Konad makes it so easy.  I had my zebra nails done in no time.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> the color and consistency are good.&lt;br /&gt;it work alone or with konad stamper .&lt;br /&gt;but if you already have thick black polish there is no need to spend money on this</li>
    <li> the black is nice, but I cannot get this to stamp. The black bleeds everywhere; it&#x27;s more like oil than nail polish. Forget about cleanup, this sludge stains; BAD.</li>
    <li> love the product and especially loved the speedy delivery...thanks</li>
    <li> Good pigmentation, received on a timely basis, good price</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this black konad polish, omg  so beautiful, it&#x27;s dark and rich.  I am not sorry it really makes a big difference.  In love, I recommend this polish.</li>
    <li> Even though you may get lucky and be able to stumble upon other nail polishes that work with the stamping plates, if you use Konad stamps, you really must always have their black and white.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than normal polish when using to stamp!</li>
    <li> Nice thick polish to go with the stamps</li>
    <li> Works great.! If ure a beginner i highly recommend to get 2 of these.</li>
    <li> I really thought you could use any nail polish but i tried it and it wasnt that vibrant. This nail polish really works great and dries really fast.</li>
    <li> The Konad Nail stamping nail polish is thick it does not work very well[[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W Konad Nail Art Stamping Polish - Black]]. [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W Konad Nail Art Stamping Polish - Black]]</li>
    <li> I did not think this item wood be better than regular polish ustil I uses it. Well it is better. The pigment is alot darker and sharper when stamping. I did the same design on my nail and toe nails. The one with the konad polish was alot better!!! I will be purchasing more konad polish for stamping.</li>
    <li> This is a must stamping polish to have on hand along with the white one</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that I needed a specific polish for my stamping kit but works the same as regular nail polish</li>
    <li> Ordered this to go with the started KIT B I purchased, I got it for mainly the stamper part of this application.</li>
    <li> not a bad price and a good product love nail stamping very good price compared to in the salons and I&#x27;ve had it for months and it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Good polish but pricey.</li>
    <li> I love Konad.  I tried using regular black and white polish (Wet n&#x27; Wild Black Creme and White Cream) but they just didn&#x27;t work as well as the Konad brand polishes do.  It&#x27;s much easier to pick up the whole image with the Konad brand, and you get a crisp image every time.</li>
    <li> This polish is wonderful. When using, just dab on a little, it goes a LONG way! I will be buying Konad polishes again!</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of this black polish and also the white.  For some reason the black polish was much thinner and did not work well at all with the stamping.  I am very disappointed since it is non-returnable.  Guess I can use it as a regular polish instead of a stamping polish.</li>
    <li> This polish works very well with the Konad plates - my daughter has a lot of fun doing nail art.  Drugstore polish works ok too - you just have to try different brands,  but if Konad is around $5 with free shipping that is a good deal.</li>
    <li> After trying a ton of other black polishes to stamp with, this polish is the top of the line for image stamping on to base colored nails.</li>
    <li> Works great on any polish picks up the image does what it&#x27;s supposed to got here on time I would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> This Konad black is well worth the money if you are using it for nail stamping.  It dries quickly and makes excellent, crisp images.</li>
    <li> Great polish, shows up clean and thick. It actually does seem to show up darker than regular polish. I am happy I bought it ;)</li>
    <li> was super awesome for the plates that have the designees !</li>
    <li> Perfect for nail art designs! The stamper copied it perfectly! Way better than other nail polishes and definatley worth the price!</li>
    <li> good product for the most part, but does get very sticky and gloopy fairly quickly. only works a slight amount better than any other brand of black.</li>
    <li> I received a different bottle not like in the picture but i guess it&#x27;s the same size. Can&#x27;t really tell. The good thing is I have a spare konad black polish now.</li>
    <li> my favorite stamping polish and color. It is amazing! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I recommend the product and seller highly.</li>
    <li> arrived on time, i dont prefer the color at all but this was bought as a gift and she liked it just fine.</li>
    <li> I already loved the white, now black is one of my favorites too!!! It is thick and perfect for stamping!!! Goes on like the white in almost a thin sheet off the stamper!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try other colors!!! I will absolutely order this again!!!</li>
    <li> Works great! It definitely stamps darker then the other polishes ive used before!</li>
    <li> I choose this product to use for the nail art stamper. Great  designs for on the run. My grandchildren like it also.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other stamping polishes but I read many review that raved about this brand. It&#x27;s not expensive and worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this special polish!  I know people say you don&#x27;t need special polish to stamp, but I&#x27;m a newbie so this polish makes it really easy for me.  It comes out really dark and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to stamping but so far this is the best polish that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works well but smudges with top coat</li>
    <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
    <li> Works like supposed to</li>
    <li> I like this polish it seems to work pretty well. I ordered the red stamping polish also but it was no longer available. But I will recommend the black stamping polish</li>
    <li> Love the color. I bought this to do designs on my mother&#x27;s nails. She loves the New Orleans Saints so I try to do Fleur-de-lis on her nails and they look okay. I just need to learn how to do it better.</li>
    <li> The most important elements of this polish are that is is opaque and doesn&#x27;t dry quickly -- great for stamping! Be sure to use a thick gel-like topcoat to avoid smearing your designs.</li>
    <li> this is just as promised- its super black and stamps on any color. the only thing that is annoying is you need 100 cotton swabs to get off skin- would rather use for small single stamps then full ones</li>
    <li> If you are a Konad-er then use the best. Other polishes don&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;The thicker polishes work better on the Konad Plates.</li>
    <li> I am so happy i got konad stamping polish in black and white because they work so much better than regular polishes for stamping. I know some regular brands of polish work for stamping too and its a matter of just trial and error as to which colors work but as black and white are BASIC staples of stamping and designs its PERFECT to get these colors because this konad polish picks up GREAT on the stamper and looks great on my nails. The image is clearer and more opaque than it would be with many normal polishes. This black was an awesome purchase and a must have for any stamper set in my opinion!</li>
    <li> must have if you what to do nail stamping. best nail polish for stamping for starter</li>
    <li> Great Stamping Polish</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described, stamps wonderful!!!  I would definately recommend stampers get Konad nail polish for stamping. I have heard many complaints about stamping and how the images don&#x27;t come out fully and clean. I had this same problem when attempting to use other \\&quot;regular\\&quot; nail polishes. Konad nail polishes solved that problem for me entirely. My images are now clean, come out as seen on the imprint, and have a nice bold color. The black is a beautiful true black.</li>
    <li> Thought this nail polish would work better than other nail polishes for nail art stamping, but it does not. This nail polish is nothing special.</li>
    <li> My sister purcahsed this as so far no complaints the on it at all, looks like it was a good buy</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Good quality. Just what I was expecting. I highly recomend this product. you can buy it with the eyes closed</li>
    <li> I loved it works perfectly and quickly did not smudge cant wait to get the white one and any other col available</li>
    <li> i loved it! it works great and it super easy! i dont have to spend a lot of time fixing my nails now</li>
    <li> Works great color is nice and black.  Much thicker then regular nail polish for stamping. We didn&#x27;t know that you need special nail polish for stamping.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This works great!  So much better than black polish alone.</li>
    <li> I bought this pollish to do my own nails.  It is just the right thickness so I can do them myself instead of having to go to the nail salon.</li>
    <li> My mom was obsessed with stamping her nails so she decided to try this. Although we absolutely love this product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT important to get it because there are other regular nail polishes that work just as well as this one does. I&#x27;ve stamped my nails with China Glaze, Kleancolor and other drugstore brands. The art it in is the actualy scraping and stamping part. If that isn&#x27;t perfected then your stamps won&#x27;t come out properly whether you use this or another polish.</li>
    <li> I use this polish with my stamping stencils and it creates nice clear lines resulting in beautiful nails.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> not as great as expected!</li>
    <li> I use this color the most. konad is the best nail stamping polish i have tried so far.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. Its  thicker than I expected, that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t really love it, but I do like it. It does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with nail image plates - great coverage and darkness.  We&#x27;ve used it multiple times and it&#x27;s consistently excellent.  Thank you for this great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I got this and I still think the bottles for these Konad polishes are small, but the stamping polish does work like it should!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work on my stamp and plate I bought them because people have been telling me to try them. Sad I wasted my money</li>
    <li> I used to think stamping polishes were unnecessary, and that I could stamp with any polish. But these Konad polishes have changed my life. They&#x27;re opaque in one stamp and they transfer to the stamper perfectly. When I use regular polish to stamp, I have to scrape with very little pressure or all the polish comes out of the image, but with these polishes, I have to scrape with more force because the polish stays better in the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a lot of money to pay for a polish you only use for stamping, but if you&#x27;re looking to take your designs to the next level, I highly recommend using these polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought I would only get tiny bottles with not a lot in them but this 11 ml size is only slightly smaller than an Essie bottle, for reference.</li>
    <li> You need this if your are stenciling because it does not smear like some of the others. If your regular polish works, then great. If not, get this.</li>
    <li> the thicker consistency makes these perfect for stamping, i love nail art, and this is a must have!</li>
    <li> This black worked perfect with my bundle monster plates. It&#x27;s not for painting, just for stamping, and it does a great job stamping, also easy to clean up edges with a q-tip.  I&#x27;d not only recommend this, but I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> clean stamping product</li>
    <li> Works great and is very pigmented. Images cone out very crisp and clean with this polish. I have used the wet n wild brand in black cream (which is recommended by many as an alternative to black konad polish) and it works pretty good I was pretty satisfied. It is much darker than most regular black polishes she used for stamping. But then I tried konadand it&#x27;s  even better. It makes black cream look so much lighter. If u don&#x27;t want to spend the money on konad i suggest black cream or ebony hates Chris (I heard that works well too) by wet n wild. And as for white Sally Hansen extreme wear in white on is great. Its thick n gets even thicker as u use it. Haven&#x27;t tried konad white yet or any other colors but I plan to based on my gem rest experience with the black. The only reason I tried konad was because I couldn&#x27;t find black cream at my local Walmart so I ordered this. While I was waiting for it to arrive I found black cream so I bought it. I do love both :)</li>
    <li> This stamping polish works so much better than every regular black polish I&#x27;ve tried. Images stamped with this stuff are crisp and lines are well-defined. I&#x27;ll never go back! Before I bought it, my black stamping always came out a disappointing dark gray color. I&#x27;ve spent way too much extra time painting over stamped designs so they&#x27;re actually black. If you&#x27;re just getting into stamping, save yourself the headache and get this now!</li>
    <li> I tried to use the stamping kit with regular nail polish and gel nail polish, neither of them worked. But this works fine with the stamp kit! I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> Great for nail art stamping</li>
    <li> This nail polish works great, the quick dry. very easy, nice and looks great when put on with the rest of the kit. my only problem was my man tried to deliver it, but i was gone so he left a note saying there was postage due, so I had to wait til the post office was open (holiday weekend) and go there to pay an extra couple bucks to be able to be able to get it. so all in all i ended up paying $8, when it wouldve been cheaper to go buy this particular nail polish at a beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldve given this product 5 stars, if not for having to pay extra. so all in all poor seller.</li>
    <li> This polish really makes a difference on stamping love it!</li>
    <li> Everyone who has konad needs the black! It goes with everything and the designs you pick show up great! definitely a need for beginners!</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure if you \\&quot;NEED\\&quot; the special polish to use with your stamping plates I hope this helps you decide..before I did decide to purchase the Konad black nail art stamping polish I watched alot of videos that were about using regular polishes versus Konad polishes with the plates. Some people had great results with non-Konad polishes and some people said to definately buy the Konad polish to use with the plates. I bought some stamping plates by Konad online but since I was impatient for their arrival I bought a 2pack of plates from Wal-mart by FLIRT to try right away. I have about 20 bottles of nail polish,several different brand names, that have all been purchased within the last 3 months and are all brighter/darker colors (mostly greens,blues,pinks,oranges,purples,black) as I prefer those over lighter/pastel colors. I used every bottle of polish I have with the FLIRT brand of plates and I was not satisfied with the results. The image on the stamper either didn&#x27;t transfer well or when it did the design wasn&#x27;t that bright/dark on the stamper and hardly showed up at all on my nail. I thought maybe the Konad plates may be better quality plates so when they arrived I again used every bottle of polish I have on these plates and the designs did transfer completely each time but did not show up all that well on my nails. So.....I bought the Konad Art Stamping Polish in BLACK (thinking if Black didn&#x27;t give me good results no color of Konad would) and used it on both the FLIRT and KONAD plates and !WOW! what a huge wonderful result I got from both plates!! My thinking is this... the good results people achieve using non-Konad nail polish may just be due to an individual&#x27;s own fingernails. I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason other than that as to why some people have to use the KONAD nail polish and some can use any brand of polish to get the same results. So my advice would be this-if you already have a bottle of polish just try it and see (I would suggest a color with some darker color result on the nail as I have a blue polish that takes about 3 coats to look as dark as it does on the bottle)and if you do not get a nice dark noticable stamp on your nail then buy the KONAD polish because the difference I achieved was really like night and day and very well worth the money for the polish (which my bottle of Konad in black was only $4.20 with free shipping)!! I now will buy another prettier color of KONAD polish to use with my plates...and I now know that I can buy less expensive plates that work just as well as the KONAD plates (using the KONAD polish) and that will offset the cost of the sometimes higher priced polish needed to stamp my nails. I really hope this helps anyone who is as confused as I was about the need for the more expensive KONAD polish for the stamping plates. I have never left a product review before but since I tried to research ahead of time if I should buy the more expensive polish for my plates or not....I wanted to pass along my experience in case it may be of any help to someone. I would like to say again how lovely the stamp shows up on my nails I was so very pleased with the results! Sincerely,Tamerar with some darker color result on the nail as I have a blue polish that takes about 3 coats to look as dark as it does on the bottle)and if you do not get a nice dark noticable stamp on your nail then buy the KONAD polish because the difference I achieved was really like night and day and very well worth the money for the polish (which my bottle of Konad in black was only $4.20 with free shipping)!!

    <li> the konad stamp polish is so much better than using regular polish.  i stopped using regular polishes for stamping once i received my first konad white polish now i will not used any other.  the stamp just shows up better. i would suggest to buy one to see the difference.</li>
    <li> This product has to be the most bold one yet. I have all the colors Konad made for stamping and this one is certainly my favorite .</li>
    <li> Great for stenciling only, I think the polish is too thick for regular painting. No problem since that is what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> You can use other polishes for stamping, and I have done that for a very long time but for Christmas I decided to see what the hype was about Konad’s “special” polish. On YouTube, people said it was thicker therefore it seemed to adhere to the engraved design better than regular polish. I figured that other polishes were working and you could paint your nails with regular polish so why pay $6 bucks for polish you could only stamp with, right? NOW I KNOW WHY IT IS CALLED SPECIAL POLISH.  The design detail and the opaqueness of the design make it well-worth having a special polish. If I knew there was such a dramatic difference, I would have broke down earlier and purchased them.  These polishes are PERFECT if you purchase cheaper plates (therefore not as deeply engraved stamping plates). This polish works perfect for Cheeky plates!! The delivery was made two days before the estimated delivery day. Polish was well packaged and it arrived in the mailbox. How this helps.</li>
    <li> This polish is great not just for stamping but also for nail art. It is perfectly opaque and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it! It isn&#x27;t too thick either. Very workable.</li>
    <li> This is a paint specifically intended for use with the stamping plates, and it was HORRIBLE!  Dried faster than you could work with, unable to get a good stamp- instead it only took portions- bc it dried too fast- and ones I did get on my nail practically peel off when removing the stamper from nail. Maybe it&#x27;s just the one bottle/color (black) but I dont even want to bother with the others now. I&#x27;d say stick with regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> I prefer this bottle shape by Konad over the Princess shapes which tip easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a stamping polish, original black works wonderfully. It&#x27;s dark and stamps well. Konad special polish is way to viscous to be used as a normal polish, it is meant for stamping only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found later than any black nail polish works for stamping plates, as long as you work fast so the design does not dry in between scraping/transferring the design from plate to stamp. However, the special polish is perfect if you need to take your time, or you&#x27;re just beginning to use Konad plates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is perfect, and not see through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a good time to dry before applying top coat, and do not press on top coat brush or it&#x27;ll smear the design.</li>
    <li> amazing polishes for image stamping, its worth it just to buy these then use regular polishes which sometimes smears the image upon application</li>
    <li> If you do konad stamping I would just buy regular black nail polish at the drugstore. This polish doesn&#x27;t dry great and when you put a top coat over it the design smears. I use regular black polish to do konad stamping, don&#x27;t let people think you need special polish to use your stamp.</li>
    <li> I have used this more than once on a variety of different plates and it works well.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s really difficult to remove from skin, even with pure acetone.  I have small hands, thus small nail beds.  A full nail image covers all of my nail and a bit of skin...cleanup is a mess.  The polish smears around like tar.  I&#x27;ve used every remover and it takes a while (and a lot of scrubbing) to get it off of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great for stamping and you get a nice clear image.  I would also recommend that you get the Konad  top coat.  I use SV or butter London and they DO smear the Konad special polish.  I use the Konad top coat first, let it dry and then use my usual top coat.  You have to work quick with this stuff but it&#x27;s worth it for a nice, dark, crisp black.</li>
    <li> Since I was introduced to Konad nail art stamping polish, I have been completely satisfied every time I use it. I am going to try some of the other colors real soon. I look forward to purchasing more products where I can use Konad polish to complete the nail art designs I come up with. Thank you Dawn Sigfusson.</li>
    <li> amazing stamping color. If you are big in stamping invest in this color. You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, but be careful not to use too much...it can get a little smeary. And yes, I&#x27;ve used other kinds of black polish and they don&#x27;t smear the same way. Absolute best price anywhere.</li>
    <li> While all other nail polishes have the ability to stamp, not all of them can stamp clearly. They don&#x27;t all come out the same color that you see in the bottle either. We all know that we have to use two, sometimes three, coats to get our colors the way we want them. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t do that while stamping. With THIS nailpolish, you CAN!!! One coat, press and stamp and you&#x27;re done! it&#x27;s a bit pricey (compared to regular polish) but it&#x27;s truly worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Works ok but nothing special</li>
    <li> I did like this but the bottle dried up too quickly. It was closed tight. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s something I did or if I just got a bad bottle.</li>
    <li> Best Polish for stamping!</li>
    <li> It is thick, seems to be old. I had to add Acetone to make it thiner, same with the white color from Konad. I apply gel on top for shine, so, it is ok...</li>
    <li> Works very well with stampers.  It dries instantly and does not lift. Really liked it for the zebra print pattern.</li>
    <li> This item was purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend--and she&#x27;s absolutely DELIGHTED.</li>
    <li> A must buy for nail stamping lovers!!</li>
    <li> The product works very well</li>
    <li> My daughters and I use this with the Konad stamping plates and it works really well.  Nice coverage and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Excellent polish. Perfect for stamping nail art. Images are clear and detailed, perfect transfer.  you will be happy with this polish</li>
    <li> This polish was a joke, I was never able to stamp my nails because the polish wouldnt stick to the stamper.</li>
    <li> fast delivery.. just what i needed</li>
    <li> There is no match for both the black and white Konad stamping polishes.  Very opaque compared to other nail art polishes.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product and loved it! I got what I was expecting. I recomend this product!&lt;br /&gt;The services was excellent!</li>
    <li> It is easy to use.But you need to wait awhile before you put a top coat on or it will smear. The colors are great.</li>
    <li> This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Great stamping polish</li>
    <li> This polish works great.  Loved the thickness.  Must have for nail art stamping.  You can use regular polish for the stamper but don&#x27;t waste your time or frustration and go straight for the good stuff.</li>
    <li> Product was as described. Easy payment options and quick shippment. I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
    <li> if you do nail art with stampers, then make sure you have the right tools. nail polish included...regular nail polish does not work as well as this. this was intended for stamping.</li>
    <li> So strong of a color and transfer. Lasts very long, needs a special topcoat but it dries fast and the images shows up good on any color</li>
    <li> Would order this again, love this stuff for my nail art stamping.</li>
    <li> Tried other black polishes for stamping and they did not come out dark or crisp. This one works the best.</li>
    <li> Dries fast so work quick...  But dying fast is a good thing.  I like it.  Other regular polishes I tried didn&#x27;t work.  Maybe it&#x27;s the type I used.  So in sticking with this.</li>
    <li> I know that you can use regular polish for stamp and I was doing it, but I decided give it a try. Let me tellyou this thing is great, stamps all the way, the color is real bold . I using it with konad and cheeky sets and so far to good.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was as expected. Very happy.</li>
    <li> The Konad nail stamping polish is great. The only thing I would change about it, is the pricing. Bring the prices down lower.  You&#x27;ll get more customer&#x27;s that way.</li>
    <li> I compared this with my black nail polish and the stamp comes out much thicker in color. I am definitely sticking to this.</li>
    <li> Although Konad is great for my nail stamping plates, I think regular (super pigmented) black nail polish could do as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that Konad black nail art stamping polish is thick enough to scrape well into the plates to get an almost-to-perfect even coat for a smooth transfer from plate to stamp to nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-dries fairly quickly&lt;br /&gt;-very pigmented/black&lt;br /&gt;-thick (but not too thick)&lt;br /&gt;-glossy&lt;br /&gt;-good amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-pricier than regular black nail polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than most regular black nail polishes, Konad nail art stamping plate gives a clear transfer (most of the time). Give it a try and see how you like it.</li>
    <li> Delivered earlier than expected. Works pretty good, but must work fast with it.</li>
    <li> This is great nail stamping polish until you put top coat on and then it gets smeared bad, unless you use it with the gel polish then the gel top coat doesn&#x27;t smear it!</li>
    <li> Perfect black stamping polish, but you have to work quickly or it will dry before you can pick up the stamp.</li>
    <li> Product was as described and shipped fast!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as any regular black nail polish</li>
    <li> It was hard to use and stamp onto my nail. Don&#x27;t know if it was me or the product.</li>
    <li> First time I had my nails stamped! My nail lady did fabulous !!! I&#x27;m addicted ! She got hers from London not sure if that matters but fyi</li>
    <li> Worked for about a month and than dried out! Bought a few of this brand and all did the same!</li>
    <li> This nail polish works great with the Konad plate template. I&#x27;ve had this on my nails for a week now &amp; it still looks great. I wash dishes a lot &amp; the paint still hasn&#x27;t chipped off! This is a must order product with any Konad stamper and/or plate template.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty awesome product :) I just used it a couple times but it is exactly what I wanted. It might cost a little bit more but it works and I like to keep my stamping polish seperate from my painting polish :)</li>
    <li> The Konad line works very well for stamping.  I had read this in other reviews, and this has proved true for us as well.</li>
    <li> compared to other black polish, this one works the best on stamped nails - we have tried other brands and for some reason the Konad is hands down the darkest - good buy</li>
    <li> My stamps show up crisp and clear when I use this polish, others can come close but his one is really the best.</li>
    <li> This Konad BLACK stamping polish is definitely  worth getting. It stamps really easily and is very opaque. The white is useless though.</li>
    <li> I prefer konad for stamping. I have found a few instant dry polishes that are ok, but they&#x27;re never as good as this brand. I really like this black.</li>
    <li> Does not stamp as well as I would like.  It may be a bit old.  For the price I paid I can not leave negative feedback.</li>
    <li> This came ahead of schedule.  I did not expect it till later this week but it came in time for christmas</li>
    <li> The Seller was great &amp; I got my package before time and it was wrapped well. It arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The stamping polish itself did not work well for me. The designs were cut off and came out blurred. I used regular thick polish and the designs came out clean and perfect. Will not purchase this polish again. Will use seller again if I find something I like.</li>
    <li> I bought a set of Konad plates about 6 months ago, i never used them because no nail polish was thick and pigmented enough to do the job. Finally i realized that only Konad can do this job, cause it&#x27;s made for it. They know what they are doing-lol.</li>
    <li> GREAT QUALITY, A+,item as described.</li>
    <li> i love mine. i use it all the time with my nail stamps and it works perfectly every time! it shows up really well and makes my nail images really pop!</li>
    <li> LOVE KONAD POLISH! I have a regular black polish that stamps ok but this polish actually stands out!  After using konad special polish I wouldn&#x27;t go back! It makes all my stamp designs stand out and isn&#x27;t that the whole point??? I even got the newer pretty bottle. I WILL be buying this again.</li>
    <li> this nail polish is very special for the conad plates, and i like better than other polishes ... so i recommend this one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly baffled as to why ppl say that the konad stamping polishes are expensive.  I&#x27;ve paid more for high-end normal polish.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too pricey, even if it&#x27;s for stamping only. Moyou Polishes are more expensive than konad.  I&#x27;m all for cheaper alternatives, but the konad black and white are the best on the market.</li>
