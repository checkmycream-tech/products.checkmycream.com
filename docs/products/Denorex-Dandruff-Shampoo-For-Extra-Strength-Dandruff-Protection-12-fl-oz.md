### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is perfect but now they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
      <li>The shampoo/condition itself is excellent and does what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not all dandruff shampoos are alike, so you may need to experiment with them to find the one that works best for you.  </li>
      <li>So, they don&#x27;t sell excellent products like Denorex.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was so happy to find this through an Amazon merchant.</li>
      <li>My scalp is no longer itchy and I&#x27;m quite happy with this product.</li>
      <li>its great, not what i was looking for but is good</li>
      <li>was amazing</li>
      <li>I recommend leaving it on for a couple minutes to let it work, and I&#x27;ve also been using a 50% water/apple cider vinegar rinse, which also helps (and is a really nice conditioner).</li>
      <li>Places like CVS and others like it try to sell you their own products.</li>
      <li>Have tried others and find them not as effective in reducing flaking from  the scalp.</li>
      <li>Here are some examples of some effective over-the-counter shampoos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff has a strong smell, it isn&#x27;t good</li>
      <li>Plus the price of the item is more like a 12 oz price.</li>
      <li>Mostly, I like the way it works.  </li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s been a life saver.</li>
      <li>So glad that I can order this on-line.</li>
      <li>I tried many dandruff shampoos and home remedies to get rid of it</li>
      <li>However, I cannot find it in most stores.</li>
      <li>The product is an 8 oz Denorex bottle that has 50% more free.</li>
      <li>It has a strong smell to it, but I like the smell</li>
      <li>I have some kind of super dandruff, it started when I was in elementary school</li>

      <li>You get this promptly, in nice big bottles.</li>
      <li>I have used Denorex coal tar shampoo for years and highly recommend it to those who need a strong dandruff shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It leaves my hair nice and soft and rinses out completely.</li>
      <li>I suspect may have caused (or contributed) to the itchy scalp problem in the first place.</li>

      <li>Very difficult to find at any chain drug stores or super markets any more.  </li>
      <li>Denorex is my favorite shampoo&amp;#62;  I had a very hard time finding it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been washing my hair with it more or less daily for the past week, and it&#x27;s working really well.</li>
      <li>The manufacturer apparently feels the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version with conditioner is the only one they want to make anymore,(at least in a practical size), and it&#x27;s just not comparable to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> I have been using this shampoo for many years and it has worked very well for me. However, I cannot find it in most stores. Places like CVS and others like it try to sell you their own products. So, they don&#x27;t sell excellent products like Denorex. It is a bad business practice because I have to buy on line what I would have bought at their stores.</li>
    <li> It was my error..I thought you received an additional 12 oz bottle. In my opinion, this is false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;I am not commenting on the product, I have not yet try it.  Just on the sellers portrayal.</li>
    <li> Me llego la compra en la fecha prometida y el producto fue exactamente el que solicite, en buen estado, lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> Denorex is my favorite shampoo&amp;#62;  I had a very hard time finding it.  It is no longer available in stores.</li>
    <li> The product performs as advertised, and I now can wear black shirts again without feeling like I need to brush off my shoulders every few minutes.</li>
    <li> It is perfect but now they don&#x27;t make it anymore. The new one has conditioner in it which does not work for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried this non-coal tar formultion and find it does not work as well as the coal-tar brand.  The active ingredient is salicylic acid (an aspirin derivative).  If you find this product does not work for you, there are other active ingredients to try (see below).  One coal-tar shampoo I really like is Denorex [[ASIN:B000GD024A Denorex Dandruff Shampoo for Therapeutic Dandruff Protection, Original Strength - 4 Oz]] For more information on coal-tar shampoos check out the Denorex product previously mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all dandruff shampoos are alike, so you may need to experiment with them to find the one that works best for you.  Here are some examples of some effective over-the-counter shampoos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coal-tar preparations (Denorex, Neutrogena T/Gel, Tegrin)&lt;br /&gt;Pyrithione zinc (Suave Dandruff Control, Pert Plus Dandruff Control, Head &amp; Shoulders)&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid and sulfur (T-Sal, lonil T, Sebulex)&lt;br /&gt;Selenium sulfide (Selsun, Exsel)&lt;br /&gt;Ketoconazole (Nizoral A-D) available as a 1% over-the-counter shampoo and a 2% prescription-strength shampoo. This is an anti-fungal preparation which really works for some people when nothine else will.&lt;br /&gt;For really stubborn dandruff cases you may need to use a prescription lotion or shampoo from your doctor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people with danfruff need to shampoo with a medicated shampoo daily.  I have used Denorex coal tar shampoo for years and highly recommend it to those who need a strong dandruff shampoo.  It has a strong smell to it, but I like the smell and so does my wife.  Mostly, I like the way it works.  It keeps my scalp free of itching and flakes and that is what I want in a dandruff shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim Koenig</li>
    <li> For some reason, this shampoo has become difficult to find.  It is the one my hubby prefers over anything else.  The manufacturer apparently feels the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version with conditioner is the only one they want to make anymore,(at least in a practical size), and it&#x27;s just not comparable to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find this through an Amazon merchant. HBA Zone delivered in a timely manner and I would order from them again.</li>
    <li> I use this product to keep my itchy scalp condition under control.  I can no longer find it in stores without conditioner added.  So glad that I can order this on-line.</li>
    <li> This has worked for me for years.  Have tried others and find them not as effective in reducing flaking from  the scalp.</li>
    <li> And this is the only way to buy! Why pay 3 times this amount for the same item at the drug store?  You get this promptly, in nice big bottles. So if you need to dandruf shampoo daily, this is the only way to go!</li>
    <li> The product is an 8 oz Denorex bottle that has 50% more free. You receive a bottle of 12 oz in total. This was not clear from the ad. Plus the price of the item is more like a 12 oz price.</li>
    <li> I have some kind of super dandruff, it started when I was in elementary school and I&#x27;ve had it ever since. I tried many dandruff shampoos and home remedies to get rid of it (FYI coconut oil doesn&#x27;t work on dandruff), my scalp was SO flaky and itchy and embarrassing I had &amp;#34;dandruff cure&amp;#34; on my Christmas list to Santa for 3 years (no joke, I was a desperate kid). When my dad got me Denorex to try it was amazing, it made a huge difference within 2 weeks and about 2 months later it was completely gone. I&#x27;ve found that the dandruff will come back within a few months if I stop using the shampoo but hey, as long as I have Denorex to use on a regular basis I don&#x27;t get flakes. This stuff has a strong smell, it isn&#x27;t good but it&#x27;s not unbearable and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair stink after it&#x27;s washed out. I&#x27;ve been using Denorex for 8 years and I absolutely love it, it&#x27;s been a life saver.</li>
    <li> its great, not what i was looking for but is good</li>
    <li> Ordered the \\&quot;non coal tar\\&quot; version of Denorex, unaware there were different formulas on the market. Found this version (with an orange cap) to sting eyes more than the coal tar mix, to the point that I was unable to wear contact lenses for a day. Happy to see the coal tar mix is still available (green cap) and just ordered it.</li>
    <li> I have used Denorex for years and now Amazon is the only place I can find it! It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my dandruff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy scalp that wouldn&#x27;t go away and I was looking for Nutrogena T-Sal, but found this and decided to give it a try because it has 3% salacytic acid like T-Sal. I&#x27;ve been washing my hair with it more or less daily for the past week, and it&#x27;s working really well. I recommend leaving it on for a couple minutes to let it work, and I&#x27;ve also been using a 50% water/apple cider vinegar rinse, which also helps (and is a really nice conditioner). My scalp is no longer itchy and I&#x27;m quite happy with this product. It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: now it&#x27;s a month after I started using the Denorex and the itchy scalp problem is gone. It might come back if I started using a regular shampoo, I don&#x27;t know, but the Denorex is fine. I&#x27;m a convert to the water/vinegar rinse. It leaves my hair nice and soft and rinses out completely. I&#x27;m finished with those gloppy \\&quot;conditioners\\&quot; that do not rinse out and I suspect may have caused (or contributed) to the itchy scalp problem in the first place.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to find at any chain drug stores or super markets any more.  Love the bonus volume, exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years. The shampoo/condition itself is excellent and does what it claims to do. However, I travel. A 12 oz. bottle is too unwieldy. The TSA limits travelers to a 3.4 ounce (100ml) bottle or less (by volume) in carry-on luggage. Why isn&#x27;t it available in a 3-ounce size? There is a 4-ounce size (for some reason), but Amazon (for some reason) doesn&#x27;t sell it eligible for Amazon Prime.  For those reasons, I have to downgrade my review by two stars, for the size/packaging and shipping problems.</li>
    <li> My head itched and burned until I washed my hair again with real shampoo Selsun Blue is much much better</li>
