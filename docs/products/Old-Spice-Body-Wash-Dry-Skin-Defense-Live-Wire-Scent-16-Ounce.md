      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>Skin feels great after using.  </li>

      <li>I have tried many others, but nothing compares.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my husband and after he used it a couple of times, he told me (more than once) how he loves this body wash.</li>

      <li>We will be loyal customers forever!</li>
      <li>It feels like lotion, but lathers up real well and has a nice, not too strong, scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it&#x27;s not gelly it still lathers up well and smells great but is not gelly like other body washes and has a light clean refreshing manly scent.</li>
      <li>It is not even available on P&amp;G website.</li>
      <li>It is also available on their website.</li>
      <li>I always loved Old Spice and got this on the warehouse deal</li>
      <li>Thank you so much Amazon for carrying products that the consumer LOVES and also for offering additional savings on this item through subscribe and save!!!</li>
      <li>It smells great and keeps skin from getting dry.  </li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it would help get me clean and keep my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>Old spice is good brand, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the fragrance of this body wash.</li>
      <li>it cleans me up, smells good and does not dry out my skin.</li>
      <li>Most will dry you out, but this body wash has a pleasant smell and really keeps the moistare in your skin!</li>
      <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to any guy looking for a fresh clean smell that also keeps your skin from drying out.</li>
      <li>keeps me fresh and clean, just wish that they would sell it in the stores again, of course it is cheaper to buy on here</li>
      <li>/&gt;But now, after a good few years, Walmart started carrying this again, for a MUCH better price.</li>
      <li>The scent is mild, no fancy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents like Axe brand products.  </li>
      <li>This body wash smells pretty good and is much better at not drying out my skin than other brands.</li>
      <li>The promise of softer skin or whatever is pretty accurate, but it&#x27;s not some miracle product.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t get me very clean and the water washed it right off before i had a chance to really scrub.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really helps with extremely dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Previously I had bought the Gillette hydration body wash and had good success with it getting me clean</li>
      <li>dad was right</li>
      <li>It works very well, it does what it says it will leave you clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>Would like more different scents to choose from.</li>
      <li>Just wish I could find it at more local retailers.</li>
      <li>I looked here and sure enough, amazon was the place!</li>
      <li>I was glad that the two pack was finally done after some weeks.</li>
      <li>At first, it felt thicker than a body wash should feel, although it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s leaving a residue.  </li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying more when he runs out.</li>
      <li>The scent is a woodsy, men&#x27;s soap smell that I found actually helps to block odors throughout the day better than advertised \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; body washes.</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite old spice body wash.</li>
      <li>I tried this bodywash while looking for something to help generally with dry skin and that smelled good.</li>
      <li>Since I started using this again I don&#x27;t get an itchy back at all, pretty good for dry Colorado winter weather.</li>
      <li>You made my husband&#x27;s day when that little brown box with the smiley face arrived and inside was his favorite, coveted, body wash!</li>
      <li>These chemicals are toxic in their pure form and cause eczema like symptoms.</li>
      <li>its a creamier soap that stays on your skin long enough to scrub and also does a better job getting you clean.</li>
      <li>wash a lot because it really does moisturize.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s just about as cheap as my local Wal-Mart</li>
      <li>After using it now, he really preers it over the others.</li>
      <li>the scent along with the fact it doesn&#x27;t dry you out makes this an easy winner...</li>
      <li>Different than all the other Old Spice scents, but still smells really good.</li>
      <li>The smell is definitely slight making it better if you wear cologne</li>
      <li>It really makes you feel clean, and not too dry after use.  </li>
      <li>I first tried the old spice body wash being a long time loyal fan to their products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s solved the problem completely, but it has certainly helped.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not overwhelming, it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong</li>
      <li>I bought this for my spouse a few years ago and fell in love.</li>
      <li>To my surprised it did not do a very good job at all taking the dirty residue off my arms and hands.</li>
      <li>It provides a lot of lather and feels very soft on the skin.  </li>
      <li>This is the first body wash I&#x27;ve found where I can actually tell a difference.  </li>

    <li> Best body wash I&#x27;ve found...hands-down...the scent along with the fact it doesn&#x27;t dry you out makes this an easy winner...This particular scent can be hard to find in the store...and is cheaper here on Amazon...Forget about the others...try this and you&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> This is by far one of the best mens body washes out. Smell is not too strong and the most important thing! It will not dry out your skin! Most will dry you out, but this body wash has a pleasant smell and really keeps the moistare in your skin!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and after he used it a couple of times, he told me (more than once) how he loves this body wash. He likes the texture and the way his skin feels and the scent that is left after using it.</li>
    <li> Only Amazon can save me! I bought this for my fiance at target and he loved it. I dug it because it smells amazing and it lasted on him all day. I went back two weeks later and it was gone off the shelves. I looked here and sure enough, amazon was the place! I love that it is a 2 pack and I love that it&#x27;s so yummy. This is a for sure must have soap! I&#x27;m now placing my 2nd order. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> if u have dry skin and have too much testosterone goin on to apply skin lotion....this is for you!!....I dont recommend anything ...but felt compelled to let everyone know. my elbows were like brillo and now..soft! old spice huh??...dad was right</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my skin being very dry, no matter what the season.  This is the first body wash I&#x27;ve found where I can actually tell a difference.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s solved the problem completely, but it has certainly helped.  I like the smell as well.</li>
    <li> Another Old Spice product you can&#x27;t find. What gives? I like this body wash a lot because it really does moisturize. However, You can&#x27;t find it. I went on the Old Spice website and could not find it? Maybe I overlooked it. That&#x27;s possible. I just want to buy it, but if they discontinued it, what is the shelf life of this stuff?</li>
    <li> This is the only body wash my boyfriend likes.  It smells great and keeps skin from getting dry.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.  Will definitely be buying more when he runs out.</li>
    <li> I tried this bodywash while looking for something to help generally with dry skin and that smelled good. This bodywash proved to be effective. Though I would recommend something stronger for very dry skin, this helps as a general daily moisturizer, especially helpful if you&#x27;re like me and live somewhere with harsh, dry winters.   The scent is a woodsy, men&#x27;s soap smell that I found actually helps to block odors throughout the day better than advertised \\&quot;deodorant\\&quot; body washes. The best way to use this is to wash and lather into the skin for 20-30 seconds, then you get the effects of the product. I would recommend trying this out, it&#x27;s a good way to keep your whole body moisturized.</li>
    <li> I had noticed my skin getting drier at the onset of winter.  Working in the elements occasionally, and washing my hands often, had really taken a toll on my skin.  I read reviews and purchased to keep my skin from cracking open.  After three weeks of use, I can&#x27;t tell any difference.  There is a build up of the lotion component in the shower making it more apt to cleaning.  The smell is definitely slight making it better if you wear cologne but I thought it was a bit medicine-like.  I had a better response from Axe Snake Peel but the smell is a strong.  This product has obviously worked for some, but I didn&#x27;t have the same result.</li>
    <li> Okay, smells weird and didnt really do anything for dry skin. I was glad that the two pack was finally done after some weeks.</li>
    <li> Tengo una esponja le aplico el Body Wash y me baño, sales oliendo súper bien y la piel súper suave.</li>
    <li> really like this body wash and have been buying through amazon for 6 months, i found it at a big chain store for under $4</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite old spice body wash. It really makes you feel clean, and not too dry after use.  With only a pack of 2 it is decently expensive here, but I prefer it over the other old spice varieties.</li>
    <li> This is just what I wanted.  I think it&#x27;s just about as cheap as my local Wal-Mart and I didn&#x27;t have to deal with crowds.  Great!</li>
    <li> My husband fell in love with this body wash once I bought it for him at Target. When I went back a couple of weeks later to restock, I was devastated to see that they weren&#x27;t carrying it anymore. My husband was so bummed, especially since after trying about 30 other body washes, he had finally found his favorite in this one. On a whim one day, I searched for it on Amazon and was beyond ecstatic when it popped up and was instock! Thank you so much Amazon for carrying products that the consumer LOVES and also for offering additional savings on this item through subscribe and save!!! You made my husband&#x27;s day when that little brown box with the smiley face arrived and inside was his favorite, coveted, body wash! We will be loyal customers forever!</li>
    <li> My hubby loves it !   He says it smells nice, kinda manly , still moisturizing his body so well .   He&#x27;s been using this product ever since last spring yet he loves it.   I am so glad We got this great deal from amazon.com  Thank you amazon.com !!</li>
    <li> I bought this one to help with my dry skin, and to try the new Old Spice sent. When this stuff comes out it almost looks like alien goo. It does not lather on well, and it does not smell as well as I was hoping. For the money I was pretty disappointed. I will stay with Dove or Nivea for men.</li>
    <li> Seems to moisturize, smells good, cleans fine.  Good price.  No complaints.  The smell is not overwhelming, it doesn&#x27;t smell very strong so if you like something like Axe this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> I first tried the old spice body wash being a long time loyal fan to their products. I would have to say for the winter time it hydrates my skin and keeps me smelling good all day. I recommend this to any guy looking for a fresh clean smell that also keeps your skin from drying out. Plus my gf loves the smell.</li>
    <li> Winter is coming and so is the four month window of dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and all is well.  The scent is great and the consistency works great for putting on a loofa.  Some body washes are far too runny, this is not.  Others which are supposed to moisturize feel no different than just body lotion, with very little lather and leaving me feeling unclean.</li>
    <li> Old spice is good brand, I&#x27;m just not crazy about the fragrance of this body wash. But it was a good buy for the price.</li>
    <li> love this product. The scent is nice and strong but not over powering. It helps with the dry skin that I get during the winter. Just wish I could find it at more local retailers. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> The soap smells great, but it leaves a film on your skin that takes a lot of rinsing to get off.  I suspect that as it is for \\&quot;Skin defense\\&quot; it has more lotion in it than soap.  Will use it, but not likely to get it again.</li>
    <li> I work in an industrial environment and get covered in welding soot and greasy residue. I bought this hoping it would help get me clean and keep my skin moisturized. To my surprised it did not do a very good job at all taking the dirty residue off my arms and hands. Previously I had bought the Gillette hydration body wash and had good success with it getting me clean so I expected the same from old spice. It smelled good but that was the extent of it. It didn&#x27;t get me very clean and the water washed it right off before i had a chance to really scrub. For the same price I would go with the Gillette body wash. its a creamier soap that stays on your skin long enough to scrub and also does a better job getting you clean. May be this will be my weekend soap when I don&#x27;t need to get nasty welding residue off myself.I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and not made for the working man.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my spouse a few years ago and fell in love. Of course I was never able to find it again locally. We tried a few different scents but it was never quite right. I happened to come across a subscription offer on this last year and we&#x27;ve been on auto delivery ever since</li>
    <li> If you have allergies to MI/MCI, then this product will mess you up. These chemicals are toxic in their pure form and cause eczema like symptoms. I did not know I was allergic to these chemicals until I used this product. The lotion in the product traps the chemicals on your skin for a prolonged period of time, unlike other products that contain MI/MCI. Basically it gave me chemical burn, burning my skin, weakened my lungs and caused dizziness after several days of use. The product has already been banned in a lot of places. Use caution when using this product. Obviously it does not effect everyone the same way.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in hopes of helping with the usual winter dry skin.  I had never seen it locally in a store, so this was a blind purchase.  I have been very satisfied with the scent and feel of this body wash.  It provides a lot of lather and feels very soft on the skin.  As for the dry skin, it has helped some in that regard.  I would purchase it again though just for the scent and good lather that it provides.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it.  It smells great and really helps with extremely dry skin.  We are both from African ancestry and require heavier moisturizers for our skin.  Since he is on the darker end of the spectrum finding suitable products that do not irritate and are not drying can be difficult. And ladies the smell is soooo awesome.  I find myself wanting to cuddle closer to him at night after he showers.  I would definitely suggest that you purchase the product through Amazon because it is quite pricey in-stores even at Walmart (about $5-$8 per bottle).</li>
    <li> A pretty decent body wash, and does help a little with dry skin, not in any means a miracle cure, but does help.</li>
    <li> Scent is a little more subtle than the high endurance body wash and I think it smells good.  It also lathers quite well.  Skin feels great after using.  The promise of softer skin or whatever is pretty accurate, but it&#x27;s not some miracle product.  Solid body wash if you can find a deal on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body wash for years now. I have tried many others, but nothing compares. It does not dry out your skin, and leaves you feeling refreshed for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They used to make a blue version of this product, which had a much nicer fragrance, but P&amp;G stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It used to be very hard to find this. It is not even available on P&amp;G website. It was always a pain to order, and to remember to order before I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now, after a good few years, Walmart started carrying this again, for a MUCH better price. I picked some up today. It is also available on their website. I&#x27;m  glad about that!!</li>
    <li> keeps me fresh and clean, just wish that they would sell it in the stores again, of course it is cheaper to buy on here</li>
    <li> I like this product and would consider buying it again with a coupon.  It comes out a bit thick due to the spout opening, so it may not last as long as expected.</li>
    <li> I always loved Old Spice and got this on the warehouse deal and I think i got two for under $8 and love it. It smell really good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long. It smell really good in the shower but once you wash the soap away so does the smell :( which is sorta disappointing because I like when the smell to atleast last till you put clothes on.</li>
    <li> This body wash smells pretty good and is much better at not drying out my skin than other brands. Since I started using this again I don&#x27;t get an itchy back at all, pretty good for dry Colorado winter weather. I used to buy the blue version of this body wash because it smelled even better but for some reason they stopped making it a while back, it was a sad day for me.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it off amazon, YET. But I plan to because I recently purcashed this product on sale at Target for one bottle at $3.99 plus tax.  It works very well, it does what it says it will leave you clean and moisturized. I love the way it&#x27;s not gelly it still lathers up well and smells great but is not gelly like other body washes and has a light clean refreshing manly scent. Works awesome makes using lotion an option!</li>
    <li> I like using Old Spice products because of the quality and the scents they offer, but was frustrated because my skin dried out when I used their products.  I was happy to find this product because it does not dry out my skin.  It feels like lotion, but lathers up real well and has a nice, not too strong, scent.  I would recommend this to anyone who has dry skin.</li>
    <li> At first, it felt thicker than a body wash should feel, although it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s leaving a residue.  Lathers up well and stays on your skin until you rinse it off.  The scent is mild, no fancy &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents like Axe brand products.  The moisturizing quality makes it usable as a shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t dry out hair from daily use.  Would like more different scents to choose from.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim here at Amazon. It was on sale at a really good price - much cheaper than in the stores. My husband has been using Old Spice body washes for years, but had never tried it. After using it now, he really preers it over the others. He says it does help keep his skin more moisturized. It is a creamier body wash but it rinses off easily and doesn&#x27;t build up on the skin. The scent is light and fresh. Different than all the other Old Spice scents, but still smells really good. We will stick with this one, especially for the winter months when his skin is the driest.</li>
    <li> This body wash is my fovorite!  It feels good on my skin after I shower with it and it doesn&#x27;t lave my skin dry.  I love the smell too.  My girlfriend thinks it smells so good I don&#x27;t need to bother with cologne.  The smell doesn&#x27;t radiate off of me like cologne does but if someone is close enough they&#x27;ll smell it.  I like that I don&#x27;t have to use as much as other body washes to get the amount I need to lather up.  All in all it cleans me up, smells good and does not dry out my skin.</li>
