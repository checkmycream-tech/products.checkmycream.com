      <li>This is such a great product for everyone</li>
      <li>It helped my hair smooth out but cannot over use product as beginning to have adverse effects on my hair after 6 months continuous use of the product line</li>

      <li>If I use it after I get my hair done, my hair stays soft for the better part of a month.</li>
      <li>and it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I tend to use the conditioner maybe once or twice a week after first bleaching &amp; if my hair is super fried</li>
      <li>Have spent thousands of dollars at salon &amp; on product lines, nothing works better, nothing comes close!</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but it is different.</li>
      <li>Box came exactly as described.</li>
      <li>spending a minimum of 2 hours in treatment application and hair drying/ironing, only to wait 4 more days to wash the product out.  </li>
      <li>had been opened many times (red flags).  </li>
      <li>I received this product as a present and worked magically</li>
      <li>This is the first review I have posted</li>
      <li>I can purchase it cheaper here and do the same process more often.</li>
      <li>hair is so much stronger, softer and healthier after just two applications.</li>
      <li>These didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really like th Awapuhi Line.</li>
      <li>Highly recomend!</li>
      <li>This product had absolutely neither.  </li>
      <li>I used a sulfate free keratin conditioner instead and left it on for about 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>My salon charges $30 for one treatment so this is a real money saver to do it myself.</li>
      <li>, i like this so much, i will buy again.</li>
      <li>Its not the real thing.</li>
      <li>and it improve my hair so much</li>
      <li>Upon opening, the PM Awapuhi Keratriplex box was VERY beat up which couldn&#x27;t have happened during shipping with how well it was packaged up</li>
      <li>This left my hair super soft, the ends were as if I had gotten a fresh hair cut.</li>
      <li>I apply to clean wet hair and cover with a hot towel for 30 minutes.  </li>
      <li>and this product has definitely helped to get my hair back to a healthy state.</li>
      <li>The one I opened and used had no discernible smell AT ALL which is NOT what I expected considering how strong the intensive moisturizing treatment smells.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
      <li>Has helped my damaged hair more than any other product when used in combination with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin treatment</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have soft and silky hair.</li>
      <li>If only using the vials show a tremendous difference in the feel of my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine how soft it will be using both products together.</li>
      <li>BUT more is not better.</li>
      <li>saw her hair changed to be smooth and less fracture, so i bought this item.</li>
      <li>This has helped my damaged hair recover and makes my hair so soft.  </li>
      <li>This product makes your hair incredibly soft.</li>
      <li>Further, it didnt smell like the real one.</li>
      <li>I really can not rate this product since I have not used it until I receive the second treatment.  </li>
      <li>(it looked like it was old and had been kicked around).</li>
      <li>This stuff always makes my hair feel like rabbit fur when used with the Wild Ginger Keratin Intensive treatment</li>
      <li>, I can&#x27;t imagine how soft it will be using both products together.</li>
      <li>I tried the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratiplex treatment vials.  </li>
      <li>It is a professional line tht you will not find in stores</li>
      <li>It really helps your hair but if you use too often the dryness comes back.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but good.  </li>
      <li>It had absolutely no scent and actually made my hair more brittle and dry than before using it.  </li>
      <li>I was ready to apply the product Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratriplex Treatment Vials when reading the directions It said to apply a vial or two and later apply the second treatment Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Treatment.</li>
      <li>I constantly flat iron my hair &amp; bleach out chunks to almost pure white (I&#x27;m a red head naturally</li>
      <li>This treatment wins hands down!</li>
      <li>My roots are straight and my hair is bouncy and soft after I use all 4 of these products on my hair, blow dry, and use the flat iron.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did the job well done</li>
    <li> I love this product. It saved my hair after a bad &amp;#34;Japanese Perm&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using brazilian keratin treatment for a few years now...spending a minimum of 2 hours in treatment application and hair drying/ironing, only to wait 4 more days to wash the product out.  I tried the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratiplex treatment vials.  At the time, I did not have the Intensive Keratine Treatment which should be the 2nd step to the process.  I used a sulfate free keratin conditioner instead and left it on for about 30 minutes.  The results were amazing...I can&#x27;t wait to use the 2 step process with both Paul Mitchell products.  If only using the vials show a tremendous difference in the feel of my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine how soft it will be using both products together.</li>
    <li> This product makes your hair incredibly soft. It is great right after getting your hair dyed.... If I use it after I get my hair done, my hair stays soft for the better part of a month.</li>
    <li> ive used all the 10 vials that came in the box.  I also used the Keratin intensive care treatment together with the vials.  I believe that this is a great product.  It always leaves my hair so shiny and silky.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but good.  I bring it to my hair stylists and she puts in on after i color my hair.  It works well when you put it on and get under a hair dryer with some heat.  You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> Product was in perfect condition upon purchase and arrived on time. It helped my hair smooth out but cannot over use product as beginning to have adverse effects on my hair after 6 months continuous use of the product line</li>
    <li> I received this product as a present and worked magically so I opted for buying it out of this link. Unfortunately the product was tempered, the bottle was sealed with ordinary tape and the product inside was lighter than the original one and smelled nothing like the original Awapuhi Wild Ginger. Beware!!!!!!   :(  http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_wr_but_top?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;nodeID&#x3D;&amp;asin&#x3D;B004JQXKVW  :(</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this product (from this seller) stating their disappointment in the product before I made the purchase...shame on me, I gave it a shot anyway.  The product has to be fake.  It had absolutely no scent and actually made my hair more brittle and dry than before using it.  The official product site raves about the wonderful scent and results.  This product had absolutely neither.  I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and waited to use the Step 1 (this product) until I had purchased the Step 2. This is the first review I have posted &amp; it&#x27;s because of the poor, fake expensive mistake that I made that I want to prevent others from doing the same.</li>
    <li> Made my hair stronger. I recommend!</li>
    <li> These are a fake, the real Keratriplex vials are a professional only item and cannot be sold to anyone who is not  a licensed cosmetologist.</li>
    <li> Product works as promised. But will not repair ends that are already split. Adds strength and moisture to weak hair, softer, and less frizz!</li>
    <li> SCAM. Do not purchase!</li>
    <li> I have only used this once and my hair felt and looked great afterward.  I used it a month ago and the results didn&#x27;t last a month.  I don&#x27;t know how often you are supposed to use it but for me obviously it is more than once a month.  I am using it again this weekend and will step up the treatment to every 2 weeks and see how that goes.  It was easy to use.  I went online and found an informative video (sorry, I don&#x27;t remember the name of it).  One of the steps was to sit under a hair dryer (again sorry, I don&#x27;t remember if it was for the 1st step which is the product being rated here -- the ampoules -- or the next step which is the cream you put on) but I don&#x27;t have a hair dryer you sit under so I just put a plastic cap on my head to keep the heat in and left it on a little longer than it said to.</li>
    <li> Product works wonders on fine processed hair. Box came exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Items came in perfect condition and it was easy to use. My salon charges $30 for one treatment so this is a real money saver to do it myself.</li>
    <li> This stuff always makes my hair feel like rabbit fur when used with the Wild Ginger Keratin Intensive treatment (not sure how it works on it&#x27;s own). I love it &amp; can always rely on it to revive my hair between salon visits. I have dry hair &amp; heat style it every day, &amp; I use this once a week.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I  started using this thru my hair Salon,  My hair dresser told me about it, I loved how it makes my hair feel, soft and full of body. I buy this everytime I can get it for a good deal. I highly recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my hair feel . I apply it after washing my hair, I wear a heating cap with it for about 15 min. Doees seem to be making my hair stronger.</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t seem to do much for my hair.  My hair stylist didn&#x27;t see any difference either with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this treatment once a month along with the treatment conditioner.  I apply to clean wet hair and cover with a hot towel for 30 minutes.  Love these products!</li>
    <li> I use this product from my stylist. I can purchase it cheaper here and do the same process more often. I really like th Awapuhi Line.</li>
    <li> Miracle treatment for dry damaged hair, see my other review for the complete system. Have spent thousands of dollars at salon &amp; on product lines, nothing works better, nothing comes close!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my hair every 4-6 weeks for the past year.  My hair looks amazing and my stylist thinks it&#x27;s because of her! lol</li>
    <li> If your hair is super fried I recommend this product just make sure to use as directed so you don&#x27;t damage your hair further. I constantly flat iron my hair &amp; bleach out chunks to almost pure white (I&#x27;m a red head naturally so that&#x27;s tough on it) and this product has definitely helped to get my hair back to a healthy state. I also have the conditioner that goes along with it. I tend to use the conditioner maybe once or twice a week after first bleaching &amp; if my hair is super fried I will add in the treatment serum within a day or two of bleaching my hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is great BUT more is not better. It really helps your hair but if you use too often the dryness comes back. Just use as directed.</li>
    <li> This is such a great product for everyone but it is so beneficial to damaged hair. I&#x27;d recommend you use this with Awapuhi Intensive Keratin Conditioning Rinse. I love the smell, but it is different.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product. I use to have my cosmetologist do this treatment on me&lt;br /&gt;in the salon for forty dollars each time I had an appointment ,however this is an easy&lt;br /&gt;treatment to do at home yourself and saves you time and a lot of money. I would and have recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
    <li> The results were amazing.... I can feel  tremendous difference in the feel of my hair, I can&#x27;t imagine how soft it will be using both products together.</li>
    <li> Compared to k pak I&#x27;ll stick with the k pak. I also like IONS reconstructor more than keratriplex. If you have long thick hair you&#x27;ll need to use two vials or more.</li>
    <li> I have Type 3b hair. Fine hair, curly, gets frizzy. This left my hair super soft, the ends were as if I had gotten a fresh hair cut. Love this. Will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> This Keratriplex treatment is expensive, but soooooooooooo worth it! If you hair is short you can get applications from one ampule.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so much stronger, softer and healthier after just two applications. They don&#x27;t sell it in Europe yet, so I ordered mine from&lt;br /&gt;the USA. Incredible.</li>
    <li> I heard that my friend said this item is useful for damaging hair since she used it for three month~&lt;br /&gt;I saw her hair changed to be smooth and less fracture, so i bought this item. i have used this item&lt;br /&gt;three times and it improve my hair so much, i like this so much, i will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is great when you need an extra boost for healthy hair. Paul Mitchell makes excellent products to maintain healthy hair.</li>
    <li> This treatment is the best treatment I have seen ever! I love the shine and the repair it does for the hair.. The results are amazing!! I&#x27;m in the business  30 years.. This treatment wins hands down!</li>
    <li> I tryed this product at my hair salon! Amazing result, especially if you have damaged hair by bleach. I bought it as 2nd part of the treatment and got amazing result 3 times cheaper than in Salon. Highly recomend!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Ordered through MyLittleOnes.Store because of the great ratings they have received (I don&#x27;t know if all the ratings are for the same product though). Package arrived on time. :) The shipping package had no dents or any type of damage to the box.  Upon opening, the PM Awapuhi Keratriplex box was VERY beat up which couldn&#x27;t have happened during shipping with how well it was packaged up (it looked like it was old and had been kicked around). The manufacture&#x27;s seal on the box was noticeably missing but you could see the circle where it had been and it looked like the box had been opened many times (red flags).  The vials appeared fine though.  I have never purchased this product before so I have no way of knowing what they are supposed to look like.  The treatment liquid in all the vials was very faint colored and very thin in consistency (like water).  The one I opened and used had no discernible smell AT ALL which is NOT what I expected considering how strong the intensive moisturizing treatment smells.  I believe I received fake product. :( Was that seller&#x27;s intention?  I hope not but I don&#x27;t know.  Use caution in who you purchase from.</li>
    <li> Has helped my damaged hair more than any other product when used in combination with the Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin treatment</li>
    <li> they have good prices and they sent me the items quickly... great seller, highly recommend I tried this product at a salon and it&#x27;s wonderful. You can also do it at home for less than half the price.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to have soft and silky hair. You must have the whole system in order to achieve the results that this great product offers. It is a professional line tht you will not find in stores and it is worth the money. I used this on my biracial daughter&#x27;s hair and it gave her the silkiest hair she has every had in her life.

    <li> This has helped my damaged hair recover and makes my hair so soft.  My hair was damaged and thinning and this has helped make my hair stronger.</li>
    <li> These vials were a &amp;#34;JOKE&amp;#34;.  It felt like they only  had water in them.  I will NOT order again.  Just get the Paul Mitchell shampoo, leave in conditioner &amp; deep conditioner (from ebay).  Was dissapointed in this product.  It&#x27;s alot of money to waste.</li>
    <li> This product in conjunction with the Paul Mitchell Wild Ginger shampoo, the keratin cream rinse, and the keratin intensive treatment are the best products I&#x27;ve used on my hair in years. I&#x27;m an African American female who usually get my hair relaxed every 10 weeks. My hair is also color treated. I have not had a relaxer/retouch since I&#x27;ve been using these products.....,20 weeks!!!!!!!!!  That&#x27;s a miracle!!! I truly believe the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi wild ginger keratin intensive treatment and the keratriplex have made a dramatic difference in my hair. My roots are straight and my hair is bouncy and soft after I use all 4 of these products on my hair, blow dry, and use the flat iron. There are times when I don&#x27;t use the Keratriplex, but I always use the keratin intensive treatment and I get the same results......straight roots, bouncy and soft hair. I hope this review is helpful because it covers 4 products in this Paul Mitchell Awapuhi  line. Once you use these products, u won&#x27;t need anything else!</li>
    <li> I swear by the Awapuhi line. Love the way it smells and the way it makes my hair look. Could never see myself using a different line anytime soon!!!!</li>
    <li> love this treatment. and so glad i could find it on amazon.</li>
    <li> I was ready to apply the product Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratriplex Treatment Vials when reading the directions It said to apply a vial or two and later apply the second treatment Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Treatment. I was not aware when ordering that this was not included since it apparently requires two solutions to complete the treatment. Guess I did not read it or it did not disclose this information. I really can not rate this product since I have not used it until I receive the second treatment.  I read others reviews and they seemed quit happy.</li>
    <li> Best purchase made.  Need a hard side bonnet type dryer to use it.</li>
    <li> ve been getting this treatment in the salon for a while  (4 times) and it does wonders for my hair. I purchased it via this vendor to try to save $  and used it and it damaged my hair. Its not the real thing. My hair got really dry and burnt on the ends. Further, it didnt smell like the real one. DONT BUY IT FROM THIS VENDOR.</li>
