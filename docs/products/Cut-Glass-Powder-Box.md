      <li>As so the saying goes; &amp;#34;happy wife happy life&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The powder box is attractive, but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; glass; rather, it is what is known as &amp;#34;pressed&#x27; Glass.  </li>

      <li>It came on time and in great condition exactly as pictures.</li>

      <li>The picture shows a brass or nickel plated top</li>
      <li>I love using glass to store powder rather than plastic.  </li>

      <li>The lid also has an un-removable line across its top.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>

      <li>I so love this powder box.</li>
      <li>I just love my powder box.</li>
      <li>This is very luxurious, looks great on my counter.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not ugly, but it&#x27;s not the amazing product the description claims.  </li>
      <li>Very Pretty, nice quality</li>
      <li>But that is fine in case</li>
      <li>and she loved the beautiful and delicate container.  </li>
      <li>It has been a challenge to find a container that is large enough to hold my 3 and 1/2 inch powder puff and this one fits it perfectly.  </li>
      <li>But it seems to be represented accurately in the picture.</li>
      <li>The lid was cheap and not antique</li>
      <li>lokks great and is functional.very hard to find a nice powder box.</li>
      <li>A special container just what I wanted</li>
      <li>Cover didn&#x27;t fit right.  </li>
      <li>powder puff, which I also purchased, is too large for the powder box!!  </li>
      <li>I will just say that in my quest to find a lovely powder box that would look appealing on a countertop, this is the only powder box that comes close.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, but lid doesn&#x27;t set snug.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, just what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The glass is very solid and cut nicely.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but for the price I expected a better product.</li>
      <li>By the way, each product (powder box, AND powder puff) carried their own shipping charges, making my total purchase almost twice the price of the order!  </li>
      <li>She was quite surprised and pleased with the elegance of this glass powder box as well as I.</li>
      <li>But, it is still a pretty item for a reasonable price and works just fine for me.</li>
      <li>The lid is not very heavy, but it works well and looks lovely on my bathroom vanity.  </li>
      <li>Lid is a little big, but it&#x27;s very, very beautiful.</li>
      <li>I do not know whether my powder puffs will fit in the box or not, but If they can&#x27;t, I can live with that.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and very functional.  </li>
      <li>The box is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;m not sad about my purchase.</li>
      <li>The lid will not have the pretty patina shown and the edge of the metal lid is not rolled like in the photo</li>
      <li>Use it to hold cornstarch as have issues with heat rash during the hot months.  </li>
      <li>This is so pretty you can put your powder in it and keep it on the dresser or in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I opened the box first</li>
      <li>The box looks pretty on her vanity.</li>
      <li>This powder box is pretty.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted in a powder box.</li>
      <li>but it is a silver top so definitely read the description!</li>
      <li>Pretty way to store bath powder.</li>
      <li>The top looks like it belongs on a totally different bottom.</li>
      <li>Pretty to look at, reasonably priced, right size.</li>
      <li>I returned mine and went on ebay and found many really nice ones for the same or less money including shipping.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t as large as I was expecting</li>
      <li>It certainly fits the bill as to what I was looking for, though yes the glass looks cheap up close, so just don&#x27;t examine too critically.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It sits in my moms bathroom and everyone who see&#x27;s it wants to know where to find it.  </li>
      <li>It;s a lot easier getting the powder from this box than straight from the plastic bottle.</li>
      <li>Both make applying the cornstarch much easier.</li>
      <li>The lid is pretty light weight, but I imagine it will be durable enough to lift and replace everyday for many years to come.  </li>
      <li>I knew the the lid would be something light and not WOW, but the glass looks very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
      <li>The only only plus i could find is that it was a lovely size and if you get it the 4 inch puff fits well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pretty, but lid doesn&#x27;t set snug. The lid is a half inch too big, as if meant for another container but was just thrown in with the one I got. It&#x27;s too loose. But it does the job</li>
    <li> Very Pretty, nice quality</li>
    <li> Use it to hold cornstarch as have issues with heat rash during the hot months.  Got a powder puff to use as applicator.  Both make applying the cornstarch much easier.</li>
    <li> lokks great and is functional.very hard to find a nice powder box. i fill it with baby powder. looks great on counter and can use powder puff</li>
    <li> It is a gift for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The lid did not fit well and the glass bowl arrived broken.</li>
    <li> Very creative photography......... The &amp;#34;embossed&amp;#34; lid is barely embossed.  The design barely shows up.  The lid also has an un-removable line across its top.  I tried to send it back, but the $16.00 postage wasn&#x27;t worth sending back a $20 item.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Since a star rating is required, I guess I have to give it a star, but it doesn&#x27;t even deserve that.</li>
    <li> Use it as earring holder just love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who still uses body powder; she loves it!  The box looks pretty on her vanity.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made.  Cover didn&#x27;t fit right.  Tin and very thin glass</li>
    <li> Nice product. Imported from India.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  It sits in my moms bathroom and everyone who see&#x27;s it wants to know where to find it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t as large as I was expecting</li>
    <li> Love the look of this. Much better than keeping the powder in the cardboard. I just wish they made these large enough to put the powder box base directly in tge container rather than having to dump it in.</li>
    <li> I like this glass powder box.  It is beautiful.  Bigger than what I was expecting. But that is fine in case I would want to use it for other things, too.</li>
    <li> Pretty way to store bath powder.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and very functional.  It arrived in perfect condition.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Powder Box is what I have been looking for.  The lead is silver and not gold as shown.  Had I known this I would not have bought it.</li>
    <li> The top looks like it belongs on a totally different bottom. It&#x27;s a very loose fit and doesn&#x27;t even sit evenly on the bottom. I was buying it as a gift, thank goodness I opened the box first or I would have been embarrassed.</li>
    <li> Didnt come with the lid</li>
    <li> this makes a beautiful bath powder container.  very nice product and worth the money!  I would purchase again as a gift.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot, as I just wanted something prettier that a box to put on my dressing table.  So I was very thrilled at the the look of it.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this beautiful glass powder container.  I love using glass to store powder rather than plastic.  The lid is not very heavy, but it works well and looks lovely on my bathroom vanity.  It has been a challenge to find a container that is large enough to hold my 3 and 1/2 inch powder puff and this one fits it perfectly.  So pleased to have found this item!</li>
    <li> The lid was cheap and not antique</li>
    <li> The powder box is attractive, but it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; glass; rather, it is what is known as &amp;#34;pressed&#x27; Glass.  Otherwise, it was as shown in the web page,</li>
    <li> not as pictured! The lid will not have the pretty patina shown and the edge of the metal lid is not rolled like in the photo it just comes straight down and hangs farther down the sides of the glass jar. The lid is also a very poor fit for the jar-very loose. The jar is not cut glass either-it is molded sugar glass which is a brittle glass. This is something you might find in a dollar store. The only only plus i could find is that it was a lovely size and if you get it the 4 inch puff fits well. NOT worth $24.99 for what you get- I returned mine and went on ebay and found many really nice ones for the same or less money including shipping. Byer beware on this as you won&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but for the price I expected a better product. I knew the the lid would be something light and not WOW, but the glass looks very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful etching.  Glad it is NOT MADE IN CHINA but India.  I put corn starch while is a natural ingredient and you can powdervyourself dry in Phoenix AZ</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife along with powder puffs. She was quite surprised and pleased with the elegance of this glass powder box as well as I. As so the saying goes; &amp;#34;happy wife happy life&amp;#34;. I would highly recommend this item and will definitely make purchases from Victorian Trading company again for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Nice design.Lousy workmanship. Sharp edges. Am sending it back.</li>
    <li> Beautiful powder box!  I was sad when it first arrived for two reasons: 1) it didn&#x27;t come with a powder puff (I didn&#x27;t notice in the description that it didn&#x27;t, so my fault, but I can&#x27;t find one anywhere!) and 2) the lid was bright, flawless silver.  However, the lid has began to get that awesome, antiqued look after just about a week sitting in my bathroom and it looks even more lovely.  The lid is pretty light weight, but I imagine it will be durable enough to lift and replace everyday for many years to come.  The glass is very solid and cut nicely.  The box is a bit pricey, but I&#x27;m not sad about my purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, baby powder is no longer an eyesore in my bathroom</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in product, from top to bottom!  Very creative photography, making this look like a quality product, which it is NOT!  Description says it&#x27;s 5&amp;#34; across.  Not sure what was measured.  The recommended 4 1/2&amp;#34; powder puff, which I also purchased, is too large for the powder box!!  By the way, each product (powder box, AND powder puff) carried their own shipping charges, making my total purchase almost twice the price of the order!  I will NOT order another product of this sort from Amazon, EVER!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Am very happy with the purchase. Now I have a handy place to store  my baby powder, instead of those awful squeeze shaker type containers it comes in.</li>
    <li> the glass bowl is nice but the lid just sets on top &amp; over the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for one that the lid fitS the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;I broke my old one.&lt;br /&gt;gonna still look.</li>
    <li> I believe this is advertised as cut glass.  It isn&#x27;t.  It is molded.  But, it is still a pretty item for a reasonable price and works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> The picture shows a brass or nickel plated top but it is a silver top so definitely read the description! The top does not fit the glass jar, it slides around so it is not secure fitting. Rather disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> A special container just what I wanted</li>
    <li> It is beautiful.  I suddenly wondered if my mundane purpose fit it&#x27;s looks.  I am still using it as I intended, but every time I do I think of the Chronicles of Narnia and Turkish Delight!</li>
    <li> I love it. It came on time and in great condition exactly as pictures.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted  very nice</li>
    <li> Did NOT like it at all. The glass was very poorly made &amp; the lid was super shiny &amp; flimsy. Not aged looking as it appears in the photo.</li>
    <li> I have not used this product yet, since purchasing it. But it seems to be represented accurately in the picture. No it does not appear to have a tarnished look as in the photo, but if there is even a very thin silver plate or nickel upon the lid, I would think that it should tarnish as the photo depicts. Certainly I would love to have a heavy duty lid made of French pewter (that is my preference), but since I am only paying twenty dollars for this pretty little powder box, I don&#x27;t expect high quality, and you will not get it in this case either. I will just say that in my quest to find a lovely powder box that would look appealing on a countertop, this is the only powder box that comes close. It certainly fits the bill as to what I was looking for, though yes the glass looks cheap up close, so just don&#x27;t examine too critically. I bought myself an extra one to boot, since powder boxes seem to be going extinct, and also bought one as a gift for my mother, as she has a great affinity for bath powder as I do. I do not know whether my powder puffs will fit in the box or not, but If they can&#x27;t, I can live with that. I will just store it separately. I would not hesitate to recommend this powder box to any one, as long as they realize that the days of getting something of superior quality for twenty dollars is long, long past. Very nice!</li>
    <li> What I received looks very little like the posted picture. The item in life is cheap looking, the lid shiny and the embossing almost imperceptible while the glass part looks like plastic, cut glass it is not, pressed glass I guess. In my view not worth even half of what I paid.</li>
    <li> This was a present for my mom to put her body powder and she loved the beautiful and delicate container.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is very luxurious, looks great on my counter. I put my dusting powder in this and use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> This powder box is pretty.  It is a good size.  I would have given it 5 stars except the lid just sits on top so you would have powder everywhere if it fell off the counter.</li>
    <li> Arrived chipped around the glass part.  I will be returning it.</li>
    <li> Just the size I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great for my powder.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Package arrived when promised. The glass looks similar to cut crystal. The lid is etched in a beautiful design. It looks wonderful sitting on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Lid is a little big, but it&#x27;s very, very beautiful. I&#x27;m glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This was just what I was looking for. Not for powder, but for my favorite hand cream. Pretty to look at, reasonably priced, right size.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, just what I was looking for. Color of lid is silver, not the tarnished gold that it looks in the photo.</li>
    <li> It is perfect! exactly what I wanted in a powder box.</li>
    <li> Nicer than I expected</li>
    <li> This is so pretty you can put your powder in it and keep it on the dresser or in the bathroom.  Love it</li>
    <li> A great piece. Nice craftsmanship. Solid piece.</li>
    <li> I just love my powder box.</li>
    <li> I so love this powder box. Obviously, I use talc on my face. Of course I use it with a powder puff and this is the perfect box for that purpose. It;s a lot easier getting the powder from this box than straight from the plastic bottle. It looks so nice too!</li>
    <li> So the picture is a little bit deceiving... the item doesn&#x27;t come with the tarnished old look to the lid.  It&#x27;s shiny silver, and flimsy to boot.  But I suppose over time it could look like the picture so I&#x27;ll give it a shot.  The glass isn&#x27;t cut in the way that was described.  They make it sound all amazing and beautiful, but it&#x27;s just cheap looking glass like you would find on a second hand or dollar store item.  It&#x27;s not ugly, but it&#x27;s not the amazing product the description claims.  It&#x27;ll do for what I wanted it for... and that&#x27;s what matters I guess.  Unlikely I&#x27;ll buy from this company again though.</li>
