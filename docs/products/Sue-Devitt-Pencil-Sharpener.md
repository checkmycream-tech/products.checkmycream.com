      <li>Very fast free shipping, thank you!!!</li>

      <li>It sharpens better than any sharpener I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
      <li>my absolute favorite ever!!</li>
      <li>This is by far, the best eyeliner sharpener I have ever used, and worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this was a very good buy.</li>
      <li>I love how smooth is sharpens my eye pencils.</li>
      <li>The seller sent us our sharpeners very quickly.</li>
      <li>The flip top lid makes it so easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>Never saw anything as finely made.</li>

      <li>I would like to return it, but the shipping will cost me more than the pencil is worth.</li>
      <li>It sharpens so smoothly, and the eyeliners never break off while being sharpened.    </li>
      <li>Sharpens to a nice point, sharpens smoothly and it&#x27;s very well made.</li>
      <li>An essential in any good beauty kit :)</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this to sharpen the fat Sue Devitt pencils.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
      <li>If you are going to buy her products on a regular basis, it&#x27;s handy to have.</li>
      <li>It keeps the shavings nice and contained to make it very easy to clean, sharpens well, fits small and large pencils.  </li>
      <li>I have used it with many different brands of eyeliners, and it works well with them all.  </li>
      <li>The point ends up so sharp, I can make a precision line that looks amazing.</li>
      <li>We were so used to using crappy, cheap drugstore pencil sharpeners that we thought we were doomed to eternity to have barely usable eye pencils.</li>
      <li>bought sharpener and just take the ring off the larger sized and the liner works fine.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The regular hole is great for my Urban Decay eye pencils, the larger hole with the stopper works well with a Cover Girl chubby eye pencil I have</li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when I opened it and tried to use it with the pencil and the pencil would not even remotely fit into the hole to sharpen as it&#x27;s a lot bigger in circumference than the pencil hole!  </li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and item was well packaged.  </li>
      <li>I originally purchased it to use with my Urban Decay</li>
      <li>You have to take the grey \\&quot;reducer\\&quot; out to get them to fit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a little thing... a sharpener for your eye and lip pencils, but it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had pencil sharpeners that break off the newly sharpened points while sharpening - this one doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
      <li>It was easy to clean afterwards as well, especially with the white little plastic stick that comes with the sharpener.</li>
      <li>All other sharpeners sharpen, but the point gets flattened or not sharp enough, so I have to keep sharpening, which wears away the pencil too quickly.</li>
      <li>How dumb do I feel? :)</li>
      <li>It is an extremely effective sharpener for thin pencils, but not for the Sue Devitt chunkers!</li>
      <li>They either dull quickly or break the tip off the liner pencil when pulling it out after sharpening.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually write a lot of product reviews; something has to be really awesome or really bad for me to take the time.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so worth the extra few bucks over an inexpensive drugstore sharpener, and in the long run it will save me money in not having to sharpen twice because the tip broke off !  </li>

<li> Unlike other sharpeners, it consistently makes a very sharp point.</li>
<li> It sharpened all of our disfigured eye pencils in no time flat.</li>
<li> Will only buy this brand after trying countless other ones.</li>

<li> After months of lamenting that the sharpener was too small for the Sue Devitt pencils, I finally figured out that the ring around the larger sharpener CAN BE REMOVED.  </li>
<li> You can sharpen little or big sized pencils,,,,couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail!</li>
<li> Works extremely well.</li>
<li> Tried other brands.</li>

<li> So it was a waste of money to have ordered it</li>
<li> Very disappointed to not be able to use it with the Sue Devitt eye pencil.</li>
<li> The sharpener was too small for the pencil.  </li>
<li> I bought this relatively overpriced sharpener for my relatively overpriced Sue Devitt pencil and was quite disappointed to discover the sharpener is way too small for the pencil!  </li>
<li> The tip never breaks off while sharpening, which is common with others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> Returned the item as it did me no good whatsoever.</li>
<li> The box is an awkward shape though.</li>
<li> I was completely disappointed to find out this pencil did not work.</li>

    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s just a pencil sharpener, but it&#x27;s the best pencil sharpener ever!  I love this thing!  It keeps the shavings nice and contained to make it very easy to clean, sharpens well, fits small and large pencils.  An essential in any good beauty kit :)</li>
    <li> I ordered a eye pencil  which I like  alot.They made it seem  like the  sharpner was made for the eye pencil I ordered but  it isn&#x27;t. So it was a waste of money to have ordered it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had pencil sharpeners that break off the newly sharpened points while sharpening - this one doesn&#x27;t do that. The box is an awkward shape though.</li>
    <li> I loved this sharpener I used for mu Sue Devitts but you can use it for any makeup pencil. Big part is also adjustable which makes it usable for 3 different sizes.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best eyeliner sharpener I have ever used, and worth every penny.  It sharpens so smoothly, and the eyeliners never break off while being sharpened.    I have used it with many different brands of eyeliners, and it works well with them all.  I originally purchased it to use with my Urban Decay 24/7&#x27;s.      With the dual size holes, it is the only sharpener I will ever need.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.</li>
    <li> wonderful quality, perfect for the jumbo Sue Devitt eye pencils.  Very fast free shipping, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The sharpener is one of the best I have used. I love how smooth is sharpens my eye pencils.</li>

They should not say it is for the pencil and not know it doesn&#x27;t even fit the hole!  Returned the item as it did me no good whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful sharpener.  It was suggested to me several years ago.  The tip never breaks off while sharpening, which is common with others I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a little thing... a sharpener for your eye and lip pencils, but it&#x27;s fantastic! I don&#x27;t usually write a lot of product reviews; something has to be really awesome or really bad for me to take the time.  This product lands squarely in the awesome category.    I have been searching for a good sharpener for years (no kidding!)  They either dull quickly or break the tip off the liner pencil when pulling it out after sharpening.  This sharpener is amazing! Sharpens to a nice point, sharpens smoothly and it&#x27;s very well made. I will never use another junky sharpener again! It&#x27;s so worth the extra few bucks over an inexpensive drugstore sharpener, and in the long run it will save me money in not having to sharpen twice because the tip broke off !  Do yourself a favor and get one, I promise you&#x27;ll be writing a good review and telling your girlfriends about it :)</li>
    <li> Perfect cosmetic pencil sharper.  Allows for 3 sizes of pencils, as well as a container to catch the shavings.  It&#x27;s a great little product.</li>
    <li> LOVEEEEE this sharpener!!! Will only buy this brand after trying countless other ones. You can sharpen little or big sized pencils,,,,couldn&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail!</li>
    <li> Bought the eye liner at a discount store for $3.99.  What a surprise to see it on the Sue Devitt site at $18.00.  I use my Walmart  bought sharpener and just take the ring off the larger sized and the liner works fine.</li>
    <li> Loved the Sue Devitt Pencil sharpener- Never saw anything as finely made. It does a wonderful job sharpening the Sue Devitt eyeliner pencils- my absolute favorite ever!!</li>
    <li> I bought 2, one for me and one for my mom. We were so used to using crappy, cheap drugstore pencil sharpeners that we thought we were doomed to eternity to have barely usable eye pencils. This sharpener has exceeded our expectations. It sharpened all of our disfigured eye pencils in no time flat. It was easy to clean afterwards as well, especially with the white little plastic stick that comes with the sharpener. The seller sent us our sharpeners very quickly. Overall, this was a very good buy.</li>
    <li> I made this purchase to replace the 1st one I had.  It sharpens better than any sharpener I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The only complaint I have about it is that from opening it up to empty it, the plastic hinges broke on my previous sharpener.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this to sharpen the fat Sue Devitt pencils.  I quickly learned how well it sharpens thin pencils (lip liner / eye liner) from other brands.  The flip top lid makes it so easy to clean.  Five years later, the blade is still sharp!</li>
    <li> This is a necessary item for the Sue Devitt pencils.  If you are going to buy her products on a regular basis, it&#x27;s handy to have.</li>
    <li> After months of lamenting that the sharpener was too small for the Sue Devitt pencils, I finally figured out that the ring around the larger sharpener CAN BE REMOVED.  Now it sharpens perfectly.  How dumb do I feel? :)</li>
    <li> I bought this relatively overpriced sharpener for my relatively overpriced Sue Devitt pencil and was quite disappointed to discover the sharpener is way too small for the pencil!  It is an extremely effective sharpener for thin pencils, but not for the Sue Devitt chunkers!</li>
    <li> 30 years of using eyeliner pencils and this is the ONLY one that does the job well. The point ends up so sharp, I can make a precision line that looks amazing. All other sharpeners sharpen, but the point gets flattened or not sharp enough, so I have to keep sharpening, which wears away the pencil too quickly.</li>
    <li> I was completely disappointed to find out this pencil did not work. I would like to return it, but the shipping will cost me more than the pencil is worth.</li>
    <li> Sue Devitt pencils fit perfectly in here. You have to take the grey \\&quot;reducer\\&quot; out to get them to fit. Tried other brands. This is the only one that works with her great eye pencils.</li>
    <li> The sharpener was too small for the pencil.  Very disappointed to not be able to use it with the Sue Devitt eye pencil.</li>
    <li> If you require a precision eyebrow pencil sharpener...This is it!  Unlike other sharpeners, it consistently makes a very sharp point.</li>
    <li> the only sharpener you can use if you use Susan Devitt liner pencils.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast and item was well packaged.  I heard about this pencil sharpener from a YouTube beauty guru and it really IS the best.  It almost sharpens too well, it doesn&#x27;t stop.  The regular hole is great for my Urban Decay eye pencils, the larger hole with the stopper works well with a Cover Girl chubby eye pencil I have and when I took out the stopper, it sharpened my NYX eye pencil with ease.  Fantastic item, great price.</li>
