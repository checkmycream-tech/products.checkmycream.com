      <li>Sprays on strong and well, love the scent</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
      <li>I think it is one of the best dry shampoos out there</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to blend in, it smells pretty good and isn&#x27;t too strong, and this Strength and Shine version does a better job of not dulling your hair.</li>
      <li>Awesome dry shampoo!</li>
      <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found!</li>
      <li>I like the smell of this version better than the original.</li>
      <li>Why does the perfume have to be so strong??</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scent is too strong for me and reminds me of a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>Very good dry shampoo.  </li>
      <li>&amp; I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>Great for the price; I used it all up in only 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Also smells the best of any of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, not perfumy just clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>Good for the price although I like clay based dry shampoo better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the tropical and original ones before this.  </li>
      <li>NOT AT ALL LIKE CLEAN HAIR.</li>
      <li>but as soon as I brush through it my hair just looks clean and shiny.</li>
      <li>Adds volumes and gives the look of clean hair.</li>
      <li>though this was a great dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>When I wake up my hair feels clean, looks clean, smells clean and has plenty of body.</li>
      <li>Smell is not too overpowering or flowery and it makes my hair seem clean for hours.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;ve tried the one brand that gets the most press, I&#x27;ll use it, but I&#x27;m also going to continue looking at other brands like the L&#x27;Oreal one that also has some good reviews here.</li>
      <li>I usually try to wash my hair every other day, and this makes my no wash day hair look great and smell great!</li>
      <li>Best batiste dry shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased thus far!</li>
      <li>This has a light fresh scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>Product arrived quickly and have used it once.  </li>
      <li>This Strength and Shine in particular is my favorite.</li>
      <li>I am no expert on dry shampoos at all, so I had no idea that there were so many brands and that people feel so strongly about them!</li>
      <li>So far I love it and it took the oily look and feel out of my hair.</li>
      <li>did not like the powdery residue it left, nice scent though.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth getting it again.</li>
      <li>For me that&#x27;s about as good as it&#x27;ll ever get since I have extremely oily hair.  </li>
      <li>I put it in my hair at the roots and brush it through my hair right before bed.</li>
      <li>Well, this morning, I over-slept and really needed to have clean hair, so I used this.</li>
      <li>Huge cloud of highly fragranced, powdery spray surrounded my head.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair look and feel clean again without a buildup like I experienced with the last dry shampoo I used.</li>
      <li>This one smells way better (my primary concern with the other two) and actually seems to work better.  </li>
      <li>I first used this product when I was in London.  </li>
      <li>I was actually able to go an extra day without washing my hair.</li>
      <li>First time experience</li>
      <li>Honestly, I love Batiste Dry Shampoo, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERY kind of dry shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I left it in my hair for a bit as I ran around the house, so it was left alone for a good 5 minutes or so...</li>
      <li>don;t understand why others are so positive.</li>
      <li>My hair definitely felt like it was stiffer, rather than fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Batiste is one of my favorite brands of dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love these dry shampoos - all of them.  </li>
      <li>My all time favorite dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good dry shampoo forever and finally picked this one based on the reviews here, and it did not disappoint.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a dry shampoo EXACTLY like this for years!!!</li>
      <li>wish I could find one for dark hair, but it&#x27;s very easy to brush out the powder.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the other versions its seemed to weigh my fine hair down more than the original</li>
      <li>This one was light smelling, and it not only brushed out easily, my hair actually felt clean.</li>
      <li>Works very well and keeps my hair grease-free all day.</li>
      <li>Works really well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;12 hours later, my scalp smells fantastic but it itches.</li>
      <li>recommend this highly!</li>
      <li>Seller delivered with fast shipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE HEAVY AND LEFT MY AIR FEELING LIKE IT WAS STILL DIRTY. STYLING WAS HARD BECAUSE HAIR ACTED DIRTY. BRUSH KEPT GETTING TANGLD IN MY HAIR. MY HAIR FELT THICK AND HEAVY. NOT AT ALL LIKE CLEAN HAIR. I USED DRY SHAMPOO PRODUCTS FOR YEARS IN MY 20-30&#x27;S WITH GRAT SUCCESS. I ALSO FEEL IT IS COSTLY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good dry shampoo forever and finally picked this one based on the reviews here, and it did not disappoint.  Smells great and does what it says.  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think shine spray and dry shampoo would go together, but I am impressed.</li>
    <li> Works really well for me, even better than more expensive brands I&#x27;ve bought from Sephora. Minus one star because it does leave a slight white residue on my dark brown hair, but it eventually blends in. Smells pretty good too.</li>
    <li> I first used this product when I was in London.  When I saw I could buy it here, I jump on it.  I think it is one of the best dry shampoos out there</li>
    <li> Works really well. Hair looked like it had just been washed and blow dried. Definitely worth getting it again.</li>
    <li> No good.  Just what I was worried about.  Makes hair look powdery and grey. Bummer, probbaly will never use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of dry shampoos and keep coming back to Batiste. This Strength and Shine in particular is my favorite. Works very well and keeps my hair grease-free all day. I&#x27;ve used multiple days in a row in place of actual shampoo and it still keeps my hair (which is on the oilier side) grease-free. It&#x27;s easy to blend in, it smells pretty good and isn&#x27;t too strong, and this Strength and Shine version does a better job of not dulling your hair. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Love these dry shampoos - all of them.  They are the only ones I have found that don&#x27;t leave residue in my hair.  Dry shampoos that leave white junk in your hair so that you have to rewash it, kind of defeat the purpose.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
    <li> I like all the Batiste Dry Shampoos. I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between any of them.  they all are the best dry shampoos of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. don&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff and gritty.</li>
    <li> Great smell and great results!</li>
    <li> I like this brand as it does not make your hair feel stiff or hard and does not leave the white residue everywhere. The smell is not too bad either. I recommend this for anyone who needs a refresher if you do not wash your hair everyday.</li>
    <li> The scent was very strong. I had to use the spray outside. Why does the perfume have to be so strong??</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad. It&#x27;s not the HG dry shampoo I was looking for, but I don&#x27;t hate it. I have platinum blonde hair, fine, above shoulder length, layered. Even in my hair, I could see the white residue it leaves, and after brushing, my hair was definitely a little less shiny than it had been. It does smell good to me, not too strong, kind of a soapy unisex smell. My hair definitely felt like it was stiffer, rather than fresh and clean. For comparison, I have also tried the Suave dry shampoo, which is one of the least expensive ones out there, readily available on the shelf at your local Walmart, and I loved that one more. I am no expert on dry shampoos at all, so I had no idea that there were so many brands and that people feel so strongly about them! Now that I&#x27;ve tried the one brand that gets the most press, I&#x27;ll use it, but I&#x27;m also going to continue looking at other brands like the L&#x27;Oreal one that also has some good reviews here. If nothing else, I know that the Suave one works on my hair.</li>
    <li> This works well, but it can show as white powdery in my brown hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves white residue in my dirty blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This one is great. Smell is not too overpowering or flowery and it makes my hair seem clean for hours.&lt;br /&gt;And it also adds body. I use it on my &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; daughter who is not into showering daily yet, but is starting to get greasy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does make your hair white when it comes out, but goes away when you brush it. My hair is brown and you can&#x27;t see it after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;And not crazy expensive either....</li>
    <li> Awesome dry shampoo! I put it in my hair at the roots and brush it through my hair right before bed. When I wake up my hair feels clean, looks clean, smells clean and has plenty of body. Great product.</li>
    <li> I  used it and my hair not only turned grey but looked gross</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. It made my hair feel dirty. It did make it look less oily, but still looked as if it needed to be washed. Kind of like putting flour on it. I would not recommend this for oily hair.</li>
    <li> I though this was a great dry shampoo. I had never used one before and was pleasantly surprised. Definitely allows you to go an extra day without shampooing your hair. Love the smell</li>
    <li> My favorite!!! Tried so many dry shampoos, batiste is the best considering price and quality. Love strength &amp; shine even better!</li>
    <li> This is so far my favorite of the batiste dry shampoos.  I&#x27;ve tried the tropical and original ones before this.  This one smells way better (my primary concern with the other two) and actually seems to work better.  Usually when I use a dry shampoo it&#x27;ll get my hair good enough to put in a head band and deal with it.  A couple times with this stuff I actually styled my hair normally and made it through a day without having to put in a head band.  For me that&#x27;s about as good as it&#x27;ll ever get since I have extremely oily hair.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great for the price; I used it all up in only 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find one for dark hair, but it&#x27;s very easy to brush out the powder.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite dry shampoo. Batiste works much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome for those days you don&#x27;t wash your hair. You do have to rub it in or comb it in a bit to get rid of the powdery look. I like the smell of this version better than the original. The original smells a little bit like baby powder or baby wipes, but this one has a fresh scent that is gender neutral, and not at all baby-like.</li>
    <li> This gets rid of my oily hair between shampoos and it doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair lay down. It is affordable. I love Bumble &amp; Bumble for Brunettes but I can&#x27;t afford the price. I continue to buy Batiste and recommend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo.  Adds volumes and gives the look of clean hair. A must have.</li>
    <li> Thought it might work better than it does.  Leaves hair feeling quite dry.</li>
    <li> Best batiste dry shampoo I&#x27;ve purchased thus far!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the other versions its seemed to weigh my fine hair down more than the original</li>
    <li> Very good dry shampoo.  Not a heavy powdery one, and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> did not like the powdery residue it left, nice scent though.</li>
    <li> First time experience: it felt rather like I was spraying shoe deodorizer in my hair. Huge cloud of highly fragranced, powdery spray surrounded my head. It&#x27;s clear right away why the warning label forbids smoking during application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aiming for the roots, as directed, it left an opaque, silvery haze on my hair, even after extensive rubbing and brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 hours later, my scalp smells fantastic but it itches. I&#x27;d recommend if in dire need of freshness, say for perhaps camping or hosteling in Europe. Otherwise, go for the ole&#x27; shampoo and water approach.</li>
    <li> Sprays on strong and well, love the scent</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love this. Fast shipping but the product itself didn&#x27;t work for me. Not sure if it&#x27;s because of my hair just not agreeing but I still felt residue after I used it. Not clean.</li>
    <li> After reading glowing reviews, I was hopeful of finding a really excellent product for oily hair.  No such luck!!  Batiste is certainly no better (and possibly less effective) than 95% of the competitors for minimizing &amp;#34;the greasies.&amp;#34;  I found it very dulling even after only one application.  Its only characteristic that seemed satisfactory is the minimal residue or detectable powder. My 30+ years of searching for a great product continues. . .</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it leaves a white powder very visible on my dark hair. Looks like I&#x27;m getting grey!&lt;br /&gt;It also makes my hair look dull. I don;t understand why others are so positive.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a dry shampoo EXACTLY like this for years!!! I tried the one for blondes which has a yellow color to it and did not like the yellow every where, so I got this. Had not tried it because I really was expecting another fail. Well, this morning, I over-slept and really needed to have clean hair, so I used this. AMAZING! I left it in my hair for a bit as I ran around the house, so it was left alone for a good 5 minutes or so...and when I brushed it out, my hair looked and felt great! All other dry shampoos leave a residue, some sticky, some tacky, and the fragrances are so intense. This one was light smelling, and it not only brushed out easily, my hair actually felt clean. Some of the other reviews said their hair felt clean, but I did not expect it to actually be true. Big sigh...happy to have found this.</li>
    <li> I was actually able to go an extra day without washing my hair. My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighted down &amp; I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with that shampoo. It&#x27;s just everything I expected. A quick refresh and your hair look and smell great again !</li>
    <li> Kind of hit or miss for me. Sometimes it would do it&#x27;s job perfectly, and others it would just make my hair oilier than it had been previously. Smells kind of like spray deodorant.</li>
    <li> The smell is overpowering and it really didn&#x27;t do much to absorb grease</li>
    <li> I am on the job hunt, and I bought this shampoo to make sure I could be ready for an interview with only a moment&#x27;s notice, if necessary.  I am so glad I did!!  I can buy 1 or 2 days between shampoos with just one application!  (I haven&#x27;t tried reapplying, yet.)  I love it!  It makes my hair look and feel clean again without a buildup like I experienced with the last dry shampoo I used. (a Sally beauty supply one)  It smells like I would expect it to, but I only smell it while spraying it on.  Once I&#x27;ve massaged it in and brushed my hair out, I don&#x27;t even smell it.  Now, I&#x27;m thinking of all the times I could have used this in the past and the inconveniences I could have overcome.  This will always be in stock in my bathroom now!</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found! It leaves my hair feeling like I&#x27;ve just washed it and actually helps make my hair way easier to brush through. I have fine, wavy blonde hair and when I first spray it in a can see a slight film on my hair but as soon as I brush through it my hair just looks clean and shiny. Also smells the best of any of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, not perfumy just clean and fresh. I also love the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use between one and another washing.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well. I&#x27;ve never used a dry shampoo before so I&#x27;m still fiddling with the application.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and have used it once.  So far I love it and it took the oily look and feel out of my hair. Need to practice with it more because if you don&#x27;t work it enough it leaves white residue on scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint so far is it arrived with damaged cap because no protective packaging was used.</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have a problem with my hair line being greasy but I&#x27;d rather not wash my hair every day.  I&#x27;ve tried using it before I&#x27;ve gone to bed and in the morning and it works wonderful either way.  recommend this highly!</li>
    <li> This worked as expected. It&#x27;s scent is too strong for me and reminds me of a man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
    <li> Batiste is one of my favorite brands of dry shampoo. I usually try to wash my hair every other day, and this makes my no wash day hair look great and smell great! A little goes a long ways with dry shampoo so don&#x27;t go overboard spraying it all over the place. If you follow the directions as listed on the bottle, you will have excellent results.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I love Batiste Dry Shampoo, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERY kind of dry shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This version is just a little bit better than the others because it seems just a bit less &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; and I think that helps.</li>
    <li> Must buy for oil hair.</li>
    <li> I am anti-shampoo... I have a reputation for having dirty hair for days - but in a good way :) Thank goodness for dry shampoo and batiste! This is THE BEST brand I have tried and I have tried them all. This has a light fresh scent. The can always sprays until the very end - even upside down. It adds more texture than their other scents. It brushes in easily and works awesome!! Love it! Can&#x27;t say my hair is very shiny with use of any dry shampoo but what do you expect?? Buy it and love it.</li>
    <li> Was not as effective as other dry shampoos I have used. Seller delivered with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Leaves a bit of white residue on brown hair. Good for the price although I like clay based dry shampoo better.</li>
    <li> Maybe I used it wrong but it was hell getting it out would not use again. My hair is curly (biracial)</li>
    <li> Tried this twice, and both times it left flakes in my hair.  I will go back to buying my dry shampoo at Walgreens or Target.  I have never had another brand do this.  In addition to leaving white flakes all through your hair, it gets them all over your clothes as well.  Very messy!</li>
    <li> So sad I&#x27;d never tried dry shampoo until now. Great product, I use the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method and don&#x27;t wash my hair often. Sometimes it needs just a little refresher at the roots so it doesn&#x27;t look oily. I can&#x27;t compare this to other dry shampoos, but I really love the product. Ideally I&#x27;d spray it in then run a comb or something through my hair, but finger comb works too. It does have a scent, not sure what but it&#x27;s nice and not overpowering or floral, and doesn&#x27;t smell like baby powder either.</li>
