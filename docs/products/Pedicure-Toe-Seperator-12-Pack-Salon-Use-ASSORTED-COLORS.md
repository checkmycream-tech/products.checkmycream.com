<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> You have to use two set to make it stand between your toes&lt;br /&gt;But the price is unbeatable</li>
    <li> took awhile to get here, and they are a bit flimsy, but they work</li>
    <li> Only received a 6 pack event though it clearly states that it is a 12 pack. Also, did not come in assorted colors...just orange. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are EXTREMELY thin, cheap and useless.  Similarly to other reviewers mine came all crammed in a little padded envelope and several were bent and distorted upon opening the package.  I also received ALL the SAME COLOR and it is an ugly orange/yellow.  Not happy with this purchase.  I bought them because my current (at the time) toe separators were too big and uncomfortable. Unfortunately these ended up being exactly the opposite of my former toe separators. So the search for a happy middle ground continues.</li>
    <li> Serve their purpose. I actually bought them to use in holding my thread bobbins for sewing. Okay for that not perfect. I&#x27;m sure they are fine for toes like they are intended.</li>
    <li> Received twisted and dirty.</li>
    <li> Unlike what is available for gorilla feet in local stores, these toe separators are a nice small size, soft and comfortable to use. I received enough to last years!</li>
    <li> I needed some toe separators, and these are just what I needed. Inexpensive. Flexible. I won&#x27;t need more for a while!</li>
    <li> They worked well - but we let them air out before using them.  Smelled very strongly of chemicals when we first opened them.</li>
    <li> Very nice and colorful and feel very nice and soft on the foot they feel like nothing there I just love it</li>
    <li> These weren&#x27;t even close to what was described.  They were orange/white and yellow/white...misshapen, and pretty stiff.  The worst part?  They arrived late.  I had to go buy other ones to fill in my pedicure jars for a baby shower!  So...now I have 36 sets of ugly, uncomfortable toe seperators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every other item I ordered arrived at LEAST a week before these did.  I got home from the shower and they had been delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wanting the product in the picture, don&#x27;t bother...you won&#x27;t get it!</li>
    <li> Bought my daughter a foot tub for Christmas.  Wanted her to have everything she needed for a great soak so I bought these toe seperators for polishing her toes.  She love them.</li>
    <li> I only got two different colors. I was disappointed by that. But otherwise they got the job done, and were great for nail kit gifts</li>
    <li> The material is pretty thin, but I cannot complain at this price. You have to handle it carefully otherwise it will break.</li>
    <li> A little on the flimsy side but the colors are pretty and perfect for a one or two time use at a Bachelorette gathering.</li>
    <li> These do the job just fine.  They&#x27;re a bit flimsy and fairly small, but they get my toes separated and I can walk around the house after I paint my nails.  What more do I need from them?  I wish I could have spent less and bought fewer, though.  One set will last me several months.</li>
    <li> I had no idea what they even were I got them.  I thought I had simply gotten an envolope with nothing but packiong material because that is what they resemsemble!  I threw them away!</li>
    <li> very good for price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product cheap and durable product. they are great for there use</li>
    <li> I would not have ordered these if I had known they would all be pink. Presumably, they work just as well, but still.</li>
    <li> The price was very attractive. I&#x27;m using these in nail polish gift bags for Christmas. Took me a while to receive them but they&#x27;re going to work perfectly</li>
    <li> Rather flimsy. Cheap though. Not bad.</li>
    <li> What I received is not what I ordered. What I got are smaller, a different shape, all are yellow and they are flimsy. i want what i paid for</li>
    <li> Mine did not look the same as the ones in the picture but I like them because they are still soft and don&#x27;t hurt my toes while still providing enough separation so toes don&#x27;t touch while painting toe nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put in some Easter Baskets that I made for my grown granddaughters.  I made them a nail salon basket, with every thing they need to do there nail, even with lots of decorations.  They loved them.</li>
    <li> For the price its a steal! I love this product! I gave some to my sister as well. A great buy.</li>
    <li> Ok the material is cheap BUT for that money is ok.&lt;br /&gt;I need it for a girls spa birthday party and I guess it&#x27;ll work very well. They came in diferent colors, a total of 24 pieces (12 sets)&lt;br /&gt;The package was shipped from China and it took 1 month to arrive, so you must order as soon you can.</li>
    <li> Well, the product is exactly what it seems; cheap foam separators. They are colorful (I got a pack of mixed colors), foam, and do the job. What really gave this product five stars for me, is the seller. I had a problem with my order and they were so fast to resolve it and so good about the whole issue, I have to give them full marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Folks, if you want fancy goods, go pay fancy prices. But if you want goods that do what they&#x27;re supposed to, backed up by a really terrific vendor, these people get my vote.</li>
    <li> I bought these for doing my own toe-painting at home.  They are like the ones that most salons use.  I&#x27;ve only used one of the sets, but they seem to last for multiple uses per set.</li>
    <li> As much as I polish my toes, I don&#x27;t know why I did not purchase this item.  I am glad I did and it was a good deal on Amazon.  I plan to order more.</li>
    <li> Its actually a 6 pack, and they look damaged. I purchased to build spa sets for my daughter&#x27;s spa themed party and I can not use them because the look use and there is not enough packs.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s hard to complain for such a cheap product with free shipping, the item was not as described. They arrived not multicolored but all bubblegum pink. Also, as other reviewers have noted, they are very flimsy and rip very easily. Not worth it.</li>
    <li> The toe separators were NOT properly packaged and therefore two of them were sticking out of the package and were bent and useless.</li>
    <li> Shipping are slow , but it&#x27;s okay. I like the product</li>
    <li> Nice but careful separating them as they tear easily...shipped from China or Hong Kong and it took awhile to get to me.</li>
    <li> They serve the purpose for what I need to do, my clients love them they&#x27;re soft between the toes and help with keeping you from messing up the polish.</li>
    <li> These toe separators are your basic separators. They do the job just fine.  They are a bit tough, but given how cheap they are, I don&#x27;t mind that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that irked me about this product, however, was they were not packaged (as shown in the picture). Instead, they arrived all stacked together in an envelope.  Luckily, they looked very clean.  But, I still sanitized them before using.  I wish I had noticed that before leaving seller feedback where I said that the product was as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the colors - I don&#x27;t really care about that.  But, because other people brought it up in their reviews, I wanted to mention that I got a nice assortment of pretty colors.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and most of them were crushed and deformed looking. I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> They are as described, foamy and colorful. They could have been a hit. They arrived 3 days late, so you may want to check the seller and make sure they aren&#x27;t coming from way oversees. Mine came from China.</li>
    <li> If these were any more than $2 I would return them immediately.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they are ridiculously uncomfortable, and they don&#x27;t spread your pinky toe much. So it&#x27;s pointless.&lt;br /&gt;And second, if ASSORTED COLORS means all puke-green. Then they got it right.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely never order anything from this account again.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I mention the smell coming out of the package? I actually have to air out these because it smells like I got used toe separators.</li>
    <li> Nice, but took an extremely long time to get. I wanted them for a Christmas gift but they came way after. Took almost 2 months to get!!</li>
    <li> handy and what I needed</li>
    <li> My five year granddaughter loves this product. It gives her and her mother quality time and they play dress up without getting messy. Even her mom uses her foot nail polish accessories as everyday wear.  It really prevents the smears on clothers, carpet,and floors. They enjoy this time together.  I would recommend this product for any mom/daughter, especially with little girls, to find quality time with each other. It can be used over again and again, until it wears out but, think of the joy you will get together............</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted thank you</li>
    <li> Ordered for big group spa day with bunch of girls, fun colors, good quality, arrived earlier than expected and perfect timing!</li>
    <li> These are crap quality. When you get the cheapest sometimes you get just garbage. Right in the trash, lesson learned.</li>
    <li> Used for spa party and they were great.  All the girls got a pair in their goody bags for future pedis!</li>
    <li> Its six pairs of toe seperators. We ordered them for our daughter&#x27;s birthday party, it had a spa theme. They unfortunatly arrived the day after the party. Still we used them for our daughters. A good price for what they are.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for a little girls party, but anything else , ehhh. They are too small fro an adult or teen to use, and they break easily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone if they need them for anything other than a little girl.</li>
    <li> You get a lot in the package, but you need to handle them with care. The first time I tried to use one, it tore into three pieces. I quickly figured out how to handle them more gently. They&#x27;re kind of thin, so if you want a lot of separation between your toes, these probably won&#x27;t work. But they&#x27;re better than nothing. Oh...they also took a long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> great for toe separation while painting nails.  These are just like the ones in the store but a lot cheaper.  I would not purchase anywhere else.  They arrive quickly.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product. It cost me more to ship it that what I actually paid for the product, but I needed it last min so I guess I can&#x27;t complain too much. The product it&#x27;s self works and is a great thing if you are not looking for &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; stuff. The color wasn&#x27;t on all of them in places but they worked for my daughter&#x27;s spa themed birthday party.</li>
    <li> These toe separators are small and I cannot leave them on for very long as they are painful to wear.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t the highest quality but for the price they work very well and serve the purpose. I couldn&#x27;t see getting anything different really.</li>
    <li> packaged well.  received in a timely fashion.  the quality is not greater than a dollar store version,,,maybe a little  less...  have not used but by appearance it may be a little less quality.</li>
    <li> These came VERY FAST and do exactly what they were meant to do - help me make my toesies pretty!</li>
    <li> Love the colors and packing- great job- will be using them for gifts since they arrived after i needed them.&lt;br /&gt;This company is fantastic- there was a problem with me not receiving my order by the time I needed it- it was not a problem on the companies fault at all- anyway before I knew this I complained about the product being late- they sent me another order at their cost with a free gift for me.</li>
    <li> Quality expected for price that was paid. However, items were crammed in a package that was too small and several were bent and torn.</li>
    <li> Assorted colors.  Really? I guess 2 colors would be considered assorted. I bought these for my daughter who just became a licensed  nail tech. I probably wont encourage her to use them as they are very flimsy and &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; looking. I guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for. Would NOT recommend. .</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised and they fit my wife&#x27;s toes comfortably. Will buy again. That, and she really likes the colors. :-)</li>
    <li> These toe separators, two sets, arrived crammed into a tiny envelope so that some of the separators were broken off and others so twisted as to be unusable.  They are made out of a flimsy foam that causes them to twist when using them.  Pay a couple more dollars and buy something else that works. These are sure to disappoint even at this low price.</li>
    <li> These definitely work for what they were purchased for.  You cant beat the price for these.  Well worth it for the price.</li>
    <li> more description needed. mentioned assorted colours, received only one colour. Ordered this product for a spa party theme, but with the colours received, useless!!</li>
    <li> 12 for such a nice price. I&#x27;ve had these since last year and I&#x27;ve still only used one and it&#x27;s very helpful keeping your toes separated while painting them.</li>
    <li> There were all shipped and in good shape just wasn&#x27;t assorted colors like I had ordered.  They were all pink and white!</li>
    <li> Very flimsy but I suppose should be expected for the price.</li>
    <li> Wow a 12 pack of toes seperator, I ordered them because of their purpose when painting your toe nails. The product is just as good as a person would find in a professional nail salon.</li>
    <li> These are a great value, the shipping was fast and the product is as described. The colors I received were all pastel though, not brights like the picture would suggest.</li>
    <li> I love them, They work just great.  They do look a little different then in the picture but they do the job.</li>
    <li> i got these before the delievery date which is cool, but it didnt come with assorted colors. i only got all pink, but i really dont mind. they dont really seperate my pinky toe that much but at the end of the day , there just going on your toes to be painted and then taken off so its ok.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and it is just as it&#x27;s advertised.  Colors and all.  I have no complaints on this product.</li>
    <li> I received a package of these that will last a lifetime. No need to ever buy any more. Can&#x27;t beat the deal on these. Took a little while to get here from China but worth it. I recommend.</li>
    <li> These toe separators fit comfortably between my toes, and I really like the bright colors.  They work great to keep my toes apart while I polish my toenails.</li>
    <li> My friend thought that these would be a bit larger, but they are still useable by him, and for someone in a salon environment these would be a great disposable or giveaway item.  Possibly a Girls Night Out &amp;#34;GNO&amp;#34; item, pajama party, etc...</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Happy buyer.</li>
    <li> These were supposed to be for a little girl&#x27;s &amp;#34;rainbow&amp;#34; spa party. I received 6 pink and 6 purple. I will use them since most girls like these colors, but does not go with our rainbow theme for the spa. Not as pictured. Otherwise they are a good size and perfect for the girls goodie bags.</li>
    <li> So i got these for my daughter, they may be a bit bit for her feet but thats not anyones fault. only thing is the description says 12 for 12 people to do both feet so that tells me 12 sets of 2 being 24 total, well its 6 sets of 2 being 12 total. but really for the price of what $2 im not tripping out, but i bet they have at the dollar store</li>
    <li> I bought these for doing pedicures for my adult friends and family. They work great, don&#x27;t break, and they&#x27;re as comfortable as any comparable products. A good buy at a low price.</li>
    <li> very flimsy, won&#x27;t work because of the flimsyness of the product. Just paid like a dollar but not even worth the dollar. I just threw them in the trash</li>
    <li> Low price &amp; I think these are actually really Great...I&#x27;m not sure what the others were expecting from these, but the toe separators I received are very firm &amp; do the job well... I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pass over this product, by reading some of the other reviewers I almost did... I&#x27;ll add some pictures...</li>
    <li> Very sturdy, colorful, great price! My clients love them! I love that they can be sanatized and used again, and again.</li>
    <li> Some how I got wayyyyyy more than just 12</li>
    <li> These toe seperators will do the job, plain and simple. They are flimsy though. I bought them to use as sewing bobbin holders, and the bobbins fall out easily. But overall, great price for what you receive!!</li>
    <li> my toes overlap when I polish them the toe seperator is excellent just like the ones at the nail salon.  My nail polish does not smudge.</li>
    <li> Excellent, just as described</li>
    <li> Used for my daughters spa party. Good price</li>
    <li> It would be nice if the material they are made of would be more pliable. The spacers hurt my toes.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy and when I received these they were bent. It states 12 pairs enough for 12 people they lied I only received 6.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these. They are very reasonable price and last a while. I use them all the time and they come in a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I like the colors and although these are thinner than I had expected I think they will work just fine.</li>
    <li> Low quality, but they came fast! Which was really nice.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t really assorted colors. just 2 colors yellow &amp; coral but did come on or before the stated date. item was ok</li>
    <li> BAD QUALITY!!! And really expensive. I tried to return it, but they didnt let me saying is gonna be more expensive the return than the product.&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS EVER...</li>
    <li> So e came bend, the package is horrible, staffed in envelope, no shape, protection.after one use some fell apart.</li>
    <li> These are very flimsy, but okay for the price!</li>
    <li> these are so comfy, they break easily so you must be careful with theses, these are more like the disposable kind</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these for so cheap! And I got so many! It will be perfect to add to my bridesmaids&#x27; gifts.</li>
