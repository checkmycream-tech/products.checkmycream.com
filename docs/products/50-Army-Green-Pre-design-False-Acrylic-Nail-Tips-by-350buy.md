<li> Other then that I&#x27;ve done my nails up several times with these &amp; people always compliment them.</li>
<li> Thwe big one were not large enough for the thumb and the small ones were to big for the pinky.</li>
<li> You have to be careful when putting them on</li>
<li> They are packaged a little oddly, but they still work.</li>
<li> and I mean never purchase  anything from this seller again also took a month to get my stuff with 2 days shipping</li>
