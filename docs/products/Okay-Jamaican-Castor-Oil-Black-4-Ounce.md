<li> Normally, I have to apply oils/moisturizer to my ends every day because they get so dry and break off, but with the OJCO mixture</li>

<li> I was surprised that there are not many reviews on this brand and wonder why because it works well for growth.</li>
<li> I use it as lotion on my arms, legs, and a few times as facial moisturizer.</li>
<li> but you can mix with other carrier oils to help mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> so you have to be careful not to make a mess</li>
<li> I will start researching other benefits of Black Castor Oil.</li>
<li> I use it on my scalp because I have excessive dry scalp and skin.</li>
<li> That is probably why my hair didn&#x27;t dry out or looks dull.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick</li>
<li> There are much worse smelling things.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell.</li>
<li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
<li> Stinks like hell, but it does the job.</li>
<li> it is not greasy nor do it have a unpleasant smell.</li>
<li> Bottle leaked bad but product is as described.</li>
<li> Reminds me of show shinning product which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Grew back my non existent eyebrows and cleared my skin.</li>
    <li> Only gave it 3 stars because I personally do not like the smell. Reminds me of show shinning product which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad but I was looking to use something for my hair and eye lashes and cannot stand to smell it all day. It is very thick so will last long, you do not need much at all. May have to find an alternative use for it since it is good for so many things.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the OJCO because my hair has been shedding and the ends have been breaking for the last five months.  I started using it on 1/3/15 mixed with an Organic Argan oil and the mixture really made my hair feel/look healthy, shiny and soft.  Normally, I have to apply oils/moisturizer to my ends every day because they get so dry and break off, but with the OJCO mixture I didn&#x27;t need to.  My ends still feels soft and healthy. FYI I started using a pure silk scarf in order to retain the oils in my hair during the night.  That is probably why my hair didn&#x27;t dry out or looks dull.  I will definitely recommend the OJCO to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this brand of black jamaican castor oil and am very pleased with the accelerated growth of my hair. I purchased from my local beauty supply and have used 2 bottles and have noticed growth in thinning areas as well. It&#x27;s thick and doesn&#x27;t have a weird smell. I just purchased another popular brand by Tropical Isle and I&#x27;m interested in seeing the differences between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now I can&#x27;t compare but I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this brand because I&#x27;ve had great results. I was surprised that there are not many reviews on this brand and wonder why because it works well for growth.</li>
    <li> Stinks like hell, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I had to return this product because the oil had spilled during shipment. It also smelled absolutely foul, like rancid sesame oil.</li>
    <li> Love the oil for it&#x27;s uses, but could do without the scent.  It is not pleasing at all</li>
    <li> Excellent product for growth/loss</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to my by a friend who recommended it to her... to say the least they loved it, she loved it and I do to!! I have recommended it to several of my friends. My hair is natural and this product is the best I have found. I have hair breakage, loss that is to be excepted but nothing like I had prior. This product is great it is not greasy nor do it have a unpleasant smell. Yes, believe me and go out and try it for yourself you will be amazed with the results.</li>
    <li> If you have a dog with a wart...this stuff works in 3 applications!!!</li>
    <li> this product is the best!!  And, Amazon is the best place to get it!  Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I enjoy the use of this oil on my hair.....I will order again.</li>
    <li> Bottle leaked bad but product is as described. I put mine in plastic zip lock bag.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to have a true opinion about it.</li>
    <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, it has a strong smell but you can mix with other carrier oils to help mask the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow it back in a couple of months! Consistency is the key! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you. Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands. I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% castor. I hope this review helps!!</li>
    <li> I saw this on Dr. Ozz and fell in love with it! It&#x27;s very thick so you have to be careful not to make a mess and I use it for everything.&lt;br /&gt;I add a couple of drops into my regular lotion. I use it on my feet and wrap them in socks and they feel better then when I get a pedicure and thats saying a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a hand cream, I wipe my make off with it. I read somewhere people use it as anti wrinkle cream so I have been moisturizing with it at night. The smell is different but usually mixing it with your regular body lotion its great. I also use it for split ends or to prevent them and my ends look healthy and shiny. Definitely a new favorite.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff! I use it on my scalp because I have excessive dry scalp and skin. I use it as lotion on my arms, legs, and a few times as facial moisturizer. My scalp is now healthy and we know that healthy hair and hair growth starts with a healthy scalp. I will start researching other benefits of Black Castor Oil.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders, despite the smell. Most people complain about the smell, but that&#x27;s very minor, because it&#x27;s not a terrible odor. There are much worse smelling things.</li>
    <li> This oil is easy to apply but just a bit greasy. I  am a male who has always enjoyed a head full of thick black hair but for some reason it began to break in certain areas if this grows my hair back it will be well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell. Going to send it back.</li>
