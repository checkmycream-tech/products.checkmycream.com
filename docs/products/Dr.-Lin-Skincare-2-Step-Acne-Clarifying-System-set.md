      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
      <li>and I have gained more confident walking out and seeing myself in a mirror.</li>
      <li>As the product worked its magic the whiteheads disappeared and the under the skin acne dissolved away.</li>
      <li>Most lines contains one of these and use it exclusively in products designed for combined usage.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to come across this product in CVS.  </li>
      <li>THis is an excellent product, highly effective yet gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I read the box and loved the fact that it reported to do so much yet did not contain carcinogens, mineral oils, sulfates, etc...  </li>

      <li>And its cheap.</li>
      <li>Our daughter can be confident and have pretty skin.</li>
      <li>I am so excited that I bought this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also very conscientious about avoiding harmful and cheap fillers ingredients that many drug store skincare systems contain.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many high-end skincare lines, such as Murad, Peter Thomas Roth, Dermalogica, Mario Bedescu, etc., which I thought were pretty good products.</li>
      <li>I love the products but stating this was a &amp;#34;3 count&amp;#34; is very misleading.  </li>
      <li>In trying to figure out what happened, I&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that the use of 3 strong ingredients salicylic acid,  hyaluronic acid AND Benzoyl Peroxide in one product line designed to be used together is TOO MUCH!  </li>
      <li>Because I read labels even  a reaction is rare.  </li>
      <li>For our daughter with fair skin we tried natural methods, such as apple cider vinegar, but got nowhere.</li>
      <li>The 2-step is great for someone like me who is typically pretty lazy when it comes to skin care.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be coming back for more !!</li>
      <li>This is my first ever review in any website.</li>

      <li>I have used murad, proactive ,  and  clean &amp;clear.</li>
      <li>Usually I can not use salic acid without if causing my face to dry up and crust off, however with this product my skin is perfect.</li>
      <li>I still get minor breakout, but my face is way much better than it used to be, and scars are even fading away.</li>
      <li>This works better than anything I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and flaky in the process.</li>
      <li>I actually did not expect my face to clear up so quickly and feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>I have only had these products 2 days and notice a HUGE difference.</li>
      <li>I saw changes within a week, and now it has been a month and a week, my face cleared up so much</li>

      <li>Nothing is better than having a clear face finally at 28.</li>

      <li>This is my first ever review, so I&#x27;m new to this world, but i ABSOLUTELY HAD TO do a review on this.</li>
      <li>I am 18 years old and have struggled with finding the right products for my skin.</li>
      <li>need bigger bottle other than that it&#x27;s  good.</li>
      <li>In the event that I&#x27;ve had a reaction to a particular product it has always been a matter of over drying .  </li>
      <li>This has high dosages of all three ingredients and instructs you to use them in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it dose the job and its brand new and came in on time and works within the 1st day u use it</li>
      <li>After looking around I stumbled on this new kit and decided to give it a try</li>
      <li>They cleared my skin up for the most part (which is oily combo), but they have never seemed to make the small skin colored bumps on my forehead to go away.</li>
      <li>My face was full of active acne/pimple</li>
      <li>In just one day, my redness was gone and my cystic acne was beginning to clear</li>
      <li>After two days the blackheads completely disappeared and the bumps began vanishing.</li>
      <li>My skin is now so soft and has lost it&#x27;s oily-ness.</li>
      <li>I have admittedly sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I have tried everything on the market, literally high to low end, none have even compared to this system.</li>
      <li>facial swelling to 3 times the normal size of my face</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say how happy I am to not apply make up frustrated about the way my face looks.</li>

<li> and I usually buy it with Dr.</li>
<li> I find it difficult to keep the regiment going with a 3-step program for whatever reason.</li>
<li> It is difficult to find in stores</li>
<li> It was so painful until I bought this product.</li>
<li> I am truly disappointed</li>
<li> If you stick with this system you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> LOVE IT !!!! IF U DIDNT BUY IT YET, BUY IT NOW!!!! it dose the job and its brand new and came in on time and works within the 1st day u use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne since i was a teen and with biracial skin, very few products work and even less products consistently make a difference. In just one day, my redness was gone and my cystic acne was beginning to clear up- even my hormonal acne was beginning to diminish! My pores are getting smaller and my blackheads are clearing up as well. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anybody who his looking for a reliable product</li>
    <li> It cleared my skin for about 2 weeks, then it broke me out in places I never broke out before...My search continues.</li>
    <li> Having very good results with this product!</li>
    <li> This did not work as well as ones I brought in the past. I stopped using it and switched back to using natural products, such as Dr. Kay peppermint soap and vitamin E gel.</li>
    <li> The 2-step is great for someone like me who is typically pretty lazy when it comes to skin care. I find it difficult to keep the regiment going with a 3-step program for whatever reason. This product subtracts a step, but keeps the quality of your skin feeling really good and smooth, which is a real bonus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells really good. I personally think it smells like lemon cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend if you are looking for a simple and effective way to improve your skin quality.</li>
    <li> This is my first ever review in any website. I am so excited that I bought this product. I would have bought it if I knew it before years ago. My face was full of active acne/pimple and I always had to hide from mirror seeing myself. It was so painful until I bought this product. I saw changes within a week, and now it has been a month and a week, my face cleared up so much and I have gained more confident walking out and seeing myself in a mirror. I still get minor breakout, but my face is way much better than it used to be, and scars are even fading away. I first wash with cleanser, apply an acne lotion, let it dry, and after few minutes, I apply thin layer of acne spot correct on my face. Thank you Dr. lin for making this amazing product.</li>
    <li> my son only likes this brand</li>
    <li> I have tried everything on the market, literally high to low end, none have even compared to this system. I have sensitive skin with lots of post acne spots and active ones and within a week there is a dramatically amazing difference! I can&#x27;t say how happy I am to not apply make up frustrated about the way my face looks. It does dry out skin, but I think that is part of the process similar to Retinol A (prescription) and i&#x27;ve avoided intense sunlight. I would recommend to everyone and am definitely buying more. Going to try Dr. Lin&#x27;s hydrating gel now.  Nothing is better than having a clear face finally at 28.</li>
    <li> I love the products but stating this was a &amp;#34;3 count&amp;#34; is very misleading.  Definitely wasted my money paying $18 + s&amp;h for one box</li>
    <li> I have used murad, proactive ,  and  clean &amp;clear. Acne products.. I have to say when I purchased this 3 days ago on 6/22/14  I actually did not expect my face to clear up so quickly and feel so smooth. No harsh chemical to scrub on my face, a light scent. I&#x27;m pleased.  And I don&#x27;t write review but I had to on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Just need bigger bottle other than that it&#x27;s  good. Thank you Dr.Lin</li>
    <li> I have admittedly sensitive skin.  As a result, I am very careful about what I put on it.  I&#x27;m also very conscientious about avoiding harmful and cheap fillers ingredients that many drug store skincare systems contain.  I was very excited to come across this product in CVS.  I read the box and loved the fact that it reported to do so much yet did not contain carcinogens, mineral oils, sulfates, etc...  I also looked at the active ingredient list and  it contained ingredients in the same dosage that I&#x27;ve used before.  In the event that I&#x27;ve had a reaction to a particular product it has always been a matter of over drying .  Because I read labels even  a reaction is rare.  Oh, and I also read the 6 reviews that preceded my reveiw . Five were glowing one was unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to four days later.  Since the ONE time that I washed my face with this system I have:&lt;br /&gt;experienced facial swelling to 3 times the normal size of my face&lt;br /&gt;had a rash that covers almost every inch of my face including my lips&lt;br /&gt;consumed 50 mcg benadryl  every 4 hours&lt;br /&gt;been initially overcome with tiredness that left me unable to be productive&lt;br /&gt;been rushed to  ER where I received a steroid treatment (DEcadron)&lt;br /&gt;Experienced insomnia due to the Decadron (known side effect)&lt;br /&gt;Experience the urge  to claw at  my face with my nails ( this is using the steroid and antihistimine)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NEVER had an experience like this and I&#x27;ve tried a variety of products.  In trying to figure out what happened, I&#x27;ve reached the conclusion that the use of 3 strong ingredients salicylic acid,  hyaluronic acid AND Benzoyl Peroxide in one product line designed to be used together is TOO MUCH!  Most lines contains one of these and use it exclusively in products designed for combined usage. This has high dosages of all three ingredients and instructs you to use them in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review.  I felt compelled  to share  so that I could possibly prevent someone from enduring the agony and hell that I am STILL experiencing!  Be careful when using this product, it is definitely not all that it seems!</li>
    <li> Very superb product that I have purchased cleared up most of my acne and I usually buy it with Dr.Lin Daily Cleanser in a 8 Ounce bottle since Step 1 and the Dr.Lin Daily Cleanser are the same, I usually use the Step 1 Bottle from Dr.Lin Skincare regiment and refill the 8 Ounce bottle. I am usually liberal with the application on of the product since I can find deals on these around various websites. It took me 2-3 weeks for my acne to start clearing since I went through the purging phase with this product and it has consistent results should you continously use it in a consistent fashion.</li>
    <li> This product did work but it didn&#x27;t help with my scars I had on my face. Sometimes it made my face really dry but other then that it did help in some places.</li>
    <li> This product is seriously amazing! I&#x27;ve only been using it for the past week, morning and night, and I have seen a major difference. My skin is now so soft and has lost it&#x27;s oily-ness. I definitely 100% recommend this product to anyone who has been struggling to find a great product with great results at a great price. You will not regret buying this product. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it all turns out in the upcoming future! I will definitely be coming back for more !!</li>
    <li> I struggle with adult acne and have tried everything on the market for the last decade. I found success with the proactiv system but it left my skin very dry and dull so I started looking for something better. After looking around I stumbled on this new kit and decided to give it a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did! This works better than anything I&#x27;ve used and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and flaky in the process. As with any acne product, you have to be patient and realistic so give it a good week to see results. If you stick with this system you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> This is my first ever review, so I&#x27;m new to this world, but i ABSOLUTELY HAD TO do a review on this. I am 18 years old and have struggled with finding the right products for my skin. I have only had these products 2 days and notice a HUGE difference. I&#x27;ve tried so many high-end skincare lines, such as Murad, Peter Thomas Roth, Dermalogica, Mario Bedescu, etc., which I thought were pretty good products. They cleared my skin up for the most part (which is oily combo), but they have never seemed to make the small skin colored bumps on my forehead to go away. I researched these and turns out they&#x27;re just clogged pores. I&#x27;ve had Dr.Lin before so i thought i would give it a go. I&#x27;m in love. These products along with using jojoba oil as a moisturizer have majorly cleared these small bumps up AND ITS BEEN TWO DAYS. Amazing. And its cheap. What else is there to want?</li>
    <li> This is the only skincare product that works for my daughter. It is difficult to find in stores so it is great they offer their product line on Amazon. THis is an excellent product, highly effective yet gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this Products! It works! And it did not try out my skin. It is very easy  2 steps compare to all others products out there.Simple and it works.</li>
    <li> Was very upset that everyone was ranting and raving about this product that did absolutely noting for me if anything I experienced more breakouts and blackheads than before. I am truly disappointed</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product that I have found for adult oily skin and acne! It leaves my skin completely smooth in just two steps. Usually I can not use salic acid without if causing my face to dry up and crust off, however with this product my skin is perfect. It does take about a four days to a week. You will be amazed!</li>
    <li> For our daughter with fair skin we tried natural methods, such as apple cider vinegar, but got nowhere. We didn&#x27;t want any harsh chemical stuff like Proactive, which also ruins clothing and towels. Then we found by chance the Dr. Lin Skincare products and we are so happy. This is a paraben-free product with botanicals and we saw results of skin improvement almost immediately. After two days the blackheads completely disappeared and the bumps began vanishing. As the product worked its magic the whiteheads disappeared and the under the skin acne dissolved away. We don&#x27;t need to go to the dermatologist! Our daughter can be confident and have pretty skin. The product will last a long time because you don&#x27;t use much at all. We&#x27;re very satisfied and glad to find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great Product, really clarifies my skin!</li>
