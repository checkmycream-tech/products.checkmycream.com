      <li>I give this a 5 star because its a great product.  </li>
      <li>The taste is great and you don&#x27;t get all that foam.  </li>
      <li>and I have had great dental check-</li>
      <li>Recommended by my dentist and not at any stores in my area, of course Amazon had it and at a great price.</li>
      <li>After many decays, the dentist suggested biotene to help my husband with his &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34;!!  </li>
      <li>SLES is an inexpensive and very effective foaming agent.</li>
      <li>The taste and texture are both very nice.</li>
      <li>Either way it tastes great and is a good toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Biotene is always good to have around to brush your teeth when you have  a sore mouth, tongue or lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Why they took a perfectly good product and ruined it is beyond me.</li>
      <li>But Biotene has a rinse that is really good as well.</li>
      <li>tasting good.....</li>

      <li>This review is an honest review.</li>
      <li>The mint gel tastes good too :)</li>
      <li>The flavor of this one differs from the original, but it&#x27;s good.</li>
      <li>I have used Biotene for many years.  </li>
      <li>No saliva means that teeth are not getting the protective coating they need to protect against decay, pain in the gums, and having to give up spicy/hot foods which I love.</li>
      <li>Surely, it has eliminated trips to a dentist for a cleaning.</li>
      <li>i love it and will continue to repurchase over and over.</li>
      <li>My favorite mouth washes and toothpaste have become kerosene in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It may clean my mouth good but it does not feel as clean as with the Colgate I have been using.</li>
      <li>I like the gel type better than the paste type but its just a personal preference as both work very good.  </li>
      <li>Biotene toothpaste combined with Biotene mouthwash is the best remedy I have found for chronically dry mouth.</li>
      <li>This is the best product for dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>the best for a person who has dry mouth.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find it readily available from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your good service.</li>
      <li>Works best when used with other Biotene products like the Oral Balance Gel and the mouthwash.</li>
      <li>The dentist told me that was also why my gums bled easily when I flossed.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals yet has a clean, refreshing flavor, give this a try.</li>
      <li>It also has a very mild flavor.  </li>
      <li>BIOTENE products really are the best and truly effective for dry mouth.  </li>
      <li>A very good product to use for dry mouth disease..</li>
      <li>Totally fine product.</li>
      <li>This is a fine product.</li>
      <li>and now I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it was free.</li>
      <li>and I believe has helped me keep my oral health in a good place throughout many medically trying times.</li>
      <li>Biotene is not foamy but leaves your mouth feeling clean</li>
      <li>I use but my teeth do not feel clean after brushing.  </li>
      <li>I imagine that for many people, 5 stars would certainly be in order.</li>
      <li>So glad we found it - highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using biotene gel PBF toothpaste and PBF mouthwash for at least two years with excellent results in removing plaque.</li>
      <li>This particular toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh, and most importantly of all - my teeth and gums feel really clean.  </li>
      <li>There are numerous products available for dry mouth, &amp; Biotene makes one of the best, the gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like it just melts into your mouth leaving it clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>However, for people with severe dry mouth, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t particularly good.</li>
      <li>I have also noticed my usual tartar buildup is not happening - a good sign!</li>
      <li>The taste is fine, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t burn, but I find flouride toothpaste to be better overall, &amp; my dentist also prefers it.</li>
      <li>It is my belief that nylon bristles create static electricity while brushing, in effect electrocuting the nerves within the tooth structure, causing what is called, \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t make my mouth feel fresh.</li>
      <li>takes care of the problem right way.</li>
      <li>ive always struggled with dry mouth, this toothpaste has been fantastic!!  </li>
      <li>Lack of saliva causes very real problems in eating, period.</li>
      <li>Only a very light mint flavor.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the gel feeling at first (not enough &#x27;grit&#x27; to make it feel like i was actually getting my teeth clean), but alias, it gets the job done. :)</li>
      <li>I tried Rembrant first</li>
      <li>and I prefer the taste of Gentle Mint instead of Fresh Mint</li>
      <li>sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc.).</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise, in my post-chemo dental appointment, the depth of my gums that used to be 3s and 4s all changed to 2s and 3s!</li>
      <li>I am sure that there are others that experience stomach upsets following toothbrushing.</li>
      <li>Very few toothpastes without whiteners now, but Biotene is wonderful and I prefer the get over the regular paste Biotene.  </li>
      <li>Lately I have not been able to find the Mint-Gel flavor, which is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>and I like this gentle mint flavor better than regular mint toothpaste.</li>
      <li>I have always tended towards dry mouth and now am on many medications permanently</li>
      <li>Dry mouth is better, if not gone, and no sores.</li>
      <li>I as a cancer survivor certainly did.</li>
      <li>Works great if you have a dry mouth due to being a \\&quot;mouth breather\\&quot;........</li>
      <li>I use an electric toothbrush and really like the fact</li>
      <li>Using it as much as 3 or 4 times a day helps quite a bit.</li>
      <li>and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
      <li>The toothpaste feels gentle - there&#x27;s nothing abrasive in it -</li>
      <li>It also cleans my teethe very well.</li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste he can comfortably use.  </li>
      <li>I really like the no foam aspect.</li>
      <li>Biotine Gentle Mint Toothpaste...</li>
      <li>Biotene products really help relieve the symptom.</li>
      <li>This really helps at night before bed.</li>
      <li>Can no longer find \\&quot;Gentle Mint\\&quot; in Markets or Stores</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t tell just how much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried brushing with normal toothpaste a time or two, and it burns as much as if I&#x27;d been drinking acid.</li>
      <li>I really liked this toothpaste, it&#x27;s really light and keeps your breath fresh without the thick peppermint taste of other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Despite having difficulty with dry mouth due to medication, I have good teeth.  </li>
      <li>I had used this particular toothpaste (in gel form) for ages.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend both of these products.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have trouble using most toothpastes because if they contain SLES, they leave a burning sensation on my lips and mouth.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant taste and leaves less of an aftertaste than other toothpastes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only given 4 stars on this, because I&#x27;m basing it on my own experience which may be a little harsher than some folks.</li>

    <li> I have used the Biotene brand for a long time, but I always used the paste version. The flavor of this one differs from the original, but it&#x27;s good. I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the gel feeling at first (not enough &#x27;grit&#x27; to make it feel like i was actually getting my teeth clean), but alias, it gets the job done. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my oncologist, and has helped minimally with dry mouth that accompanies my particular chemotherapy treatments.  It has been somewhat helpful, but has not made a substantial difference.  I cannot speak for how helpful it would be for a &amp;#34;non-chemo&amp;#34; user.</li>
    <li> Totally fine product.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this brand of toothpaste to me before I began chemotherapy. I decided to try it since it wouldn&#x27;t hurt. Much to my surprise, in my post-chemo dental appointment, the depth of my gums that used to be 3s and 4s all changed to 2s and 3s! It felt great to have some good news while going through a medically challenging time. The toothpaste feels gentle - there&#x27;s nothing abrasive in it - and I believe has helped me keep my oral health in a good place throughout many medically trying times.</li>
    <li> Apparently, this toothpaste lacks a foaming agent that upsets my stomach.  Hurray!  I am sure that there are others that experience stomach upsets following toothbrushing.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist and not at any stores in my area, of course Amazon had it and at a great price. Works great if you have a dry mouth due to being a \\&quot;mouth breather\\&quot;........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastes great and does the job !</li>
    <li> At the recommendation of his dentist, my husband uses this product daily. Not all stores stock this product. I was pleased to find it readily available from Amazon. Thanks for your good service.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does what it claims to do, which is to provide relief for dry mouth.  The taste and texture are both very nice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste for several years for my chronically dry mouth--within days of starting use, the frequency of canker sores in my mouth dropped 90%, and has been low ever since</li>
    <li> My dentist told me I have the beginnings of gum disease - and I already floss daily and brush after ever meal.  So I decided to enhance my brushing by using Biotene toothpaste.  I use an electric toothbrush and really like the fact Biotene doesn&#x27;t foam like regular toothpaste (I brush for two minutes after each meal).  This particular toothpaste makes my mouth feel fresh, and most importantly of all - my teeth and gums feel really clean.  I have also noticed my usual tartar buildup is not happening - a good sign!</li>
    <li> I recommend Biotene toothpaste, particularly for people with oral issues such as mouth sores.  I did not like the gel but other Biotenes are very good.</li>
    <li> Biotene is always good to have around to brush your teeth when you have  a sore mouth, tongue or lips.&lt;br /&gt;I had irritated lips from a new lipstick &amp; Biotene (just by bubbling out when I brushed) helped the redness heal in just a few days.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ORAL SIDE EFFECTS FROM RADIATION FOR CANCER AND THIS TOOTHPASTE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DOESN&#x27;T BURN MY MOUTH</li>
    <li> I use toothpaste without sodium lauryl sulfate to prevent canker sores. This brand works for me. I tried Rembrant first but it didn&#x27;t make my mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Just right for my dry mouth. Only a very light mint flavor. Mint burns my skin and drys my mouth.</li>
    <li> I used the product for a month or so and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. As another reviewer stated after about 2 or 3 brush strokes and the product is gone, dissolved away. I stopped using it and went back to my usual toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I love the Amazon subscription service! I&#x27;m paying less than half of what I&#x27;d pay buying this toothpaste from the drugstore. Biotene toothpaste is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve found to reduce canker sore pain. The mint gel tastes good too :)</li>
    <li> ive always struggled with dry mouth, this toothpaste has been fantastic!!  i love it and will continue to repurchase over and over.</li>
    <li> This really helps with dry mouth.  If it doesn&#x27;t solve your dry mouth problem use it with their other products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with dry mouth due to a medication I take and it did not work- at all. In fact, it made it worse. And I actually got sores in my mouth and on my tongue. As soon as I stopped using it the sores and super-dry mouth went away. I ended up going with a natural toothpaste (a NOW product) from my local health food store. Dry mouth is better, if not gone, and no sores.</li>
    <li> One or two brush strokes and it is gone. word word word word word word word word word word (Stupid rules)</li>
    <li> This is the best product for dry mouth.  A nurse recommended it to me after chemo therapy made my mouth raw.  It was a godsend.  My mouth healed and I no longer get canker sores which I suffered with for years.  There mouth gel worked well to after chemo.  I don&#x27;t like the taste of their mouthwash tho..</li>
    <li> Because of certain medications he takes, my husband gets extreme dry mouth. He keeps a tube of this with him at all times.</li>
    <li> Because I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and an extremely dry mouth, this is the only toothpaste I can use which doesn&#x27;t burn the inside of my mouthl</li>
    <li> Biotene toothpaste combined with Biotene mouthwash is the best remedy I have found for chronically dry mouth. I have been using these products for over 18 years and they are the only products that have helped with my dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;The pricing I am getting through Amazon cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I have dry mouth because of some of the meds I must take.  This toothpaste is very good for keeping the mouth moist while sleeping and I use it in connection with other biotene products.</li>
    <li> Before using this product, I was getting a dry mouth and a the resulting bad breath within 15 minutes of brushing my teeth. This has definitely helped - I go hours now instead. It will not last you all day unless you are brushing after each meal. I recommend using this toothpaste and the Biotene Oral Balance gel or spray to keep your mouth moist later in the day.</li>
    <li> BIOTENE products really are the best and truly effective for dry mouth.  I have tried all their products and fully rely on the toothpaste and mouth rinse.  I have always tended towards dry mouth and now am on many medications permanently that make the condition much worse.  Drinking water only helps for an instant.  With real dry mouth you need products that help saliva production and BIOTENE does this expertly.  This is a fluoride toothpaste which is a must and is the only paste I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dry mouth I had constant canker sores, irritations, pain on my tongue and just overall discomfort in my mouth.  I have been using BIOTENE now for years but when I started it it only took continuous use for about two weeks for the dry mouth symptoms to honestly totally disappear.  This is a product you must use regularly to work if you have dry mouth.  If you do this BIOTENE should provide miraculous results for you as it did for me.  It contains the ingredients necessary to provide salivation to ease the discomforts of dry mouth.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like the no foam aspect. This toothpaste works well with the other items in the biotene line up.</li>
    <li> I really liked this toothpaste, it&#x27;s really light and keeps your breath fresh without the thick peppermint taste of other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> Biotene does NOT contain sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES). I have trouble using most toothpastes because if they contain SLES, they leave a burning sensation on my lips and mouth. Biotene is not foamy but leaves your mouth feeling clean and I have had great dental check-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fron Wikipedia: sodium lauryl ether sulfate (SLES), is a detergent and surfactant found in many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpaste etc.). SLES is an inexpensive and very effective foaming agent. Although SLES is considered safe at the concentrations used in cosmetic products, it is an irritant similar to other detergents, with the irritation increasing with concentration.[2] SLES has been shown to produce eye or skin irritation in experimental animals and in some human test subjects.[2] The related surfactant SLS is a known irritant,[3][4] and research suggests that SLES can also cause irritation after extended exposure in some people.[5][6]</li>
    <li> Was a loyal customer for years, but After they changed the formula, all Biotene products now suck and taste horrible.  Why they took a perfectly good product and ruined it is beyond me.</li>
    <li> There are numerous products available for dry mouth, &amp; Biotene makes one of the best, the gel. However, for people with severe dry mouth, this toothpaste isn&#x27;t particularly good. The taste is fine, &amp; it doesn&#x27;t burn, but I find flouride toothpaste to be better overall, &amp; my dentist also prefers it.</li>
    <li> Despite having difficulty with dry mouth due to medication, I have good teeth.  I thank biotene toothpaste and their other products for this outcome.  I would recommend this toothpaste to anyone with dry mouth issues.  It also has a very mild flavor.  I found it was one of the few toothpastes, I could tolerate, when I was pregnant.  The overly minty ones of other brands was very difficult for me to stomach, I was so sick.</li>
    <li> Family member undergoing chemo has mouth sores.  This is the only toothpaste he can comfortably use.  So glad we found it - highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever suffered from Dry Mouth, this is the toothpaste for you. It helps stimulate the flow of saliva, thus relieving the symptoms. Dry mouth can be caused by a variety of ways: medication, illness, or Dry Mouth Syndrome. Biotene products really help relieve the symptom.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to whiteners in toothpaste. Very few toothpastes without whiteners now, but Biotene is wonderful and I prefer the get over the regular paste Biotene.  Locally, all I can get is the regular paste.</li>
    <li> I have very dry mouth and have been using this for years.  An expensive toothpaste but the Amazon price was the cheapest I have found anywhere.  It really works to give me relief for a little while.  It also cleans my teethe very well.</li>
    <li> I use but my teeth do not feel clean after brushing.  I do not see much improvement in dry mouth, maybey that&#x27;s just me. I probably will keep using because my dentist recommends it</li>
    <li> I have extreme dry mouth due to medications I am taking.  Sometimes my mouth is so dry I can&#x27;t even talk.  So I use the Biotene Gel Mint Toothpaste and I think it helps alot.  I also use the mouthwash also.  The taste is great and you don&#x27;t get all that foam.  It&#x27;s like it just melts into your mouth leaving it clean and fresh. I recommend to anyone with dry mouth problems.</li>
    <li> Can no longer find \\&quot;Gentle Mint\\&quot; in Markets or Stores so I order it at Amazon and I prefer the taste of Gentle Mint instead of Fresh Mint and I like this toothpaste as while cleaning my teeth. tasting good.....keeps my mouth moisturized......Biotine Gentle Mint Toothpaste...my choice.....</li>
    <li> I give this a 5 star because its a great product.  I have to use this type of toothpaste because of a medical condition called Sjogren&#x27;s disease  and it really helps with the dry mouth.  I like the gel type better than the paste type but its just a personal preference as both work very good.  Taste is good and mouth feels fresh and keeps you from having dry mouth and helps keep bad breath away. I would recommend it to anyone who has dry mouth for whatever reason.</li>
    <li> This review has gone from five stars to one because about a year ago Glaxo Smith Kline chose to destroy a very fine product that thousands of people relied on for dry mouth relief. I as a cancer survivor certainly did. I used to buy about 3 tubes a month and now none. There really is a public outcry to restore the old formulation but apparently no one is listening. It was so good that I gladly paid 6 to 9 dollars a tube and now I wouldn&#x27;t use it if it was free. This review is an honest review. I almost never give a bad review but in this case it is truly warranted.</li>
    <li> I like this toothpaste and have used it for several yrs.  I like the taste which has basically none.  Very good to moisten your mouth and gums.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist&#x27;s recommended trying Biotene and gave me a sample. It does help...so does Biotene&#x27;s mouth spray. The mint flavor is very mild...not like regular toothpaste and I like this gentle mint flavor better than regular mint toothpaste. I wish it would last longer and it may on others but not on me especially at night.</li>
    <li> Went back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste because Biotene changed their formula.  I had used this particular toothpaste (in gel form) for ages.  Hope they will bring the old one back.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with my regular toothpaste....still trying it out, would recommed.....the key is to get off stains or prescriptions!</li>
    <li> I needed this when I was on chemo, don&#x27;t need it now but still have some and it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Bought this after my dentist recommended I try it.  I have allergies and tend to breath with my mouth open at night which causes my mouth to get extremely dry.  The dentist told me that was also why my gums bled easily when I flossed.  After using it for a few weeks I noticed a big difference.  So did my dentist the next time I went back!  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> A very good product to use for dry mouth disease..Used it for almost 3 years and find it to be the best.</li>
    <li> A little two expensive and don&#x27;t really know if it made my mouth moister. Not flavorful enough. Just going to buy regular toothpaste from now on</li>
    <li> the best for a person who has dry mouth. takes care of the problem right way. thank you for the best.</li>
    <li> I find this toothpaste to be very affective for dry mouth. In fact I don&#x27;t have to use near the other Biotene dry mouth products near as much as long as I use the dry mouth toothpaste regularly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using biotene gel PBF toothpaste and PBF mouthwash for at least two years with excellent results in removing plaque. Surely, it has eliminated trips to a dentist for a cleaning. I highly recommend both of these products. Prior to using biotene, I used the alcohol laden big \\&quot;L\\&quot; which did NOTHING to remove plaque. I&#x27;ve experimented with other brands of mouthwash and practically every other brand of toothpaste. biotene beat them all in removing plaque. Incidentally, I always use natural bristles (medium and soft) toothbrushes. It is my belief that nylon bristles create static electricity while brushing, in effect electrocuting the nerves within the tooth structure, causing what is called, \\&quot;sensitive teeth\\&quot;. Your comments are welcomed. E-mail me at:  madeinusa@rcn.com. Use subject, \\&quot;Teeth\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> After many decays, the dentist suggested biotene to help my husband with his &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34;!!  We haven&#x27;t been back since my purchase, so we&#x27;ll see!!  :)</li>
    <li> I take meds that dry my mouth out which can lead to all sorts of miserable, expensive dental appts.  This does help some but I can&#x27;t tell just how much.  Either way it tastes great and is a good toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty severe case of some nasty old thing called \\&quot;Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome\\&quot;, which rarely show itself in men, but  I have a number of things going on in me that isn&#x27;t what most folks call common. One of the fun things with Sjogren&#x27;s is having dryness of the mouth that goes beyond the &#x27;unpleasant stage&#x27;, at times making it difficult for even my wife to understand what I&#x27;m saying, or trying to say. Other than being a complete nuisance, the lack of saliva can and does cause serious problems with my teeth. No saliva means that teeth are not getting the protective coating they need to protect against decay, pain in the gums, and having to give up spicy/hot foods which I love. Lack of saliva causes very real problems in eating, period. I have a very difficult time eating even the dark meat of chicken. Almost impossible to eat steak, pork chops, etc. I never know what is going to cause severe burning sensations in my mouth, even Seltzer water sometimes. My dentist has made it clear that I could never wear false teeth due to dryness.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve used Biotene for some time. Although it is somewhat more expensive than other toothpastes, it does help relieve some of the  worst symptoms. Using it as much as 3 or 4 times a day helps quite a bit. I&#x27;ve tried brushing with normal toothpaste a time or two, and it burns as much as if I&#x27;d been drinking acid. Thankfully, that is not the case with Biotene. Biotene has none of whatever goes into regular tooth paste that causes it to be foamy, so don&#x27;t think you aren&#x27;t cleaning your teeth because it isn&#x27;t foamy. It helps to keep your lips closed as much as possible, or the Biotene will run right out.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve only given 4 stars on this, because I&#x27;m basing it on my own experience which may be a little harsher than some folks. I imagine that for many people, 5 stars would certainly be in order. For me, Biotene comes a lot closer than anything I&#x27;ve used in 71 years.</li>
    <li> I have been looking EVERYWHERE for Mint Gel-flavored Biotene. I have used Biotene for many years.  Lately I have not been able to find the Mint-Gel flavor, which is my favorite.  It is the least sting-producing toothpaste I have ever used. Other toothpastes leave my mouth feeling dry and cottony.  Biotene does not.  I have this product on subscribe-and-save.</li>
    <li> This product will help somewhat with dry mouth issues, I would not expect dramatic results. It has a pleasant taste and leaves less of an aftertaste than other toothpastes. It won&#x27;t help dramatically however it also won&#x27;t burn or dry out your mouth like a Colgate/Crest would.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Biotene Gel Toothpaste for dry mouth I get from medications I take for asthma. It helps alot, especially overnight. Works best when used with other Biotene products like the Oral Balance Gel and the mouthwash. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff if you get dry mouth , not to be confused with cotton mouth which in my younger days, was a temporary condition. Or a type of snake here in Tennessee. This really helps at night before bed. I use regular (Colgate) in the morning. But Biotene has a rinse that is really good as well.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product. If you are looking for a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals yet has a clean, refreshing flavor, give this a try.</li>
    <li> My mouth has become very painful whenever I eat hot or spicy foods.  My favorite mouth washes and toothpaste have become kerosene in my mouth.  I can use this toothpaste without any pain.  It may clean my mouth good but it does not feel as clean as with the Colgate I have been using.</li>
    <li> I will purchase again if this remains at this price point.It does what it is supposed to. I have a dry mouth because of anti-cholinergic type meds that I take daily, so I really need a product such as this, but I don&#x27;t care at all for the taste</li>
