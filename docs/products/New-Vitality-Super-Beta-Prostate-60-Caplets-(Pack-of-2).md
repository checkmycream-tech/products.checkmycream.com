    <li> My husband loves because it works!</li>
    <li> They seem to be working.</li>
    <li> Great product I have nerve damage from a bad back and this helps quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Super beta prostate is not a magic supplement ,but is a very good supplement to keep the prostate healthy . It will not work right away, but takes a few weeks getting used to, I has helped me and I will be using it from now on as I have been on it for a few months. It has all the right stuff in it to help the prostate functioning well,and as I said it does take some time for the pill to work properly.</li>
    <li> This product does not seem to keep me from getting up three to four times a night to urinate as projected that it would. I still take it twice a day as instructed with hopes that it will start to work.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 10 years my last blood work my reading was 1.5 . I only take one tablet a day in the morning.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me, after four bottles in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Helps me with my enlarged prostate</li>
    <li> Simple Fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The testimony from the person that uses this is that they work much better than the Saw Palmetto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the complaints started about slow, stalled urine flow, I bought the Saw Palmetto but user stated they did not think it was effective.  Gave Superbeta a try and the symptoms subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End of story.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much, they are so much as seen on TV,,no games or rhymes they are just as advertised</li>
    <li> If. like me, you are old enough to need this product, then you should know that it is one of the very best on the market! You pay more for it because you get much more relief!</li>
    <li> Very good a lot of energy come with it</li>
    <li> My husband had a reading of 5 after his prostrate test. He has been taking these pills less than a year and his number is down to 3. We credit these pills for that.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my father in law who was constantly goin to the bathroom&lt;br /&gt;He had radiation treatment years ago to his prostate&lt;br /&gt;He says he can more easily empty his bladder noe..</li>
    <li> tryed something differnet once. right back to beta.</li>
    <li> New Vitality.  What a scam!  This company prays on the elderly and those that do not ask their doctor before falling for supplements like this.  My father is 90 years old and sees their commercial on television.  GET A MONTH FOR FREE AND PAY ONLY $6.99 SHIPPING . . . . .  then they begin automatic shipments charging your credit card $46.94 per month!  He already has prostate cancer, just as most men will by the time they reach their 80&#x27;s.  They die WITH it . . . .  NOT from it.&lt;br /&gt;Talk to your doctor before ordering supplements you see on TV.  Have you not seen the news reports advising that many of these list a multitude of ingredients that ultimately are nothing more than fillers.  I would suggest that you do your due diligence and research these products.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband. He is not a pill taker so he suffers unnecessarily.  Once he resumes he says nothing works better to relieve the pain and discomfort.</li>
    <li> This product works much better than many others that I have tried.  Buy from Amazon, because when you buy direct from the manufacturer, they will hound you to death with phone calls and they automatically keep sending them and charge your credit card.</li>
    <li> Not as effective as advertised.</li>
    <li> May have worked a little BUT not as good as the advertising claims. In fact they may actually be a one star. Also kind of pricey and when I didn&#x27;t want to subscribe (before I started buying them here) they offered to cut the price quite a bit. I bought them based on a TV ad. Boy, I should have known better.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work somewhat but not as promoted.</li>
    <li> Results are not spectacular but it does seems to have had some positive impact.</li>
    <li> Very good for my prostate</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great transaction.</li>
    <li> Have noticed less getting up at night and less urgency to void.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking a little while but I think it&#x27;s coming along</li>
    <li> I have been using Super Beta Prostrate for over 10 years and, although I switched to other products on occassion, I have never found a better product at an equivalent price.</li>
    <li> It was shipped on time and as featured. Thank you</li>
    <li> Worked very well for me very happy with this product.</li>
