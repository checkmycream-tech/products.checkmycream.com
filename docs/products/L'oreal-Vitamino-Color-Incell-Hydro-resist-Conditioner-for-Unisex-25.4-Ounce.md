<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this conditioner!!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of fine curly hair that is colored.  This is the only conditioner I have found that I can brush my hair after using. Great product.</li>
    <li> Wish it would come with the pump included.</li>
    <li> I have been a Loreal Professional Hair Care user for quite a few years and I absolutely love it! Only this shampoo does not make my scalp itch and gives my hair great look at the same time. I cannot live without these products. Definitely recommend it but again hair care products are very individual. It took me a long time until I found something that worked for both my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> seems to work - hair is healthier and breaks less, feels less dry after bath/drying/styling.</li>
    <li> Use it after regular conditioner. It acts like a smoother. Makes my hair soft, no frizzies; I have thick blonde hair that is mildly coor treated in good condition that poofs in humidity.</li>
    <li> It was great receiving this product quickly and at a good price.  But beware, it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump!!!!  (The shampoo I ordered from a different vendor came with one).</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I get compliments on my hair daily and know its bc of this shampoo/conditioner line!  The salon I go to sells it for 45$ so the price had me sold already! The shipping time it arrived made me sold on coming back for more!! I was afraid I would have to use my travel size because I was out but didn&#x27;t !! The only reason for a 4 star was because of no pump included! I should have figured that but already threw my old one out! GREAT DEAL</li>
    <li> I love this product &amp; it is so much less expensive buying in quantity on line than in the salon.  I can&#x27;t even get this size at salon.</li>
    <li> i love this conditioner, it works great on my damaged colored hair. and it is very profitable to order in such a large size.</li>
    <li> Pricey, but worth it. Great conditioning product.</li>
    <li> I have fine blonde hair which is color treated.  I love the smell of this conditioner but it is very lightweight.  I have been using a more moisturizing shampoo to counteract the dryness of the conditioner which seems to work.</li>
    <li> I alternate between this brand and Living Proof for my color treated hair. I&#x27;ve found that this line is super concentrated. They leave my hair glossy and hydrated without feeling heavy or oily. My stylist recommended and uses this product. I really love it!</li>
    <li> Beware of this product...its fake! I had bought this product before at a hair salon..and&lt;br /&gt;Paid lots of money for a small bottle..when i saw this jumbo size,for only $35 ish..i was very happy..BUt&lt;br /&gt;When i received i compared both product,,,and this is fake...dont b buy!! And there was NO receipt on my delievery...&lt;br /&gt;So...FAKE ..not the same as original!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product for anyone who has normal or dry hair. It works well on my dry hair, making it shining but not flat. Love the smell also!</li>
    <li> the product is fine, but it arrived with a broken pump, so it&#x27;s not convenient to use.</li>
    <li> Great to find this online at a good price.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;ve been using this product for over 15 years now, started back in Europe. My hair is long blonde, highlighted, impossible to comb after washing due to tangling. I have tried many products, even professional, salon stuff regardless of the price. Nothing even compares. This conditioner makes my hair easy to comb, leaving it luxuriously soft, shiny and weightless. The vitamins that it contains make my hair look incredibly healthy, even though it&#x27;s been chemically treated for a long time. I would definitely recommend this product, it is worth the price, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for several years.  Really great for color treated hair - keeps it smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> This is very good conditioner.  I have tried every type of Paul Mitchell conditioner and this beats them all.  I use it every day to keep my hair soft.  It is much cheaper through Amazon than the Beauty Salon.</li>
    <li> No issues. Use these products regularly!</li>
    <li> The only thing stopping five stars is the fact that no pump comes with it.  Smells wonderful, provides great protection for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give this a bad rating necessarily, it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations according to other reviews. It&#x27;s an above average product but I would try the complete keratase line if you want something more wowing. It didn&#x27;t seem to saturate very well into my hair. I have course long dark hair. I&#x27;m always looking for a product to make it shiny and soft and I want to fall in love with a product. Unfortunately, I just haven&#x27;t found that. Maybe it&#x27;s a case of never being satisfied and looking for the next best thing. Sigh.</li>
    <li> Really gets the tangles out! Leaves here shinning and smooth. great product at a good price! I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Excellent for color treated hair. Leaves it soft and light with no frizz</li>
    <li> Will not fade your color. Great for hair</li>
    <li> My hair feels silky and clean and it smells pretty good...I´ll definitely keep using the shampoo, conditioner and masquera. My daughter also looooves them.</li>
    <li> I have used Pureology for 12 years and switched to this about 6 months ago per my hair dresser.  I really like this product.  It helps maintain my color and also keeps my hair super shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to use in conjunction with L&#x27;oreal Vitamino Shampoo.  I noticed that it seems to help maintain hair color longer between salon visits.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!  Came sooner than expected.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a year. It protect my hair color and helps it last longer with out fade out. Additionally, this is a great conditioner for fine hair as it does not weigh hair down.</li>
    <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve been using for more than 5 years these loreal professional products. You see the change in your hair.</li>
    <li> I especially enjoyed the prompt delivery  this amazon card has really awed me  this card is worth the increase  kudos  !!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good seller. I received the product on time and without problems. I recommend for all.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a very long time. It keeps my hair in great condition and only have to use a little.</li>

    <li> The same thing for the shampoo, I like it, but I couldn&#x27;t see the difference on a regular shampoo. It is expensive.</li>
    <li> Always loved the smell and the great condition it leaves my hair without weighing it down.  Add the shampoo &amp; you will love love love your hair!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair so soft and rinses out easily!  Makes my hair stronger as well, it must have protein in it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product and it left my curly, color treated hair very soft, but not coated and limp.  This is a great price, it is much more expensive in the store.  11/15 Update:  This one is the real deal.  I tried the less expensive one with the XO L&#x27;Oreal label and it was thin and much to light to do the job.  I went back to this product and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> LOVE this conditioner!</li>
