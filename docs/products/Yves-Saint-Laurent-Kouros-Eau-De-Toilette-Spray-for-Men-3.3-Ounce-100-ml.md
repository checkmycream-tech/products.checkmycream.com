    <li> Hi, I am Wanda&#x27;s husband.  This cologne is hard to find in department stores, and is one I extremey like.  This cologne has been around a long time, but I constantly get complements whenever I wear it.  It&#x27;s a huge hit with the ladies!!!  I would recommend this cologne to any one young or old, expecially those who are trying to attract their lady friends.  And not trying to affend anyone, for those who swing the different way, I feel certain they would get the same response.  Good day!</li>
    <li> Use by husband.  His no. 1 pick.  He prefers this over any fragrance he has used.  Will choose again.  Great choice</li>

    <li> This Kouros spray is not the same product we&#x27;ve bought for the last 20 years.  The fragrance has changed and it&#x27;s not what the normal Kouros fragrance is.  We&#x27;re very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Excellent products and delivery time.  I will definitely order again.  Do you carry Jean Nate?</li>

    <li> Kouros is women killer.. this is all I can say!</li>
    <li> My husband loved it !</li>
    <li> Received a 3.3oz instead of 3.4</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time was as described.</li>
    <li> Men.....you can&#x27;t go wrong with this fragrance.  Every time my husband wears it, women ask what he&#x27;s wearing.  Too bad it&#x27;s being discontinued....or at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard.  YSL needs to reconsider if this is true.</li>
    <li> Excellent product i have loved this scent for years - sad to know it will no longer be made.</li>
