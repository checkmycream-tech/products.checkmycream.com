      <li>and it&#x27;s fabulous-</li>
      <li>Smells great, leaves no white flaky residue.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m even more baffled that it has such good ratings.</li>
      <li>Clean hair, maybe.  </li>
      <li>I had seen this product on Amazon during my search for a great dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>This stuff literally did nothing to clean or add volume my hair and made it smell like citronella candles.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give much volume but does do a good job of absorbing oil and smells</li>
      <li>the smell is very strong and not as nice as Dove or the Garnier Fructis dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>the price is right and the smell beats this one every day!</li>
      <li>It added fullness to my style and also helped keep it looking good for the next day.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I am really desapointed with this shampoo, I read the reviews</li>
      <li>If I paid full price, I would have returned it.</li>
      <li>You are really taking a gamble with this product and even more so with this seller.</li>
      <li>I was really happy with the way this product worked in the beginning in terms of not leaving the white residue that most dry shampoos do - the product went on clear and smelled pleasant.</li>
      <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say good, a little powdery but not horrible.</li>
      <li>I have been using Oscar Blandi for over two years and love the convenience of the spray, the smell is fresh and the overall result is something that works really well on those \\&quot; my day didn&#x27;t go as planned\\&quot; days!!!!</li>
      <li>I have a lot of light dyed blonde hair and it&#x27;s great for my darker blonde roots.</li>
      <li>Want hair that has lift and volume and fresh like just washed?  </li>
      <li>Totally worth the cost</li>
      <li>This product smells good and really does make hair feel and look better after a few sprays.  </li>
      <li>Not a stench, but distinctly chemical.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years ;i love it very much always have ;no white stuff in the hair &#x27;smells really nivce</li>
      <li>Works as advertised for those emergencies when you can&#x27;t wash your hair right away.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to fragrance and this did not have a strong odor.</li>
      <li>it volumizes to such an extent I find myself having to settle my hair down, the volumizing feature has been so successful!!</li>
      <li>Fortunately I still absolutely love the Pronto Dry Shampoo</li>
      <li>The smell was so powerful &amp; strong (like lots and lots of chemicals) that I has to remove my two year old from my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clear, absorbs just the right amount of oil, and smells totally fine.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, it does go on clear &amp; easy.</li>
      <li>In an effort to find the right dry shampoo for my fine oily hair - I tried the original Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo and was very pleased.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;To be sure, I used this product until the very last spray.</li>
      <li>one bottle will usually last me three or more months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found others of a similar price point that are nicer, but I&#x27;ve also found cheaper ones that work better.</li>
      <li>I have used several times and have always been pleased with the look , feel, and the texture of my hair when I do.</li>
      <li>I shake the can first, then bend over flipping my hair and spray just my roots</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Suave, Got 2 B, Batiste, and my favorite is actually the powder (non-aerosol) form of&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love dry shampoo as a rule, but I&#x27;d never tried this brand even though everyone seems to recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo.</li>
      <li>Not my favorite dry shampoo product.</li>
      <li>&amp; it certainly didn&#x27;t absorb any oil from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>maybe it&#x27;s for a certain type of hair.</li>
      <li>The $5 Tresemme Dry Shampoo is much cheaper and much better.  </li>
      <li>I love this dry shampoo!  </li>
      <li>The same brand but the lemony scented powder in the white bottle works amazingly better,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t over spray, just a light dusting to freshen, get rid of the sheen and bring some life back to the roots.</li>
      <li>and it really messed up the styling of my hair for the day.</li>
      <li>This does absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
      <li>I expected so much more from this product</li>
      <li>Well this stuff does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Got this product with free reward points at a local beauty shop and brought it on vacation this week.</li>
      <li>and so I blew through the bottle really fast and didn&#x27;t find it even looked cleaner</li>
      <li>Tried this because I liked that it left no white powder residue, but it did nothing.</li>
      <li>This does not work nearly as well, is more sticky and does not absorb oil the same way.  </li>
      <li>As someone who HATES flat hair I got a free sample of this somewhere....</li>
      <li>I bought it because the original can sometimes leave a white residue, but this sometimes looks as though I sprayed a bunch of hairspray in my hair and didn&#x27;t brush it out.</li>
      <li>Great if you wake up late and need to run, or just need some extra boost as well.  </li>
      <li>However....I will say that the original Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo (spray bottle, white w/ yellow) is FABULOUS!  </li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>may hair soft and very lovey</li>
      <li>The oil never absorb in my hair the one time I tried it - even applied 3 different times in an attempt to absorbed the oil in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Most dry shampoos leave a layer of white dust in your hair that you can&#x27;t brush out.  </li>
      <li>I bought this dry shampoo  after I read a few good reviews for it.</li>
      <li>I definitely give that one 5 stars and yes, it&#x27;s much better than the Tresemme Dry Shampoo!  </li>
      <li>From the very first time I tried this dry shampoo, it literally did nothing.</li>
      <li>My 3 star review is based on getting it much cheaper at a discount store, you all know the one I mean - it has XX in the name:)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After using this a few times, I&#x27;ve resorted back to baby powder.  This does absolutely nothing for my hair.  I switched from the cheap Tres Emme version to this, and it may not leave white residue as it claims, but it also doesn&#x27;t make my hair look less greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo. It&#x27;s clear, absorbs just the right amount of oil, and smells totally fine.  I use it after 2-3 days to extend my wash an extra day. I have a lot of light dyed blonde hair and it&#x27;s great for my darker blonde roots.</li>
    <li> I love the smell , will work in a pinch. Doesn&#x27;t give much volume but does do a good job of absorbing oil and smells</li>
    <li> I have to have Oscar Blandi dry shampoo, always.  My long hair gets icky throughout the day, and dry shampoo is a quick fix if you need to go out again and need a little bit of freshening. This product smells good and really does make hair feel and look better after a few sprays.  Just make sure to brush your hair a few minutes after!</li>
    <li> Not heavy or flaky, gives weightless volume and makes my long, super-fine bounce back to life on no-wash days.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, just because it&#x27;s one of the more expensive brands doesn&#x27;t guarantee that it&#x27;s better. I got this as part of my dry shampoo mission, allowing me to skip a day or two between washes. I&#x27;d hoped this would effectively give me another day, and because it claims to go on invisible, wouldn&#x27;t leave that tell tell horrible white powdery mess other brands do. Thankfully, it does go on clear &amp; easy. Now the bad news - it doesn&#x27;t work. If anything it makes my hair feel greasier than before I put it in and the smell faintly reminds me of lemon wood polish. It&#x27;s too bad too. I so wanted it to work. I&#x27;ve found others of a similar price point that are nicer, but I&#x27;ve also found cheaper ones that work better.</li>
    <li> In an effort to find the right dry shampoo for my fine oily hair - I tried the original Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo and was very pleased.  When I saw \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; in his line, I thought - what a great combination.  I was disappointed.  The oil never absorb in my hair the one time I tried it - even applied 3 different times in an attempt to absorbed the oil in my hair.  The volumizing has a 1 star vote, as it&#x27;s not a great or even remotely \\&quot;good\\&quot; dry shampoo...The $5 Tresemme Dry Shampoo is much cheaper and much better.  However....I will say that the original Oscar Blandi Dry Shampoo (spray bottle, white w/ yellow) is FABULOUS!  I definitely give that one 5 stars and yes, it&#x27;s much better than the Tresemme Dry Shampoo!  For my short A-line bob hair type (color treated, highlights, oily, fine but with lots of hair), I would not recommend the Volumizing Dry Shampoo by Oscar Blandi.  Go for the original and you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> I tried this because of a recommendation in a women&#x27;s magazine, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  It didn&#x27;t do anything more than the much less expensive \\&quot;Pssssst\\&quot; brand.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am really desapointed with this shampoo, I read the reviews and I thought it may works, so I bought it but it makes the same work that the one from cvs $8.00 does. It doesn&#x27;t volumize as good as I thought, the hair doesn&#x27;t look shinny... I don&#x27;t know, or maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for my fine hair. If there was any oil absorption, it only lasted a few minutes. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I ordered  this product for the first time and am very happy with it&#x27;s performance. I am very sensitive to fragrance and this did not have a strong odor.</li>
    <li> I received a trial version of Oscar Blandi Pronto Invisible Volumizing Dry Shampoo Spray. I was pretty excited to use it, I&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo before but it was such a disappointment. I already have such thick hair and just had the bio-ionic hair straighter done a few months ago and it really messed up the styling of my hair for the day. It smells weird, I wouldn&#x27;t say good, a little powdery but not horrible. I also have dandruff during the dry weather and the spray made it a lot worse. So instead I had to skip dinner and wash it out. Now I don&#x27;t know what to do with the rest of my trial size except throw it away. This product might be good for people with fine hair but it did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Tried this because I liked that it left no white powder residue, but it did nothing. My recommendation is for BATISTE. Batiste works wonderfully but you have to work to get the white out. At least my hair isn&#x27;t oily afterwards though, like with the Oscar Blandi dry shampoo. Don&#x27;t waste your money and find a different product.</li>
    <li> I love dry shampoo as a rule, but I&#x27;d never tried this brand even though everyone seems to recommend it.  Previously I&#x27;ve tried a couple of drug store brands (suave and something else) and those were no better than hairspray.  I loved the Bamboo Alterna travel-size I got at Sephora, but it is very expensive as a full-size so I got this.  It makes your hair feel clean, volumizes a little bit (not as much as the Alterna) and it even makes it look shiny, which is not something the Alterna did.  Big fan of this stuff.  Totally worth the cost, glad I didn&#x27;t cheap out.</li>
    <li> I bought this dry shampoo  after I read a few good reviews for it. This dry shampoo is obviously supposed to get rid of the oily in hair and the manufacturer claims that it&#x27;s supposed to make the hair very voluminous. From the very first time I tried this dry shampoo, it literally did nothing. I sprayed it like it was directed and all.  It did not get rid of the oil, it did not make the hair any voluminous then it was before I sprayed it.  All this horrible dry shampoo did was make my hair feel like hay.  I tried contacting the company and there was no response whatsoever. Do not waste your money on this chemical that has no effect at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this stuff-  it doesn&#x27;t get rid of dirt or oil in the hair.  I purchased it for a trip and was very disappointed- my hair felt like it needed washing even more after I used it.</li>
    <li> This stuff literally did nothing to clean or add volume my hair and made it smell like citronella candles. I am really kind of baffled as to why it exists and I&#x27;m even more baffled that it has such good ratings. Am I missing something?</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years ;i love it very much always have ;no white stuff in the hair &#x27;smells really nivce&lt;br /&gt;makes may hair soft and very lovey ;i love this product and continue to use it ;until they dicontinue it like everything else i have used ;well i have 3 containers it will last until the end of summer ;but u do like this very much ;i don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday never have ;it is bad for your hair of you wash your hair evey day  you strip out the oil and your hair will look thinner and just not the same ;now you can rince it ;but not wash it shampoo is to hard on the hair ;so i like this Oscar Blandi i use it when i feel like it just needs something .Love it .</li>
    <li> My hair always needs a wash, so I was hoping that this dry shampoo would help decrease my maintenance efforts. Alas, to no avail. My hair still felt greasy and dirty, and on top of that there&#x27;s a strong smell. Not a stench, but distinctly chemical. Finally, I have black hair, and this left awkward white dandruff-like residue. Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised for those emergencies when you can&#x27;t wash your hair right away. Not sticky or powdery. Gets rid of the extra oils.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Wish it was a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> I used to get this from Sephora for around $30. NOT ANYMORE!!!. Amazon.com strikes again!! Want hair that goes BOOM? Want hair that smells like MMMMFRESH! Want hair that has lift and volume and fresh like just washed?  Look no further. I wear braids, I also go natural. This dry shampoo leaves me bouncy and fresh. Love love love it and Amazon has it wayyyy cheaper than the boutique stores.</li>
    <li> I had seen this product on Amazon during my search for a great dry shampoo. Unfortunately, this product here was way out of my budget. A few weeks later I saw it on sale at TJMaxx for half the price. Score! No. It was like I was spraying air into my hair. Really bad smelling air. The smell was so powerful &amp; strong (like lots and lots of chemicals) that I has to remove my two year old from my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This left no residue &amp; I have very dark, shoulder length, fine hair. It gave me no volume whatsoever &amp; it certainly didn&#x27;t absorb any oil from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be sure, I used this product until the very last spray. I am so disappointed! Even on sale at $11 I feel like I just got duped big time! Don&#x27;t waste your money. What a horrible product and what a shame to charge an arm and a leg for DRY SHAMPOO! Geez!</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo!  I have black hair, it doesn&#x27;t show any white powder.  My hair is soft and looks normal, not a dried out and heavily hair sprayed look</li>
    <li> This stuff works awesome. NO white residue. I have no complaints about this except the smell is very strong and not as nice as Dove or the Garnier Fructis dry shampoo. The price is hefty too. I will stick with Garnier..it&#x27;s my fave...the price is right and the smell beats this one every day!</li>
    <li> Got this product with free reward points at a local beauty shop and brought it on vacation this week. Used the product today and saw absolutely no beneficial effects and actually the product just left a white dandruff appearing residue. Would suggest to stick with Batiste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oscar Blandi Pronto Dry Shampoo (powder) for years but I wanted to give the spray a try because a spray dry shampoo that works might be less work for me. Especially if it&#x27;s brown and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it blending in with my dark hair.  Well this stuff does absolutely nothing.  I&#x27;ve shaken the bottle. I&#x27;ve sprayed close to my roots, I&#x27;ve sprayed farther. Nothing.  I&#x27;ve pulled back different sections of my hair around my scalp and sprayed. Nothing. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m not using any dry shampoo at all. I don&#x27;t understand how this works for anyone else honestly.  Fortunately I still absolutely love the Pronto Dry Shampoo and I don&#x27;t think I want to continue wasting money on dry shampoo sprays only to find out they don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Used it one time and the spray nozzle disconnected. $25 down the drain and so upset. No contact information either. You are really taking a gamble with this product and even more so with this seller. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I expected so much more from this product but i put it in my hair after like 3 or 4 days of having it straight and it made my hair look less greasy but my hair felt thicker and weighed down and dull....</li>
    <li> Great dry shampoo. It gives my limp hair some volume, it works well enough to allow my oily hair-mess to go without a wash for a day (note that without this product my hair turns into a grease ball in 3 hours). I have not had problems with there not being enough in the bottle-- one bottle will usually last me three or more months. My only complaint is that if I use this product too often it will leave a residue on my hair-- which is not good for it and makes my hair less manageable. So use in moderation, only on those days when you don&#x27;t have enough time for a shower.</li>
    <li> I like to use dry shampoo because I do not wash my hair everyday because I dye it.  This product comes in handy</li>
    <li> I am always on the go and need to have a good hairdo. This product does the trick, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have not gotten this product to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried it with semi dirty hair (one day since wash, needs a little refresh) &#x3D;  no improvement. I&#x27;ve tried it with dirty hair (visibly greasy bangs and scalp) &#x3D; no improvement. I&#x27;ve tried applying it 6-8\\&quot; from scalp, as indicated &#x3D; didn&#x27;t improve my hair. I&#x27;ve tried spraying it closer - no better. I&#x27;ve sprayed a LOT of it on.. I&#x27;ve tried using a little..... I&#x27;m just about done with this can and I don&#x27;t know why I keep trying. maybe it&#x27;s for a certain type of hair. I have lots of FINE hair - it&#x27;s long and tends to get greasy in the bangs and the scalp after a day or so without washing. This product does not work for me - AT ALL.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the original. I bought it because the original can sometimes leave a white residue, but this sometimes looks as though I sprayed a bunch of hairspray in my hair and didn&#x27;t brush it out. Not my favorite dry shampoo product.</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t leave reviews, but I was so upset with this product I felt compelled to. I was really happy with the way this product worked in the beginning in terms of not leaving the white residue that most dry shampoos do - the product went on clear and smelled pleasant. That said, I only used it a handful of times before it stopped working completely. The bottle feels at least 75% full, but the can appears to have run out of aerosol. I tried running the nozzle under warm water as directed on the can but this didn&#x27;t help at all. It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to have paid for a product for which 3/4s goes unused.</li>
    <li> As someone who HATES flat hair I got a free sample of this somewhere.... Wow!! not only is it invisible... it volumizes to such an extent I find myself having to settle my hair down, the volumizing feature has been so successful!! Never thought I&#x27;d see the day.  Great if you wake up late and need to run, or just need some extra boost as well.  Volumizing lasts (with hair spray), and doesn&#x27;t go flar in an hour or two.  Only downside is that it seems to be difficult to find.... makes me wonder if this is being discontinued. (just my own wandering thoughts...).</li>
    <li> This stuff smells really great and rescues me when I put too much product in my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky, and it actually adds volume!</li>
    <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used Suave, Got 2 B, Batiste, and my favorite is actually the powder (non-aerosol) form of&lt;br /&gt;Oscar Blandi Pronto in the white and yellow bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one (brown aerosol can) did not take away the greasy oils on the hair!&lt;br /&gt;You have to spray and spray to see any result and so I blew through the bottle really fast and didn&#x27;t find it even looked cleaner after.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this again. The same brand but the lemony scented powder in the white bottle works amazingly better,&lt;br /&gt;and even on darker hair just shake and blend and brush it through and you won&#x27;t see it. Buy that not this.</li>
    <li> If your hair is not that dirty but just starting to separate or lack volume, this will fix that! It will work I suppose if you are between shampoos because it does have the comb out feature. What I really like is that there is no icky powdery residue left behind and my hair is still shiny afterwards. Some of the other get all over clothes, dull the heck out of your hair, and then look grayish even after combing through. NOT this one!</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo sounded so promising: invisible, volumizing... what more could a girl ask for?  Well.  Clean hair, maybe.  This did absolutely nothing to make my hair look less greasy.  I&#x27;ve tried it on \\&quot;not really dirty but could use a little refreshing\\&quot; days and \\&quot;wow, my hair is gross\\&quot; days.  Didn&#x27;t work for either situation.  I keep trying this product, hoping that it will work but to no avail... I&#x27;ve even sprayed close to half the can on my hair in one sitting once out of frustration and determination to get this product to work.  Ugh!  I&#x27;ve used the [[ASIN:B0039VMLWW Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Dry Shampoo for Unisex, 2.65 Ounce]] in the past with a lot of success but wanted a spray instead of a powder this time... I think I&#x27;ll go back to my Alterna!</li>
    <li> My 3 star review is based on getting it much cheaper at a discount store, you all know the one I mean - it has XX in the name:) If I paid full price, I would have returned it. I only used it on my bangs, and it  definitely improved the look, but it really smells unpleasant. I will use it as needed, but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This product worked great in my hair.  It added fullness to my style and also helped keep it looking good for the next day.  Did not add stickiness to my hair, but helped hair stay in place.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I love this product -  I have used several times and have always been pleased with the look , feel, and the texture of my hair when I do.</li>
    <li> Gets the oil out without the white stuff. You do have to blow dry what you spray, but it only makes hair shinier and softer.</li>
    <li> Best dry shampoo on the market! Give Oscar Blandi a try and you will see how it blows away any other dry shampoo. I tried several and none compare to this product!</li>
    <li> This did not have a nice smell that you would expect from 1. Oscar Blandi 2.  this price and 3. a dry shampoo.  I buy their powder one and it has a wonderful lemon scent that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Most dry shampoos leave a layer of white dust in your hair that you can&#x27;t brush out.  This product doesn&#x27;t do that which is great.  However, it doesn&#x27;t function as well as a dry shampoo that leaves your hair dusty.  I didn&#x27;t get any volumizing at all.  The worst part is the smell.  It is VERY strong and bordering on offensive.  I&#x27;ll go back to the white dust products that work and just use them at night, before bed, giving them a chance to work their way in and be absorbed.</li>
    <li> Smells great, leaves no white flaky residue. Perfect for skipping a shampoo.</li>
    <li> In the past, I have been a HUGE fan of this product.  It used to come in a yellow can and I assumed they just changed packaging.  Not true!!  They have changed the formula.  This does not work nearly as well, is more sticky and does not absorb oil the same way.  I will need to look for another project.  If you can find this in the yellow can, stock up!  Otherwise, stay away.</li>
    <li> I like how the spray doesn&#x27;t have a color, so it matches anything i do to my hair without it messing up highlights etc</li>
    <li> I have been using Oscar Blandi for over two years and love the convenience of the spray, the smell is fresh and the overall result is something that works really well on those \\&quot; my day didn&#x27;t go as planned\\&quot; days!!!! I shake the can first, then bend over flipping my hair and spray just my roots, I let it dry and then brush out and it&#x27;s fabulous- I don&#x27;t drench my hair, I don&#x27;t over spray, just a light dusting to freshen, get rid of the sheen and bring some life back to the roots. I happened upon this product two years ago on a business trip and it has been a lifesaver for me ever since.</li>
    <li> Smells terrible&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair dry like hay</li>
    <li> This stuff makes it possible for me to go longer between washings.  It helps get rid of oil but also truly helps restore some volume as well.  Now a regular member of my beauty arsenal.</li>
    <li> It did not seem to remove some of the oil out of my hair.  However, it does not leave any white powder in your hair, which is a plus.</li>
    <li> Je I love that stuff, even on fresh hair!!!!</li>
