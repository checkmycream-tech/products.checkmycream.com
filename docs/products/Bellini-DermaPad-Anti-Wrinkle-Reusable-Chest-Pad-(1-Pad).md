      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>Love it !</li>
      <li>This product is truly amazing</li>
      <li>After receiving the product and taking a look at it, I realized there was no way this oversized jelly sticker was going to help with stretch marks, so I requested a return and was informed that I could not return \\&quot;hazardous</li>
      <li>This product really works great!  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried this chest pad, I almost cried from the amazing results!!</li>
      <li>It is very effective and comfortable.  </li>
      <li>The adhesive is very strong on the pad.</li>
      <li>but i was pleasantly surprised it works perfect.</li>
      <li>/&gt;What pissed me off the most is that its a defective product but their BS return policy claims its a hazardous material once used and cannot be returned.</li>
      <li>I washed mine for the first time today and it cleaned up great and the sticky is still there.  </li>
      <li>Plus you can use lotion to make it stick better.</li>
      <li>and I am not as satisfied with its quality as I was with Decollette Pad (read my review about the product)</li>
      <li>It may save you from wrinkles on your chest if you will be able to have it on for more then 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and when it remains in place it appears to be effective, but what&#x27;s the point if it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this product more for side sleepers who would like to alleviate the associated chest wrinkles.</li>
      <li>They worked better than I thought they would.</li>
      <li>Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>

      <li>and so glad it is reusable and washable.  </li>
      <li>I love it and will continue to use it every night.</li>
      <li>I washed it per the directions and it is still sticking for the most part</li>
      <li>The skin must be very clean for it to stick at all.</li>
      <li>Seems to work pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I loved the first one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very good, but it doesn&#x27;t last more the 10 applications, it starts to peel off the silicone on the edges.</li>
      <li>Like most reviewers pointed out you have to make sure your chest is clean before wearing or it will not stick.</li>
      <li>You have to be sure your skin is clean to ensure adhesion.  </li>
      <li>liked it so much that I purchased more to pass out to my friends to try.  </li>
      <li>The trick is to make sure that your Decolletage area is clean.....</li>
      <li>It works fine, not quite as well as Decollette Pads by Calvet Cosmetics but it will do.</li>
      <li>These do work to smooth out those chest wrinkles, but I cannot wear them because....</li>
      <li>I use it every night since its so comfortable.</li>

      <li>the next morning my chest area looks great.  </li>
      <li>It is comfortable to sleep with and</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I works super</li>
      <li>Made a huge difference the first night I wore it .</li>
      <li>The very first time I used this product I saw results.</li>
      <li>Decollete works great at night with impressive results, but lost adherence first time I washed :(</li>
      <li>Wish it was bigger but love it!</li>
      <li>Even the first morning there was significant change.</li>
      <li>I recently tried DermaPad and the results are amazing.  </li>
      <li>I also liked that the protective pad you use to store the pad is larger and does not curl up.</li>
      <li>Well worth every cent.</li>
      <li>I wake up in the morning with several lives on my chest not too attractive with low cut tops.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for selling such an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda Collier</li>
      <li>Once a week I wash it with warm water and let it air dry.</li>
      <li>after first use is garbage.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this</li>
      <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>This really works!  </li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a thick layer of the sticky glue that you would find on fly paper.</li>
      <li>Price wise, NONE of these silicon pads are worth the price because they don&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>My chest was clean and clear of any lotions or products.</li>
      <li>The pads are very durable and they truly moisturize.</li>
      <li>It really does lessen the appearance of chest wrinkles and also helps to prevent them.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay put if you try it at night during sleep,  which is really disapointing.</li>
      <li>this really works.</li>
      <li>These really work temporarily.</li>
      <li>It really does work..</li>
      <li>&amp; they&#x27;re very inexpensive to make.</li>
      <li>Worth the money, make sure your skin it clean and a little moist, it will last longer if used like this!!</li>
      <li>I cut it in half width wise to get double the use.</li>
      <li>Second, when I first tried it, it was pretty sticky.</li>
      <li>Clean skin very well and allow to dry.  </li>
      <li>Would highly advised using it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend ti.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>High quality and lasts.</li>
      <li>and it is a little better.  </li>
      <li>This once young busty “girl” is now a middle-aged very pro-bra woman.  </li>
      <li>It is also cheaper than the other one, and offered FREE shipping.</li>
      <li>I tried using a new pad, but the problem persisted.  </li>
      <li>I wear mine every night and in the morning I take it off, put the lining back on it and put it in the bag making sure the seal is completely closed.</li>
      <li>but I have a feeling the strap will get stretched out real fast.</li>
      <li>I have used the Anti-Wrinkle pad for the last 4 nights and it really works!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I works super and so glad it is reusable and washable.  Would highly recommend. Great price for this product too,</li>
    <li> you have to wear it for an hour and well it doesnt really work so great anyway</li>
    <li> You need to wear for at least 2 hours to see results.  It doesn&#x27;t stay put if you try it at night during sleep,  which is really disapointing. Decollete works great at night with impressive results, but lost adherence first time I washed :(</li>
    <li> Works well and sticks where I place it. Treat it properly and you will get lots of use from it.</li>
    <li> The Bellini DermaPad works! I have had chest wrinkles for a few years as I am a side sleeper. After using this product for a few weeks, the old wrinkles are gone. GONE!  I use it every night since its so comfortable. I don&#x27;t even feel it as I sleep. If I forget to put it on at night, I just put it on in the morning for a few minutes and any new lines or wrinkles that formed overnight are gone! This product is truly amazing and I will never stop using it!</li>
    <li> These do help my wrinkles yes</li>
    <li> It really wasn&#x27;t what I expected. First off, I did get it within a few days of ordering, so it came early. Second, when I first tried it, it was pretty sticky. It&#x27;s like a thick layer of the sticky glue that you would find on fly paper. So it&#x27;s pretty nasty, plus it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Third, it caused a rash on my chest. It wasn&#x27;t a horrible, disfiguring rash, but never the less, it caused a bad reaction. Fortunately, you can use the opposite side like I&#x27;ve been doing &amp; it works perfectly fine without causing the nasty little rash. Plus you can use lotion to make it stick better. Price wise, NONE of these silicon pads are worth the price because they don&#x27;t last long AT ALL &amp; they&#x27;re very inexpensive to make. These things need to be coming in a 5 pack for the ridiculous price that they cost. So not worth the price for these things for both companies that sell them.</li>
    <li> This product did not stick.  All night long you have to be sticking it back into place.  Now I want to return it and it&#x27;s a hassle. The company only has a PO Box and is not very friendly. It is not worth 25 dollars.</li>
    <li> It may save you from wrinkles on your chest if you will be able to have it on for more then 10 minutes. As the skin under it is not breathing, it starts to itch like crazy, so I had to take it off. I couldn&#x27;t even imagine sleeping in it all night. IT covers a big area so that your skin feels sweaty underneath it. I was very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This once young busty “girl” is now a middle-aged very pro-bra woman.  Dismayed by my chinkles from life long side sleeping, I bought this chest pad.  This product is a wonder.  Big difference after one night.  I use every night now.  Do they make it for the entire neck?  Its time to repurchase because, alas, the stickiness does wear off.  I washed it per the directions and it is still sticking for the most part but I do not think it will last much longer.  Advice:  The skin must be very clean for it to stick at all.</li>
    <li> OMG, I can&#x27;t believe how naïve I can be buying these pads.  My vanity got away from me and I wasted my time and money on this junk.</li>
    <li> These really work temporarily.</li>
    <li> It really does work.. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a few weeks even if you keep it clean and use it as directed.. Too bad they weren&#x27;t a little more affordable. I will buy another one</li>
    <li> It really works! I am a side sleeper and at 38 my chest was starting to wrinkle.  I use it every night. Like most reviewers pointed out you have to make sure your chest is clean before wearing or it will not stick.</li>
    <li> because they work. There is nothing else that does but you can combine the pads with a cream in the day time or when you are not going to be wearing anything like a V-neck or bathing suit. I suggest Pria Decolletage/Neck Cream during the day, you can get it on HSN. I use both for a beautiful neck and chest area...btw I am 48.</li>
    <li> Does not stay in place it come off not worth spending the money, do not recommend it I will try other brands.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The adhesive is very strong on the pad. I also liked that the protective pad you use to store the pad is larger and does not curl up. Overall, very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> The product information states that this chest and body pad is hypoallergenic but I developed a very red, itchy rash on the chest area where it was placed even thought I used as directed. I had to discontinue after using it twice so I don&#x27;t know if it would have worked. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 and lately when I sleep on my side I wake up in the morning with several lives on my chest not too attractive with low cut tops.  I use this at night and when I awake you can barely notice any lines.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Made a huge difference the first night I wore it . Wish it was bigger but love it!</li>
    <li> did not stay on and were cheaply made</li>
    <li> So far so good. The pads are very durable and they truly moisturize.</li>
    <li> OMG!! These patches are so amazing! I have had deep wrinkles on my chest area for years due to sleeping with bras on and sleeping on my side every night. The first time I tried this chest pad, I almost cried from the amazing results!! Well worth every cent. I never dreamed anything would erase those lines (except surgery). Thanks for selling such an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda Collier</li>
    <li> I sleep with this on but it does come off during the night. I do see temporary results but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this product I saw results. I&#x27;m a side sleeper and wore it all night. I did moisten the area a bit with water before applying. It stayed in place all night, was not at all uncomfortable and in the morning....the wrinkles were simply not there. I cannot recommend this product more for side sleepers who would like to alleviate the associated chest wrinkles. I love it and will continue to use it every night. Thank you for solving a problem I thought there was no solution for!</li>
    <li> I decided to give it a try after using for some time Decollette Pad from Calvet Cosmetics. This item is a little bit cheaper, but you got what you paid for - it did not serve me for as long as Decollette Pad and I am not as satisfied with its quality as I was with Decollette Pad (read my review about the product)</li>
    <li> this really works. I ordered thinking there is no way but i was pleasantly surprised it works perfect.I will order this again.</li>
    <li> Love these, they work like a charm. I would suggest sleeping in them rather than the instructions provided, however. Wake up looking younger .</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims it will but it works rapidly and with minimal inconvenience. I highly recommend ti.</li>
    <li> This item is amazing! It really does lessen the appearance of chest wrinkles and also helps to prevent them. I wear this all night or for an hour during the day. I have purchased several of these and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Good product easy to use and keep it clean.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick well.</li>
    <li> This product really works great!  I wore it every night religiously until about 6 months ago when I started getting a raised rash on my skin where the pad is placed.  I tried using a new pad, but the problem persisted.  So unfortunately I had to stop wearing it.  I don&#x27;t know if they had changed the formula or if I had just developed a sensitivity to the adhesive.  Otherwise I would have rated the product 5 starts.</li>
    <li> The stickiness lasts longer than other chest pads I have tried. It is also cheaper than the other one, and offered FREE shipping. The only negative is it took too long to get here.</li>
    <li> Seems to work pretty good.  If you sleep on your stomach it can fold over during the night, but I&#x27;m a tossing-turner.</li>
    <li> It works fine, not quite as well as Decollette Pads by Calvet Cosmetics but it will do. Cheaper isn&#x27;t always better!</li>
    <li> This product has potential, but as I move and change position through the night, the pads seem to shift position. By morning sometimes the sticky side has become stuck to my clothes or the entire product has shifted up towards my neck. It&#x27;s comfortable to wear and when it remains in place it appears to be effective, but what&#x27;s the point if it doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job and stay in place :(</li>
    <li> They worked better than I thought they would. Can&#x27;t even tell you are wearing it. Have a good day. Good price</li>
    <li> I purchase another brand last time and I ended up ordering that brand again. This one does not stay on properly, doesn&#x27;t stick well.</li>
    <li> they last along time, east to use and are priced very well , will buy again. Product does everything it says...</li>
    <li> but wears out and doesn&#x27;t stick after 2 weeks, even if you follow the daily care instructions.  I&#x27;ll use it if I know I&#x27;m wearing a V neck the next day.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Best if you sleep with it each night.  It adheres to the skin very nicely.  I&#x27;ve been using mine for almost a month.  I noticed a difference the very next day.  My chest wrinkles are completely gone but if you miss a couple of nights of wearing the pad they do seem to return.</li>
    <li> I have used the Anti-Wrinkle pad for the last 4 nights and it really works!  It is comfortable to sleep with and the next morning my chest area looks great.  Would highly advised using it.  I tried one before that had silicone in it and I had a reaction but this one worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> These do work to smooth out those chest wrinkles, but I cannot wear them because.... whatever the stuff is that makes it stick on to your skin really irritates my chest and causes it to look red and somewhat bumpy.  I am sorry about this, because, as I said, it works.  Try it and see if it will work for you.  My only caveat would be that, if you tend to get at all sweaty at night, it will start to come off/move around (not what you want to happen).</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. ..it dont stick. ...</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as described. High quality and lasts. I still have mine (I wear it every night) and it stil works great.</li>
    <li> Works but I have a feeling the strap will get stretched out real fast.</li>
    <li> This is really amazing, I do not know how it works!!  But it does!!  Worth the money, make sure your skin it clean and a little moist, it will last longer if used like this!!</li>
    <li> I have a red, blotchy chest.  It&#x27;s been three days and it is a little better.  Got bumpy and red and itches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other brands, and that has never happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks worse that wrinkles!!!</li>
    <li> I dislike this product completely.. It does not stay in place. the gel comes out from the heart...  waste of money and poor quality</li>
    <li> I recently tried DermaPad and the results are amazing.  Even the first morning there was significant change. Its comfortable to sleep with and hasn&#x27;t been messy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I purchased more to pass out to my friends to try.  What a difference.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to the founder of the DermaPad!!!&lt;br /&gt;LG</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good, but it doesn&#x27;t last more the 10 applications, it starts to peel off the silicone on the edges. But it works.</li>
    <li> My last review for this product was removed.  So I&#x27;ll try again.  Purchased through Amazon as it claims it can be helpful with stretch marks too.  After receiving the product and taking a look at it, I realized there was no way this oversized jelly sticker was going to help with stretch marks, so I requested a return and was informed that I could not return \\&quot;hazardous materials\\&quot; to Amazon.  After an email or two they agreed to the return.  Products have been returned but I still have no refund.  Argh...</li>
    <li> The dermapad was expensive for a single pad, and it didn&#x27;t hold up.  I was very disappointed and I will not purchase it again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LW</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 53 yr. old female. Recently, I started looking for a product to help me with wrinkles in my Decolletage area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a side sleeper and was waking up in the morning with deep creases in between my breasts. It took hours to go away and I couldn&#x27;t wear V-neck tops without feeling self conscious. I looked on-line for something but there a few choices. I saw the DermaPad and thought I&#x27;d take a chance. I love it! I bought 2 so I can switch them. I have no problem with the adhesive part lasting. The trick is to make sure that your Decolletage area is clean.....no creams, nothing. Also, If the area is slightly damp (from H2o),the pad will adhere very well and will last much longer that way. I wear mine every night and in the morning I take it off, put the lining back on it and put it in the bag making sure the seal is completely closed. Once a week I wash it with warm water and let it air dry. I was given a very good piece of advice by an esthetician in my youth. She said, &amp;#34;Learn to sleep on your back. You&#x27;ll have fewer wrinkles as you age&amp;#34; . It&#x27;s really good advice but until I can re-train myself to start sleeping on my back this is a great solution!</li>
    <li> This one was not the same as the first one I ordered....not nearly as adhesive .  Disappointed this time....I loved the first one.  That one worked great.  Disappointed....I lost my money this time.</li>
    <li> it works, the trick is to make it stick all night.  Clean skin very well and allow to dry.  Use rubbing alcohol if you can&#x27;t wait for water and skin to dry completely.  I wish I would not have to re-order after 30 uses!</li>
    <li> This product is great. The only thing I have a problem is that the stickiness goes away. After wearing for couple hours, noticed a difference</li>
    <li> I have been using the DermaPad for a month.  It is very effective and comfortable.  You have to be sure your skin is clean to ensure adhesion.  I washed mine for the first time today and it cleaned up great and the sticky is still there.  I would definitely recommend it to someone with problems with wrinkles in that area.</li>
    <li> This product was $4 cheaper than the chest pad from Calvet Cosmetics so I wanted to try it-by chance to save money. It would not even stay on for one night without curling up on the outside. Huge disappointment. My chest was clean and clear of any lotions or products. And I hardly ever sweat-so that wasn&#x27;t the issue either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What pissed me off the most is that its a defective product but their BS return policy claims its a hazardous material once used and cannot be returned. Are you joking me? That says EVERYTHING about this company knowing their product is inferior.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s easy to get used to and it works great!  I cut it in half width wise to get double the use.</li>
    <li> do not waiste your money, it does not work, is not reusable. after first use is garbage.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this</li>
