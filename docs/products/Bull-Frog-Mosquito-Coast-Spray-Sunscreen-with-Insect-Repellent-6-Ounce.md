### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent for boating</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d put this on in the morning to protect from both sun and mosquitoes and it did an excellent job of both.&lt;br</li>
      <li>According to consumer report this is the best sunscreen on the market.</li>
      <li>Great transaction.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product and has been working so well for my kids.  </li>
      <li>Living in the mountains of Colorado I had no need of bug protection unless it was fly spray for my horse.</li>
      <li>Great product; feel it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, thusly 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
      <li>that states that it has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>Good sun protection but</li>
      <li>So glad to find it on Amazon!  </li>
      <li>Great Item--- goes on easily</li>
      <li>Will need more soon...should have ordered more than one!</li>
      <li>Good product, I like that it is deet free for myself and my family.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen that works well, and is very water resistant.</li>
      <li>bug bites though :)</li>
      <li>I but this for my husband for golf to keep him sun safe and to keep the pesky bugs at bay.</li>
      <li>I reapplied about every 2 hours, so maybe if you reapply more often, the sand fleas wont&#x27; get in.</li>
      <li>Great product, price and fast shipping.u</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, when I wash my skin repeatedly, even scrubbing, the smell lingers.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s both combined into 1</li>
      <li>Was pleased that it did not have an offensive odor.</li>
      <li>It smells so strongly that it makes me self-conscious and worried if it&#x27;s really safe to use on my skin.</li>
      <li>It is highly effective and the main reason I prefer</li>
      <li>If you live on a creek or river, this is the best repellant against yellow flies!</li>
      <li>I came home without a significant sunburn but had 50</li>
      <li>Its cheaper on Amazon then in store where I originally found it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help but shake my head at their bold lie on the can</li>
      <li>This is a great product for both adults and kids and works very well, not too oily like some other brands</li>
      <li>I really needed a product like this because I spend a lot of time outside and have to contend with both the sun and critters that love the taste of my blood.</li>
      <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll get regular old bullfrog sunscreen (which is awesome) and apply some Deep Woods Off, as it does prevent sand flea bites as well as mosquitos.</li>
      <li>It goes on easily with the spray, but does leave an oily film on the floor, so might want to apply it outside.</li>
      <li>Stung certain body areas.</li>
      <li>The new spray bottle works better than the pump, but it is bigger too.  </li>
      <li>Worked really well at the beach&lt;br /&gt;Sand</li>
      <li>The product sprays OK upside down, which made it easier to spray the backs of my shoulders, neck, and legs.</li>
      <li>were after me with just the normal sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Sprayed</li>
      <li>I only wish it had a higher spf option</li>
      <li>has an oily feel at first, but you forget you have it on in a short while.</li>
      <li>the down side, wish it had been higher spf as I burned the first day after using this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Use every morning when walking the dogs and eliminated all bites so far.</li>
      <li>Used on recent trip to the Caribbean and worked very well.</li>
      <li>However, I got eaten alive by sand fleas.</li>
      <li>Living near the woods, we use this every year and cannot find it in any of the local stores.</li>
      <li>I saw them landing on me not long after using this product.</li>
      <li>My first morning walk on a tropical beach left me peppered with little red welts.</li>

<li> This is a very effective sun blocker and insect repellent.</li>
<li> and I had to fall back to using other bug sprays.</li>
<li> Unlike other spray on sunscreens this actually blocks the sun</li>
<li> It also keeps gnats away (at least the gnats where I live) in addition to mosquitos.</li>
<li> During 90 minutes outside, I got one bite on my lower shin, a spot I usually forget to spray.</li>
<li> So, I&#x27;ll give it a half a rating.</li>
<li> Even though the label says it does not contain DEET, it smells like it and has a slightly greasy feel that I associate with DEET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m actually not altogether sure if this product works or not - at least the insect repellent -</li>
<li> One thing I can say for certain is that it STINKS.</li>
<li> I did not get a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray button is a little hard to depress, so it was a little difficult to spray with my non-dominant hand.</li>
<li> We have Asian Tiger mosquitos which are active during the day, so I have been looking for a combination insect repellent + sunblock for when I spend time in my back yard.</li>
<li> given the quantity of mosquito bites I have, it&#x27;s not very good at deterring them...</li>
<li> I have had a hard time finding it in stock at the store sometimes so ordering it online and having it delivered saves the hassle.</li>
<li> GREASY, hard to get off.</li>
<li> RUINS PLASTIC!!!</li>
<li> In short, the bug repellent does not work well</li>
<li> Because this is not DEET, my camping buddy was skeptical.  </li>
<li> Seems to work well as a casual user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> This product protects me from those annoying flying insects when I work in my garden.</li>
<li> To me, it smells like exterminator&#x27;s bug spray rather than insect repellent.</li>

    <li> This stuff just works.  The new spray bottle works better than the pump, but it is bigger too.  We always have Bull Frog at home and the cabin.</li>
    <li> This product protects me from those annoying flying insects when I work in my garden. I buy it every year.</li>
    <li> Living near the woods, we use this every year and cannot find it in any of the local stores. So glad to find it on Amazon!  It is highly effective and the main reason I prefer it is, there is no deet in it.  Do I feel it is a bit safer to use on myself and children.</li>
    <li> Was pleased that it did not have an offensive odor.</li>
    <li> Great transaction.  Great product, price and fast shipping.u</li>
    <li> This is a very effective sun blocker and insect repellent. My husband takes it everywhere.</li>
    <li> According to consumer report this is the best sunscreen on the market. I but this for my husband for golf to keep him sun safe and to keep the pesky bugs at bay.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and has been working so well for my kids.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s both combined into 1 so they are covered for both.</li>
    <li> Good sun protection but given the quantity of mosquito bites I have, it&#x27;s not very good at deterring them...</li>
    <li> This is a great product for both adults and kids and works very well, not too oily like some other brands</li>
    <li> I really needed a product like this because I spend a lot of time outside and have to contend with both the sun and critters that love the taste of my blood. I&#x27;m actually not altogether sure if this product works or not - at least the insect repellent - because I have some bites from before I bought it that still itch. One thing I can say for certain is that it STINKS. I can&#x27;t help but shake my head at their bold lie on the can that states that it has a pleasant smell. Uh...no, it doesn&#x27;t. To me, it smells like exterminator&#x27;s bug spray rather than insect repellent. It smells so strongly that it makes me self-conscious and worried if it&#x27;s really safe to use on my skin. What&#x27;s more, when I wash my skin repeatedly, even scrubbing, the smell lingers. I don&#x27;t know if I can keep using it because of that fact.</li>
    <li> Great product; feel it&#x27;s a bit overpriced, thusly 4 stars rather than 5. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Unlike other spray on sunscreens this actually blocks the sun and you don&#x27;t get burned! It also keeps gnats away (at least the gnats where I live) in addition to mosquitos. Its cheaper on Amazon then in store where I originally found it. I only wish it had a higher spf option</li>
    <li> Great Item--- goes on easily I spray into hand then apply. Use every morning when walking the dogs and eliminated all bites so far. It absorbs well and  doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel. Will definitely buy again Especially convenient with the sunscreen built in</li>
    <li> Worked really well at the beach&lt;br /&gt;Sand flies/fleas(?) were after me with just the normal sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;Sprayed this on me and not a bug in sight.&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, wish it had been higher spf as I burned the first day after using this.&lt;br /&gt;No bug bites though :)</li>
    <li> We have Asian Tiger mosquitos which are active during the day, so I have been looking for a combination insect repellent + sunblock for when I spend time in my back yard. This product worked well on both fronts. During 90 minutes outside, I got one bite on my lower shin, a spot I usually forget to spray. I did not get a sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray button is a little hard to depress, so it was a little difficult to spray with my non-dominant hand. The product sprays OK upside down, which made it easier to spray the backs of my shoulders, neck, and legs. Even though the label says it does not contain DEET, it smells like it and has a slightly greasy feel that I associate with DEET.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I can find a combination product that doesn&#x27;t smell like DEET, I will buy that, but otherwise I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I buy a six pack of these for our trips to the Caribbean. Living in the mountains of Colorado I had no need of bug protection unless it was fly spray for my horse. My first morning walk on a tropical beach left me peppered with little red welts. Yikes! This product was just what we needed. Sun screen and bug protection all in one. I liberally spray my legs, ankles, and arms we protects me from the biting critters of the tropics. We used it on our six hour hike through rainforest (including a swim in the waterfalls) and returned relatively unscathed (Thea&#x27;s always one or two diehards that make it through).</li>
    <li> Because this is not DEET, my camping buddy was skeptical.  I&#x27;d put this on in the morning to protect from both sun and mosquitoes and it did an excellent job of both.&lt;br /&gt;It has an oily feel at first, but you forget you have it on in a short while.</li>
    <li> If you live on a creek or river, this is the best repellant against yellow flies!</li>
    <li> This was purchased for our summer bags so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about carrying and applying both sunscreen and bug spray. Seems to work well as a casual user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still bring a container of sunscreen if I&#x27;m going to be in the sun all day since it needs to be reapplied every two hours and you may not want/need to apply bug spray that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price of around $6 is comparable to the box stores. I have had a hard time finding it in stock at the store sometimes so ordering it online and having it delivered saves the hassle.</li>
    <li> Stung certain body areas. GREASY, hard to get off. RUINS PLASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> I tested this out at Banks Lake in Eastern WA where I went camping for four days in 100+ degree heat and sun. I came home without a significant sunburn but had 50+ mosquito bites all over my body. I saw them landing on me not long after using this product. In short, the bug repellent does not work well and I had to fall back to using other bug sprays.</li>
    <li> Only spray that works for me when camping in south Louisiana.</li>
    <li> Excellent for boating</li>
    <li> Good product, I like that it is deet free for myself and my family. Ordered it at the beginning of the summer. Will need more soon...should have ordered more than one!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen that works well, and is very water resistant. Used on recent trip to the Caribbean and worked very well.</li>
    <li> Well, it sort of worked. I did not get sunburned, not did I get mosquito bites. However, I got eaten alive by sand fleas. So, I&#x27;ll give it a half a rating. It goes on easily with the spray, but does leave an oily film on the floor, so might want to apply it outside. I reapplied about every 2 hours, so maybe if you reapply more often, the sand fleas wont&#x27; get in. All in all, I won&#x27;t buy it again, as it just didn&#x27;t deliver on the promises it made. Next time, I&#x27;ll get regular old bullfrog sunscreen (which is awesome) and apply some Deep Woods Off, as it does prevent sand flea bites as well as mosquitos.</li>
