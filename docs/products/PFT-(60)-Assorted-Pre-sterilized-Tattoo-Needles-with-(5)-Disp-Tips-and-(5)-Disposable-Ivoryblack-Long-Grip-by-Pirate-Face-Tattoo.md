    <li> Came directly on time, their sharp, and just awesome lol</li>

    <li> This is what it is.  50 Needles and 10 tips.  They work fantastic.</li>
    <li> these presterilized tattoo needles will fit perfectly in my anus</li>
    <li> Love this better to use this than infected needles</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> Highly satisfied everything was in the package and was placed neatly everything including as shown on image....will be buying more n the future from this vendor.thank you</li>
    <li> All but 2 pks were great</li>
    <li> I never recieved my tips</li>
    <li> I was talking to a employee from this tattoo supply distributor over emails about my order before i ordered it  i mentioned the sizes and the amounts i needed.  he sent back that he has received the sizes and amounts i needed and that it will be sent out the next day.  he also sent s a follow up email two days later asking \\&quot;Did your order go through\\&quot;    Yes my order did go through but out of 60 needles i only received 15 i actually wanted.  they sent me a huge variety of needles i did NOT want nor do i use!!  when i sent him a email about the situation he told me that the order number i sent him was incorrect and that it did not match there records.  1.if that was the case-why would you have sent me them? if you do not have the correct order number to begin with why would you send someone the order?  he then asked for me to resend the order number.  so i went onto my emails and received the confirmation email (basically like a receipt) and retrieved the order ID number.  (noted i did copy and paste it-that way so i wouldn&#x27;t mistaken the numbers)   he then told me that i might&#x27;ve received a order from a different supplier.  1.if that was the case-how would you know which order i was talking about?    i honestly believe they are not at all professional about what they do.  I also believe that if you receive an incorrect shipment that they will not work with you to return your shipment and receive the correct order.  Because as of half a WEEK ago they have failed to work with me to retrieve the ACTUAL order i requested.  They have failed to apologize for there mistake-none the less they have continuously been rude regarding the situation.  So now i am screwed with needles i DO NOT use. My mother gave me the option to try and sell them to another tattoo shop but i highly doubt another tattoo shop will buy then because of the fact that the expiration date is extremely faded to the point where you cant tell when they expire.  along with the expiration date being faded thesize of the needle on the back is also faded and you cant tell what size needle it is unless you are experienced in the business.    Im bothered by the fact that ive basically wasted my money and that ive had a bad experience with such a company.  a company that seems to be a scam to me.  If i could rate a 0 i would.  I do hope that if anyone does choose to buy from this supplier that they check into them  and if that goes good, then good luck i hope YOU get what you request.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as advertised.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Delivery was way early and helped me a lot !!</li>
    <li> I am very very satisfied with my purchase from these guys. Everything was packaged very neatly and the needles have expire dates on them. The tubes that came with the needles helped a LOT. I will be buying from you again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and camenities fast!!</li>
    <li> Came SUPER fast. Awesome. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Please I need 60 line #5 , 40 shade #5,  20 line #9,</li>
    <li> hello, i resently purchased the (60) assorted pre-sterilized tattoo needles with (5) disposable&lt;br /&gt;tips and (5) disposableivory/black grips and i am very pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;the kit will come in handy for me right now and i hope to do more shopping with you all&lt;br /&gt;and peircing pros in the future. thank you</li>
    <li> I rated these needles quite high because I think they are as good as the more expensive ones out there. Its nice to get a good mix without having to buy two or three hundred to get what you want.</li>
    <li> How do i tell them what needles i want? i want to order a certain set of them. Which ones would they send automatically</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my order, and how quickly my order was shipped and delivered.  I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> They got here fast and I will be ordering more in the further</li>
    <li> I got my All the 60 needle and the 5 grips. But I did not get the 5 disp tubes.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipping was in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Good needles...Great Value...Perfect!!!!!</li>
    <li> half of the needles were open</li>
    <li> shipping speed was very slow , i asked for specific needle sizes which the description says the sizes, i contacted them and they told me to send them the ones i wanted along with order number once i order. i did that and i recieved random needle sizes that most are useless to me and will not even be used so big waste of money and time. plus they are very basic qaulity something you would get in a chinese kit.</li>
    <li> Good quality. I use them often.</li>
    <li> ended up throwing awayy over half the needles, the tips were not what i ordered and th needle tips were full of solder with some being frayed out.</li>
    <li> I had a couple of tattoos lined up and was haggling around on where to get needles at. This seller came through and fine style. Five stars!!!!</li>
