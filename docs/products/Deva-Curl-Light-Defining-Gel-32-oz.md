      <li>Very much I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use it for many years and will continue to use.</li>

      <li>love this gel.</li>
      <li>I love this curl defining gel.  </li>
      <li>Nothing more can be said about Amazon.</li>
      <li>but I prefer the gel that gives more definition.  </li>
      <li>Love it and all the deva curl products.  </li>
      <li>My curly hair has never looked better.</li>
      <li>I love my wavy hair, which used to be even curlier.</li>
      <li>The oil gave me smooth, shiny, bouncy, healthy curls and did not leave a residue.</li>
      <li>and those of us who enjoy our lovely locks.</li>
      <li>The pump makes&lt;br /&gt;it easy to use, and you can even use to freshen your waves/curls in between washing.</li>
      <li>(Allows me to get up in the morning when I wear my hair curly and have a way to look presentable without having to shower - HUGE</li>
      <li>I use the products then scrunch with a towel, add light gel then use diffuser w hair dryer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply daily which is great.</li>
      <li>I have lightly curled hair and have used every product imaginable for my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is just the right consistency after washing your hair, and doesn&#x27;t make the hair and curls &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; as many products do.</li>
      <li>It does reshape easily if you run wet fingers through your hair, which is great for morning touch ups.</li>
      <li>Love this gel, this is the first time I purchased this size bottle.</li>
      <li>Especially when someone has paid good money for it.</li>
      <li>Love this whole system of curly hair products.</li>
      <li>Has a build up - mild, compare to some products, but it is there&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this new product my hair has more balance and shine, however I had to use a lot of it to achieve desirable results.</li>
      <li>I love the products for naturally curly hair from Deva Curl!</li>
      <li>This is a great price and keeps my curls tight without making it look greasy.</li>
      <li>It smells great and isn&#x27;t heavy on my hair</li>
      <li>This gel is light weight and isnt sticky (unless you use too much).</li>
      <li>Fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell and how it makes my curls soft.</li>
      <li>Provides just the right amount of hold for my curls.</li>
      <li>It probably  would air dry nice too.</li>
      <li>this at my most recent haircut.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>few years ago I found an oil based product I loved for my hair.</li>
      <li>Super soft feeling!</li>
      <li>The gel itself is fine, but this is the second Deva product I have purchased with a defective pump.</li>
      <li>But, I&#x27;ve been using DevaCurl products for 4 years straight</li>
      <li>My tween daughter and I have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair really oily.</li>
      <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
      <li>This is my second order of the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel.  </li>
      <li>Have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
      <li>I really like this gel.</li>
      <li>Defines curls really well, frizz is non-existant&lt;br</li>
      <li>Think of it like a light glue - it will keep your hair in a curl, but they are not soft flowing curls.</li>
      <li>Overall: good product, but that bottle won&#x27;t last long if your hair needs a lot of it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>At first I thought I might be using too much, so I cut back</li>
      <li>Now I have to find another container to put it in or see if I can find a new pump for it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s completely watered down and doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real DevaCurl Light Defining Gel.  </li>
      <li>Keeps my hair from being frizzy, I have not been able to find a product that will do this and still allow for a little bounce!</li>
      <li>I like buying the 3 products in the 32 oz size so they will last a long time and then tend to be a tad bit cheaper when purchased in the larger quality (which helps since these are not inexpensive products - but they are soooo worth it for any Curly Girl!!)</li>
      <li>Leaves my curls soft yet, they stay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, hope it will get better as I continue to use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product for my unruly, curly hair and it works great.</li>
    <li> I love the product, but the pump was all cracked and broken, like someone dropped it. Not going to lie, I find that very annoying. Now I have to find another container to put it in or see if I can find a new pump for it. At least it didn&#x27;t leak all over the place, but still. Take more care with the merchandise, guys. Especially when someone has paid good money for it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair from being frizzy, I have not been able to find a product that will do this and still allow for a little bounce!</li>
    <li> love this gel. It smells great and isn&#x27;t heavy on my hair</li>
    <li> I especially like the pump</li>
    <li> I truly love it!! I have been using this product for over six months and it has made a big difference for my curls.</li>
    <li> Very much I love this product. I use it for many years and will continue to use. Very actual packing size for me.</li>
    <li> My tween daughter and I have very curly hair. I love the deva the gel. You have to follow The Curly Girl Handbook (download it from Amazon) to get those perfect curls. Love this whole system of curly hair products.</li>
    <li> This is good but I prefer the gel that gives more definition.  These products are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Do not like this product. Can&#x27;t even put your fingers through your hair</li>
    <li> I love this product. I thought I&#x27;d tried them all, but this one is the best. Leaves my curls soft yet, they stay. They last longer too. I can sometimes make it 3 days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this gel. It is necessary to use with the entire system. After the Deva Curl No Poo and the Conditioner One I only use a small portion of this on my hair. So happy I purchased this!! It locks in a soft curl and doesn&#x27;t make my hair too hard.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly girls.  Be sure to use as directed and your hair will have amazing curls.</li>
    <li> love this stuff and have used it for years.  Provides just the right amount of hold for my curls.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the size of the product. It does hold my curls in place. I need to wash it out daily, though. If not, the build up makes ones curls look like one ugly mess.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair. This is the best gel for my hair I have found!!</li>
    <li> Love it and all the deva curl products.  I am hooked.</li>
    <li> Lots of lasting curl⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</li>
    <li> Deva Curl has proven to be the best products I have found for really curly hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and excellent service.</li>
    <li> I finally found &amp;#34;THE PRODUCT&amp;#34; for my curly hair!!! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair dry or stiff. I don&#x27;t have to reapply daily which is great. What are you waiting for? Buy it!! :-)</li>
    <li> Love it!  Arrived on time exactly as described at a great price.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really oily. I stopped using it</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I use it daily and because it has no alcohol in it, it is not drying for my curly hair. I love buying it on Amazon because it is the best deal!</li>
    <li> The only thing to use if you&#x27;re a curly girl.  Reactivates the next day with wet hands.  Fresh smell.  Works with high or low humidity.  Does not build up on hair.</li>
    <li> Have very curly hair. Keeps it controlled, without the crunchiness of other products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for years. If you have curly or wavy hair, you need to buy this. This is a great price and keeps my curls tight without making it look greasy.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, quick shipping.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Deva Curl is the ABSOLUTE best hair product for curly hair! After forty years of trying all sorts of products this found me and is the best! It keeps my curls nice and healthy even as I grow my hair out. I will never change!</li>
    <li> I love this curl defining gel.  My curls look and feel so good after I have used it.  I always get tons of compliments from people telling me that my curls are awesome!</li>
    <li> This gel is light weight and isnt sticky (unless you use too much). I love the smell and how it makes my curls soft.</li>
    <li> I have lightly curled hair and have used every product imaginable for my hair. I need volume and a holding down quality. Deva LIGHT is good for my hair and does the job well. Not tested on animals. I use most of the Deva products and find them fairly priced and excellent for curly hair. Nothing more can be said about Amazon. Always on time, helpful people on the phone, just great service.</li>
    <li> Love this gel, this is the first time I purchased this size bottle. Extremely disappointed that the pump does not work.</li>
    <li> Typically, I have to change our products once a year or so because my hair stops responding. But, I&#x27;ve been using DevaCurl products for 4 years straight and my hair keeps getting better and better.</li>
    <li> The product as the same quality as what I had previously purchased at a salon at a much lower price.</li>
    <li> Wavy hair lady. Product I used to use wad discontinued and I have final found my new replacemnt! I am using the no poo shampoo. Conitioner and the light gel! Use lore product than you think you need!!! Does Not make my hair crunchy. I use the products then scrunch with a towel, add light gel then use diffuser w hair dryer. It probably  would air dry nice too. Super soft feeling! A must try for wavy / barely curly hair</li>
    <li> Pros: Defines curls really well, frizz is non-existant&lt;br /&gt;  Can run wet fingers through hair to reshape it (Allows me to get up in the morning when I wear my hair curly and have a way to look presentable without having to shower - HUGE bonus)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does nothing to make my hair stay healthy&lt;br /&gt;  Has a build up - mild, compare to some products, but it is there&lt;br /&gt;  Hair stays in the shape you put it in, so if you play with your hair, it will poof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I found an oil based product I loved for my hair. My hair is coarse, dry and prone to frizz. The oil gave me smooth, shiny, bouncy, healthy curls and did not leave a residue. Sadly it&#x27;s been discontinued and I&#x27;ve been hunting for something similar. This product is great for molding your curls, but there are some drawbacks. Think of it like a light glue - it will keep your hair in a curl, but they are not soft flowing curls. They are curls that are glued in place. If you play with your hair as I do - that means that you end up with curls at odd angles or poofy hair. At first I thought I might be using too much, so I cut back and then I ended up with some frizz. It does reshape easily if you run wet fingers through your hair, which is great for morning touch ups. I wanted to like this product and I still might use it occassionally, but I&#x27;m still search for something better.</li>
    <li> Sealed up and no suspection of tampering, will update after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  My curly hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> This is the equivalent of using hand sanitizer in your hair. It dried out my hair to the consistency of straw and left it full of knots throughout the day. There is no running your fingers through your hair with this stuff. Along with the DevaCurl DUO, my hair had lost all of it&#x27;s luster. Zero shine. This stuff can not be good for your hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will be using it for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;This is a replacement of the AnGel version of the product.</li>
    <li> The gel itself is fine, but this is the second Deva product I have purchased with a defective pump.</li>
    <li> I use in combination with the DevaCurl no-poo and One condition conditioner. I started them all at the same time, so it is hard to rate this product individually but as a combination the system works great. My hair starts out curlier than it ever was in the past, and this gel holds it all day without being stiff. My hair is also much less frizzy since using this product line.</li>
    <li> Because my hair is super curly and thin, I&#x27;ve always used leave-in conditioner that helps to get my hair heavy so it stays put all day, but most of the time without any good balance. With this new product my hair has more balance and shine, however I had to use a lot of it to achieve desirable results. I&#x27;ve used it only a few times, hope it will get better as I continue to use it. Overall: good product, but that bottle won&#x27;t last long if your hair needs a lot of it.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have difficulty getting the pump to work, but the gel is terrific!</li>
    <li> This is my second order of the Deva Curl Light Defining Gel.  I use the No Poo shampoo and One Condition conditioner, so this is a great follow up to set my hair.  I like it because it&#x27;s not very sticky and help set my curls.  I like buying the 3 products in the 32 oz size so they will last a long time and then tend to be a tad bit cheaper when purchased in the larger quality (which helps since these are not inexpensive products - but they are soooo worth it for any Curly Girl!!)</li>
    <li> Love the product! Smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy and stiff if used correctly.</li>
    <li> Only products I use!!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent curl!!</li>
    <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I like it alot but I&#x27;m thinking of switching to the arc angel because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff at all.This product does make your hair feel a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> I love my wavy hair, which used to be even curlier. My amazing hair stylist used this, and suggested that I order it, this at my most recent haircut.&lt;br /&gt;It is just the right consistency after washing your hair, and doesn&#x27;t make the hair and curls &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; as many products do. The pump makes&lt;br /&gt;it easy to use, and you can even use to freshen your waves/curls in between washing. Just mist with some water,  add some of the&lt;br /&gt;Deva Curl spread evenly in the palms of your hands, and run through from the roots of your hair to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;To give credit where it is due, this and related products originated at the Manhattan Devachan Salon, and they know and respect curly&lt;br /&gt;hair, and those of us who enjoy our lovely locks.</li>
    <li> I love the products for naturally curly hair from Deva Curl!</li>
    <li> This is a fake product.  It&#x27;s completely watered down and doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real DevaCurl Light Defining Gel.  I would suggest avoiding seller 911Salon unless you like wasting money!  Does not even deserve the one star.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my curly hair. I towel dry my hair, scrunch in the gel, and go!</li>
