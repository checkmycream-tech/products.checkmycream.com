<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Thank You Sigma for the best brushes I have ever purchased!!! These brushes are amazing with my powder foundation. I can not say enough about them, I noticed I am using less product and moves across my face smoothly. My bronzer loves it as well. I have one the first professional set brushes I bought a couple of years ago and they are still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants a set of brushes that will last and last these are the ones!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Sigma for making me beautiful everyday!!&lt;br /&gt;Isabel</li>
    <li> These brushes are amaze! Use the F80 for liquid foundation for a flawless, blended application. Use the F82 for concealer or just blending out harsh edges and the F84 is PERFECT for blush and contouring. You will not be disapointed with these brushes! Love Sigma &lt;3</li>
    <li> The brushes are packaged in a cute bag w/ brush guards.  This is a great set of brushes for a low price.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes today and I LOVE them!! They&#x27;re super soft and perfect for putting on foundation and blusher. The brushes were packaged in a lovely blue coloured bag and I&#x27;m just so happy with the purchase - a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> ... with these brushes! The f80 is amazing for liquid foundation, the f82 applies powder flawlessly and the f84 is great for blushes wet an dry. These brushes help make my makeup perfect everytime. Great price &amp;&amp; great quality!</li>
    <li> Just got my brushes, I have not used them yet but just by looking at them I could tell that they are very high quality.  And I am comparing them to brushes made by MAC and Bobbie Brown both of which I have owned for years.  I also plan on buying additional brushes to replace my lower quality ones I already own.  Also the shipping, to Hawaii, was quite a bit faster than I thought it was going to be, so a definite plus!</li>
    <li> Like a few others out there, I saw these brushes used on multiple youtube tutorials/reviews. I just had to try them. I have never used MAC brushes before, mainly because of the cost. So I was very eager to try out the Sigma line. And...I love them! They have a good weight to them, easily to handle, dense bristles and soooo soft. I tried out the flat kubuki for the first time this morning with my liquid foundation and I love the application. So quick and easy and the results look great! Now I am looking forward to getting a bronzer so I can try out the angle brush :) Would highly recommend this set!! Oh, and my shipping was excellent. Was supposed to receive around June 20 and instead I was pleasantly surprised to have them waiting in my mail box yesterday (June 13).</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely nice!! The quality is great. They came very quickly and were wrapped up so nicely! It is my first time using Sigma brushes and I am definitely glad I purchased them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are simply fantastic. I have not seen any other brushes like these to come on the market (and I own quite a few lol). They are very densely packed, and make make-up application go on smoothly and flawlessly. These brushes can be used for liquid, creme or powder application. My favourite of the 3 brushes is the angled brush. I use this for liquid foundation, and have to say that I have never had such perfect application.  My only downfall with these brushes is, Im sorry that I didn&#x27;t order 2 sets!! As when you wash them, they can take over a day to dry.  But all in all, I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for face brushes. 5 stars</li>
    <li> This brush set included the F80, F82 and F84.  These brushes are amazing, soft, quality brushes!  I was very happy with how well they apply! A great product I recommend to anyone who is looking for a high quality stippling brush set.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes after reading good reviews. And wow I was very impressed how quick I received them 3 days later I got them!! And I tried the brushes out and they are great I love all 3 of them. I will definitely order more from this brand in the future! Great brushes and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting these brushes for quite some time now. I am excited I finally got them. The F80 is great for applying my liquid foundation. It gives me a flawless look. They are soft and perfect for someone like me who loves to play with make-up. Sigma ships super fast. I got my brushes in 3 days. Wow! I love this company!</li>
    <li> These are excellent brushes, It will make even the most cheapest looking foundation look amazing. I am very impressed with the high quality of the brushes and would recommend it to any makeup lover.                                               Thank you for this wonderful product, most satisfied customer Tashara</li>
    <li> I received my brush set today. OMG they are soooooooooo soft and soooooooooooo dense. I have used so many brushes earlier and can tell the difference in quality. They are great quality brushes. If you are starting out in makeup or starting bridal work, go for these brushes. No need to invest in Mac brushes if you don&#x27;t want to. You can definitely use Sigma brushes. Very happy with my purchase and shipping was fast. Thanks Amazon and Sigma.</li>
    <li> At first I only wanted to buy the f82 flat top because thats all I knew about and I wasn&#x27;t sure how great the brush would be, but after talking to me sister who bought the whole set, I was convinced on buying the three brush set, and I was so happy I did. The shipping came pretty quickly, and I&#x27;m really glad it came in a pretty blue bag with covers on each one. The brushes are so soft and they pick up make up liquid or powder so well, that application is flawless and makes my skin look great. I definitely recommend these brushes!</li>
    <li> I was looking at a subscribed youtube page that I always watch, and she was doing a review on sigma brushes the beauty synthetic face kit ones. how you can take the flat top brush and use it to put on your foundation because i was tired of using a sponge and have it soak up all the product on the sponge. So, I was waiting for my birthday to roll around and finally got to ask for them.  You can check them out on my [...] page...thank u!!</li>
    <li> Of all the Sigma brushes these are by far the best brushes in their entire collection. These are well worth the hype. Yes it is true what everyone says about these they are absolutely wonderful.  Okay I&#x27;ll even go a bit further.  These are by far the best synthetic blending brushes that I own of all the brushes I have ever tried or own EVER.  These are incredibly soft.  They blend foundation or blush well.  They work with any type of make up to give you a really soft canvas blended look.  Honestly I use these every day that I apply make up on.  I have washed them a ton of times and I use a brush guard they have not lost their shape and are still as good and as soft as the day I bought them.  Their construction is nice.  Nice sturdy handle, sold ferrule.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these.  Skip all the other Sigma brushes.  If you can only have one set this would absolutely without a doubt be the one to get.</li>
    <li> I received my Sigma Synthetic Face Kit brushes about a week ago, which I decided to purchase based on recommendations from three different beauty product bloggers. I was in search of synthetic fiber brushes because I prefer how they pick up liquid and powder products over non-synthetic brush material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I use a full-coverage foundation, I want the finish to be as natural as possible, and I&#x27;ve found that the round kabuki is great for my stipple/buff method of foundation application. Because of its densely packed brush fibers, it really does create my perfect finish, covering up some acne scars and my melasma \\&quot;mask,\\&quot; but without a cakey foundation look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat top kabuki is great for blush application on the apples of the cheeks...I like it for the precision it offers, and how nicely it picks up both pressed powder blush and my Tarte cheek stain stick color. Really great for building color, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the angled kabuki is what I&#x27;ve been using to apply all-over bronzer. Again, great brush fiber density, and such a nice shape that&#x27;s perfect for a quick sweep of color across the cheeks, at the jawline, a bit on the forehead and temples...you know the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like I&#x27;m actually using less product with this brush set, and getting a very natural - but still polished - look.  They are unlike any other brushes I have in my rag tag set that ranges from drugstore buys to a well-known high-end brand. I&#x27;m really glad to have become familiar with the Sigma line...my experience so far is that I&#x27;m getting a terrific value for really well-made cosmetic implements, and I plan to shop Sigma first next time I&#x27;m in search of a particular brush.</li>
    <li> These three brushes arrived suprisingly quick. I did not like to use makeup everyday until I received these brushes. They are simply pleasurable to use and feel like a soft gentle massage on my face. I uses the angled brush to apply my powder blush, and the rounded brush to apply liquid foundation everyday. I occasionally use the flat brush for finish powder. The application seemed very natural and blend to my skin very evenly.  I wonder if sigma makes the smaller version of angled HD brush for eyes.          I used to use the exact color of foundation on my face to look more natural. Now with the rounded brush I can buy more desirable (lighter and healthier) color of foundation, they blended onto my face so naturally and brighten my face color. The angled brush now replaced my Mac $32 angled brush because the application is more natural and airbrushed. I love these brushes so much. I would like to have one more angled brush to apply bronzer, and one more rounded brush to apply face cream.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes and I can&#x27;t agree more on others reviews. It&#x27;s really soft and blend well on your face.Also I&#x27;ve got a gift from sigma which is a &#x27;duo fibre-f50&#x27; It&#x27;s stippling brush like mac 187. This is one is also perfect. I bought a brush set from other brand but I&#x27;m thinking buy another brush set from sigma because I guess Sigma is the best as make up tools. Reasonable price and best quality. I&#x27;m gonna recommend this product to my friends who are considering buying some brushes.  Thank you Sigma!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much good thing on those brushes that I had to check myself if it was the truth. And IT IS ! those brushes are so dense, so soft, I adore them.  I&#x27;ve only bought the face kit for the moment, but now I&#x27;ve handled those brushes, I will definitively by more, in fact a lot more. Love them</li>
    <li> I saw a review for these brushes on youtube and everything I heard on them was making them seem like the best brushes in the world. I had to try them so I shopped around online and found them on Amazon at the best price! I had some delivery issues but thankfully I was able to work everything out. I finally recieved my brushes and they are MAGNIFICENT! They are honestly the best brushes I have ever used. I spent the exact same amount that i paid for these 3 brushes over at Mac for 1 brush and these brushes are a trillion times better. The trick to flawless makeup is having flawless brushes and these are definetly flawless! They are so thick and dense that i use less makeup on these brushes than i use with the other brushes. I have recommended these brushes to all my friends and i will never use any other brushes for my foundation, powder, and blush again. i am definetly going to go back and order the complete sets for the eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> These brushes are fantastic, by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are so soft, dense, and just the right size.  They also come with plastic covers that protect and help keep the shape of the brushes.  This is really nice, especially if you travel a lot because with these covers, the brushes don&#x27;t need to go in a brush roll.  The brushes also come in a pretty travel bag.  This was my first Sigma brush purchase but it certainly won&#x27;t be my last.  Shipping was fast and this trio is a really great deal considering you get 3 top notch quality brushes for $14 each.  You just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I am in love with these brushes they provide such a beautiful finish to my face and they make applying makeup a much faster process with the use of less products! I will surely continue to purchase sigma makeup brushes in the future</li>
    <li> I love these brushes so much! Not only are they extremely soft, but they do their job and then some. They make my make up look flawless and airbrushes, which was advertised. I never really knew how much a brush could make a difference in application until I bought these. I had a round top kabuki brush once before and thought it worked well, but compared to F82, theres no contest. The packaging they came in is also great. It came with brush covers, which can be reused and is great for travel.I also love the pouch they come, which will also come in handy as well. Money well spent!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t words to say how wonderful these makeup brushes are really an amazing product, and believe me a very good buy</li>
    <li> I got a scarf instead n now have to send it back n get a refund n reorder the brushrs</li>
    <li> i LOVED this product!  the shipping was EXTREMELY fastt and the product was exactly as it was described!!  it even came in a superr cute packaging with a  pamphlet  describing each brush!  i LOVED itt~!!! ((:</li>
    <li> I got my brushes yesterday and used them tonight for the first time, and they are really nice.  They feel nicer than the other brushes I have bought previously, which were about the same price or slightly more expensive.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t yet comment on how they will withstand over time (and will update with that at a later time), but for now I can say that they are as nice as I expected.  Thanks Sigma!</li>
    <li> Lets start from the very beginning- Ive been checking out these brushes for the longest while as they seem to be the most liked by many makeup artistes. Finally I placed my order and they just arrived----the packaging is so cute!! definitely a nice touch compared to other things you purchase online. The texture is sooooo soft but firm at the same time if you know what I mean. I immediately handed my old brushes over to my sister cuz I know that there is no going back! I cannot wait to use my brushes! Thanks Sigma! I cannot wait to make my next purchase from your line!</li>
    <li> I ordered this set about a month ago. I love these brushes! I have only used the round and flat brushes though. I have used the flat top brush with both cream and liquid foundations. I have used the round brush to apply powder. I know some people who like to use the brushes to apply moisturizer or primer, but I have not tried this. Both brushes blend and buff perfectly. I find that I use less (waste less) product with this brush compared to the tapered foundation brush, finger, or sponge application. The brushes are easy to clean- I use a mild brush soap or baby shampoo. The brushes keep their form when dried, and they don&#x27;t smell after washing (I used another brush from another company that always smelled foul after every wash). I would definitely recommend this set.</li>
    <li> I RECEIVED NY BRUSHES TWO DAYS AGO AND I LOVE THEM. MY FOUNDATION LOOKED FLAWLESS, LIKE AIRBRUSH. THIS WILL BE THE ONLY BRUSHES THAT I WILL USE FROM NOW ON.</li>
    <li> These are by far the best brushes I have ever used.  I have wasted so much money on brushes claiming to give a \\&quot;flawless, airbrushed look\\&quot; but never did.  Finally, after finding these brushes, I have found what I have been looking for.  Flawless look, quality, sturdy brushes and design.  Received within a few days of ordering and will definitely order from again.  The day I received, I actually removed my make-up, and reapplied using these brushes!  I now look forward to doing my make-up, and the time to apply my foundation has practically been cut in half as I do not have to play around with different brushes, fingers, sponges,etc., these brushes do it all!  You will not be disappointed. I have told everyone I know!  Excellent!</li>
    <li> Oh my god thess are the best brushes I own in my brush collection. Just received brushes in the mail today, and I was astonished by them the packeage was well made nice and the shipping was very fast. I ordered these brushes on monday and they were here by friday which is amazing.I never had a problem with recieving any order that I order from amazon I also rate them a A+. I ordered these brush because I heard so many great reviews on amazon and youtube which i have to agree they are really good brushes for apply makeup, it makes my makeup look flawless. Thees brushes are the first expensive brushes that I purchased and I made the best decision ever and worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive these brushes, they arrived nicely packaged and with a bonus on top of it. They are by far the best addition to my make-up collection.  These brushes are top quality. They are so soft and dense.  They really make your make-up application flawless and are worth so much more than they cost. I have previously ordered the pink travel brush set ( that I never leave home without) and Sigma never disappoints.  I plan to order the full-size set very soon. You will not regret this purchase.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes &amp; I&#x27;m super excited. Packaging was so cute. I don&#x27;t have any MAC &amp; although I&#x27;ve been debating to purchase some, I don&#x27;t think I am anytime soon. Although I just got them. I have used the round top already (i couldn&#x27;t wait) &amp; omg!!! I love my elf flat top powder brush but this beats it&#x27;s by a zillion!!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more sigma!</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes today and they came very nicely packaged with plastic guarding on the brushes so the bristles do not run stray and a plastic cover around the handle. I cannot believe how densely packed the bristles are in these brushes! Hands down, the densest brushes I own. I used to use the coastal scents flat bronzer brush that is similar to the flat top kabuki and the size of this one is smaller, but I actually prefer that because it&#x27;ll help me get into the creases and small areas around my face for an even application. Also, I am not worried that it&#x27;ll take me longer to apply my powder foundation because the bristles are so dense that there is no need to go over one area too many times (like I have to do with the cs flat bronzer brush, which btw sheds quite an irritating amt). Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and cannot wait to try these brushes after I wash them. I heard they take a while to dry because they are so dense, but I&#x27;m ok with that. They&#x27;re the softest brushes I own as of right now (that is until I purchase even more from sigma brushes in the future ;]) The price I feel is reasonable for the amazing quality of these brushes. The shipping was fast and direct, I ordered this face kit on 3/6 (sun) and they arrived to me on thurs (3/10)! Thank you Sigma for making such wonderful brushes that I can afford!</li>
    <li> I loved the * Sigma Beauty Synthetic Face Kit , it is very soft on the skin makes makeup appear natural and glowing i am very happy with my purchase it is really worth it and i loved the packeging   Thank you sigma</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Laura Mercier, Bare Minerals, EcoTools, Revlon, Mac brushes.     These products can be compared to that of the higher end brushes! If you are in the market for brushes, I highly recommend these brushes! I have not experienced fall out!</li>
    <li> I honestly have never felt such soft bristles! Your face deserves the best treatment especially if you are a faithful make-up user everyday like I am! I will never turn to any other brand again! I trust Sigma brushes 100% because I know that the quality will never hurt my sensitive skin like others have. You MUST purchase these if you haven&#x27;t so already! They are AMAZING and make you look like you&#x27;ve airbrushed your makeup on! I promise you will not be disappointed! :)</li>
    <li> I absolutely love what i bought which are 3 face HD brushes kit and eye brushes kit.   They are extremely high quality, and wonderful brushes. Sigma also shipped my order faster than i thought would be. Wonderful!!!! I will definitely purchase more brushes from Sigma.   The only problem that i had with my order was that the shipping and handling price are different compare purchasing in Amazon and purchasing in Sigma website. It is about $4.0 less charge of shipping and handling if i purchase exactly same thing from Sigma website than purchase from Amazon. Other than that, i absolutely loving my new brushes!!!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
    <li> Let me tell you these brushes deliver.  After hearing my girlfriend talk about them and look at them multiple times I just decided to get them for her as a gift and she was ecstatic.  She says that they are fantastic with her product and unlike other brushes that \\&quot;eat\\&quot; her product, these brushes end up with the product on her face.  Based on her reaction I would definitely say they are worth the buy.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my wife. Very good quality. They are for amateurs but you will find a professional result. Excellent cost/benefit !.  My wife uses every day and she obtains the HD result.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about Sigma brand for awhile but did not want to invest since they are pricey. But after struggling with uneven results I decided to give these a try. Wow what a difference! Faster more even coverage with liquid and even better with mousse or cream type foundation. Have not tried it yet with my mineral foundation yet. Flawless! This has cut my prep time in half! These brushes are of the highest quality, feel soft on skin and great in your hand. I purchased the 3 brush set and purchased and extra Kabuki flat top for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Some people have issues with the shipping, but it is well worth it! I ordered these on a weekend and received them on Monday! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great for applying anything from foundation to brush. The brushes give an air brushed look to your face. They completely changed how the makeup products I already have look on me. They are expensive but totally worth it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to order these brushes...I love them! They came in the mail this afternoon (shipped quickly) and I had to take off my foundation and try them out. They are soft and provide great coverage, and I&#x27;ve used almost every high end brush out there! I can&#x27;t wait to keep using them</li>
    <li> I have brushes from MAC, EcoTools and Sephora.  These face brushes from Sigma are quickly becoming my favorite.  Each brush is made with soft, synthetic hair and offers the perfect amount of firmness you want in a face brush.  The flat top and rounded brushes are excellent for buffing/blending out liquid, cream or powder foundations.  I use the angled kabuki mostly for blushes of all types.  If you&#x27;ve ever shied away from cream blushes, the angled kabuki makes them super simple to apply.</li>
    <li> Ok I love Sigma brushes, I think they have a great quality and great value for your money, but if you have to choose this is the set you must have. These brushes are fantastic! Well made and with them you will achieve a great look because to look good you have to create the perfect canvas and with this brushes you will.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my purchase! I read a lot of online reviews before purchasing, and I heard such good things about sigma, that I decided to try it out for myself! I think they are very well priced for the quality, and I also like the fact that they are synthetic.     I&#x27;ve washed them twice already, and have been using them daily to apply liquid foundation and concealer, and powder blush/bronzer with the angled top brush.     I have been using the Beauty Blender for a long time now to apply concealer and foundation, but was unhappy with the fact that I could never clean it really well. I am so happy with the results using these brushes, and it&#x27;s so much easier to really keep clean and sanitary. They do work very well, are easy to use and blend foundation, and I am not an expert.     And on a side note, they are very attractive. I like the simple design of black with silver accents. They look nice on my vanity, which is nice since they are out on display all the time!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best face brushes i have ever used. The bristles are super soft and glide to give excellent coverage all over the face. You will not regret buying these...</li>
    <li> I am used to using MAC brushes or Simple ones from Target. But I have learned a lot about this company and wanted to try these. I got these as an early Christmas gift. And I am in LOVE with them. Perfect application and smooth to the touch. Very are Full and do not feel cheap or like they will loose hairs. I use the flat top for Foundation and it creates an amazing finish to my makeup. I use the other too for Blush and Contour. It creates perfect makeup for your face and never looks overdone. The brushes pick up just the right amount of makeup and doesn&#x27;t overdo the product or under-do it.    I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy any other brushes and I think I am stuck with these 3 for a long time.</li>
    <li> I received these beautiful brushes a few days ago and have tested all three of them out.  I am absolutely impressed with all three brushes!  The quality is superior, very soft, dense, and truly make application a breeze.  I actually enjoy putting on my makeup because it cuts down on the application time, and I end-up with flawless skin.  Can&#x27;t wait to order more!!  Also Sigma was very very prompt in sending out my order!  Thanks for a first rate product at less than half the cost of designer brushes!</li>
    <li> The Sigma Face Kit Brushes are very soft and the quality is great.  I love these brushes and my makeup goes on so nice and evenly this is great buy.  I also was so surprised how fast I received the brushes, I got them in 3 days that&#x27;s fast service.  Great quality and fast service, I will buy more in the future from them.</li>
    <li> This line of brushes is everything I&#x27;ve wanted and more from a brush. I just put more on my wishlist for the holidays! I hope I get another set. They do the job right, blend like a dream with no harshness whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I seriously don&#x27;t know how I was able to do my makeup all this time without these and now that I have these, I&#x27;m never going back to any other face brushes! This kit is seriously everything I need, from concealer to foundation and even blush and contouring! I love the service too!! I seriously got this within about 3 days. Definitely going to buy a back-up set of these :)</li>
    <li> I use it every day. Very well made and no issues after cleaning them.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how easy these brushes are to use. They are s soft and apply liquid foundation, blush, and powder flawlessly. This is actually my first set of sigma brushes and definitely NOT my last. My next purchase will be the 12-piece set! I can&#x27;t wait!!!! Thanks Sigma for making such a phenomenal product.</li>
    <li> Those are the best brushes ever!!! I&#x27;ve a lots of brushes and the sigma ones are always perfect. My make looks really natural. This Face kit really exceeded my expectations. I am Brazilian and I always watch tutorials from the girls in Brazil. So I decided to purchase this kit. I&#x27;m loving and I recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I just got my brushes in the mail today, and the first thing I have to say is the shipping time was AMAZING. I ordered these brushes late Monday night, and they arrived on Friday afternoon -- that&#x27;s exceptional in my book! Not only did they arrive much sooner than expected, but they arrived in a wonderfully packaged, sleek box with the Sigma logo on it. When I opened the box, I was very pleased to find the brushes packaged in a very chic teal colored mesh bag, each brush with a brush protector over the bristles, and a plastic covering on the handle. This definitely made me comfortable knowing my brushes had a nice, protected journey to my mail box! The brushes also came with a lovely pamphlet outlining the many uses for each brush.    I had heard about Sigma for a long time, and when I actually had the brushes in my hand, I understood what the hype was about. Not only do the brushes somehow balance being extremely dense with being extremely soft, but, in my hand, they feel extremely, extremely durable; in other words, they feel like they should cost a lot more than what they do! I was very pleased, and, of course, had to try them out. I used the flat top kabuki for my liquid foundation and concealer, the round top kabuki for my powder, and the angled top kabuki for my blush and WOW...I couldn&#x27;t believe that I actually did the makeup -- it looked like I had it professionally done. And, the best part is that not only did I use less of each product, but I did it in less time too since these brushes make blending easy and super fast.    All in all I am very satisfied with my purchase. Knowing that Sigma delivers quickly with wonderful products has certainly made me a loyal customer! I look forward to expanding my Sigma collection!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing, exceptional quality. The flat top and round top are perfect for liquid foundation and for concealer. I use the round top for concealer and it is the best ive ever used. The angled is perfect for blush and contour. These brushes are so soft, not stratchy at all like some. I would highly recommend these brushes, far better than MAC in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long Sigma Beauty lover but I have to say their Synthetic face kit brush set is by far one of their best.  The bristles are extremely dense and super soft.  They apply my makeup; either it&#x27;s liquid, powder or creme, flawlessly and give me full coverage and spreads the makeup without leaving streaks on my face. They are easy to clean but because they bristles are so dense it may take a while to get dry., so maybe wash at night to let it dry by morning. I would definitely by more brushes from Sigma, especially their synthetic ones.</li>
    <li> I got mine today , they are very famous in youtube . I think they are the best face kit ever .. \\&quot; I have not use them yet though , however I am sure they will be so amazing \\&quot;</li>
    <li> These brushes are AMAZING!! I never thought my makeup could look so great, so blended, so natural. As soon as I received them I could not wait to try them...they are so amazingly soft on my face I actually enjoy putting on my makeup :) Thank you sigma, I will be back for more!!!</li>
    <li> If you are a beginner, this face kit is essential.  The three brushes can function as multiple brushes.  You can lay down your foundation, apply blush, contour, highlight, blend and buff it all out perfectly.  If you are more experienced with brushes and makeup, the same applies.  You will just be adding some very fabulous brushes to your collection.  The handles are very solid, have a nice weight to them.  The F80 I received has a glossy finish, with shimmery labeling, which is quite cute, and gives the brush a more sophisticated look.  I hope Sigma finishes all their brush handles this way in the future.  As for performance, they are unbeatable.  Like I mentioned before, this face kit can substitute a foundation, blush, contour, and highlight brushes.  The price is amazing, only $42 for three brushes!  The MAC 182 (kabuki) costs $52.  The quality of these brushes is wonderful, I will definitely be trying out more Sigma brushes :)</li>
    <li> These are, in the words of Alan from the Hangover, the three best friends that anybody could have! I don&#x27;t know how I ever went without! They work well with liquid, cream, and powder; and will always leave you with a flawless finish. Shedding does not exist in the world of these Sigmax brushes! The colors don&#x27;t bleed and they are so soft! I can&#x27;t say anything bad about them! And I can&#x27;t seems to get myself to stop &#x27;exclaiming&#x27; everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Synthetic Face Kit &#x3D; !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the end!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. I use each one for powder,blushes, and cream to powder makeup.These brushes are great for quick appliction. I think it makes a great gift for people who love their makeup brushes.</li>
    <li> I was afraid when I bought this brushes BUT...    - The Shipping was faster.  - Excelent package.  - Excelent Presentation.    Here we have an excelent Synthetic Brush Kit. These brushes are very soft, with the perfect size for an easy use and high definition effect.    Not compare with other brushes, these are softer and high quality), this is an Excelent kit that you HAVE TO have in your make up Kit.</li>
    <li> These brushes arrived at my house amazingly fast!  That was pleasant enough!  Then I opened the adorable bag they came and and fell in love instantly!  All three of the brushes and extremely soft and dense!  Perfect for foundations!  I am replacing my old makeup sponge with these!  I cannot wait to purchase more brushes from Sigma!</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes in the mail. Shipping was really fast! The brushes come in a really cute blue, drawstring bag, each brush with a plastic cover around the bristles to protect them. The gift brush also comes in a plastic cover to protect. The brushes are REALLY soft, unlike many brushes that I&#x27;ve tried that feel like straw. And they&#x27;re all very thick! Very dense brushes with a lot of bristles. I haven&#x27;t used any of them yet, but the bristles don&#x27;t shed as easily as other brushes that I have. I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
    <li> This was the first time I purchased sigma product and I love it. Soon, I will be getting other brushs.</li>
    <li> These are my first brushes I&#x27;ve bought from sigma, I have yet to try them but i can tell there very good quality. When I buy any kind of brush they need to feel good on my face and these feel so soft and gentle very impressed, I will continue to buy from sigma from now on. Shipping was super fast to I am super happy with my new brushes^^ .</li>
    <li> I love my new Sigma brushes! I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about these brushes from youtube and my friend let me borrow hers to try. I fell in love right away! The brushes are so easy to use and applied my foundation flawlessly! This is the perfect set because you can use it to apply your foundation, setting powder, blush, and bronzer with an airbrushed look! Also, shipping was so fast! I ordered my Sigma brushes last Wednesday and it came the following Monday! I wasn&#x27;t expecting it until Friday and so I was surprised to get it so fast! Awesome buy, awesome brushes!!! Thanks Sigma!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased these brushes about two weeks ago and I am completely in love with them. They do what they say they do, they leave my face absolutely flawless. I also notice that I use less foundation with these and they do a great job at blending the make-up onto your skin. I have tried them with both liquid and powdered foundation and they are great with both. Since I have used them, I have had no shedding and they are the softest synthetic brushes I have ever felt. I have also washed them several times now and they are still soft as new. I was traditionally in love with MAC brushes and was all I ever purchased, but the quality of these Sigma brushes, makes me want to never go back. Plus the fact that for the usual price of one MAC one I can get three is amazing. I love these and I hope to buy more Sigma brushes in the future :)</li>
    <li> Definetly my favorite brushes!! I Luv to apply foundation, powder products, The bronzers looks amazing!!!  My foundation goes on sooo well. i actually prefer the angle top for my liquid foundation, it gets really well around the nose and eyes. Dont even hesitate about getting these just do it!! you&#x27;ll see a transformation with how your foundation goes on.</li>
    <li> Fantastic set, they are so so soft! I use the flat top for my mineral foundation, it glides on like silk. The round top is great for blending out concealer under your eyes &amp; is perfect for contouring. The angled brush would be great for blush or contour.  I have MAC brushes as well but I think you can save your money &amp; go for the Sigma brushes they are just as good for a lot less $!</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this brush set.  These brushes are very soft and the most densly packed of any brushes I have ever felt.  I have washed the brushes with no shedding and they dried to their original shapes with no deformation. I have also used the brushes to apply both liquid and powder foundation and they work well with NO shedding.  As you can tell, I hate brushes that shed. In fact, I have thrown away very expensive brushes for just that reason. I also love the fact that these synthetic brushes are cruelty free.  Sigma Makeup seems to be a top flight company  with which to do business.  Shipping was fast, the product was packaged well to prevent damage, and came in a lovely blue mesh presentation bag.  Sigma also included a very nice travel size blending eye brush as a bonus-a very thoughtful touch of appreciation.  I am so pleased with the brushes and the service from Sigma that I have placed another order for the 12 piece professional kit with brush roll and some additional eye brushes to round out my collection.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes after seeing good reviews on You Tube and I am loving them! They are great quality, comperable to more expensive brands. And - to my surprise - I received also small blending brush E25 as a gift! Thank you Sugma! I will definitly buy more of your products!</li>
    <li> I love Sigma brushes. They are soft, dense and feel wonderful on your face. I have own a lot of other high end brushes and these are as good, if not better. Plus, they don&#x27;t shed when you wash them either.</li>
    <li> Their AMAZING!! Its so soft and amazing for  applying your foundation !!I wish i knew about thes brushs sooner!</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and they blend my Urban Decay foundation makeup beautifully! Completely worth the price I paid for them :)</li>
    <li> As someone who wears liquid foundation EVERY day, I&#x27;ve had my fair share of makeup brushes.  These are, by far, the BEST brushes I&#x27;ve ever had-- extremely soft and dense.  I wear liquid foundation from NARS and Lancome, which are not the cheapest... so if you&#x27;re like me and are savvy about how much makeup you&#x27;re using with each application, these are the brushes for you because they do not soak up a ton of product, which is great!  Also, they don&#x27;t leave unattractive brush streaks across your face...  I don&#x27;t even have to worry about it with these!  My favorite is the flat-top kabuki, but all three are great.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I also saw a you tube review on these brushes and thought i would give them go, i am SO happy that i did. These brushes are absolutely AMAZING, they don&#x27;t leave any marks on your face, make up looks completely flawless, they are the preety size (not too big and not too small). Seriously the best $42 (26 pounds) i have EVER spent. I would seriously recommend these brushes to anyone who wants a flawless foundation look.</li>
    <li> I read reviews and watched videos on these... and they do not disappoint! All are wonderfully soft and dense. The round one is fantastic for applying and buffing in my MAC studio fix plus powder. It applies precisely without any waste and it takes less time than with other brushes, It picks up the perfect amount. I use the flat top for my bronzer and the contour for my blush.... fantastic... I am so in love. The weight and size is perfect for handling. I could never use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have done a lot of research on these brushes and have yet seen any negative feedback! I have a new love for sigma brushes. What&#x27;s amazing is the price you pay for these 3 brushes that work wonders....is the price for one MAC brush. I am definitely getting another set just to have : ) For any makeup lovers give these brushes a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I currently own the F80 which was known as the SS197 brush. I have had it for over 1 year now and I am absolutely in love with the brush. My makeup application goes on flawless. Every time I try to switch brushes I regret it. Somehow the synthetic bristles on these brushes applies makeup so well. When the F82 and F84 brushes were launched, I knew I had to have them. I bought this kit because not only for the two brushes F82 and F84, but I wanted another F80. My current F80 is not damaged, but I just had to get another one. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other two brushes. I&#x27;m sure I am going to love them also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Sigma could make all their brushes synthetic :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product! Well worth every dollar spent!</li>
    <li> My husband ordered this set for me as a gift and I absolutely love them! The flat top makes foundation application so much easier, and it comes out perfect every time.  They are super soft, much more so that I expected for synthetic brushes, and are still dense enough for foundation, bronzer, blush, etc.  I also own the complete brush set and will hopefully be getting the premium brush set soon.  I love them and they&#x27;re perfect for people who don&#x27;t want to spend the money on more expensive MAC brushes for something of the same quality.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I LOVE these brushes. They are truly professional quality, you can feel the softness and how thick and firm they are. I&#x27;m very picky about how my skin looks and these brushes really do their job. My foundation looks flawless, and trust me, I do not have perfect skin. Both the F80 and the F82 is perfect for my foundation. The F84 makes my cheeks look amazing! They really help bring out my cheekbones. I would really recommend this to everyone, especially since you don&#x27;t have to pay an arm and a leg to buy the brushes!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are so soft and gets the job done. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I recently decided to try \\&quot;stippling\\&quot; my foundation and read the reviews for these brushes.  So glad I bought them.  And glad I bought all three!  Each plays an individual role in applying the makeup.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these brushes. They pick up perfect amounts of product. Also great at blending/buffing. Must have for any lady :)&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are of high quality and they feel so amazingly soft! Some people complained that they shed. I never had a problem with the fine hairs falling out. im very much satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;:))))</li>
    <li> They came quick, 4 days earlier i was super excited it came in cute packaging. The brushes are so beautiful and really good quality for a very good price will purchase from this seller again thnx:)</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been eyeing these brushes for a few months now and finally gave in after reading all the wonderful reviews, wondering if it&#x27;s really as great as everyone is saying. I just received it in the mail and boy am I seriously wowed by these brushes. They&#x27;re REALLY compact, ultra soft and well made. It even came with a brush guard. The true test is in its use obviously but I can already tell they will work wonderfully!! In fact I think I&#x27;m going to get rid of my other brushes entirely... and if this is any indication of their brushes, I am seriously thinking of getting their eye brush set as well!!  I&#x27;m going to give it a few weeks of daily use and I&#x27;ll try to update my review!!</li>
    <li> These brushes work great with my mineral foundation and blush.  The bristles don&#x27;t come off on my face, like the Bare Minerals brushes.  These seem like they are very good quality.  I am so far very impressed with these brushes and would highly recommend them for anyone who uses powders.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase this set as everyone has been raving about it! I can definitely say I was not disappointed. The flat top brush was everything everyone was saying it was. I have yet to try the round top brush but I did use the angled brush for blush and I found it was a bit too dense to apply blush, nevertheless the quality is still amazing. Great product Sigma!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I can say I am not disappointed, and would highly recommend these brushes to anyone who is serious about their appearance...definitely a must have item.  Bought two sets, and just had to have a third one.  [[ASIN:B0045W2TDA Sigma Beauty Synthetic Face Kit]]  Great gift idea</li>
    <li> im glad i bought them, they are super soft and they give me a flawless look... they work well with my chanel foundation</li>
