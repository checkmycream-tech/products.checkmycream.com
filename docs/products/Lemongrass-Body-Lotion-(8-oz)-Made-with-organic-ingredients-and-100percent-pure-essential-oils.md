      <li>the ingredients used are good for your skin!</li>
      <li>Actually,she loved it and was very happy.</li>
      <li>Great aromatherapy...and</li>
      <li>Great to use throughout the day as well.      </li>
      <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m still going to buy more since it smells so wonderful.</li>
      <li>I have just begun using this lotion and it is as good as the soaps.  </li>
      <li>My skin haven&#x27;t been flaking since I used this plus good soap.</li>
      <li>Love this lotion!</li>
      <li>I love Plantlife products!</li>
      <li>and I get many compliments on just how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>awesome hand cream smells live fruit loops!.</li>
      <li>I bought their soap prier and loved the quality,so I was excited to find this on Amazon!</li>
      <li>But, more importantly, it is also rated as pleasantly \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; by the Environmental Working Group -</li>
      <li>and I really love the scent of it.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I found this lotion and their vanilla orange to be very, very nice lotions for face or whole body.</li>
      <li>It is so mild, I even apply it to my face on warm days when my skin rebels against greasy, heavier moisturizers.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for after shower in the dry winter days.  </li>
      <li>She said this was not too strong</li>
      <li>This is a lovely scented lotion that feels good, is non-greasy, and nicely moisturizes my dry skin.    </li>
      <li>Before I opened it, I kind of smelled the lotion but not really, and it smelled a bit like my grandma&#x27;s oint mint, but after opening, I was relieved and happy that it smelled so fresh!</li>
      <li>Mine did not smell anything like lemongrass (or anything fresh for that matter), more like something that had been sitting on a shelf for a while.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly enough, she absolutely loved this lotion.</li>
      <li>Nice natural scent.</li>
      <li>I find the lotion to be a little sticky, but the lemongrass fragrance is great - not too strong.</li>
      <li>Great for my  dry cuticles and skin!!  </li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>Nice for soft skin, but the fragrance is gone fairly fast</li>
      <li>I use this right after I shower.  </li>
      <li>This Plantlife body lotion is a pleasant, fast-absorbing product with lemongrass as its top note, followed by other gentle and natural ingredients including aloe, hibiscus and grapefruit peel.  </li>
      <li>the lotion either didn&#x27;t have much of an aroma to begin with or it&#x27;s been on their shelves for years!  </li>
      <li>Love the feel and initial smell!!!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other good things from Plantlife, but I won&#x27;t be buying this particular lotion again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another recommendation is that I use it to remove my eyeliner gently &amp; effectly and don&#x27;t want to spend extra money buying more products.</li>
      <li>first, cut up a garlic clove and swallow the pieces whole, then apply this lemongrass lotion all over.  </li>
      <li>It smells good but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>One of the very few lotions that I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful ingredients and also nut free.  </li>
      <li>And, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the bottle because this product fells really slimy.</li>
      <li>Very lightweight yet moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My mom refuses to use organic beauty products because she believes that natural products cannot be as good as the ones made from harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>May be that is her first step to convert to using natural beauty products.</li>
      <li>This is a great lotion as you only need a small amount which goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>Light but long lasting!</li>
      <li>I wanted a natural lotion with no chemicals.  </li>
      <li>(smell and ingredients were soothing, not harsh)</li>
      <li>The body lotion is not too heavy and is easily absorbed!</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter who only uses organic natural products.</li>
      <li>And if you are not very careful when you open it.</li>
      <li>non greasy, would absolutely buy it again, wish it was a little bit cheaper though</li>

<li> I have oily and dry combination skin, oily nose and dry face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really complaining, it&#x27;s just not what I expected.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
<li> I will also purchase other fragrances as well.</li>
<li> The lotion make a big mess and a waste of product.</li>
<li> , that is my only complaint.  </li>
<li> and notice less exes oil production.</li>
<li> I recommend purchasing this as you won&#x27;t feel bad since it&#x27;s all natural and contains no synthetic ingredients.</li>
<li> Lemongrass is an all natural mosquito repellent, so after I come in the house after doing backyard gardening</li>
<li> Witch it is really expensive.</li>
<li> This way, if an errant mosquito follows me indoors (probably hiding in my watering can), I don&#x27;t have to worry about being bitten, plus this lotion smells plenty nicer than those stinky outdoor repellent products.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <li> Love the feel and initial smell!!!  On me though, the smell does not last very long.  Great for my  dry cuticles and skin!!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great! I have oily and dry combination skin, oily nose and dry face. My skin haven&#x27;t been flaking since I used this plus good soap. My face does not look greasy at all using this. Before I opened it, I kind of smelled the lotion but not really, and it smelled a bit like my grandma&#x27;s oint mint, but after opening, I was relieved and happy that it smelled so fresh! Everytime I use it, it wakes me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another recommendation is that I use it to remove my eyeliner gently &amp; effectly and don&#x27;t want to spend extra money buying more products.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this lotion when I purchase essential oils and I really love the scent of it. I&#x27;m going to buy a bottle of it as well as the essential oil scent.</li>
    <li> I wanted a natural lotion with no chemicals.  This is a great lotion as you only need a small amount which goes a long way.  I use this right after I shower.  Great to use throughout the day as well.      I recommend purchasing this as you won&#x27;t feel bad since it&#x27;s all natural and contains no synthetic ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scented lotion that feels good, is non-greasy, and nicely moisturizes my dry skin.    But, more importantly, it is also rated as pleasantly \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; by the Environmental Working Group - see their database of body care products at e w g . org</li>
    <li> I have just begun using this lotion and it is as good as the soaps.  I use it daily after my gym workout and I get many compliments on just how good I smell.  I love it.  I will also purchase other fragrances as well.</li>
    <li> My mom refuses to use organic beauty products because she believes that natural products cannot be as good as the ones made from harsh chemicals. Amazingly enough, she absolutely loved this lotion. May be that is her first step to convert to using natural beauty products.</li>
    <li> One of the very few lotions that I have been able to find that doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful ingredients and also nut free.  It smells good but not overwhelming.  Perfect for after shower in the dry winter days.  Wish they would make hand lotion too!</li>
    <li> I found this lotion and their vanilla orange to be very, very nice lotions for face or whole body. Light but long lasting!</li>
    <li> I love Plantlife products! Great aromatherapy...and the ingredients used are good for your skin! The body lotion is not too heavy and is easily absorbed!</li>
    <li> I find the lotion to be a little sticky, but the lemongrass fragrance is great - not too strong. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Have used thes lotion before, couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal on here. Very lightweight yet moisturizing. Nice natural scent. Love this lotion! I haven&#x27;t found anything I dislike from this company. Recommend anything from them!</li>
    <li> awesome hand cream smells live fruit loops!. non greasy, would absolutely buy it again, wish it was a little bit cheaper though</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter who only uses organic natural products. She said this was not too strong (smell and ingredients were soothing, not harsh) Actually,she loved it and was very happy.It is a lotion she will buy again and recommend. I bought their soap prier and loved the quality,so I was excited to find this on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Mine did not smell anything like lemongrass (or anything fresh for that matter), more like something that had been sitting on a shelf for a while.  I got it for 3 bucks, so I&#x27;m not really complaining, it&#x27;s just not what I expected.  It&#x27;s a lotion, and it does seem to do the job.  I&#x27;ve purchased other good things from Plantlife, but I won&#x27;t be buying this particular lotion again.</li>
    <li> Nice for soft skin, but the fragrance is gone fairly fast, that is my only complaint.  Probably would not want to buy this again though.</li>
    <li> the lotion either didn&#x27;t have much of an aroma to begin with or it&#x27;s been on their shelves for years!  And, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non-oily. A little goes a long way, too. Heavenly smell. Love it. I bought it (and all the hair care products) because lemongrass is supposed to repel mosquitoes. If it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m still going to buy more since it smells so wonderful.</li>
    <li> This Plantlife body lotion is a pleasant, fast-absorbing product with lemongrass as its top note, followed by other gentle and natural ingredients including aloe, hibiscus and grapefruit peel.  It is so mild, I even apply it to my face on warm days when my skin rebels against greasy, heavier moisturizers.  Lemongrass is an all natural mosquito repellent, so after I come in the house after doing backyard gardening I do two things:  first, cut up a garlic clove and swallow the pieces whole, then apply this lemongrass lotion all over.  This way, if an errant mosquito follows me indoors (probably hiding in my watering can), I don&#x27;t have to worry about being bitten, plus this lotion smells plenty nicer than those stinky outdoor repellent products.</li>
    <li> I only use this product where my skin gets dry. and notice less exes oil production. I don&#x27;t like the bottle because this product fells really slimy. And if you are not very careful when you open it. The lotion make a big mess and a waste of product. Witch it is really expensive.</li>
