    <li> My assigning 5 stars to this product reflects my own (and my daughter&#x27;s) satisfaction with it BUT the product has been discontinued by Neutrogena so that is moot! I was stockpiling as much as I could find after learning of Neutrogena&#x27;s drop of this shampoo.</li>

    <li> We cannot find this shampoo anywhere in the stores so I sought this out for my fabulous husband who is a bit picky about his shampoo. It&#x27;s Neutrogena or nothing. I don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ll do when we can&#x27;t even find it on Amazon. I don&#x27;t think I want to live with a man who has dirty hair.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new shampoo and someone suggested that I try this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;I tried and I love it.  It leaves my hair nice and clean without drying it out.
