      <li>The color combo&#x27;s are great and the idea is a good one....</li>
      <li>It also creased up fairly quickly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>even when you put a lot on it, which is good coz</li>
      <li>I love the way my eyes look with this cream based eye shadow!</li>
      <li>~ Once the color went on my eyelid, I really liked the smoky lideffect.</li>
      <li>It kind of just smudges around.  </li>
      <li>I would agree that it can break easily, as mine did!  </li>
      <li>What I love:    </li>
      <li>I love Cover Girl products</li>

      <li>maybe the brown/beige would be better.</li>
      <li>Great product and price with fast shipping</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it at full price but it is a nice product to have on hand for a night out look, if you can get it at a discounted price.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m excited to try another color!</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this product!  </li>
      <li>hope that Covergirl is able to fix these problems as I do love the product and would be willing to give it another try!</li>
      <li>This is upsetting as they really are (or were) one of my very favorite products.</li>
      <li>So, it looks like such a GREAT idea.</li>
      <li>but I did receive my sample of Covergirl for free in exchange for sharing my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I guess I will keep it in my purse just for emergencies, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
      <li>I was really excited about trying it, as I don&#x27;t often buy makeup from stores since I can&#x27;t try it before buying it.  </li>
      <li>~ If I find the perfect balance--not to much, not too little, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;crinkle\\&quot;.   </li>
      <li>After the 2nd use, the darker color was easier to apply, making it look more like a smoky eye, rather than looking like I had been beat up!  </li>
      <li>The 2nd time, it looked a lot better!</li>
      <li>I tried all the color combinations of this, and while I loved the idea of it, I didn&#x27;t actually like too much about</li>
      <li>Is it worth buying?</li>
      <li>Right?</li>
      <li>The day I received it, I tried it right away.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying to learn how to do a smoky eye, and never could get it just right.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice as you apply the first color, but the second color doesn&#x27;t really go on very well over the first.  </li>
      <li>I would be willing to try this product again, perhaps in another color.</li>
      <li>I love the color (I got the brown color), but that&#x27;s the only thing I like.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product, but definitely did not like the execution.</li>
      <li>I know that can be a problem for many women with an oily lid with all different types of shadows.</li>
      <li>Hmm, ok, same problem with the pigment.</li>
      <li>First let me say that I am a Buzzagent.  </li>
      <li>The first day, I used it without the primer.</li>
      <li>But for those who really like a bold look, this won&#x27;t really do it for you(unless</li>
      <li>Besides its nice and easy to have  smoey eye for any occasion either its a girls night out or for any occasion .I really had  fun playing with the different effects and options that this single product afforded me to try.</li>
      <li>since I felt my lid were becoming all dark and not the light silver.    </li>
      <li>I would have loved a deep peacock blue with a gold or bronze.</li>
      <li>I recieved this product from bzzcampaign ,I have been using it since i recieved ,so far so good ,I can create a smokey eye within a few seconds and it saves time ,its so wuick and easy to do the professional</li>
      <li>If I put powder on my eyes first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to crease as much.  </li>
      <li>its really exciting so far loving this product and i will be buying diferrent other colors too.</li>
      <li>really like to concept and colors</li>
      <li>~ It gets crinkly if too much is put on  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t rim my eyes as much as I like.     </li>
      <li>I received this product as a Buzz Agent and really like how it works.  </li>
      <li>Several times a day I have to smooth out the shadow with my finger</li>
      <li>~ The secondary color did do a good job in my eyelid crease, helping define my eye  </li>
      <li>~ There is a good amount of product and even after it broke, if I keep it down low enough, I can still use it  ~ It stays put and doesn&#x27;t wear off easily    </li>
      <li>I was really excited about the shadowblast sticks -- double ended for ease of use, just glide it on</li>
      <li>I love all the colors-especially silver and pink!  </li>
      <li>Using it on it&#x27;s own is very 80&#x27;s looking, but using the white as a highlight with other shadows is nice, or just the black alone as liner.</li>
      <li>When I \\&quot;scrolled\\&quot; the Onyx, the black part fell off the container without the need of even touching it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for girls with a heavy hand, as the colors are quite sheer, which I like.</li>
      <li>, ok, it doesn&#x27;t like my everyday primer.</li>
      <li>last issue was that I didn&#x27;t think the color combinations were very modern.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the color once I manage to get it on, but I&#x27;m not pleased with how it wears.    </li>
      <li>However, the color is vivid and has a lot of sparkle and shine.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and eyes.</li>
      <li>Really convenient to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The step 1 gray color is not obvious on the lid</li>
      <li>Creased, but just a bit near the corners.</li>
      <li>It creased and then disappeared completely within an hour.</li>
      <li>The dark color is too similar to the light color</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely careful with my stuff and very gentle with my make up.</li>
      <li>end result looked pretty tacky (in both sense of the word) and not very smoky.  </li>
      <li>Pressure must be used and multiple passes with the stick are necessary, which pull on the lid too much.    </li>
      <li>Maybe, if I used a primer for the eyelids, it would work better, but, alas, I don&#x27;t have one.</li>
      <li>First of all, as the previous user stated, this shadow will crease.</li>
      <li>The other 3 parts (the white from the onyx and both sides of the silver sky) fell after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> The purple(purple plume) was too pink and made me look like I had pink eye while the powder blue(tempest blue) is like going back to the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ones I did like</li>
<li> purple(silver sky)which has a little glitter in the grey so it does tend to be young looking the champagne/</li>
<li> Reminded me of being 10 and putting on cheesy cheap eyeshadow.</li>
<li> Plus, the color stays on all day long....</li>
<li> What about my special occasion primer (read expensive junk bought at Sephora)?</li>
<li> And I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this product is super lame.</li>
<li> It does crease a little, but I do like the overall look and control of the stick.  </li>
<li> I will continue to use these colors despite the downfalls, and just will be careful not to apply them to the crease.</li>
<li> And second, after a few uses, the pencil parts on both ends broke off.</li>
<li> Thought maybe I was the only one with a heavy hand, but it appears this is the one flaw.  </li>
<li> Also, with only using it a few times, the shadow snapped off at the bottom and came out of the tube all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The color I picked (and received) was not really what I expected.  </li>
<li> It is by far the worst product I have tried and it was a waste of good money.</li>
<li> I am going to try the other colors the Covergirl has to offer.</li>
<li> When I first saw this product on ANTM, i thought it was lame.</li>
<li> I gave it a second chance, first with my NYX Eyeshadow base in white</li>
<li> Not worth spending money on.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t have dark lines when my eyes are shut.      </li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t be so upset if it were a couple of bucks, but it&#x27;s not worth the six to eight dollars the stores charge for it.</li>
<li> Thumbs down.</li>
<li> I know less than 4 hours might not be little for you, but I want and am used to having my eye make up lasting at least 6 hours without having to touch</li>
<li> Faded out in less than 4 hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received this product from bzzagent. The shadow is difficult to apply and pulls at your eyelids when you rub it on, almost a little painful. It creases, and does not go on very dark. Not worth spending money on.</li>
    <li> I received this as a bzzagent and have a love-hate relationship with it.     What I hate:    ~ It was hard to start, as in, there seemed to be dry film over it that kept it from going onto my eye lid  ~ It broke on the second usage  ~ It gets crinkly if too much is put on  ~ It&#x27;s hard to make the secondary color look like an actual liner. It didn&#x27;t rim my eyes as much as I like.     What I love:    ~ Once the color went on my eyelid, I really liked the smoky lideffect. It was great for a night out with my husband  ~ If I find the perfect balance--not to much, not too little, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;crinkle\\&quot;.   ~ The secondary color did do a good job in my eyelid crease, helping define my eye  ~ There is a good amount of product and even after it broke, if I keep it down low enough, I can still use it  ~ It stays put and doesn&#x27;t wear off easily    Is it worth buying? If you had a coupon, coupled with a sale, it would be. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it at full price but it is a nice product to have on hand for a night out look, if you can get it at a discounted price.</li>
    <li> First let me say that I am a Buzzagent.  I do NOT get paid but I did receive my sample of Covergirl for free in exchange for sharing my opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like to concept and colors this product has to offer.  However, I was unstaisfied with it performance.  After just a couple of uses the colors broke and fell out of the holder.  I also found that the eye make-up was bad to settle into the creases after several hours of wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Covergirl is able to fix these problems as I do love the product and would be willing to give it another try!</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed in this product! I love the color (I got the brown color), but that&#x27;s the only thing I like. First of all, as the previous user stated, this shadow will crease. Even after I put on eyeshadow primer on my eyelids, when I put the darker color in the crease, it creased to the lower part of my eyelid after an hour or so. I can&#x27;t even get the darker color to look like a liner on me, which is also disappointing. And second, after a few uses, the pencil parts on both ends broke off. I was extremely disgusted for having wasted $6 on a product that didn&#x27;t even live up to its promise of giving me a smoky shadow blast!</li>
    <li> Item was not as great as I thought it would be. Reminded me of being 10 and putting on cheesy cheap eyeshadow. Thumbs down. I won&#x27;t ever use this, it was a waste of money :(</li>
    <li> I was really excited about the shadowblast sticks -- double ended for ease of use, just glide it on and you&#x27;re done. Right? I tried all the color combinations of this, and while I loved the idea of it, I didn&#x27;t actually like too much about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for girls with a heavy hand, as the colors are quite sheer, which I like. But for those who really like a bold look, this won&#x27;t really do it for you(unless you get the black/white stick). Once I had the base color on, the liner color didn&#x27;t go on smoothly and was hard to smudge and get it to integrate into the base rather then just completely rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem: the shadow creases. I have dry/regular eyelids, so I was shocked to see it had creased after 2 or so hours. I know that can be a problem for many women with an oily lid with all different types of shadows. But for me, a shadow has ever creased on me in my lifetime. Also, with only using it a few times, the shadow snapped off at the bottom and came out of the tube all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last issue was that I didn&#x27;t think the color combinations were very modern. What is up with the lime green/rust(citrus flair) pairing? I don&#x27;t think these colors go together at all! I would have loved a deep peacock blue with a gold or bronze. The purple(purple plume) was too pink and made me look like I had pink eye while the powder blue(tempest blue) is like going back to the 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ones I did like was the grey/purple(silver sky)which has a little glitter in the grey so it does tend to be young looking the champagne/chocolate(bronze fire)which are great neutrals for work, and while not together, I do like the black/white(onyx smoke). Using it on it&#x27;s own is very 80&#x27;s looking, but using the white as a highlight with other shadows is nice, or just the black alone as liner. I will continue to use these colors despite the downfalls, and just will be careful not to apply them to the crease.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product from bzzcampaign ,I have been using it since i recieved ,so far so good ,I can create a smokey eye within a few seconds and it saves time ,its so wuick and easy to do the professional look.the only thing is just dont rub your eyes when you are wearing this shadow otherwise it will make itchy eyes.Besides its nice and easy to have  smoey eye for any occasion either its a girls night out or for any occasion .I really had  fun playing with the different effects and options that this single product afforded me to try. its really exciting so far loving this product and i will be buying diferrent other colors too.</li>
    <li> The color combo&#x27;s are great and the idea is a good one....BUT Its like trying to put on eye shadow with lip stick. The application sucks. Mine broke off at the base right away and became un-useable. The color&#x27;s faded with in a hour and creased also within the hour. It is by far the worst product I have tried and it was a waste of good money. I love Cover Girl products but this one failed big time for me.  The color faded so bad that within 3 hrs it didnt even look like I had applied anything...it creased and disappeared all together.</li>
    <li> I too received this as a Buzz Agent.   I didn&#x27;t have a problem with creasing, but I almost always use a primer anyhow.  It allowed me to get that smokey eye look in just a minute and it looked great.  However, I did have to go over several times to build up the color.  I would agree that it can break easily, as mine did!  I salvaged what I could, because this works great for me when I am running out of time!  Thought maybe I was the only one with a heavy hand, but it appears this is the one flaw.  For the price and speed, I would recommend.  Just use a light touch and build layers!  It still is a lot faster (and less messy) than using  powders!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a Buzz Agent and really like how it works.  The color I picked (and received) was not really what I expected.  It is a little dark for my skin tone.  However, the color is vivid and has a lot of sparkle and shine.  It does crease a little, but I do like the overall look and control of the stick.  If I put powder on my eyes first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to crease as much.  I am going to try the other colors the Covergirl has to offer.</li>
    <li> Great product and price with fast shipping</li>
    <li> I received this product as a tester for BzzAgent. I was really excited about trying it, as I don&#x27;t often buy makeup from stores since I can&#x27;t try it before buying it.  I tried it on as soon as I got it.  I&#x27;m pleased with the color once I manage to get it on, but I&#x27;m not pleased with how it wears.    I agree with other reviews that the lighter color is difficult to apply. Pressure must be used and multiple passes with the stick are necessary, which pull on the lid too much.    I followed the directions for application with applying the darker color in the crease of my eye lid.  I eventually stopped doing that since I felt my lid were becoming all dark and not the light silver.    I also found that the shadow collects in my lid creases.  Several times a day I have to smooth out the shadow with my finger so I don&#x27;t have dark lines when my eyes are shut.      I would be willing to try this product again, perhaps in another color.</li>
    <li> So, it looks like such a GREAT idea. Indeed, it is, but the product itself is terrible! So I bought 2 of these, the Silver Sky and the Onyx at my local CVS when it was on sale and guess, what? Even paying 75% of the total price for each, I still regret spending 13 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging feels very cheap, and even though I think is the perfect size to go my purse, it just feels like it&#x27;s going to break at any moment. I&#x27;m extremely careful with my stuff and very gentle with my make up. When I \\&quot;scrolled\\&quot; the Onyx, the black part fell off the container without the need of even touching it. The other 3 parts (the white from the onyx and both sides of the silver sky) fell after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I told myself \\&quot;deal with it\\&quot;, so I made an effort and used the sticks anyway. The first day, I used it without the primer. I found it was  not pigmented at all. I had to make an effort to get the product out and make the color stand out. The worse part is that 45 minutes later it had faded out to a little oily stain on my eyes (and no, I don&#x27;t have oily lids). The remaining product was bunched together on my crease! TERRIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it a second chance, first with my NYX Eyeshadow base in white (also have the skin tone one), since I wanted the color to stand out and guess what? I still had to put effort to firm the color and it still creased and even though it didn&#x27;t fade out as badly, it was out of my lids in 2 hours. It also looked very oily and shiny in a bad way. I went to the gym that they and it melted, which never happened when I use my Coastal Scents eyeshadows with NYX primer or even my LA Colors 12 palette I bought for 99 cents at the dollar store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured, ok, it doesn&#x27;t like my everyday primer. What about my special occasion primer (read expensive junk bought at Sephora)? I tried with my Urban Decay Primer Potion. Hmm, ok, same problem with the pigment. Creased, but just a bit near the corners. Faded out in less than 4 hours. I know less than 4 hours might not be little for you, but I want and am used to having my eye make up lasting at least 6 hours without having to touch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product EVER. If you want an smokey eye and want it to be portable, seriously, buy a small palette and get mini brushes because this product is GARBAGE!ours might not be little for you, but I want and am used to having my eye make up lasting at least 6 hours without having to touch up.

    <li> When I first saw this product on ANTM, i thought it was lame. But I got the chance to try it so I did. And I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that this product is super lame. The dark color is too similar to the light color so there is no drama. maybe the brown/beige would be better. I don&#x27;t like how hard the product is to apply, meaning how hard you have to push. it makes me worry about giving myself wrinkles, and it actually hurt. I guess I will keep it in my purse just for emergencies, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
    <li> I tried this product through a Bzzz campaign. I&#x27;ve been dying to learn how to do a smoky eye, and never could get it just right.  I was excited to try this product!  The day I received it, I tried it right away. At first, I was disappointed, my eyes looked like I had been punched in the face. I washed it off, and decided to try again.  The 2nd time, it looked a lot better! The color i tried was Silver Sky.  After the 2nd use, the darker color was easier to apply, making it look more like a smoky eye, rather than looking like I had been beat up!  Now I&#x27;m excited to try another color!</li>
    <li> Updating my review because the colors in each side are broken to the point where you can not use them unless you drop them out of the slot.  This is upsetting as they really are (or were) one of my very favorite products.</li>
    <li> I love the way my eyes look with this cream based eye shadow! Plus, the color stays on all day long....Woot!  Note: I have sensitive skin and eyes. This makeup did not irritate my eyes. I love all the colors-especially silver and pink!  My daily mascara: [[ASIN:B004Y4JNZ6 Covergirl Natureluxe Mousse Mascara, Very Black 500, 0.27-Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Great for a base for doing a smoky eye and it helps last all day and makes the smoky eye very dramatic.</li>
    <li> I got it yesterday (Silver Sky color). It creased and then disappeared completely within an hour. I am truly disappointed in this. Maybe, if I used a primer for the eyelids, it would work better, but, alas, I don&#x27;t have one. I wouldn&#x27;t be so upset if it were a couple of bucks, but it&#x27;s not worth the six to eight dollars the stores charge for it.</li>
    <li> I bought the silver color.  It feels nice as you apply the first color, but the second color doesn&#x27;t really go on very well over the first.  It kind of just smudges around.  With both ends of the stick, I felt I had to go over and over and over my lid to get any color on there. I ended up with the darker shade caked into my lashes and none actually on my lash line! It also creased up fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result looked pretty tacky (in both sense of the word) and not very smoky.  I love the idea of this product, but definitely did not like the execution.</li>
    <li> v  very good and acomplish my expectative v v v v v v v v v v v v v v</li>
    <li> Really convenient to put on.&lt;br /&gt;The step 1 gray color is not obvious on the lid even when you put a lot on it, which is good coz I don&#x27;t want heavy smoky eyes.</li>
