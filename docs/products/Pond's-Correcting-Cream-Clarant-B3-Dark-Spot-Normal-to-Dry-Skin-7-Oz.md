      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this because it did help my blemishes fade.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and before bed for almost four weeks and while it seems to be an okay for moisture there has been no improvement in fading the brown spots.</li>
      <li>i have used for 2 weeks and my face does feel smoother and more even toned.</li>
      <li>So i am already pleased with it..</li>
      <li>so I am sure this all helps&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my favorite face lotion</li>
      <li>i am so glad i did.</li>
      <li>I use in on the top of hands also.</li>
      <li>At first it caused pimples, but i decided to stick it out because i have heard so many good things about it-- and man</li>
      <li>have pretty good skin turgor for my age</li>
      <li>Priced right too!!</li>
      <li>It does not apply easily (i.e. it does not spread and soak into the skin well</li>
      <li>And the smell is strong.</li>
      <li>Guess best way get rid dark spots stay out of the sun.</li>
      <li>Its the perfect non-heavy moisture that my face needed, and the kick-butt dark spot correcting too!</li>
      <li>Furthermore, this is a great product considering that a jar can last for about 6 months.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing that my skin reacted very well in this product.</li>
      <li>All I want is to have a smooth and toned skin.</li>
      <li>The good was it did keep my skin soft.  </li>
      <li>Its very handy to use it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Original ponds in the jar is way too greasy for me.</li>
      <li>and my skin is super smooth</li>
      <li>could not really see a great difference</li>
      <li>I have tried many products over the years and none really made a difference until this Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3 came out</li>
      <li>I am still looking natural but brighter and more smooth skin..</li>
      <li>Better than the high price alternatives.</li>
      <li>The first day I used it my skin begun to feel smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>good face cream for dry skin?</li>
      <li>It sloughs off some dead skin when you begin using it which is great, it&#x27;s exfoliating.</li>
      <li>Ponds clarant is five stars worth</li>
      <li>Great Product and arrived early enough</li>
      <li>Wuickly absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>Light scent, not thick or greasy.</li>
      <li>and I could not find out a quantity higher than 7 oz.</li>
      <li>this is the only face cream that helps my skin look and feel better.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying similar product from Clinique and worked so much better.</li>
      <li>First i&#x27;ll give you some background:</li>
      <li>I have extremely dry skin, I was hoping for more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Love the cream will continue to use it, recommend this cream to use for dry skin</li>
      <li>It may not work as well for others but it has certainly made a believer out of me.</li>
      <li>WOW it does EXACTLY what it says it does!</li>
      <li>I could really see visible difference in look and feel of my skin just after 1 week.  </li>
      <li>And moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have texture to it and its very runny, also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Paid way too much.</li>
      <li>absorbs very well</li>
      <li>and I feel that it really does not do what it says it does.  </li>
      <li>and i don&#x27;t break out as much when using this product.</li>
      <li>This really works to diminish brown(aging) spots.</li>
      <li>I was using the Clinque dark spot corrector for a while, but it wasnt working good enough</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>A little whiter may be ok.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, I would avoid dry areas and stuck with the original Pond&#x27;s for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels smooth on my face and removes rough spots on my hands.  </li>
      <li>and I must say, this \\&quot;Normal to Dry\\&quot; dried my skin even more and made it flaky.  </li>
      <li>I live this product.</li>
      <li>Cannot recommend to anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would help even out skin tone and spots, but I am near 3/4 done with the jar and no difference.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps skin soft, but that wasn&#x27;t why I bought it.</li>
      <li>Iam liking it so far</li>
      <li>So far I like the product and will continue using just for the moisturizing effect without a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>my skin is sensitive to everything and leaves some  spots after acne.</li>
      <li>Product provides a basic moisturizer at a reasonable price and didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  </li>
      <li>The cream was OK didn&#x27;t help dark spots and seen it later at Target for about same price..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought this and used for quite awhile and never did a thing, waste of money in my opinion.  I ended up buying similar product from Clinique and worked so much better.</li>
    <li> this product is excellent . while watching Dr. OZ, he mentioned that all skin needs to look healthier ,more radiant is vitamin B&#x27;s especiall vitamin B3. check out Oil of Olay they also have this ingredient in their products but ponds is less expensive and feels great on your skin.it absorbs very well and  you get more for your money.</li>
    <li> Just a basic moisturizer, no improvement on even skin tone or lighter brown spot.  Will not recommend to people and I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> my wife loves Pond they make Excellent products, and great for your skin, she just made me purchase another set....  Excellent quality recommend 5 stars</li>
    <li> The cream was OK didn&#x27;t help dark spots and seen it later at Target for about same price..Guess best way get rid dark spots stay out of the sun.</li>
    <li> Product provides a basic moisturizer at a reasonable price and didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  Giving it two stars for that.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement in skin discoloration.  Also, it made my eyes tear up and my nose run.  Cannot recommend to anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Pond&#x27;s cream smells very clean and nice.  It feels smooth on my face and removes rough spots on my hands.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this Pond&#x27;s Cream for several months now.  I had bought the small sample size before I found this larger size on Amazon.  This is the first time I have found a cream to help lighten the dark spots on my face.  I have tried many products over the years and none really made a difference until this Pond&#x27;s Clarant B3 came out and I tried it.  It may not work as well for others but it has certainly made a believer out of me.</li>
    <li> works great, i have dry skin and i like they way it makes it feel</li>
    <li> good face cream for dry skin? Love the cream will continue to use it, recommend this cream to use for dry skin</li>
    <li> All I can say about this is, my mom liked it. It was a gift to her. She has always been a fan of Ponds creams.</li>
    <li> The first day I used it my skin begun to feel smooth and silky. It&#x27;s amazing that my skin reacted very well in this product. Amazing and wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m already noticing that my dark spots are fading and it&#x27;s a wonderful moisturizer. It sloughs off some dead skin when you begin using it which is great, it&#x27;s exfoliating. Then it&#x27;s just great to keep skin supple and moist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every morning and before bed for almost four weeks and while it seems to be an okay for moisture there has been no improvement in fading the brown spots. I will try something else.</li>
    <li> i have used for 2 weeks and my face does feel smoother and more even toned.As far as dark spots the product says 4 weeks so I am waiting to see if they diminish.So far I like the product and will continue using just for the moisturizing effect without a greasy feel.</li>
    <li> Keeps skin soft, but that wasn&#x27;t why I bought it. No difference in lightening of dark spots after six weeks usage</li>
    <li> I love this because it did help my blemishes fade. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is whitening my face now my face is a shade lighter than the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> I only used this product over 3 weeks. Its very handy to use it as my daily moisturizer. I like the texture. The smell is nice. Its thin and not making my face oily. Wuickly absorbed into my skin. I had been using every day after each time I washed my face with Kojic soap. My face is already brighter. I am still looking natural but brighter and more smooth skin.. I am not in a rush to turn into caucasian over night. By the way I am an Asian. All I want is to have a smooth and toned skin. A little whiter may be ok. I live this product. I am using a few product at a different time in a day ie- Nadinola cream in the night, Kojic Papaya soap in the morning and evening, Ponds clarant in the morning ang evening, Snow white cream in between ! I am getting slightly fairer.. My hyperpigmented skin still remain there, but looking lighter. I only started all this product since 15 October.. So i am already pleased with it..</li>
    <li> I had a deep red discoloration on my neck. After using this product for only two weeks the area was noticeably lighter in color. Great product</li>
    <li> Marvelous! !!! I love it. Everything perfect: The product, the service, etc. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Ponds products are Very good.  This one especifically, seems to be working, but a little bit slowly. However I understand that there are different kinds of dark spots...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do not like is that it is difficult to find out the product in the stores and I could not find out a quantity higher than 7 oz.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t lighted any dark spots.  The good was it did keep my skin soft.  No difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
    <li> execentt product&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> This lotion is hard to find in stores, thank goodness for Amazon. It is a really nice lotion too. Smells nice, feels great on the skin. Priced right too!!</li>
    <li> I misunderstood and thought I was getting 2 for this price.  Look elsewhere for a much better price.  It looks suspcious in that someone took a marker to it and crossed out information in black ink.  Very unhappy with this.  Paid way too much.</li>
    <li> Original ponds in the jar is way too greasy for me. And the smell is strong. But this stuff is great. Light scent, not thick or greasy. And moisturizes very well. perfect face cream. Can&#x27;t say how it works on dark spots, since I haven used it for that long.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product at Target.  Price is good and it is a nice consistency cream.  That&#x27;s about it!  It does not apply easily (i.e. it does not spread and soak into the skin well, you tend to just rub it in and it will be in that area only). I am kind of disappointed with Pond&#x27;s this time around.  I thought this would help even out skin tone and spots, but I am near 3/4 done with the jar and no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a bit of combination skin and I must say, this \\&quot;Normal to Dry\\&quot; dried my skin even more and made it flaky.  Especially on my forehead.  I don&#x27;t know why, considering I do not have sensitive facial skin in the least.  Anyhow, I would avoid dry areas and stuck with the original Pond&#x27;s for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 stars are for the price and smell/consistency.  Other than that, I would not buy this again and I feel that it really does not do what it says it does.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer but didn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 months now and my skin at 51 is looking better than ever.</li>
    <li> Iam liking it so far I just had it for a week.</li>
    <li> Cream is very thin and does not seem to cover dark spots.</li>
    <li> my favorite face lotion</li>
    <li> I could really see visible difference in look and feel of my skin just after 1 week.  I intend to keep using it till the dark spots on my back are all cleared; I use it for my face and neck too. Great Product and arrived early enough</li>
    <li> This product worked so well with my skin !! my skin is sensitive to everything and leaves some  spots after acne. I started using this cream two weeks ago and my skin is clearing up, it also does not leave my skin oily which is a plus!, For best results I used a Biore face wash when I wake up and before bed, then I applied the cream!. Ponds clarant is five stars worth</li>
    <li> This really works to diminish brown(aging) spots. I use in on the top of hands also. Better than the high price alternatives.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, I was hoping for more moisturizing. The price is great, but I was slightly disappointed in the product. I have been using it for 3-4 weeks and it has done little. Not sure if I would recommend it to mature skin.</li>
    <li> Best product ever. You never go wrong with Ponds. I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> Best creme for clear skin. Vanishes pimples. I apply it to anyplace in my body and gives clear results the following day. Also weeks in- brighter and radiant skin. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was using the Clinque dark spot corrector for a while, but it wasnt working good enough, it was too expensive $60 for like a 1 oz bottle? I saw this product on Amazon and I decided to buy it at Wal-Mart.  WOW it does EXACTLY what it says it does! My dark spots cleared up after two weeks of using ot twice a day. Its inexpensive and it&#x27;s an abundant amount..7oz, results inexpensive vs. Clinque or any other popular brand  1oz or less and too expensive.  Get this product it will work!</li>
    <li> es una crema muy buena,yo amo usarla a diario ,es maravilosa y de buena calidad,gracias a mazon por darnos a todos la oportunidad de adquirir muchisimos productos sin riesgo de q se pierdan o sean de mala calidad.</li>
    <li> BEST, REALLY MADE A DIFFERENCE</li>
    <li> this is the only face cream that helps my skin look and feel better. i have really bad acne due to health reasons and this actually helps clear them up and i don&#x27;t break out as much when using this product. would reccomend to anyone looking for clearer  skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product no more age spots, they disappeared !!!</li>
    <li> Terrible! Doesn&#x27;t really have texture to it and its very runny, also doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I am not one to waste time writing reviews however this product deserves one. First i&#x27;ll give you some background: I Have bad acne dark scars all over my face from previous pimples and blackheads. Bad meaning that i will not dare step foot out of my house without make up on. I have indian brown skin that is normal-dry depending on weather. I needed a product that could base for makeup, provide moisture for my face, and correct dark spots/improve skin overall. Before using this, my face was rough (even when using Fruit Garnier&#x27;s dark spot corrector which stopped working like halfway through the tube) with dark noticable marks. About two weeks into this and my skin is super smooth, my foundation glides right over this, and i can actually see my dark marks fading. I can say that now i am wearing much less make up and i feel much more confident! Im not saying that this clearned everything and my skin is perfect, but in less than a month i see good improvement. Furthermore, this is a great product considering that a jar can last for about 6 months. At first it caused pimples, but i decided to stick it out because i have heard so many good things about it-- and man i am so glad i did. I am sure this progress will continue because my skin literally feels better ever time i use this baby! Its the perfect non-heavy moisture that my face needed, and the kick-butt dark spot correcting too!</li>
    <li> It Works so good, and it is the perfect cream for me. i recommend it 100 percent because it works..........</li>
    <li> could not really see a great difference&lt;br /&gt;I use many things on my face so I am sure this all helps&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty good skin turgor for my age but I do not think this makes a difference on the average face</li>
