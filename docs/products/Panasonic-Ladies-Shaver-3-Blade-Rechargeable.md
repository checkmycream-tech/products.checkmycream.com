      <li>Did not realize what a great difference it would make to replace my 10 year old shaver.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Really does a nice job</li>
      <li>I have used this twice and have experienced razor burn only in the bikini area, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that.</li>
      <li>Important not to nick.</li>
      <li>bought it as a birthday present because of  the good reviews.</li>
      <li>The first lasted a while(9 months or so), but the foil razor part bent easily and now it no longer will charge.</li>
      <li>But for use on my legs, it is quick, painless no razor burn</li>
      <li>Light weight and will give you a nice smooth shave..wet or dry.</li>
      <li>My legs are very smooth (almost as good as shaving with a regular razor in the shower) and the razor is surprisingly quiet.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I like this shaver very much; prefer it for shaving my legs over a razor, and it can be used in the shower as well.  </li>
      <li>The new version of the old Remington she had did not have near as good reviews.</li>
      <li>The multiple passes quick or slow does the best, and of course, takes the longest.</li>
      <li>I actually have only used it dry and it works perfectly.</li>
      <li>I need to use this longer to see how long the blades last with a good shave.</li>
      <li>I thought this shaver was part of the free postage deal through Amazon when ordering over a certain amount of merchandise, but it ended up costing me the same amount as the shaver for handling and postage.  </li>
      <li>Drier shave was better than a wet shave.</li>
      <li>but it runs out of battery really fast.</li>
      <li>Shaves really close.</li>
      <li>I really like this shaver.  </li>
      <li>Recommend highly!</li>
      <li>This does give me as smooth as a shave as a regular razor, however I have an issue with razor burn</li>
      <li>I tried the several quick passes method, then the slower passes, then wetter, then drier.</li>
      <li>Its noise level seems reasonable to me for such a small object doing a good job of hair removal.  </li>
      <li>the actual color of the item is a bright pink - almost red.</li>
      <li>The charger is very convenient as it plugs directly into the wall outlet</li>
      <li>Nice small handle!</li>
      <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t dare try it on more delicate parts.</li>
      <li>Nice and sharp, clean, quicker shave than the old one that became dull.  </li>
      <li>But it is nothing like the color on the website which looks like a light wine or dark lavender -</li>
      <li>I like it very much and such an improvement of my old one.  </li>
      <li>I tried the old blade on the new one and the front blade didn&#x27;t work with it either.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>One drawback is that the charger holds the shaver sideways and does not feel very stable like it would in a different position.  </li>
      <li>This was such a disappointment as Panasonic has always been a good brand.</li>
      <li>Much nicer than my previous name brand shaver.</li>

<li> Poor design overall.</li>
<li> and when the battery went down there was no way to change it, unbelievable.</li>
<li> It works, but it is not better than a disposable.  </li>
<li> Waterproof, doesn&#x27;t pinch her while using it, slick design, not to expensive, and there&#x27;s not an annoying cord!</li>
<li> Impossible to maintain in upright position with extension cord.</li>
<li> Sorry, my bad!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
<li> Nicks and terrible razor burn.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Seems to be working well!</li>
    <li> Perfect!  It holds a charge for over 2 weeks and she s very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it as a birthday present because of  the good reviews. The new version of the old Remington she had did not have near as good reviews.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp, clean, quicker shave than the old one that became dull.  One thing about the Panasonics, however, the battery lasts forever and holds a long charge even when the rest of the unit no longer works well.</li>
    <li> Husband bought this for me as I have tried ALOT of shavers. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Close shave. Convenient.</li>
    <li> It works, but it is not better than a disposable.  Good for a quick shave if you forgot to do it in the shower.  It can be used wet or dry.</li>
    <li> love it! Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  No knicking, pulling, etc...good power. Recommend highly!</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Light weight and will give you a nice smooth shave..wet or dry. The charger is very convenient as it plugs directly into the wall outlet</li>
    <li> Love it! Shaves really close.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver.  It gives me close shave.  I have not used it in the shower, only used dry.  I just wish that it was lighter.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this.</li>
    <li> I like it very much and such an improvement of my old one.  It&#x27;s so quiet when operating too.</li>
    <li> does not shave close enough, takes a lot of time to shave legs, have to go slowwww.</li>
    <li> My wife needed it and loves it.</li>
    <li> Fair price good product</li>
    <li> Shaver is great. Downrated because of inadequate charger/stand with no power cord. Stand is small unstable cube with male prongs which must be either plugged directly into wall or into an extension cord.  Impossible to maintain in upright position with extension cord.</li>
    <li> i love this but it runs out of battery really fast.</li>
    <li> I have know choice but to rate this item with five stars! If there was a rating scal from 1 - 10, this would be a 12. What? There&#x27;s know 12 between 1 &amp; 10? Now I know why I always come up short 2 numbers when I count my fingers!</li>
    <li> Did not realize what a great difference it would make to replace my 10 year old shaver.  This razer is priced right and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Love it, Makes close shaves.</li>
    <li> A great razor. Cuts close and doesn&#x27;t pinch</li>
    <li> Gives the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor and is cheaper than others I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I need to use this longer to see how long the blades last with a good shave. It&#x27;s for bikini area only. Important not to nick.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver.  I have never owned an electric shaver.  I have yet to use it very much , but it was very effective when I shaved.  Easy to use.  One drawback is that the charger holds the shaver sideways and does not feel very stable like it would in a different position.  It is plugged into the outlet and the shaver is plugged into that.  I would modify that if I was the inventor .  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars..</li>
    <li> Works great. Would recommend</li>
    <li> The best shaver for the price!  It works great, and is comfortable to hold.  I had the earlier model for several years, so when the battery no longer worked, I bought this one.  I am completely happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is useful and works good.</li>
    <li> My Panasonic Shaver is very smooth, I love it.  Much nicer than my previous name brand shaver.</li>
    <li> Returning shaver. It took 4x longer to use this shaver than a razor. I tried the several quick passes method, then the slower passes, then wetter, then drier. The multiple passes quick or slow does the best, and of course, takes the longest. Drier shave was better than a wet shave. I was looking for a quick, effective shave. It does not come anywhere close to a razor shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a surprise, hers didn&#x27;t really work well at all, and she said it&#x27;s perfect. Waterproof, doesn&#x27;t pinch her while using it, slick design, not to expensive, and there&#x27;s not an annoying cord!</li>
    <li> Love this razor!  My legs are very smooth (almost as good as shaving with a regular razor in the shower) and the razor is surprisingly quiet.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always prepared to to receive a product that is not up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, this shaver met my expectations and exceeded them.  So far, I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve only had it a short time.  Another six months will tell.</li>
    <li> First the good news!  I like this shaver very much; prefer it for shaving my legs over a razor, and it can be used in the shower as well.  Its noise level seems reasonable to me for such a small object doing a good job of hair removal.  I gave it 5 stars because it does everything as advertised on Amazon.  Now, for the bad news, which technically I must blame myself for not being more diligent about mailing costs.  I thought this shaver was part of the free postage deal through Amazon when ordering over a certain amount of merchandise, but it ended up costing me the same amount as the shaver for handling and postage.  So, beware of that. Since I live outside of the contiguous U.S., my state seems to get dinged for higher postage costs, and some sellers prefer not to send their merchandise through the U.S. Postal Service, which would have been less expensive than UPS.  Other than that, I would buy this Panasonic shaver again, only next time I&#x27;ll go to a local store.  Sorry, my bad!</li>
    <li> Wish it gave a closer shave, but it&#x27;s a nice shaver.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Returning this.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t try the shaver so I have no idea how good it is although it got good reviews which is why I purchased it.  But it is nothing like the color on the website which looks like a light wine or dark lavender - the actual color of the item is a bright pink - almost red.</li>
    <li> The shaver ended up being a lot nicer than I expected.  It does a great job, easy to clean and recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> very happy with this razor</li>
    <li> This was such a disappointment as Panasonic has always been a good brand. Tried it wet and dry, tried minimal and harder pressure. Nicks and terrible razor burn. Tried on stubble and on longer hair. Longer hair felt like it was being just ripped out of my skin. I do not have sensitive skin. I certainly didn&#x27;t dare try it on more delicate parts. Poor design overall. Didn&#x27;t even come with a cleaning brush or oil for cleaning. I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for years and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Works great, convient, and great price.</li>
    <li> Works perfect!  Nice small handle!</li>
    <li> Love it. I&#x27;m old school and have dermatitis on one leg so must be careful. It is very quiet, shaves close, and is perfect for me. I have had one before and loved it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these. The first lasted a while(9 months or so), but the foil razor part bent easily and now it no longer will charge. With the second, the front blade stopped going, no idea why. I tried the old blade on the new one and the front blade didn&#x27;t work with it either.</li>
    <li> Really does a nice job</li>
    <li> This shaver works well, and is a good price.  I purchased another shaver on line which was battery operated and when the battery went down there was no way to change it, unbelievable.</li>
    <li> This does give me as smooth as a shave as a regular razor, however I have an issue with razor burn and I can only use the shick quatro razors on my legs. Even then I still occasionally get razor burn. I have used this twice and have experienced razor burn only in the bikini area, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that. But for use on my legs, it is quick, painless no razor burn and I don&#x27;t need to use any sort of shaving cream or gel. I actually have only used it dry and it works perfectly.</li>
