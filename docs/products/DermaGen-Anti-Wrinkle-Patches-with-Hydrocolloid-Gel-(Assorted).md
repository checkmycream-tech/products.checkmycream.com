<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are amazing! I used to order the paper wrinkle patches from another company, but these I don&#x27;t have to wet down and the edges don&#x27;t curl up when I sleep.I have used them for about 6 months. I can  re use them over and over and they cut easily to fit where I need them. Best of all..... they work great!</li>
    <li> I just like to reduce the wrinkle for my smile line and between eye at first time.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered with frownies and DernaGen. I tried frownies first. for frownies, I always get a red on the skin when i take it off even I used water for taking off.&lt;br /&gt;But DermaGen isn&#x27;t get heart to take off and it was so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Also frownies take my sebum also. I like that, but my pore size much bigger and some pimple came out. I was no idea why my face looks dirty first time, but It was because of frownies. But wrinkle was reduced by frownies, so I just like to take rest of frownies for a moment. And I started to use for Dermagen. And I felt kind of upset. Because This is much better than frownies, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermagen didn&#x27;t get my skin hearts and It was so comfortable on my face also It effected to my skin younger. First time, I just used for my smile line and forehead between eyes, but right now, I put this for my pore size reduce and also my nose to reduce my blackheads. Thus I put this on my trouble spot. For me, It take very long time to kill the pimple, but If I put this to kill my pimple, It&#x27;s only one week is maximum. I am kind of big fan of this dermagen. If CosmeSearch,Inc make the Dermagen for whole face, I am gonna buy for that. please make more bigger and variety size that can cover for whole face please</li>
    <li> So- these are ok-- a bit easier to use than Frownies.  They shipped quickly, but I didn&#x27;t like how they were package (an envelope).&lt;br /&gt;They claim to be reusable, but I had a hard time-- could only use once.  I like Frownies because I get more, and they feel alot tighter on my skin.  Also, had better results with Frownies.</li>
    <li> Not sure this product was worth it, other than making me FEEL better by just putting them on and hoping it will work.</li>
    <li> waste of money, waste of time, i bought this prodcut after i saw good reviews on ebay but does not work from me at all. i will never spend money for this prodcut again</li>
    <li> These didnt do anything for me.  Didn&#x27;t stay on and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad for the price, I am able to use mine for several days before they wear out and stop sticking. I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference on my face, I have very fine lines and am using this more as a preventative measure so I think if you have deeper wrinkles you would probably get minimal or no results. I prefer the frownies for the between the eye wrinkles, but these are more comfortable for the under eye and across the forehead regions.</li>
    <li> Okay, so basically I purchased these because I&#x27;m a side sleeper and I want to avoid getting wrinkles due to this in the future. Frownies were WAY too uncomfortable, so I was searching for an alternative. These are comfortable and work very well FOR ONE NIGHT. The description states you can wear them 2 or 3 times, but if I try to reuse them, they start folding the second night. They ONLY work well the first night. If you don&#x27;t wear these to bed than you are throwing money away; this patch will not help wrinkles go away unless you are trying to avoid expressions or sleep lines. I bought them bc they stated you could use them multiple times. I recommend these only if you&#x27;re okay with paying money for 20 ONE TIME USE patches to sleep in. However, don&#x27;t purchase if you think you will be wearing 3 times over. These are more or less only a 20 day supply, not 40 or 60 days. But they work great the first night, and are super comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have only been using these for one week.  I am 43 and have a deep wrinkle between my brows that makes me look angry.  This patch is totally comfortable and practically invisible on my skin, so my husband doesn&#x27;t even notice its there.  When I take it off in the morning my skin is super smooth between my brows and the wrinkle is 85% less noticeable.  However, by 8pm the wrinkle has reappeared.  Maybe I need to use these longer to see permanent improvements. I have been focusing on not making faces throughout the day, but still catch myself sometimes.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to get botox.  I have heard some horror stories!</li>
    <li> I tried these and I didn&#x27;t notice even a small difference.  Although reviewers state, patches could be used twice, mine wouldn&#x27;t stick the second night.  I am going back to Frownies!  Easier to use and they stick nicely and I notice a difference!</li>
    <li> I do like this product, however, you get very few for the price. They can be reused but I still don&#x27;t think they are worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies for awhile but decided to try these because Frownies can be a little uncomfortable.  I&#x27;ve gotten 3 uses out of the individual stickers I&#x27;ve used.  Washing them in lightly soapy water and patting them dry somehow reactivates the sticky.  They work as well as Frownies.  I like the around the mouth stickers best.  My fine lines appear smoothed out in the morning!!  The only reason I deducted a star is the price.  You get 7 triangles, 10 around the mouth, 4 very tiny circles and 6 long, thin strips (which I cut in half to use on my forehead lines).  You do need to take good care of them to stretch out the supply.</li>
    <li> I really like these patches. They aren&#x27;t uncomfortable to wear and I really notice they are helping with the fine lines I am starting to see around my eyes. The only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they sold sheets with just the eye patches because those are really the only ones I need so the rest of them end up going to waste. I have ordered them a couple of times now and plan to continue.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not, the first night I used the patches someone complimented me on my creamy complexion and it has been many years since I&#x27;ve gotten any compliments on my skin. It seems to smooth out the lines.</li>
    <li> When I sleep my face smashes together and causes wrinkles above my upper lip.  Since I&#x27;ve been using the DermaGen Anti Wrinkle patches, it keeps my skin smoothed out.  I&#x27;m not sure that it will ever make the wrinkles go away..but I know for sure it won&#x27;t get worse as long as I use them.</li>
    <li> I will not be purchasing this product again. I did not see improvements and many of my strips would not stay on my skin.</li>
    <li> Just started using patches, I have a deep frown wrinkle and it has helped lessen appearance.  Will keep on using!</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started using these last week and I have to say they really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine lines under my eyes and \\&quot;milia&#x27;, yuk and these patches have helped reduce the size of my milia.  They have also worked on the scars I created on my own while trying to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; my milia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered three more packs and will continue to use them.  After spending thousands of dollars on face creams and \\&quot;gadgets\\&quot; this has been the best money spent.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful to wear while sleeping! When I take them off in the morning, there are NO wrinkles. Of course, they re-appear, but at least they are being kept at bay while I sleep! So much better than frownies and I can get 2 (maybe 3) nights out of them! You will need more than one pack...I&#x27;m thinking 2 per month should work for me. I also recommend the Decollete pad (on Amazon)if you like these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of things for the wrinkles I&#x27;ve seen appear under my eyes:  silicone scar strips, scar-away scar pads, you name it.  Nothing works the way these do.  I still use the Scar-away to \\&quot;extend\\&quot; the area that the under eye pads reach; if I use only the pads, I get a little \\&quot;fold\\&quot; below it that shows up as a wrinkle the next morning.  However, these anti wrinkle patches are the best thing I know of to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  I suspect that the material also helps my anti-wrinkle cream to work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the company had full packages of only one type, but I can also use the straight line pads (I cut them in half and then use two, one on top of another) in the same area.  The under eye pads also reach the \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; area, but when I&#x27;m using the straight line pads, I use the triangle ones on the crows feet.  They do stick better if appplied immediately after I apply my moisturizer but you can also make them stay by cutting Band Aid Tough Strips Fabric bandages into small strips and using them to help the Wrinkle Pads stay secure.  Works for me!  :-)</li>
    <li> These patches are great, I use them to supplement my botox as I tend to frown at night while sleeping. These also work well when I am doing a lot of computer work and am trying not to squint too much. The material allows you to stretch the patch and increase the amount of tension applied to the muscle as opposed to simply resting on the surface of your skin. I have been ordering these for years now from Cosmesearch and have nothing but positive experience with them.</li>
    <li> Love these patches! They really do work. However; the description says you can re-use the patches….well, I can not. It doesn&#x27;t  stick again after the first use. I cut them in different shapes for my liking.</li>
    <li> I got my first order last night and tried it on and like it.  I just ordered 5 more.  I hope it continues to help me with my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I love DermaGen patches!  I&#x27;ve been using them for 2+ years or so.  I usually put the patches before bed time, and remove them in the morning.  Very easy and comfortable to use.  And the result is GREAT.  It&#x27;s an instant gratification for me almost, because when I peel them off in the morning, my skin under the patch is super moisturized  (bright and soft).  This is one of the items I know I&#x27;d use for years and years.</li>
    <li> Good product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used frownies for a while. I could only ever use the between the brow ones as the others were uncomfortable and fell off during the night. I got a good result with Frownies but getting them to stick and then getting them off, not so great.  These stick and they come right off in the morning. I can make one rectangle one stick between my eyebrows for 4 or 5 nights. After the first night, it loses some of its stickiness so I apply a drop of moisturizer to it and stick it on. It stays. On the 3rd night I washed the patch and it got stickier. Hard to complain about that. I think 4 or 5 nights max on the rectangle one is probably the max for me. Between my former use of frownies and now these, I have no frown lines... when I&#x27;m not frowning. And therein lies the difference between these and Botox. With botox (which I haven&#x27;t had for over a year), I can&#x27;t frown much so the lines don&#x27;t crease over and over again. With these, yeah, they get relaxed and refreshed and the creases are gone, but I can still make creases by frowning. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at remembering not to frown  I used the ones that go around your mouth for the first time last night. Felt MUCH better than the frownies brand and stayed on all night. I was expecting nothing. Those nasal labial folds aren&#x27;t going anywhere fast without some kind of dermal filler that I don&#x27;t want to spring for just now. I was shocked when I woke up and they were smoothed out. It didn&#x27;t last of course. I didn&#x27;t expect it to. It was ONE night. But just the fact that they could spend 8 hours NOT folded is a pretty cool thing. We&#x27;ll see if there&#x27;s any real difference with continued use. Somehow I doubt it.   For what they are, they&#x27;re great. Will they take all the lines out of your face the way Botox or dermal fillers would? No, but there is a definite difference, which beats the heck out of no difference. :)</li>
    <li> So I was convinced to buy these because it said \\&quot;best wrinkle patch you&#x27;ve ever used or your money back.\\&quot; It certainly didn&#x27;t live up to this expectation.   -The patches are rubbery, which makes for uncomfortable sleeping. Then, you wake up and realize the rubber patches not only clogged your pores (yes I got mild acne out break where the patches were, and I don&#x27;t usually get acne) but also left a shape impression on your face that takes more than an hour to wear off. Take that into consideration if you have somewhere to be in the morning. After a few hours, the impression wears off, and so does the results.   -The package says it takes about 30 days to see the product&#x27;s full potential, but there aren&#x27;t enough patches in it to get to the 30 days and I wasn&#x27;t convinced enough to buy more. I wore the patches about 10 nights before I saw some results; this was disappointing because I have worn some one night and see the results last for about 2-3 days from that one night.      They weren&#x27;t horrible, you will see some results, but you have to be okay with the rubber stickers in your sleep (which are more uncomfortable than the more common fabric-y/canvas-y material) and not seeing results for awhile.</li>
    <li> These anti-wrinkle patches work.  I just placed my second order.  I put my usual night cream on and thought they would not stay in place but, after letting them set for a few minutes, I can go to bed and they are still in place in the morning.  They blend to your skin tone after applying also so they do not appear obvious that you have them on.  In the morning I found that the wrinkles or creases are much less noticeable.  I will be ordering more in the future.  I also like their skin products.</li>
    <li> This product really works.  I saw a dramatic change after using it just once. Also, the product came very fast.</li>
    <li> I bought these for wrinkles after I tried frownies and didn&#x27;t like wearing them at night.  Little did I know how helpful they would be!  After a dermatological nightmare (that ended with a 5cm incision on my neck) I was horrified at the stitches and redness that I endured.  The only thing that made the scar area feel better (and protected) was this product.  It stayed on nicely, but was easy to remove with vitamin E and then water.  It hid the worst scar I have ever been given, and after researching silicone, I found that it can be one of the best types of scar care.  I am trying other products as well to see if they deliver anything different, but honestly, the results I&#x27;ve had with this product means I&#x27;m ordering more.  Purchased for wrinkle maintenance and delivered on so much more.  Saving me from a Frankenstein scar I doubt I would have had if derm had referred me to a plastic surgeon.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I let my vanity rule my sense of the ridiculous.  These are ridiculous!  Complete waste of money!  Save your money.</li>
    <li> I have used up half of the half-moon-shaped strips that go along the sides of the mouth and have seen no dramatic improvement.  The strips may work a litle to straighten the lines between a nostril and the corner of the mouth.  But they don&#x27;t seem to do much to straighten the deep grooves going from the corner of the mouth down to the chin.    Furthermore, the packet contains too many various shapes and lengths of tape, while in my case, I only want those half-moons.  So it is also a little too costly for my needs.</li>
    <li> I have just used this product for a couple of weeks and can already tell a difference. They stay on really well and are much easier to use than the paper kind. I also have tried a lot of different products to smooth out lines, but none have worked as well as these. I really don&#x27;t want to be without them.   Pamela S.</li>
    <li> We used this patch for a while. every time before go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;When you wake up, like magic the wrinkle are erased. it works so perfect. They only must to offer in a better price more reasonable. 27 patch, is just for 2 weeks or less.</li>
    <li> I am 25 and I have heavy nasolabial fold, beside that fold, I do not have any other folds (or wrinkles) on my face. I guess because I prefer sleeping on my side, so I was pressing my cheeks against my mouth every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I need to do something against it. So on May 3rd I bought both DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches and Frownies. I was very suspicious about these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one month use, I like frownies better.&lt;br /&gt;DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches pros and cons compared to frownies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-DermaGen is made of clear silicon, so family members are not likely to notice it in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;-DermaGen is flexible and softer than frownies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-DermaGen is more expensive compared to frownies. Frownies cost $15 for 144 patches, DermaGen costs $10 for 20+ patches.&lt;br /&gt;-DermaGen is not as efficient as frownies. DermaGen is made of elastic silicon that can bend easily while frownies are made thick paper that is more sturdy. Because DermaGen is very soft, it can not help me to avoid pressing my cheeks against my mouth in sleep (the main cause of my nasolabial folds).&lt;br /&gt;-My skin can not breathe using DermaGen because it is made of silicon. Frownies are made of paper and I feel my skin could breathe better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;*One thing worth mentioning is, I think you cannot stop using the patches. Once you stop using them the folds will come back quite quickly.</li>
    <li> No directions come with this product and it makes no difference. I suspect some of the 5 star reviews are from people who are vested in the company. Buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> It does work . But the package says enough for 6 weeks. After one use the strips are useless. No sticky left. So it&#x27;s about 3 weeks worth.</li>
    <li> When you do not have money for surgery and you need whatever will work for a few hours this product is just OK. This product do not get rid of  wrinkles</li>
    <li> I have been using these patches for several months. I LOVE THEM! They are easy to apply and stay on all night. Of course they are not a permanent solution to your wrinkles but they help smooth your skin and give you a boost in self confidence. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to have smoother looking skin. I like using them during the week to get ready for the weekend. The effects last through the weekend allowing you to enjoy yourself and not be self-conscious of your wrinkles. The patches last for more than one use and are well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have bought these to try and of course read the reviews.. My assment is not only does this product do exactly as it says but it&#x27;s such an outstanding price, unbelievable really. They work def overnight you will notice a difference!! Highly recommend. Btw, not sure where you live but I ordered these and got within a few days not on Prime but regular mail. Very quick. On my third pack only because when I find something I like. I stock up!</li>
    <li> After all the glowing reviews I was excited to try this product. I had used Frownies in the past with great results but they were not very comfortble to wear to bed and getting the right amount of moisture to activate the sticky substance was tricky. I have to admit the DermaGen Patches are far more comfortable, however, I have not even seen a temporary difference on my forehead lines and wrinkles. Conversely, my wrinkles always appeared smoothed out for at least a few hours following removal when I used Frownies. The other issue with DermaGen is as other reviewers have mentioned, one pack does not provide for a full month supply and the lack of choice of size and shape (only available in the variety pack) is wasteful. I did not find the adhesive properties in these patches conducive to multiple use. You can slap them on your face a second time but they did not hold the skin taut for me after one use. If you are considering switching from Frownies, you may be disappointed in this product. Perhaps they work better on fine lines than more mature skin with deeper wrinkles. I will likely just hold out for my Botox in the future.</li>
    <li> DermaGen Anti-wrinkle Patches are absolutely fantastic. I personally use them because I am a side sleeper and I was getting a crease near my eyes from my face being scrunched into a pillow everynight. The patches eleminate that problem by keeping the area smooth. The crease that was starting to form is now fading. Instead of waking up with new lines, I now wake up totally smooth and refreshed looking. It is really nice because you can get at least 3 or 4 uses from each patch, so it is pretty economical. The best part is they are really comfortable. I thought they would be irratating, but they are not at all. It took me about 2 minutes the first night to get used to. The company is also great and they ship them out really quick. I love these patches so much and would recommend them to anyone trying to smooth and prevent their wrinkles and lines!</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was more than skeptical about this product. I used them for the first time last night and they actually worked. The lls between my eyes were gone and the mouth to nose creases were significantly diminished. They were not uncomfortable to sleep in like I thought they might be. The only downside was that the effects only lasted a couple of hours. Still it is a pleasant way to start the day so I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I thought these were going to be like frownies. I think it&#x27;s unsanitary to reuse these even if you do rinse them.</li>
    <li> I just placed my second order for these wonderful patches! I am so very impressed with how well they work. So easy to use,you don&#x27;t even feel them. I have a small scar and redness from  surgery and the patches have really helped to reduce both issues! I will absolutely continue to re-order them.  Geri</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with these Derma Gen Anti-Wrinkle Patches. They are just paper. Frownies makes a better product.</li>
    <li> I used to use Frownies, but these are better as they are softer and stay where you put them..and can be used 3 or 4 times.  They are on the must have list</li>
    <li> This soft and robbery stickers that you stick to your face do help reduce wrinkles but they don&#x27;t last! You can only used them a week or few more times then they turn like sticky shapeless goo! That means you have to keep buying them. Cuz of that I gave it 2 stars. You can get the same affect by using a gauze tape etc. just make sure you are not allergic to glue of the tape.</li>
    <li> I never expected these to work as well as they have. I&#x27;ve found that I can wear the patches for about a week instead of 2 or 3 nights.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s really nice waking up looking less wrinkled than when you went to bed.  I still use Frownies for the deeper crease between my eyes, but these work great under my eyes and around my mouth. (Also forehead wrinkles)  They&#x27;re comfortable and stay on all night.  Would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> This will shock and amaze you, I never expected such great results I will continue to reorder  like forever.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over the competion based on reading many reviews.  First time I put them on I stretched my skin a bit prior to placing on the wrinkles around my mouth .... quickly learned NOT to do that (as it created new wrinkles). No worries later when I put them on with a relaxed face. I wear them while sleeping; they are comfortable enough that I hardly realize they are on. Only down side that I see is that they don&#x27;t last the three uses as advertised but only two.  Maybe it is because I wear them longer-- as in overnight.  Still a great product though.</li>
    <li> I love this patches . I am 49 years old .I tried frownies before and was very disapponted . Absolutly uncomfortable . I could kept them until half night . dermagem - is different story . I love them , I can sleep through night and almost don&#x27;t feel them . . I should made picture or even video before use them  and after ,because Result was excellent. After using ONE time  , I woke up and don&#x27;t recodnize myself .  I already recomended this patches to my friends from Russia . And this much cheaper than frownies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I do not work for the company.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Frownies before with ok results and have also given Botox a try with awful results (a lifted eyebrow and no change in the deep crease between my eyebrows).  I decided to give these a try and I am so impressed.  They stick easily and stay, but they don&#x27;t hurt when you peel them off in the morning like Frownies can.  They are see-through and aren&#x27;t obvious when you are wearing them (I mean, I wouldn&#x27;t wear them out to dinner or something, but my husband has never noticed that I&#x27;m wearing them at night).&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that they really help reduce the lines in my face (I&#x27;m 55, so I&#x27;ve got a few!), particularly that crease between my brows and the \\&quot;marionette lines\\&quot; near my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and I&#x27;m very pleased.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but it has helped the puffy eyes that I seem to have on a regular basis.  Now when I wake up and remove my patches my skin is 100% less puffy and smooth.  They are comfortable to sleep in. I hardly notice they are on.    Just remember the area under your eyes is very thin and sensitive, so removing the patches there, must be done slow.  I learned the hard way- ouch!   I will be purchasing these again!</li>
    <li> The DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches are convenient, easy to use, and, what&#x27;s more, the results are positive. I recently re-ordered the patches after depleting my initial supply. Although I was extremely skeptical when I first applied the product, I began to notice a definite lessening of the deep vertical wrinkles between my eyes and the ones around my mouth after just a few uses. The patches are very easy to apply, they stay in place throughout the night, and they can barely be felt. Furthermore, I have been able to extend the life of each patch by lightly wetting it after the suggested two applications. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give this product five stars is that the patches are not evenly distributed for use. I could have used more for those lines around my mouth. That said, you can&#x27;t beat the price and the results. This product takes the place of more expensive treatment for me. By the way, I ordered through Amazon, but the company, CosmeSearch, Inc., followed up my order with a notification that the product had been shipped within minutes of my placing the order. You can&#x27;t beat that for service!</li>
    <li> I love the DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches!  I tried a similar product, but the material was too stiff and quite uncomfortable.  DermaGen patches are pliable but still inhibit wrinkles.  Actually, I even wear them around the house during the day if I have somewhere important to go in the evening.  They really do work.</li>
    <li> Best Anti-Wrinkle product I found so far, and I tried many! You wake up and those wrinkles are GONE! Works for under eye area, forehead, nose-mouth ones, you name it. I used them for a while now and it seems like the effect keeps longer, the longer you use them. Highly recommended. Arrive fast every time I order. Will definitely buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> I have used these pads for over four years and absolutely love them. I&#x27;m 50 years old and don&#x27;t look to much older than my 30&#x27;s. My teenagers use the tiny pads for an occasional pimple-they almost disappear over night. I highly recommend these patches.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit it, I&#x27;m 65. Do people tell me I look 20 years younger? Don&#x27;t I wish. They do say \\&quot;I look great for my age\\&quot;. (was that a compliment?) Skeptic that I am, I figured I was wasting my money on these. I put patches on only one side of my face for a test. Forehead, under eye, between the eyes, along mouth. Kept them on overnight. Didn&#x27;t feel a thing. (Unlike the frownies). Could hardly believe what I saw in the morning! NO WRINKLES! Inexpensive, and works, how about that. I&#x27;m going to try their face tightening gel now, and maybe their mild face peel. This is just, well, amazing. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Summer 2013. I&#x27;m still using these regularly and still loving them. The more I use them, the longer the effects last. I can use them every 2 or 3 nights now and keep my wrinkles at bay. I have ditched my former chemical laden moisturizer and now use organic coconut oil. [[ASIN:B003B3OOPA Nature&#x27;s Way Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce]], It is the best moisturizer I have ever found. It soaks in very quickly and helps prolong the effects of these strips.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of dark circles,fine lines and puffiness under my eyes from lack of sleep. It definately reduced puffiness and made me look rested. I wore it overnight and in the morning my eyes appear less puffy, but it did not last all day. But for the price compared to others I have tried, it is great!</li>
    <li> I like these! They are way more comfortable than Frownies and more effective. Plus that rosewater stuff you are supposed to use with Frownies smells like an old lady! The DermaGen patches also look less obvious. I&#x27;ve been wearing these to bed for a couple months without mentioning anything to my BF about it, lol &amp; so far he hasn&#x27;t mentioned it either because he hasn&#x27;t noticed them or doesn&#x27;t want to mention it! Haha... I feel kind of silly having to resort to this kind of beauty product, but it is a far more economical solution to Botox. Botox &amp; Dysport only lasts 3 months in me, and sometimes it comes out uneven, leaving me with one lower (or way higher!) eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 41 years old &amp; although I look young for 41, I look all that much younger when I use these! I ran out recently &amp; bought Frownies because I thought they seemed like a better deal for the money (since you get more) and they have the specific shape I want- I need these patches for lines above my eyebrows. That&#x27;s the only problem I have with the Dermagen patches.... why don&#x27;t they come in packs designed for JUST the area you need them for?? I usually end up trying to tweak the shapes designed for other areas of the face for above my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, go ahead and give these a try! They work!</li>
    <li> does not seem to work, made even more wrinkes ....</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love It ,  Reorder it second time and will reorder again.Better than Bottox  and and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Help to hold and relax my facial muscles  I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put on and leave overnight but wait until your moisturiser has absorbed else it&#x27;ll stick to the pillow rather than your face!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004CQ710U DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches]]  I have used this product for several days now and have had amazing results.  I recommend this product to anyone who is trying to get rid of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> First let me tell you I really am impressed with the anti-wrinkle patches. I am 39 and started getting Botox on and off about 8 yrs ago around my eyes and forehead but it wouldn&#x27;t really help my small crapey wrinkly crows feet eye area....so I took a chance on these. I noticed that my lines were far far much worse in the a.m. because I sleep on my sides when my cheeks push up causing horrifying lines/wrinkles mostly my left but on both pretty much and Botox can&#x27;t help that!!! (I even use a 100% silk pillowcase)  After using these I awake without wrinkling! I haven&#x27;t had Botox in 6 months. Granted, when I smile, which is a lot, my lines show up but just at that moment and not permanently.  The only reason for 4 stars is that it is fristrating to not be able to Purchase a full sheet(s) of the under eye moon shapes instead of the variety... I waste all of the other ones.  I wrote/emailed the company today so I am hoping they will offer that option.  **there is also another type that works but they are for your glabella (sp?) aka middle eye at the forehead area that if turned a diff way work too but the don&#x27;t come in the \\&quot;moon\\&quot; shape which would be perfect! Those ones I buy here on Amazon too and are: Fur lesse - all one word - I am going to research that company too to see if they have under eye patches and will email them too. I am leaving a review for that product today as well**</li>
    <li> Obviously these are not Botox and your wrinkles will be gone forever. However, they are great for training your face not to frown. They didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and came in a nice case to reuse them. The images accompanied with this product are hilariously photoshopped, but besides the point, I&#x27;m sure with a constant use, you may able to soften those lines.</li>
    <li> I have never tried any aging products. I decided to give this one a whirl. I knew it was not going to work because really how can it. Well color me stupid. Unbelievable. It worked the 1st night only on my 3 rd night, I&#x27;m flabagasted, I don&#x27;t know what else to say. It works wonderfully. WOW.</li>
    <li> I began using the patches, the first morning I was amazed, my frown lines were gone! But an hour later they were back. These are comfortable and I had no trouble sleeping with them, but I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;re gonna be permanent.</li>
    <li> I just got these in today and I used a strip for a deep forehead crease. I am 33 and have had that annoying line there for a few yrs. Ive tried every wrinkle treatment imaginable. I took a 3 hour nap and was excited to see that the line was GONE! COMPLETELY GONE! I couldnt believe it! I just kept staring at my face. I cant get over it! Im on here to order more immediately. Im trying the under eye patches now! I have never been more excited about a wrinkle product! I did try to apply the forehead strip again and I had trouble getting it to stick again. Oh well, looks like Im just going to have to continue buying them. I love it!</li>
    <li> I got these last week and thought it was going to take awhile to see a difference but I was wrong. I noticed after one night of sleeping  that the next morning my skin was smoother, the deep lines at least 80%  lifted and my muscles in these areas were relaxed and not reactive. I hold much tension in my forehead and you also make faces during sleep which compounded the situation. The gels are easy to wear, can be used at least 3 times and best of all they work!! You still have your face but it is smoother, lines are gone (yes, I mean just about gone, at least for me)  the affect lasts for days in my case!  This is the BEST, cost effective alternative to botox.  A great gift for your over 40 friends who are trying to stave off the clock. If you want to maintain any work you&#x27;ve had done this is the key.  I highly recommend these and I will purchase again and again and again..... i&#x27;m on my third order.  I also highly suggest doing facial massage along with these patches/ &amp; accupressure  tapping which you can learn from YOUTUBE videos&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using these strips pretty religiously and I&#x27;ve noticed several things. First, the deep forehead lines are greatly(75-80% in my case) reduced, second, my tension headaches which start in the front of my forehead, (due to tight forehead muscles) have stopped. I don&#x27;t have that worried look anymore in my face. I look more relaxed and at ease. Also, due to consistent use, the over reactive muscles in my face have been somewhat re-trained to not constrict but not to the point where I have no facial expression, it&#x27;s just less reactive &amp; more subtle.  I can still make faces but not over-exaggeratedly so. I also noticed that there is something in this pad that has made some deep lines and scars almost unnoticeable. For me the affects of these strips last all day and with consistent use, continuously.  I highly recommend this product if you are trying to re-train facial muscles to avoid future wrinkling &amp; want a more calm, smooth and rested look.  FYI: You also make lots of faces in your sleep so it&#x27;s a huge benefit to stopping the wrinkling process while sleeping as well.ooth and rested look.  FYI: You also make lots of faces in your sleep so it&#x27;s a huge benefit to stopping the wrinkling process while sleeping as well.</li>
    <li> I have used the other brand Frownies for years but I wanted to try something different so I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I was annoyed that there were so few in the package, and that I was expected to re-use them. I have very oily skin so re-using these on my forehead would mean getting pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they were made of very soft rubber so they weren&#x27;t strong enough for my forehead. My forehead muscles are very strong so I used all of them the first day (reducing the value of the product) but by morning, my forehead had squeezed them all to the center into my normal frown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using Frownies instead if you have a strong frown between the eyes like I do. It is the only thing I have found that works.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t believe good reviews. It will stretch your skin and make it saggy. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided I&#x27;d try this.  I have the vertical lip lines which are the hardest to get rid of.  Of course I get 6 inches in front of the mirror and study them (not suppose to do this) we all have a habit of looking at our faces and focusing on the thing we least like.  Human nature I guess.  Anyway, I ordered the patches, the shipping was extremely fast, was surprised to get them so fast.  You can cut and design the patches however they work best for you.  I used the long one and put it across the top of my upper lip, it was a little long so I cut the edges a bit.  Very comfortable and blended with my skin, I was going to bed anyway, so wasn&#x27;t really worried about the look of it.  In the morning the lines were all but gone, this lasted pretty much most of the day!!  Immediate and dramatic difference on the vertical lines!!!!  I&#x27;m thinking the more I can keep those wrinkles flat, they WILL become better.  I only used it ONE night.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what they do in a few weeks time!  Also, they are reusable, so I&#x27;m hoping to get 3 or 4 days out of one.  I&#x27;ve tried everything to minimize those lines, these strips virtually take them away and for a LONG time!  Would highly recommend them.  I&#x27;m almost 60 have almost waist length hair and very good skin.  I&#x27;m pretty anal about my skin.  These WORK!  If they didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t be taking the time to write this.  Try them, you have nothing  to lose except a few dollars and the lines around your mouth!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect patches for smoothing out the nasal labial folds. They also work very well on forehead lines. Compared to Frownies, which I used on a regular basis before discovering DermaGen, these patches are very comfortable and stay on during the night. They are easy to apply and you&#x27;ll hardly notice wearing them. No water needed. Just peel them off the sheet and attached them to your face. I use the same patches three to four times. Although you wake up looking wonderfully smooth, the effect will wear off during the day. However, you can add on a few \\&quot;tricks\\&quot; which will keep you glowing and firm.     In my experience, the best results are achieved by:  1. Allowing your night cream to absorb a little before attaching the patches.  2. Do facial exercises on a daily basis. You&#x27;ll find some easy to follow videos on You Tube.  3. Drink plenty of water and use products which will moisturize and plump up your skin. My favorites are Lancome Genifique Concentrate and Shiseido Bio Performance Super Restoring Cream.  Don&#x27;t be discouraged by the \\&quot;As Seen On TV Images\\&quot;. This product is far better than the first impression...</li>
    <li> This product works nicely. I used it as instructed while I slept and woke to smoother skin. I often wake up and find that the lines between my eyebrows are more pronounced, as if I was frowning in my sleep. This product eliminates that and actually makes them more shallow and less noticeable. The little lines at the corners of my eyes have diminished too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> * 5/12 - I had to update this review because I think they changed something about these patches. The last 2 batches I got felt a bit different and did not stick as well. I am not trying to knock the product, I still think it is awesome but I am ordering again with hopes I just got a couple of &#x27;bad eggs&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;* 8/12 They changed the pads again, different packaging and everything. These newest pads stick better than the last ones but they do leave my face more &#x27;tender&#x27; than the others did. I do not see as much positive change with these patches, te first ones I got were by far the best. These have not worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so I am only 2 nights into these patches but I can see where this is going already lol.&lt;br /&gt;I am only 31 so my &#x27;wrinkles&#x27; and &#x27;fine lines&#x27; are &#x27;invisible&#x27; to some people but not me, I see the 1 forehead crease coming thru and don&#x27;t even get me started on my &#x27;laugh lines&#x27;. My eyes are ok but I see fine lines forming.&lt;br /&gt;I am diligent about skin care but was starting to think I was messing up my face in my sleep. I would wake up looking beat, even after a decent nights sleep,&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I came across these and figured for $10-15 I may as well try them, I never used anything like it thinking it would be super uncomfortable. These little pads are actually quite comfortable, they sick on well and are easy to remove. I had no issue reusing them a second night and I know I will get at least 1 more use from them.&lt;br /&gt;I put them on before bed and woke up to way less lines in my face. My forehead line was smoothed away and my laugh lines were a bit fainter. Last night I did my eyes and it worked very well, I now know how hard I am on my face in my sleep. It&#x27;s quite scary.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall to these is that if you have sensitive skin they may leave redness. I know my laugh lines were left a bit red so I didn&#x27;t use the pads there again the next night, I switched them to my eyes. I think the delicate skin around the eyes maybe sensitive to thesepads every night too. This is defiantly a case by case product, not all skin responds the same to everything and you may have no redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this and would order it again, the company had it sent to me super fast too.</li>
    <li> They work and they stay on.</li>
    <li> After using it for a few nights, I saw my wrinkle lines shrank, although the effect did not last.  Have a feeling that it can help remove my wrinkles, if I keep using it for a long term. It is not a repeat-use product and so costly.  I will still purchase more and use it because it works.</li>
    <li> These wrinkle erasers came on a plastic sheet they had a yellow old looking tint to them. They were going to be returned but I ran out of the Therapeutics under eye patches. So I thought I would try these. These stickers stuck good all night. But I did not see any signs that my skin was softer or that my wrinkles had changed any by morning, then there was the fact that you could resuse them, right!!. They acually hurt when removing them, and there was no way that these would stick to the plastic again, let alone to someone&#x27;s face again. I would try these again if they were a fresher product and made recently not in 1950.&lt;br /&gt;I think the company should send me another sheet for my second use as that is a promise they make of these wrinkle erasing stickers.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;PS</li>
    <li> These anti-wrinkle patches worked great for me because I am a side sleeper. I had been noticing deeper wrinkles on the left side of my face around my eyes and upper lip on that side. I bought the patches and applied them to both of my eyes as instructed and to my upper lip. When I woke up in the morning the wrinkles seemed to look softer and less noticible! I have been wearing them every night and the awesome thing about these patches is they blend in with your skin (which is good because I didn&#x27;t want to freak my hubby out!) Also, they STAY where you put them, they don&#x27;t shift around!! AND you can reuse them several times BONUS!! I will definately be purchasing these again!!</li>
    <li> I have now been using the patches for 3 months and can tell that my 3 main sleep lines are 50%- 60% improved.  While fillers fill... they are not the true solution to sleep wrinkles.  I love how easy and fast they go on and off with no residue in the morning.  I am sold on this product!</li>
    <li> I do like the product, but I did not get 27 patches! I will buy these again. If it does not have the correct amount, I&#x27;m sending them back. But, again they do work well on fine lines.</li>
    <li> I would be more if cheaper--soft on skin</li>
    <li> Great product! I would definitely purchase again! When I used it, the next day my skin was smoother where I put the patches! I love it!</li>
    <li> I found that when I woke up in the morning, I had wrinkles on my face that were much worse from sleeping on my stomach with my face in the pillow.  Wrinkle cream was not helping. I needed something to protect my face at night.  I purchased these patches to cover the area to prevent wrinkling while I sleep.  I am very happy since these patches cover the area and keep it from wrinkling more at night.  In the morning, the lines are smoothed out.  They do come back later in the day, but before they were being reinforced every night; now they are being smoothed out every night.  Over time, this has to be a great benefit.  I have only used them for a few weeks but am very pleased.  They are comfortable to wear and last at least 3 times each.</li>
    <li> I bought these after being so happy with Decollette Pads.&lt;br /&gt;These are awful. They moved while I was sleeping and just created wrinkles in new, unexpected places.&lt;br /&gt;They are not very sticky at all and can hardly be used once</li>
    <li> I bought these once and was very pleasantly surprised. Put on at night and in the morning all \\&quot; ironed out\\&quot; ready for work. Sometimes I even skip the moisturizer. Ordered a second time a few days ago. Good purchase and they last for the price. Will try more products from the company.</li>
    <li> I have used both these patches and Frownies.  In some aspects, I prefer these and here is why:  You can reuse them, you have more options with the different patches, the tiny patches work WONDERS on blemishes.  My favorite aspect of these patches is the vitmans/oil on them.  The tiny patches work great on blemishes that are red and raised. They sooth them and the next day these little red problems are virtually gone.  In addition, they do reduce the appearance of wrikles, most especially on my 11&#x27;s.  Cons:  Each time you wear the patches, they lose a bit of their hold.  Frownies last longer due to the sheer number of them in a package. If you decide to order these, double your order. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Yes I am a 49y/o woman doing all I can to keep my facial lines in check an No this is not the answer but I did see Improvemnet after my 1st use on my ( ) an forehead I like to use them at nite that works well for me I continue with my antiaging skin care regimen, I suggest you try this product it is cost effective an worth a try. Im goin to place my 2nd order.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with this company.  I used these patches along with their Instant Face and Neck Lift and both have exceeded my expectations.  These patches stayed in place overnight and I could reuse them again the next night.  Good stuff coming out of this company, I will be back to buy more soon.</li>
    <li> These actually totally work! I love the results, I&#x27;m 42 and was going to have to stick to high neck shirts because of my chest wrinkles but these strips have totally changed that for me!! Only thing Is they loose there stickiness a long time before they say there supposed too. Otherwise I am in love!!</li>
    <li> Hi, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I just HAD to after using the patches. They are amazing !!! I&#x27;m a beauty product junkie ;) and I tried a lot of different products, this one truly rocks. I had some fine lines and wrinkles under my eye area, the main word is HAD ;) after using these patches they are either minimal or completely gone, I&#x27;m on my third order now and I will keep purchasing. Some ladies say the results last few hours, mine last at least two days or the lines are gone. I&#x27;m truly a very happy satisfied customer and I hope they continue making the patches with same results and the same reasonable price. If you can spare few extra bucks , please try ;))) You&#x27;ll love the way they either minimize or completely diminish the lines, thank you Dermagen :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for a short time, but this product, so far, seems to do what it claims.  For me, overnight use completely eliminates(albeit temporarily) fine lines (for a day or so), and significantly reduces deep ones.  Repeated use seems to be cumulative, actually visibly improving my skin. After using patches under my eyes, puffiness and dark circles were gone the next morning, eliminating the need for \\&quot;cover\\&quot; makeup.  In addition, I&#x27;ve used the small round patches on mildly irritated spots, and found those much improved in the morning.  All in all, I&#x27;ll be buying these again.</li>
    <li> I ordered these awesome patches last week and have ordered more!!! I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s with minimal wrinkles, but what little I had under my eyes and the beginnings of crows feet have smoothed out dramatically. So, I have ordered more:-) I use my own serums and eye creams with these and they stay put just fine. I will be a forever customer. Oh, I get 3 uses per patch. If it feels a little loose I add a little water to the back of the strip and it affixes just fine to my skin. Thank you from a new forever customer!!! Great product and it ships fast too!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be so much better than Frownies! The patches are soft, and so are much more comfortable and less likely to crease and cause even worse lines. They do still sometimes crease, but are less likely to do so and less likely to do so on the lines I&#x27;m trying to avoid. In the morning I find I have no compression lines from sleeping on my face and the skin under the patches is hydrated, making the appearence of lines even less. These do not stick via tape or glue, they are more like a gel (like burn pads) and don&#x27;t hurn to remove in the morning (unlike Frownies or tape).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with them is that not too many come with one package. I only want the cresents, but the package only comes with 10 - then devide by two, one for each side of your face. Even with two or even three uses, that is only enough for 10 or 15 days. Still less expensive than Juvederm or another filler. I now buy several packages at a time so I&#x27;m not constantly having to reorder, and will try using the other shapes together on the area I want to cover to make use of the whole package. The product instructions talk about retraining the muscles and being able to use them less often than everynight after 30 days. This seems a bit silly to me, as I don&#x27;t see how you can retrain muscles with these things. However, they are great for avoiding sleep linesn associated with a pillow compressed face!</li>
    <li> I really like these! I&#x27;ve been using them for about a month now, and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without them! Really quickly, before I gush, I&#x27;d like to explain why I only gave four stars when I love them soooo sooooo much. The thing that bothers me about them is that I don&#x27;t find all of the varieties that come in the pack to be very useful. There are some straight lines and little dots that, while they may work great for some, are of no use to me. I think the company would do it&#x27;s costomers a big favor if they would provide ordering options. I&#x27;d personally love it if I could buy a sheet that only contains the half moon shapes, as they work for both under the eyes and in the laugh-line area. Now, that said, these really do work. I saw immediate improvement with under eye bags, and I was over the moon happy with that. After a few weeks, when I realized that my wrinkles were also diminishing, it was just a bonus. Another good thing is that you can actually use them for over a week, and they&#x27;ll still work just great. A little tip is to put some vitamin E oil on your skin before you apply them...it&#x27;ll take a few minutes for them to sort suck up to your skin, but the vitamin E oil helps them to come off comfortably in the morning (not to mention it&#x27;s just more good stuff for your skin!). Anyway, this is the best ten bucks I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!</li>
    <li> These are easier to use than Wrinkies--they&#x27;re easier to get on and off.  The concept is a great one, and they do work if you use them regularly.  My only complaint is I wish they&#x27;d break up the multi-pack into large groups of patches for only one target area, but then again, my target area is between my brows, and I just modify all the other patch shapes to fit that function.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I am hooked on this product and find myself buying it every 2-3 months.  These patches seem to minimize fine lines and puffiness especially around eyes.  And so economincal that I feel it is so worth it.  I find I can use them 2-3 times each to get maximum use from them. Thank you CosmeSearch.</li>
    <li> Have tried these twice now and continue to like this product.  I was surprised that I really can get 2 - 3 uses from a patch.  As other reviewers have mentioned, for best results when re-using a patch you need to moisturize your face, wait a bit, then add a drop of your moisturizer to the patch before applying.  Although I have extremely sensitive skin, these do not cause problems, e.g., adhesive rash.&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be for DermaGen to provide separate sheets with just the triangle and strips, as I do not need the curves that are applied between the nose and mouth.  I cut those to fit more like the triangle shape but they don&#x27;t work as well.  This is the only reason I gave this product 4 stars rather than 5.</li>
    <li> These patches are great! When I peel off the \\&quot;sticker\\&quot; from my brow in the morning- I literally don&#x27;t have those furrow marks between my eyes anymore. I used to use Frownies- these are better and have some ingredient for the skin on them. Always felt odd tearing the Frowning off my skin and wondered how good that glue was for the skin. These feel fine and are easy to remove- have had to quickly peel them off when someone has suddenly come to my front door. I even use the DermaGen on cuts- seems to be better than a bandaid. Sometimes I use them during the day at home as well because I know I am furrowing my brow.</li>
    <li> Frownies work better.</li>
    <li> I do not have a review, yet, but, before I purchase this product, I would like to know what type of ingredients they are made of. Last year I had a Botox shot in the forehead and cannot tell you the pain and anguish I went through as the toxin created very unpleasant side-effects that lasts 3 long months! Now, as a result, I&#x27;m terrified of putting anything on my face that I fear has some type of poison that can infiltrate in the skin giving me some painful side effects. When I did get the botox shot, after a few days the forehead looked smooth and beautiful, but, boy, it was SO not worth the anguish I went through. Any thoughts?</li>
    <li> I have for many years slept  a very deep wrinkle around my eyes. I sleep with these on and no wrinkles! Finally a solution! I am happy that I finally discovered the other package that has only the crescent shaped patches.</li>
    <li> I like that the patches are soft and pliable - much more comfortable to wear overnight than Frownies, but not as effective. I didn&#x27;t see any real results after using these for 1 month.</li>
    <li> I am on my second order because I find that when placed under left eye, the one I sleep on, I don&#x27;t wake up with puffiness or a line which always appeared the next morning. I also place them on my left cheek area and chin as well to prevent wrinkles from sleeping on my left side.  The patches never come off and are comfortable as well.  I have saved $ from Restylene undereye injections.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I ordered them for the first time two weeks ago. They were sent to me quickly! (from Amazon)&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference after the first night. Love the quick results!!! Also note that I slept like a baby. There was No discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered two more boxes, can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 47 years old. My crow&#x27;s feet and laugh lines (these are areas of concern) are loving these patches.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> These work very well. I put them on before bed and wear them all night. After I wake up and remove them my skin underneath is smooth. You are still able to use your night moisturizer just be sure it is all absorbed before appling the patches or they won&#x27;t stick. I re-use mine about 4 times before they don&#x27;t stick anymore. This is my second order of these and will be ordering more when I get low. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
    <li> These patches really work!  Takes a few nights but I began seeing results.  Stay on pretty well...can reuse for several nights.  They shipped in just a few days...I just reordered.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with these patches.  I mostly use the patches for under the eyes and sleep in them.  They keep me from having those \\&quot;sleep wrinkles\\&quot; under my eyes when I wake up.  They work for that 100%!  I have tried various froms of tape (yea, I am a little extreme) but discovered these and they feel and look much better than the tape.  They are a good thing!</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time last night.  I only used the under eye patch because I typically have bags and lines under my eyes.  I put the patches on before bed.  They stayed on all night no problem.  I woke up this morning with NO bags under my eyes.  Really great product.  Great price.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Edited to add on 3/30/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now know that I will keep reordering this product permanently. I still stand by my original review, but this has worked better than anything I&#x27;ve found. I have figured out a way to improve the lasting power of these patches (for me, anyway, because I use them for expression lines) and that is, when I \\&quot;retire\\&quot; an old set of patches, I ALSO use them for when I am putting on makeup. I found that most of my expression lines are worse then I am raising eyebrows, putting on makeup, so I put them on, use a brush to stipple on foundation around them, then  after I complete my make up, I fill in the area where the patches were with powder and foundation. I stay relatively line free until the end of the day. I still sleep in the patches, but use \\&quot;retired\\&quot; patches for makeup. It helps a lot with expression lines. I don&#x27;t think I will go without them. Plus, I have found the customer service to be very polite...even though they seem to call me EVERY time I place an order:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these patches to correct the \\&quot;11\\&quot; lines between my eyes and some thinner expression lines on my forehead. I already look very young for my age, but these expression lines are driving me nuts, and I have to figure out how to correct them. I&#x27;ve tried tape, retraining my face, every lotion or cream you can think of. Everything short of injectables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I really like these little patches. I&#x27;ve been using them for about 2 weeks now. They are very comfortable, and when I wake up my expression lines lines are perfectly smooth (which has never happened before with any product I&#x27;ve used for these lines). They don&#x27;t JUST keep you from causing wrinkles in your sleep, they also plump them up and fill the wrinkles in. This tends to wear off a little during the day, but I still feel that the lines are better than before. I would definitely use these for a few hours before going out, an event, pictures, etc, as well as at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with the product, is that I don&#x27;t need most of the shapes in the pack. I only need the triangles and the long lines. I have no use for the other shapes, and I felt that the under eye area was probably too delicate for the sticky patches. If I could order a few sheets of JUST the shapes I need, I would be SO happy! Instead I have been trimming the long lines in half to stretch out the amount of product. I don&#x27;&#x27;t know what I will do with the rest of the patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, the way I use the product, one sheet would last me about 3 weeks (after stretching it by trimming, reusing patches). I hate that I have all of these leftover shapes that I don&#x27;t need. I will probably reorder this product anyway, a few more times. I do feel that they will help in the long run. I really wish the seller would consider selling full sheets of the different shapes. They would definitely get 5 stars from me then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summation, when you wake up, you will probably be amazed at first. It wears off a little throughout the day, but I still noticed an improvement. I feel like I will see improvement in the long run. Patches are great, not being able to order JUST to suit your needs is kind of a pain.</li>
    <li> Aren&#x27;t we all suspicious of those \\&quot;Removes Wrinkles!\\&quot; claims? Well these odd little stick-ons really do seem to work!  The results are very noticeable though they don&#x27;t last long.  I recommend them for any time that you want to look wrinkle-free. Just smooth out your wrinkle(s), put a thingie over it (them) and wear them for a day or two and then remove. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the results!  Great seller, too!  bbeckyt, Florida</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good stepping stone towards frownies but not as effective as frownies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are easier to you and more comfortable and less horrible looking but not don&#x27;t make wrinkles go away.  Too bad, seems like a terrific idea.</li>
    <li> I have re-ordered this product again and again and will continue to do so. I use them for my eleven lines (frown lines) in between my eye brows.  These patches are a good alternative to botox, which I cannot do.  When I wake up in the morning after sleeping with it on, the lines are definitely smoother. Also I think the longer I&#x27;ve used them, the smoother the lines have become.  That is why I will definitely continue to use them.</li>
    <li> I tried these a couple of times and did as it suggested on packaging but I didn&#x27;t see any differance . the reviews where so good  oh well I live with disappointment everyday :(</li>
    <li> I am not impressed and I do not think it works at all. It is rather weird how it is to be used. The patches range from strips that are to line up to a wrinkle on the forehead, a strip to apply to laugh lines. They are supposed to be reusable, but there is no adhesive left after you use it once. I give it 3 stars because I don&#x27;t see it working, and I give it three stars because it may work for some people. I would have not bought it if I knew then what I know now.</li>
    <li> These were cool, but they don&#x27;t last long. Therefore, you must keep buying them forever and ever if you want them to be effective. In addition their effects only lasted for a short time during the day. Then you were right back where you started.</li>
    <li> It actually works! Every night I slept with it on my face, the next day my wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
    <li> My wife uses these and has for over a year and recommends to others</li>
    <li> I was really hopingthese would do the job.They don&#x27;t. Not worth the money. Not the sellers fault ,that part was fine.</li>
    <li> Great product...you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Noticeable difference after one use. Better than frownies and easy to use. Reordering more today.</li>
    <li> These patches are unbelieveable!  I love these.  Just one use and ...swear...the fine lines are gone...vanished!!!!  I just ordered two more boxes because I&#x27;m addicted to my new youthful look.  This is the same concept as the chestpad that stop chest wrinkles... but it&#x27;s in smaller form.  Really does work.  I think you probably have to use them at least 1-2 times per week,and I&#x27;m sure the fine lines reappear after a while (you can&#x27;t beat mother nature) but for 9.95....quite a investment.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month and have seen a big difference with the reduction of the darkness underneath my eyes.  It has removed some puffiness which is still better than none.  But it mainly just lightens underneath your eyes.  My husband has started wearing them because he saw that it removed the dark circles. They are comfortable to wear at night as well.  I used the strips on my forehead but haven&#x27;t noticed much of a reduction in wrinkles and I am 32.  So I am giving it 4 stars because it does make me look refreshed but does not diminish wrinkles that much and it could reduce the puffiness a little more underneath the eyes.  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick well after the first use, that would be fine if not for the price tag. I would suggest to the seller to cut the price to 5 bucks a sheet w at LEAST prime if not free shipping. You&#x27;d get many, many more orders if you did this. I really wanted to use in all different areas, but since only one use, I used each patch for the same spot, &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my eyes. They DEFINITELY made a difference and comfortable to wear.softening of the lines immediately and on my days off I keep them on at home,  at first the lines would reappear in a couple of hours but the longer I wore them,  the longer the lines stay away. If they lower the price,  I&#x27;ll be able to continue and see how a few months work out.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical looking for something that would help to fight wrinkles. I didn&#x27;t really believe that once you&#x27;ve got them, something could help you unless you try something aggressive like Botox. But I had nothing to lose so I bought these patches based on good reviews and have to admit I am not disappointed.  I have been using for my eyes and between the eyebrows and all over my face :-) for few year.  I leave them overnight and I really like the result in the morning.  Although I can&#x27;t help noticing that the wrinkles keep coming back by the end of the day (mimic, I wish I could freeze my face).   I have seen some people complaining about clogged pores and I would tend to agree but it is still worth it. I would suggest to not sleep on your stomach. It may prevent your pores from clogging.  I am very happy with these patches.  Keep buying them  and highly recommend to anyone who wants to look wrinkle free.  My suggestion - it will help you if you start early.  I do not think you will notice the big difference with deep wrinkles.  But in my case (like wrinkles under my eyes) they really help.  The only reason why this area on my face looks 5 years younger - because I religiously apply them every night.</li>
    <li> These are the most comfortable patches and effective that I&#x27;ve ever used. I wear them on my crow&#x27;s feet on the way to work, making sure I remove them before I get to work.  They are the highest quality patches. I&#x27;ve tried most of them on the web, and these are the best!!</li>
    <li> I have been using dermagen anti-wrinkle patches for quite some time. They keep areas around my eyes from wrinkling at night while I sleep and some lines have actually disappeared. An exceptional product.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try these, however, wore them all night, woke up with what looked like the worst pillow creases ever. The creases are created where the patch ends. I ended up spending the morning covering up the damage, which finally went away. Not worth the money and odd feeling while you sleep. As a beauty product junkie and an avid review reader, hope this helps others.</li>
    <li> Okay so many buyers said Frownies were better...not for me! For me Frownies didn&#x27;t work at all, they didn&#x27;t stick and they were not comfortable at all. But DermaGen works amazing!! They just feel like tape when you sleep in them, and when I wake up I literally cannot see lines and wrinkles I had the night before. This stuff seriously works! I keep buying from them, they are awesome and I reuse mine normally up to three times a piece. I just don&#x27;t wear night cream with them because they don&#x27;t stick as well but after using these every night I don&#x27;t need night cream anymore. :)</li>
    <li> This item was absolutely not worth it, waste of money. It did not notice one bit of improvement and they don&#x27;t send you enough to even give a chance if they really do work.</li>
    <li> These are a temporary fix.  If you are going to a meeting in the morning and you want to look good, use them the night before.  I used them for a couple of weeks, but the effects are not lasting.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Frownies, but I like these patches so much more. They are reusable, comfortable (they don&#x27;t get hard edges because they don&#x27;t dry out), and you can use whatever product you like with them. I like the assorted sizes and shapes, as well. They really work, too!</li>
    <li> I squish my face in my sleep and wake up with a deep eleven engraved into my forehead--not a desirable look.  I put on a light moisturizer then pop one of these patches on my forehead before I go to bed at night, and peel it off in the morning.  No eleven! These stick well.  I like the frownies, too.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> will never buy these again. don&#x27;t know what I was thinking. they don&#x27;t even stay on your face....waste of money</li>
    <li> I love to use this product. It actually works for minor wrinkles and to reduce morning under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> These patches work wonderfully and soften fine lines as indicated.  You must wear them at least every other night to maintain the softening effect. This is my second set, and I&#x27;ll definitely re-order.</li>
    <li> I purchased these patches based on the good reviews. They surprisingly works pretty well to soften under eye lines. I leave these patches on overnight and do see a difference the next morning. They are easy to use and comfortable to wear overnight. I have ordered more add hope to see long term effect after consistent use. As other reviewers mentioned, I would also like to have the option of purchasing only the undereye patches (half moon shaped ones). Overall, I highly recommended these patches.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  Anti -wrinkle patch?  Believe it. It also does not hurt --I usually don &#x27;t remember if I took the patches off until I touch my skin or look in the mirror.  Taking the patches off is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I bury my head in my pillow every night, and that does not help the normal aging process.  With the CosmeSearch DermaGen Patch, I look like I used to look--before worry, cigs and age took their toll.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a lot of antiwrinkle products.  This one is unquestionably the best.  No other product even comes close.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the DermaGen Patch for the first time  in late Sept.  I still have a couple left now Oct. 10, and I placed two more orders so that I have some before and during my vacation.&lt;br /&gt;I have to check with Amazon if the patches can be ordered on a subscription basis.  It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;I think I &#x27;ve found \\&quot;the one. \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about the patches--BUT--decided to give them a ty. I have noticed significant results. No pain! Definite gain!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for these. The adhesive was too strong and it pulled a lot on my skin when I took them off. Also, if you don&#x27;t place them exactly correctly, you actually end up setting weird indents into your skin, or adding little wrinkles. Think of what happens when you sleep on a pillow wrong and wake up with a crease on your face that takes a while to resolve. That happened to me using these.  I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> Nuff said...Could only use it once or twice.  Was a waste to me, but others may love these.  I used to use Hollywood Wings (?) but something changed (glue didn&#x27;t hold, paper not as strong??) .  So I was looking for a replacement.  Didn&#x27;t find anything cheap so went ahead, but the bullet and got a Nuface! (which I love)</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t stick very well and they are not reusable, despite what they say.  When they do stick, they make more wrinkles than the ones I&#x27;m trying to get rid of.  There are no decent instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insert says that these must be worn with a gel that they sell separately.  Nothing in the online description says this.  I even wrote to them before ordering and this was not mentioned.  They should sell kits that include everything, and only sell the patches alone as a refill when that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
    <li> These worked fine but not too comfortable and I could not use all of them</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these many times over the past few years. They miraculously smooth away the wrinkles! I wear them to bed. Great customer service too!</li>
    <li> They work ladies, and gentlemen!!!!! Do not hesitate to purchase these wonderful wrinkle patches. My only complaint is their aren&#x27;t enough of them especially for under the eye. Also I was not able to reuse them, so it was a one time use for me!!!</li>
    <li> Have ordered this product a few times.  It sure helps dimish those rinkles that you cannot get rid of without surgery.  This product is a &amp;#34;Must Try&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This does not do what it is supposed to do.  It actually caused more wrinkles and it took a few days for the new wrinkles that it caused to go away.  I used these primarily on my eyes and it caused more wrinkles and puffiness, which is something that I hated.</li>
    <li> I sleep in these but not on regular basis. usually last but fades by end of day. perfect for special occasions</li>
    <li> This product works overnight!  Wonderful for between brows and eye area.  They are a bit small for larger places like forehead.  So I bought DermaGen H2 Full Coverage patches.  They stick to your skin and do not fall off like other products.</li>
    <li> Gave these a try after having used frownies for about a year. I still prefer frownies over these. These didn&#x27;t stay through the night or didn&#x27;t get as many uses from 1of the gel ones. I have only used 1 month seem to work the same as frownies.</li>
    <li> fast delivery....thanx*****</li>
    <li> The product does help decrease forehead wrinkles but they don&#x27;t last as long as it says. I think for the price they should send several sheets of the product. Should be used daily to see actual results.</li>
    <li> Rodan and Fields acute care strips absolutly work better however they are 20 times the price for only 10 packs of 2 strips.  these do not seem to do anything aside from make you feel like they are holding it so there is not a wrinkle at that time.</li>
    <li> Patches can only be used once which makes them  expensive. Don&#x27;t know if they work or not because have not used long enough.</li>
    <li> I love it, it works well, but you have to use it more than once which it lets you use several times.</li>
    <li> purchased for friend.  advertising as a anti-wrinkle patch is laughable. If you had perfect skin I supposed it would be true.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the glue is on patches.  Not reusable as suggested on lable. Only have used a week and have not noticed any improvements.</li>
    <li> THESE THINGS REALLY WORK.</li>
    <li> I have been using these patches for a few years now. I cannot allow myself to run out of them or panic will set in! They are simple, easy, reusable and deliver results at a low price. What else could we possibly ask of a wrinkle product? Recently - for reasons unknown - I bought a package of Frownies just to compare. I&#x27;ll tell you, for twice the price, I did not get half the results. What in the heck was I thinking? Buy them - just save some for me!</li>
    <li> These things really really really work!  However, only for a short time.  If you are going to have your pictures done then time it well!  It will give you the perfect effect for about 15 minutes.  And you MUST be careful using makeup afterwards or you will manipulate your skin too much and lose the perfect effect.  But it was remarkable after removing the strips!  I could not believe what I saw!  Now, I wore them to bed.  Put them on spots of my face that had HEAVY wrinkles or deep pit marks.  The pit marks were nearly completely GONE.  And the wrinkles were all gone!!!  But, as I applied my makeup the first time I manipulated the skin on my face too much and the effect was gone by the time I was finished.  If I didn&#x27;t wear makeup - who knows how long that would have lasted.  And I did use some of these strips more than once, and they worked.  Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll be amazed too!  Because the effect didn&#x27;t work for long I removed 1 stars.... but my age and skin condition could be responsible.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s painfully obvious that you have used what amounts to &amp;#34;stage makeup&amp;#34; on the model to simulate lines/wrinkles/creases in her face.  If you are going to attempt to show the result without actual results in a photo - the least you can do is blend the makeup a little better and not look so obvious.  You aren&#x27;t fooling anyone.  the only reason I&#x27;m trying these is because of the shape and hoping they are softer texture than others I&#x27;ve tried.  But, really, you need to work on the photos.</li>
    <li> This wrinkle patch is not a cure rather it&#x27;s a quick fixed which last  about 10 minutes. I would apply and leave until overnight and hope to see  great improvements in the morning but It wasn&#x27;t at all so... Am done spending money on facial products that claim perfection.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not something you want to do often.</li>
    <li> The directions regarding exactly how to use these patches aren&#x27;t clear to me. More specifics on how and where to apply the patches would be helpful.</li>
    <li> This is my go to product when I&#x27;m not splurging for Botox.  If you use these religiously, you will notice they work.  However, you need to be consistent.  If you stop, you&#x27;ll see those elevens return.  Great product for the price though.  You can use them over and over, too which helps extend the life of them.</li>
    <li> Nice, but dries out after a while.  Feel it is more moisterizing than other patches.  Not too many useful patch shapes per sheet.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product! Buy collagen crystal eye patches instead.  These do not adhere to the skin, do not create results, and overall very dissapointing!</li>
    <li> I use these about once/twice per week - but not every night.  I use different patches around my face but I can&#x27;t really determine if they&#x27;re working. There&#x27;s no irritation, they&#x27;re comfortable, etc. so while I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s an anti-aging miracle, don&#x27;t see how they hurt either!</li>
    <li> I actually bought these by accident. Hit one click purchasing when reading about them. Have used them two nights in a row and my crows feet and laugh lines are almost completely gone. The deep lines in between my eyebrows are also almost gone. Not sure how long this will last yet, but I am buying more and getting some as gifts because all my friends would love these!! I look like I had a face lift , I still am amazed..</li>
    <li> Astaxanthin Has Multiple Skin Benefits&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin helps to stimulate continuous production of collagen in the skin which is responsible in maintaining skin tone elasticity and firmness. Astaxanthin can inhibit melanogenesis or reduce melanin production (about 40 percent) diminishing age spots, freckles, and dark eye circles gradually.5,6 Its effect is superior to vitamin C. Topical astaxanthin may act as an effective skin whitening agent, which is a tremendously popular trend in Asia.&lt;br /&gt;There have been a number of studies about astaxanthin&#x27;s skin benefits using oral supplement, topical application or the combination. These studies have shown a substantial improvement (between 35 to 59 percent) in wrinkle reduction, skin smoothness, skin moisturization and elasticity over a period of two to 12 weeks.7,8,9 Astaxanthin is definitely a new potential and promising skin anti-aging nutrient.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the results these have provided.  Easy to apply and remove.  I have deep naso-labial folds, and these have really minimized these lines!  Love them!</li>
    <li> These will surprise you with the first use...can&#x27;t wait to see results after extended use</li>
    <li> Very sticky compared to what I have used in the past, and not really great to use a second or third time.  Will keep on looking for something that works a little better.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my aging skin and really hoped these would help my under eye wrinkles. I have a few from side sleeping. I sleep with these on and it smoothes out the skin where they are applied but the surrounding skin wrinkles a little. I sleep on a satin pillowcase and it really helps to prevent the wrinkiling but these are better used if cut up smaller and put on my breakouts. They are similar to hydrocolloid bandages and not really like silicone which I think would smooth the skin much better than this. Also, tearing these off in the morning feels a little like waxing.</li>
    <li> i saw no difference at all.  to be fair, i got bored with them after a week or so and gave up.  they don&#x27;t stay on well and you can&#x27;t talk or move your muscles after they&#x27;re on.  after a while, they seem to contract and feel uncomfortable.  then they fall off</li>
    <li> I was crazy to buy this. Wouldn&#x27;t stick to my skin for any length of time. Weird shapes and so on. Just wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the patches for three years. I cannot live without them now. As soon as I am running out of them, I order again. I put couple every night before going to bed, sometimes during the day on weekend.  I see the real result.</li>
    <li> Didnt stay on... Can&#x27;t really judge because of that.  Dont think this is the product for me.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I discovered patches at Amazon. I have only been using patches for a week and the patches work as well as the injectables I have had for wrinkles, but far less expensive.  I am really excited about how well the patches work.  I am also keeping a patch on a scar I have and it is softening the scar, making it flatten. For best results it is recommended that you use for thirty days so you will need more than one order of patches.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these once but I ordered more already! They&#x27;re so much more comfortable and easier to use than frownies and they stay on all night.  I&#x27;ve noticed a difference after one use! It even helped make my blemish look less noticeable and flatter. I love that they are re-usable. I&#x27;ll continue to be a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> After keeping one of these patches on all night, I was left with a triangular imprint in between my eyes. The imprint did not go away for two days.It was totally embarrassing. No I will never use or buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am in my 60s and not about to get cosmetic surgery.  However, I am a full time professional and need to look as good as I can.  The DermaGel Anti-wrinkle Patches allow me to do just that.  Regular use reduces the look of find lines and softens the deeper lines.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without them!</li>
    <li> I have only used these patches for approximately one week and I already see a huge reduction in a frown wrinkle between my eyes that has really been bothering me for years! These patches are so easy to use and comfortable! ---and they work!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stick well on the face, and it is non-reusable.  Will not recommend it to anyone.  Concept is good but, poor product.</li>
    <li> stupid because it&#x27;s uncomfortable.  you are supposed to sleep while wearing them!  not.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product but decided to try it. Much to my surprise, after one night of using the patches I noticed a significant improvement in my skin. I had a hard acne spot that unbelievably diminished overnight after putting the small round patch on it. The pores across the top of my nose appear smaller. A scar on my right cheek dimished and my forehead lines are gone. I used one of the patches on a neck wrinkle on the left side of my neck but did not use it on the right side.  The difference was amazing. I&#x27;m not sure if the results will last, but if you are looking for an overnight, probably temporary, improvement in skin texture and flaws, try this. I am ordering more to use for special occasions when I want my skin to look its best.</li>
    <li> I was suprised that these things actually worked! I&#x27;ve tried many creams but bever really saw a big difference and a lot of them irritate my skin. Even after the first time, the lines around my mouth and forehead seemed to be much less pronounced. They left my skin feeling soft too. I wish they could be purchased in stores also.</li>
    <li> totally did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see results after a few minutes of taking them off.</li>
    <li> These patches, are good enough to correct sleeping lines. Not permanently (but what is)&lt;br /&gt;I can get 2 uses out of one patch. They do hurt somewhat when you peel off, where there is any hair. You only get one sheet. I thought I was getting 5 sheets for the price. I ended up ordering more, because I plan on using them on a regular basic.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, and much more easy to remove then frawnies.</li>
    <li> Not too impressed. These did nothing but tighten my skin.... scotch tape would work just as well.</li>
    <li> the patches are very comfortable and i wear them all night long.&lt;br /&gt;however, they are only a temporary fix for wrinkles--just an hour or so after i arise the wrinkles around my lips and between my eyes return.....that being said, if i am going to continue to purse my lips and furrow my brow NOTHING will stop that except fillers and botox.&lt;br /&gt;so bottom line, good for a temporary fix only</li>
    <li> They were rather expensive for just a few patches.  I would still use them again and I might order them soon.  This beats plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> These work great on the small crows feet I have around the eyes.  Works well on the small wrinkle between my eyebrows too but not so great on my laugh lines on either side of the mouth since they&#x27;re a little deeper.  Effects are temporary and once I washed my face in the morning, it seems to go away more easily, but I do see a difference, albeit temporary.  I&#x27;ve been using one patch for 4 nights and it still works.  I like how you can cut the pieces into smaller and different size shapes.  They&#x27;re really easy to stick on and take off but they don&#x27;t fall off easily.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried these patches, never heard of them before, but I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon and the positive reviews.</li>
    <li> By the way, this is Greg&#x27;s wife, Clair!  I really like the DermaGen patches.  I used Frownies for several years before discovering these, and the DermaGen patches are far superior for a number of reasons.  First of all, the Frownies would often come off in the middle of the night, or they would move.  The patches are easily adjusted and they almost always stay on all night.  Second, since they are clear, they are much less obvious than the patches, especially for darker skin tones.  Third, they last much longer.  I can reuse them a number of times, so they are economical.  I love my DermaGen patches, and have often had the pleasure of being told that I look like my 20-year-old daughter&#x27;s older sister rather than her mother.  I&#x27;ll be using these forever!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I would say it works as it says. After just one use I saw the difference! The strips actually last more than 2 or 3 times. The delivery was pretty fast and sellers communication is excellent!!! Get prepared to order more!!!! A++++++++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a side sleeper who started to develop under eye wrinkles from smashing my face against the pillow. The crescent shaped patches have worked wonders to smooth those lines. I wear the patches after my eye cream is absorbed. I remove them by gently pressing on my skin as I peel them, being careful not to stretch that delicate area. They don&#x27;t leave any marks or sticky residue. I&#x27;d love to have the option of buying just the under eye patches, as I don&#x27;t use the others. The company ships fast and their customer service is great.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Very temporary results.  Lasts for about 10 minutes after removing the patch</li>
    <li> These are little miracle workers.</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
    <li> SERIOUSLY i love reading reviews before buying products and 3/4 of these reviews have been positive. okay this is how this product worked for me whn i got up in the morning it ws like omg all wrinkles GONE but the minute i got out of the shower and looked in the mirror they ws right back. i think the glue in these patches gets in the wrinkles and fills them but as soon as u wash u face bye bye results. im not knocking the other reviewers but these definatly did not work for me will not be purchasing this item again</li>
    <li> I bought both this product and the frownies.  Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t stick (it says it will if I use moisturizer 1 hour before which I don&#x27;t take my make up off til right before bed.)  Anyway, my skin is way too dry not to use moisturizer and the frownies stick and this does not so I&#x27;m glad at least I tried both at the same time.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found so far which will reduce wrinkles and sagging overnight and with continued use I see a definite difference and isn&#x27;t that what we all want to see...a difference?</li>
    <li> After purchasing this product and  Frownies comparable product, I much preferred the feel and texture of Dermagen&#x27;s patches. They look and feel more natural and even the residue they leave behind seems to continue to work for smoothing out lines. Frownies felt like I was wearing a postage stamp on my head! I only wish that these patches came in packs of specifically targeted areas - like a full sheet JUST for the forehead. I don&#x27;t use the others as much because my main trouble area is the frown lines. Hopefully Dermagen will one day come out with sheets of just the triangular patches for us frowners!</li>
    <li> What price beauty? I ordered this based on reviews even though I wasn&#x27;t excited - so many  products promise to reduce wrinkles and don&#x27;t. Could see results first night, second/third nights very impressed - does what it says. That said, in morning when they are removed skin looks great and wrinkles GONE. By evening of that same day many are back, although perhaps not as severe. So you definitely need to use EVERY night and there aren&#x27;t many in a pack. They say they can be reused and this is true. Each one lasted me about 4-5 uses. They can be cut to fit certain areas. Stick well without leaving marks - DID NOT FALL OFF during the night. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to using this product. I use a similar product ordered through Amazon for chest lines. However, this product really did not meet the product requirements by having an appropriate amount of sticky backing. This sticky backing only lasted a couple of hours, this was after exfoliating my skin and cleaning with rubbing alcohol. Also, the prodcut did not seem porous enough to perform the intended task. However, there are products out there that do. It made me want to order my chest pad and just cut it to use for my face. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I bought into the hype, for $11 I knew it was too good to be true. All these do is act like frownies would...flatten the wrinkle, stretch out your skin and flatten it. Here&#x27;s the thing, the next time you smile or make any expression, the wrinkles are back. I thought these would work like fillers or along the same principal no. I threw them away. Pieces of tape work the same.</li>
    <li> I thought it was just for Women...&lt;br /&gt;big time wrong....&lt;br /&gt;Once this started working...I bailed a nightmare and am staying with this Blissful Kiss Forever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing how something so simple WORKS!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  I should have known better!  There is no magic cure for wrinkles!</li>
    <li> Totally worthless. Use Scotch 3M shipping tape for a much better result. DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> These work! I used them for the first time last night. I had fine but stubborn lines under my eyes. They&#x27;re completely gone! I used Eucerin Q10 (amazing) under the patches. I&#x27;m very impressed and will order again without hesitation. I&#x27;ll update my review once I determine how long the results last.</li>
    <li> This product does remove wrinkles/lines, and absolutely gives you a more youthful appearance. . .for 1 hour, then you are back to square one. This product is not permanent, and has no indication of providing anti-aging benefits. Also, I&#x27;m not sure that adhering sticky pads to your face then stretching your delicate facial skin as you pull/rip these things off can be good for your skin (seems more damaging to me). On the flip side, I was amazed after the first time I used these how wrinkle/fine line free I was and used these before a few big events/parties. . . that dragged back down to reality after they wore off.</li>
    <li> This product does not last as claimed. I purchased this last week with the understanding that it would last four to six weeks, this is not accurate at all. I cannot reuse mine because they get worn out after two uses. They do not give you nearly enough to last more thsn a week. I would feel much better if i was either refunded or given at least one or two more boxes mailed to me free of charge.</li>
    <li> Works great,no need to waste money on Botox.  I recommend this Product to men and woman. You just need to keep using it regular.</li>
    <li> These patches are wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been wearing them at night for about two months now and unlike other patches that I have tried they are comfortable and don&#x27;t come off during the night. I wake up with smooth skin and looking refreshed!</li>
    <li> leaves my eyes very smooth in the morning after wearing them.  can be used more than one time.  good price.</li>
    <li> I received my first batch of these patches on Wednesday. I wore them Wednesday night to bed around my eyes, mouth and between my eyebrows.  I was pretty skeptical about them, but for the price, I figured what-the-heck.  I was so pleasantly surprised when I woke up.  I&#x27;m 39 and in the past year I&#x27;ve noticed my crows feet and lines around my eyes a lot more.  The lines are more prominent around my right eye and they were so much smoother and noticeably fainter.  The smile line on my left side is deeper than my right and that was smoother as well.  The result lasted pretty much all day (except my left smile line...that was less smooth by the end of the day, but that&#x27;s ok).  My make up looked smoother and didn&#x27;t crease like it normally does.  I&#x27;m going to order another batch and will check back in a couple of weeks to note how things are going.  Today is day 2, but so far, I&#x27;m loving these patches.  I used my first few patches only twice, but I&#x27;m going to try to extend the next few a little longer like other people have.</li>
    <li> This holds the skin firmly in place so I do not get the sleep creases (that want to stick once you get older), I am so thankful I found these!</li>
    <li> It does iron out the wrinkles but really pulls on the skin when removed. This really stretches the skin and I think in the long run will make pouches under my eyes. I am too old to have resiliant skin. (59)</li>
    <li> I did not see any results consistently, abd the package comes with a short number of them, but it´s ok</li>
    <li> these have helped a great deal with sleep lines. granted they wont reverse 20 years of deep wrinkles, but they do help soften wrinkles and my fine lines are almost gone.i think regular use could reverse some damage. ive seen it already in just one week of use.im very happy with these and will continue to use them .</li>
    <li> Curious so I bought them and they are really an excellent temporary beauty strategy.  They actually work to smooth out my surface wrinkles.</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t stick worth beans and kept falling off.  I finally threw the rest away.  Save your money for a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands of patches over the years for my &amp;#34;frown&amp;#34; lines, but these triangles for the forehead are the best.  They do not leave marks from the edges like the other ones, plus they are nearly invisible, small, and &amp;#34;attractive&amp;#34; in comparison to the other brands. When I am not using these, I would definately say that my &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; are prominent and a definite problem area, but when I am using these, my lines smooth out and I nearly forget that they are a problem. Sometimes I even place a sticker (flower, butterfly, etc) onto the triangle. It makes it look like it is a &amp;#34;beauty patch.&amp;#34; Another good thing is that it comes off discreetly and easily without having to have access to water and the effects of the patch are all day.  Just reapply each night.  One other note: Sleeping on your back decreases wrinkles and also be careful of times when you squint because of the sun or while working on the computer, crying squishes the face all up too.  These patches, plus a little common sense and your unsightly frown lines will be diminished and a thing of the past. I am so thankful for the DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product recently when I was considering buying more Frownies online. I must say I prefer this product to the Frownies.Frownies tend to fall off at night, and are not reusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smooth feel of the DermaGen patches, and I wake up with my skin looking noticeably smoother in the areas where I use them. I ordered two packages to try them, and just recently bought more, as I want to use these regularly.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the results I have seen so far two weeks in.  I have been able to use the patches two to three times each.  I have no trouble sleeping with them on.  The most noticeable results were around my eyes which were my biggest concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a deep wrinkle above my left eyebrow that is now diminishing.  I realize that this is not permanent, but I think the less time your skin spends being creased, the softer and fewer lines in the future.  I have done botox in the past and love it, but it&#x27;s just too expensive to do every 4 months.  This is a much more affordable option to keep the wrinkles from setting in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I see is that there are too few strips in the pack for forehead wrinkles.  Otherwise, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I have used everything from Frownies to scotch tape and these have worked the best for me. They are very comfortable while sleeping and peel right off in the morning. I have only used them a short time, however my skin is much smoother in the morning. I am hoping with time, these will push back the days when actual fillers are needed! Hopefully never!</li>
    <li> Of course you never know when you try these products what the result might be.  But sometimes out of desperation you are sucked right in, hoping something might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these DO, and I was amazed with the results!  After sleeping in them a few times, as suggested, I found that, depending on how you sleep, the skin can actually wrinkle more.  For eample, if you sleep on your side, the skin may actually \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; up under the patch.  If you can remain on your back, however, you WILL see amazing results.  And actually, I started just putting them on about three hours before work in the morning, and even that small amount of time made a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will never be without it!!  It&#x27;s TOO EASY!</li>
    <li> The product work but it is too expensive to do for long term.  I wish they included more patches or reduced the price.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work and added new (temporary) lines. xxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xx xx x</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it will do.  If you want to look great (10 years younger at least) for a night out, wedding, class reunion, this product is for you!!  My husband keeps asking me \\&quot;what did you do, you look great,\\&quot; I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and he still doesn&#x27;t know.  Very easy to use.</li>
    <li> fast shipping - was a pain to use with no results</li>
    <li> I just recieved my first pack last night... I washed my face, put the stickies on my face and slept with them on.. When I woke up and took them off I couldnt stop looking in the mirror!!! After one use what a difference! First thing this morning I ordered the cream toner peel patches pack and the firming gel! To sum it up I am pretty sure this will be the product I use for the rest of my life! Im so excited I found this product. After my pack gets here I will update my review to let everyone know how it all works together! They alsohave thier own website if u want to see all thier products. [...] that is where I found the firming gel.</li>
    <li> I liked these because the silicone was durable, very sticky, and could be applied and re-applied if you didn&#x27;t get it \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; on your face the first time.  The reason I will probably not go to the expense of buying these again is that they were just too small. The forehead pieces weren&#x27;t quite long enough and the under-eye pieces didn&#x27;t quite get the full area. I did have an indentation when I woke up from where the patch ended and the skin began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, while I would consider these washable because of the strength of the material, if any fuzz whatsoever ended up on the sticky side, it would not come off no matter what.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference immediately after sleeping in these. However they in my experience are NOT reusable. They would definitely not &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; a second time and you need to make sure your face is scrubbed clean with no signs of makeup, soaps or creams, moisturizers before applying. Easy to use. And literally noticed results after one use.</li>
    <li> I tried the product but it don&#x27;t help to fix the wrinkles ( I have just few wrinkles). Don&#x27;t recomended I waist my money.</li>
    <li> Difficult to apply and does not adhere to skin when wearing over night. It was not overt expensive so I could feel worse about wasting my money.</li>
    <li> I’ve received a dried out package of strips to place on my face, they simply don’t do anything except that they leave a mark on your face when removed, so you end up looking worse than before; ladies, only botox works, unfottunately</li>
    <li> I ordered Frownie and used it for a week.  It showed slight difference only when it stays on skin over night.  Frownie is pieces of thick stiff paper with glue, it feels odd.  Slight difference is amazing at this point, but I noticed that it would be better if it sticks on skin good enough and reusable.  I ordered this patch next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Frownie makes nasolabial folds line slightly lighter, DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches make the lines lighter and softer appearance.  The creases get deeper as time passes, of course.  As a short time effect, what you expect is feeling wonderful about least lines on face for a couple of hours. I value on its long term benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this patch since it stays on face over night and reusable.  I wash used patches with soap and baking soda, and it has been 6 nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a trench shaped pillow I just got, the patches works very well.  Patches and pillow are added to my daily skin firming treatment with Trinity and Stop.  The patch erases fine lines between eye blows and helps nasolabial folds lines look lighter after started using few nights.  As a side sleeper, this patch became must-have item in my life... was what I thought it was... while being obsessed about regaining youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, After 2/3 of the stickers are gone, I no longer care about this item.  It&#x27;s been many months, my lines are the same or even lighter because of something else, that I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;It is costly for a couple of hours of illusion.  Cannot fight with natural law of gravity.&lt;br /&gt;As long as looking healthy, it is okay.  I accept my own aging process.  I will still use Tretinon and facial peel along with other things.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m  67 years old and have really good skin. That doesn&#x27;t mean the hands of time and gravity haven&#x27;t left their marks. I have used these for four nights, leaving them on all night long. Unfortunately, I see absolutely no change in the lines down the sides of my mouth, my biggest concern. I bought two packages. I&#x27;ll  continue trying until they are all gone. If anything does change, I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
    <li> IVE reviewed this and SMoothie wrinkles removing strips and they are truly amazing and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IVE got no more wrinkles on eye or forehead after 3 months of using 2x  a day soooo worth it i will use forever</li>
    <li> After buying these, I saw a video online about using scotch tape.  Much cheaper.  So I never used these and decided to return them but I still have yet to receive a refund from the company.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to actually work as well as it did! I was expecting something just to help me prevent wrinkles as I smooshed my face in my sleep, but after I woke up the first night, the appearance of my wrinkles were noticeably diminished! Will be buying again and again!</li>
    <li> I could not believe how well this stuff works!!! I tried it the first night and in the morning it worked beautifylly. I am 62 years old and believe me if it can work for these old wrinkles it will work for you!!! I have put away my expensive old dermawand and use these strips exclusively now. I use plently of face cream and even though it says not to use it for 2 hours after applying face cream I do and the strips stick fine. They dont bother me when I sleep (I do sleep alone and they make you look kinda funny but who cares for the results in the morining???). Love this product. And is so inexpensive!!!! WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> I have been seeing those 11&#x27;s between my eyebrows and decided to try these. The first time I did was overnight and in the morning my skin was smooth between my eyebrows. Great! They must train or help those muscles to relax. definitely worth a try for wrinkle management.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle, but I gotta say I&#x27;m pretty impressed!!! Other than scaring my husband, looking like Hannibal Lector, I thought these were pretty comfortable, hardly felt like I had them on. After just 2 days I was already noticing my crows feet &amp; the lines between my brows had faded!</li>
    <li> I used the patches for the first time last night and woke up feeling optimistic about the results. However as the day wore on red, irritated patches began to form where I had used the product. It&#x27;s not coincidental considering they are the EXACT shape of the patches themselves. Anyone else have this issue? Maybe some sort of interaction with another product?</li>
    <li> Awkward! These left me with more wrinkles in the morning. Will never buy again. These were a huge waste of my money!</li>
    <li> I have a severe wrinkle in the middle of my forehead, which makes me look like a Mad Hatter.  Haha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one patch for 2 nights and can already see a major improvement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a recommendation that you buy some of their anti-wrinkle creams to use with the patches.  However, I did not purchase any of those.  I just used the patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed after 2 days of using this product.  Wow!</li>
    <li> These patches work well if you wake up with creases on your face or eyes. It plumps them out. This is not a long term fix for wrinkles but does work for me for the day.</li>
    <li> As with so many cosmetic/beauty products that promise miracles, at first I was skeptical about purchasing these. However, I was VERY pleased to discover how well they work! I just placed a second order! I am able to use each patch 2-3 nights, which makes the patches very cost effective. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These work great.  They can be re-used more than a couple of times...just rinse off and reapply.  They are more comfortable to sleep in and easier to remove than Frownies, but they don&#x27;t work quite as well on eye corners. A crease tends to form in the middle that can actually reinforce a line rather than smoothe it.</li>
    <li> This product has not really reduced wrinkles but it does seem to soften he wrinkles. The shapes of the patches are great.</li>
    <li> I tried a few patches overnight and the result was ZERO, absolutely no changes at all.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money!</li>
    <li> i like these i notice that my smile lines are disappearing i cant even see them anymore a great product :) will buy again :D :D :D deff worth buying wasnt expensive or nothing :D</li>
    <li> I stumbled on DermaGen and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try and now I am addicted!  I have been using them for about 5 months and I use them for wrinkles and especially for the occasional breakout, and they work wonders! Within a day or two my pimples are gone. I use them all over my face and now i can&#x27;t go without them.  Plus, the service is excellent and they always ship the day I order them! Highly highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These are interesting, and they stay on throughout the night if you follow the instructions.  But I do not believe that they are as effective for the deep frown lines and wrinkles as Frownies.  They aren&#x27;t expensive, so it was worth trying once, but I would probably not order them again.</li>
    <li> Did not had great expectations about the product and was right. Lack of clear instructions. Very confusing..  Throw away money</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to the prospect of an inexpensive product that would help slow signs of aging... I have a few visible creases (on my forehead and smile lines and between my eyebrows) when my face is relaxed and wanted to see if this would make any difference.  Sadly, it did not.  I slept with them on (8-10hrs per night) and they always stayed in place, there was no issue with their construction or adhesive properties, I followed all the directions and prepped my face accordingly prior to applying them.  I am only 27 so my creases are really not that noticeable so I thought I would be pleased if there was even the slightest improvement.  When I peeled them off each morning, the skin underneath looked the same as when you remove a bandaid from your skin that had been on for a while, slightly lighter and puffier than the surrounding skin.  Then, like skin after a bandaid is removed, say an hour later it was back to looking exactly as before the patch was applied.  To summarize: great concept, bad product.</li>
    <li> dose not do a thing for the wrinkles</li>
    <li> Tried Frownies but they were uncomfortable to sleep with. The Dermagen patches are comfortable and work atleast as well if not better, on my second order!</li>
    <li> These patches did nothing.  They were uncomfortable and I actually threw them in the trash after the second night of wearing them overnight with no visible results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Tried this until all the product was gone.  Same thing every night, they either peeled off (and my skin isn&#x27;t oily)  or if they managed to stay on they did NOTHING...nada.  VERY uncomfortable, especially the ones near the mouth.  Really, a waste. :(</li>
    <li> I really love these patches, they do work, I was amazed how they smoothed my wrinkles and lifted my cheek area, the only reason why I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars it&#x27;s because I really wish the seller would consider selling full sheets of the different shapes. They would definitely get 5 stars from me then.</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and I was very much hoping this product would work for me but it didn&#x27;t. I thought after seeing all the good reviews that there would be some hope.  I am glad I didn&#x27;t lose too much money but then again there isn&#x27;t many applications inside the packet. I am really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are around my age and have defined wrinkles and starting to have sagging skin this product probably won&#x27;t work and you would most likely be wasting your time and money. I think this product probably works better on younger skin.</li>
    <li> This is a unisex anti-age product that really works! Best result when used overnight. Sure, the result is not long lasting like botox, but it is pain free to use and easy to apply. There is no cream or serum available that gives an instant result treating deep wrinkles like these patches. Because of the different design of patches there is always a shape that works for a specific wrinkle on face. If not, just adapt shape with a scissor. I recommend using a finger to hold skin tight where patch is applied when removing it gently, to avoid pulling skin on treated area.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference after just one night of use. It&#x27;s not a cure for wrinkles but it&#x27;s pretty close! I just ordered two more boxes!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t do a thing for any lines on your face. You may see a visiblr difference right after you take them off, bu that disappears in a matter of minutes.</li>
    <li> These are much better than the paper Frownies and other light-weight anti-wrinkle patches.  They are relatively think, so they stay in place if you move your face muscles.  I use these every night - they work pretty well, but because I have oily skin in my &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone, I only get one or two nights out of these.  Also, the effect wears off by mid afternoon for me (3:00 pm-ish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the company made a sheet of just the triangles, because between my eyebrows is my problem area.</li>
    <li> How long with I use it one time?</li>
    <li> I expected these to be a bit firmer. The quality is good, I just wish they were a bit more firm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermagen anti-wrinkle patches for about five months now and it does what it says.  I have had a vertical line next to my right eyebrow for years and this product smoothes it out and makes my face looks years younger!  I also use the long, narrow strips for fine lines on my forehead.  Those work well too but I have medium brown skin and have found that sometimes the adhesive will lighten the skin a bit (the way a bandage would once you remove it) making the forehead wrinkles stand out more!  But the lines are definitely flattened and even my mother noticed that she couldn&#x27;t see the forehead lines anymore.  All in all a very solid product and no strange chemicals or injections!  Would definitely recommend and am planning to use this for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me, they feel nice and soft on the face and you can hardly see them on but the frownies work best for me at least. I really wanted to like these as the quality is so much better, but I guess its the ruggidness of the frownies that tame the muscle so these were a disappointment.</li>
    <li> i love that i can put them on and they go virtually unnoticed (at bedtime, of course). they smooth out large pores and fine lines and really can be used twice. i wish they sold a night cream of whatever it is that these strips are treated with.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> I did not see any changes in my face. I would never get this product again</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t work,the eye patches made my eyes puffy,with more of a crease it looked terrible.</li>
    <li> WORST product. Does absolutely nothing but make you look weird.</li>
    <li> Small tape like shapes do not adhere to face tightly. Tape Come off at night and only work while on.</li>
    <li> Great Seller. The product is a little known secret but it works great!</li>
    <li> I thought it worth a try for marionette lines, but they really do not work well, and they fall off easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry for only giving two stars, I used to give five stars... I have been using DermaGen anti-wrinkle patches for about a year. I am very happy with how they work. However, this last order, I noticed that the material used for these patches is noticeably thinner. I wake up next morning with a whole bunch of new wrinkles all over and under the patch that was supposed to be minimizing a wrinkle. I don&#x27;t know what changed, but please don&#x27;t use thinner patch material just to cut costs on your side, DermaGen. Please make the material thicker or go back to the way it was originally because, as I said, these new patches are definitely much thinner and they are not doing the job as well as they did previously. :(</li>
    <li> I have used these and other products which have no chemicals or drugs in them and they are fine. I don&#x27;t like the way these peel off the next day, though, after sleeping in them. I feel like the peeling off of them undoes the wrinkle restraint they provided while they were on!!</li>
    <li> I really like these, especially for my horizontal forehead lines. The pliable material they are made out of is the best I have tried out of all the available tricks (such as plain old surgical tape), because it really &#x27;molds&#x27; the lines into a flat smooth surface and holds them there, without (like many tape-based solutions) creating new lines elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are careful to put them on a clean face and then put them right back on the paper when done, you can definitely get multiple uses out of these. Sometimes I use a tiny bit of nexcare tape to hold them on and get a few extra uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many similar products, at first the lines may re-appear shortly after removal; the key is definitely consistency.</li>
    <li> sorry - doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Tried them for a month.  Will not buy again.  Have much better luck with other products.</li>
    <li> I had doubts about trying this product because normally the adhesive patches do not stay on at night while sleeping.  I was very pleasantly surprised as the same patch will adhere for several nights without falling off.  These patches are great for &amp;#34;sleep wrinkles&amp;#34; caused by bed pillows or sheets.  Worked wonders for me!!  I plan on purchasing again.  Great product!</li>
    <li> When u take the patches off in the morning your face looks great.  The problem is that is does not last!  If it did it would be a great product!!!!  Have been using the patches for several weeks and seems to not last any longer!!!!</li>
    <li> The patches are not very long lasting and aren&#x27;t very sticky.  They will have to be replaced too often  to be worth it.</li>
    <li> she said they&#x27;re perfect,so i give 5 stars,can i get discount if i buy more next time :D thank you</li>
    <li> They are good for about 3 or 4 uses each piece but I can really notice a difference in my frown lines and lines around my mouth - and under my eyes. Very good product!</li>
    <li> Not sure .. Very odd  to say the least&lt;br /&gt;Sticking gel shapes on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What will they think of next?&lt;br /&gt;Didnt notice a diff except face was wet w slimy stuff</li>
    <li> The only problem is there aren&#x27;t enough in the package. They&#x27;re great,and work really well.I just need to get more.</li>
    <li> Well I have used these 3 times now.  The first time I was amazed when I woke up and removed the strips around my mouth.  I have some&lt;br /&gt;deeper \\&quot;laugh lines\\&quot;, worse on one side of my face than the other.  Totally gone after using the curved patches.  Wow!  Only problem is the effects don&#x27;t last all day, which I didn&#x27;t expect they would anyway.  I think I removed the strips after sleeping with them, probably around 7 a.m.  By 11:00 a.m. the effects  were almost gone.  They stick very well.  They are reusable for 1 or 2 times. I am not using them every night. I guess they would be good if you could wear them before a big event or night out, for a few hours.  I will post updated review in the future, after more use.</li>
    <li> This product works Very well! I suppose the main competition for this type would be &amp;#34;frownies&amp;#34; and I tried those, but these are much better and I suspect these would be better for almost all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;  Comparison:  You get multiple sheets of frownies whereas you get One sheet of these, but both are reusable.  Frownies are made of very thin soft plastic, and you can reuse them if you are careful, but they do have a type of glue on the back that visibly starts to come off after a couple of uses. These are made of silicone - thicker and slightly less transparent (a slightly yellowish peach/tan) and the limit to the reuse with these seems to be a degradation of the material of the product itself (as in it ages and thus deteriorates Eventually) plus a build up of skin oil, product, exfoliated skin particles, etc. These can be rinsed/washed to reduce the build up, but eventually the edges will start to curl and the material won&#x27;t stick as well. I end up reusing mine for so long that I think the two pretty much last about the same total amount of time, and the costs end up being comparable.&lt;br /&gt;  Given the thickness and slight color, these are more noticeable, but anyone is going to notice either one anyway. You are going to wear either one at night or in private times. Both are about equally comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;  That leaves the effect as the deciding factor, and the very thin but ever so slightly harder plastic of frownies can be difficult to place so that it doesn&#x27;t cause a wrinkle at the edge. The instructions say to avoid adhering the frownie right to the edge (in other words, leave the edges free from the skin), which is probably an acknowledgement of this problem and an attempt to avoid it - but even if you manage to do this, the edges often adhere themselves over night, and you can wake with a whole new wrinkle where the edge dug into your skin. The softness of these DermaGen patches tends to avoid that better. Also, the softness seems to allow the skin to flex a little more so that the skin beyond the patch isn&#x27;t taking up all the stretch or flex and developing New wrinkles. Both are pretty good, both have their advantages, but when I repurchased, I purchased this type, directly from the company using the paper inside...&lt;br /&gt;  Oh, my one cringe about these is the quality of the illustrations which make it look like a cheesy low quality product - which it is not. DermaGen; get a real woman and use a camera!kin to flex a little more so that the skin beyond the patch isn&#x27;t taking up all the stretch or flex and developing New wrinkles. Both are pretty good, both have their advantages, but when I repurchased, I purchased this type, directly from the company using the paper inside...&lt;br /&gt;  Oh, my one cringe about these is the quality of the illustrations which make it look like a cheesy low quality product - which it is not. DermaGen; get a real woman and use a camera!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
    <li> it made my lines deeper and more noticeable after a night&#x27;s sleep because the patch kind of sunk into the wrinkle. I sleep on my side, so I was hoping these would work. It is a great concept, but it didn&#x27;t work for me, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have been using these little patches for a while now.  Perhaps it&#x27;s my imagination, but I think they work.  At least, I think I see a difference especially the area between my eyes.  Those frown lines are less noticeable to me.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The products works and give a flawless result when you awake in the morning.  After taking off the product for an hour, the lines were back but not as pronounced.  Regular use would decrease lines over time, in my estimation, but at what financial cost??  Solid product, but cost is a negative factor.</li>
    <li> Silly me.  I ordered both these and another set of them with some type of firming &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.  So far I am not happy with the results.  They do not give the same as the paper frownies.  Being pliable, I thought they would actually be better.  As said, silly me.</li>
    <li> I only use it for the frown lines between my eyebrows which are fairly deep. While this package contains strips for all areas of the face, I simply cut up the longer ones to apply to my frown lines and get more use out of the strips I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t use. I place the patch on clean skin at bedtime and remove in the morning. I found that if I apply for two nights, my frown lines are almost gone for a week or more. Would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> Many good reviews were already written so I will keep it short. It works great! I use it between my eyes and on the forehead and it is like a miracle in the morning. Now I use them when I will be in the sun all day, to prevent from frowning/squinting. I wear a cap so it is hardly noticeable under my sun glasses. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using the patches for about a year.  I have a scar on my face and put a patch on it before I go to bed.  In the morning, it is almost invisible!  The results only last for around 5-6 hours but if needed, I put a patch on before I go out.  If needed, I cut the long strips in half which makes them last much longer.  They are reusable but only for another day or two.</li>
    <li> I experimented with these quite a bit going through lotions and oils with them, taking them off, placement, etc so it is my wish that this review will save you time in figuring them out because these pads are a wrinkle dream once you figure out the art of using them. If only the company had more instructions etc but at least the product itself is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine skin that is getting laugh lines under/side of my eyes and forehead lines from raising my eyebrows as well as diagonal sleep lines when I forget and role to my side at night. I had the thought about how many more years I can go before going under the needle for Botox and I really don&#x27;t want Botox in my 30&#x27;s but these things saved me at least for now. You have to play with these a little to find what works for you but this is what works for my eyes and forehead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Train yourself to sleep on you back, all time best thing you can start doing for your face in general. It took me a month with a little help of Melatonin supplement in the beginning here and there plus meditation before bed but I did it. I can&#x27;t even fall asleep on my side anymore it has to be my back. If you don&#x27;t sleep on your back with these you will get a diagonal crease under your eyes from where the polyurethane folds plus you won&#x27;t be able to use these as long since the stickiness degrades with each use and if you sleep on your side they will start curling up and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I use 100% organic argan oil, quite a few brands available just get one in a dropper bottle as you won&#x27;t waste it, it&#x27;s easy to apply small amounts on specific areas of your face and it&#x27;s less messy. A few hours before bed I wash my face, tone, and moisturize than dab this oil on under and around my eyes as well as across my forehead lines. Then right before bed when this has all had a chance to set in for a few hours I pat the argan oil with my finger tip to make sure it is just a light layer left so the pads will stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Before bed you want to place the pads over your wrinkles, this is where the experimenting will come into play as all of our faces and wrinkles are different. On my forehead I can just rub the long thin pad across and I&#x27;m done. For my eyes I don&#x27;t go all the way under but start with the tip of the half moon pad about half way from left to right under my eye and a about 2/8ths of an inch below my eye. I press that tip of the pad down then I gently/lightly pull my skin up and out near my temple away from my eye and smooth the rest of the pad down. If you pull your skin too tuant before smoothing the pad down your wrinkles will be less but still noticeable as your skin was set squished beneath the pad or create a new wrinkle on the outside of the pad from where the skin relaxes back over the pad when you release it. Don&#x27;t stress as this will disappear throughout the day and you can fix it when you do it again at night. The key is to figure out how to place the pads and smooth them over the surface of your skin so that the wrinkles are relaxed underneath not squished together or held in their current wrinkle state. I found having put the very light layer of argan oil on a few hours before gives me even more dramatic results each night but to much and it won&#x27;t stick so remember to use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Don&#x27;t pull at your skin when taking them off in the morning. For the eye area you will want to pull from your inner eye outward. Gently hold down the skin towards your inner lower eye, slip your nail under the tip of the pad that&#x27;s under your eye and gently peal it off. I like to put a soothing eye gel on while I eat my breakfast and workout in the morning after I removed the pads. My current fave has cucumbers in it. It&#x27;s not totally necessary but you did just have something kind of sticky on your under eye area so I like to make sure the skin is taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this all helps and makes sense to you. I love these patches and after using them night after night until I get to what I wanted I now use them a week here and a week there as needed.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 nights in a row and I&#x27;m starting to see a difference.  The package does not come with the picture, so the first night I placed the patches in the wrong places and upside down.  Lesson learned - print the diagram or sketch it out and leave it with the product in your drawer somewhere.  They do stay on during the night.  I place the half moon patches under my eyes and WOW, the next morning - no puffy eyes!  Great to use before bed if you&#x27;d had a night of drinking or staying up too late for whatever reason - your eyes will look relaxed the next day with NO PUFFINESS!  I&#x27;m not getting very good results between the eyebrows and was hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay the bucks for Botox.  The other area that I tried on my own was taking a half moon patch and place it upside down on the upper lip to help with those little fine lines.  It&#x27;s really working.  It has diminished the fine lines to over 50%.  So to close this review, you just have to experiement with them to see where they are most effective.  Knowing my skin is soaking in this ingredient for 8 hours undisturbed seems to make sense and I have seen proof on areas of my face that it&#x27;s working.  They patches do last through 2-3 uses and continue to stick well.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> wanted to intially get frownies however from past experience i recalled how they werent the best at staying on overnight, was very pleased by how they stuck on for the whole night,,very important to make sure you clean your face thoroughly before applying because even after a scrub and a face mask the natural oil is inevitable and the dirtier your face is the less it will stick, does a decent job for the crease in my forehead and am waiting to see how it affects the minor wrinkles on the side of my eyes and lines on my mouth,,noticed with my still young age(22) facial excersizes like stretching and holding for 2 minutes at a time does the trick, however this certaintly doesnt hurt the early fight against wrinkles</li>
    <li> Just ok.  Not what I thought it would do.</li>
    <li> MY FEELING THE MORNING AFTER USING THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The patches are very easy to put on and painless to take off. I liked the feeling of the areas where I have lines being taut while the patches were on. I actually felt better with them on. They are so nice I could wear them all day if I never left the apartment! When I pulled them off in the morning my skin was smooth and pores were smaller but of course the lines reappear as the day goes on. I am not sure if they have an effect long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A WEEK OR SO LATER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I only got one use out of strips. I tried washing them like some other reviewers said but that did not work for me. Therefore, it is completely impractical to use these strips on a regular basis. You get 6 long strips which I used for my forehead lines. Unfortunately, I have 3 forehead lines I wanted to attack which meant I was only able to use the forehead strips twice. They give you four small ones that are like dots which I used at the corner of my eyes so again I only got two days use out of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of money I would have to spend a month to use these strips every night would make getting botox (not planning to do that anytime soon) the more economical choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice idea. Way too expensive to be practical.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the numerous great reviews. When I received it I realised it&#x27;s just scotch tape/ cellotape?? I thought there would be some kind of anti wrinkle gel on it. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m putting it on wrong as there are no instructions with it, but nothing happened. But then again why I thought putting a bit of scotch tape on my face would do anything is beyond me....</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. Probably depends alot on age and skin type...but worth a try. Just remember to use daily for best results.</li>
    <li> Returned after using once.  Putting these patches under the eye just tore at the sensitive skin there when patch was removed.  After first experience, did not use again.</li>
    <li> Not as good as advertised!</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me. Was very dissappointed in the results and u can only use them once, also hard to sleep with them on.</li>
    <li> I dont have wrinkles near my eyes, just tired eyes from insomnia. But I do have those parenthesis around my mouth. I used these on both my eyes anyway and around the mouth and now I have eye wrinkles and the lines around my mouth are more pronounced. WTFreak! Thankfully they were inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old. I&#x27;ve tried several filling options to get rid of fine lines.. all of them both expensive and painful.&lt;br /&gt;I must say I wasn&#x27;t very optimistic about this patches when I bought them..but I was curious about its reviews. The results I got are amazing! If you wear them overnight you will be stunned at the way your face will look in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;They are also helping me with the open pores on my nose and an acne scar I had for years is almost gone after a week of continuos use. I wish full sheets of a unique shape were available too.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on November 2012 and I am still using it but it doesn&#x27;t have the effect I expected by reading the recommendations and good reviews here on Amazon. I use the stickers for my front head  before going to bed every night and every morning when I dettach  them from my skin the lines on my front head skin are not there and of course because of the pressure of the stickers they are suppressed some how but after a few minutes they come back and I don&#x27;t see them even get any better.</li>
    <li> I use them on blemishes that are healing and they help the process along dramatically. I just cut the peices into the shape I need.  I found the under-eye use to be uncomfortable and it hurt to remove them. BUT, I have very tender skin.</li>
    <li> No instructions came with these.  Just ads for other junky products.  I purchased these after reading about these in reviews for Furlesse.  I prefer Furlesse,</li>
    <li> I have a few deep frown lines and thought this might help soften them.  My best guess as the before and after pictures is, the woman is still wearing the patch in the after picture thus creating the &amp;#34;immediate results&amp;#34;!  For me, I placed the patches on before bed and the next morning the original wrinkle was noticeably softer but there was another crease next to the patch!  So, I tried it again making sure I wasn&#x27;t stretching the skin or bunching it under the patch. Same result.  They make your face look better while you are wearing them but haven&#x27;t done much once taken off.  And, no, you can&#x27;t wear them in public under your makeup!</li>
    <li> These essentially work but . . . They aren&#x27;t repeatedly reusable and depending on exactly how I place them and how I sleep the cause other puffy areas or creases.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading what results it would produce.  I used the product for 2 straight weeks and after removing the strips I would only see 10 minutes of results and then my skin went back to the way it was before.  I have contacted Amazaon and they will get me my refund.  I would never recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
    <li> I am on my second box of these little miracles. I highly covet as they work great. I bought first as I have headaches and along with that came furrows after an attack. This did help A lot, I pull the skin apart when I apply. I have to admit I usually haven&#x27;t put all of them on but might start so look for an update. Tired of creams that promise miracles that are short term? Throw out the jar. These work long term. Meaning --- they will KEEP YOU FROM GETTING DEEPER FURROWS OR LINES. IMPRESSED- NO PUN INTENDED.</li>
    <li> The patches are definitely more comfortable than the frownies. They work great and I love the results! I would suggest having more patches within each set because supposedly you are able to use them \\&quot;more than once\\&quot; as the directions state, when really I can only get one great use and then it&#x27;s gone to waste.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure how long-term the results are, this product really does work! I wore several patches to bed one night, and woke up very pleasantly surprised. I wish it was more affordable to use every day, because the patches run out quickly. I almost gave 4 stars for this reason. But it still deserves 5 for being the only thing I have ever tried that actually makes lines vanish!!! :D</li>
    <li> These won, hands down.  At first I didn&#x27;t think that would be the case as they seemed relatively thin and flimsy, with less stick and less coverage, but they are decidedly more comfortable to wear at night, I wake up truly wrinkle free, and the kicker is...it really gets better and better each day that I use them.  I have ordered more.  These are my new favorite go-to anti-anging trick.</li>
    <li> Wore these to bed last night and I looked 10X worse went I woke up!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be giving these another try.</li>
    <li> I have used frownies for over 10 years and I liked them enough to be a repeat user, but never loved them.  They are a little uncomfortable and very unsightly.  Plus, as the years have gone by they have gotten much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I was shopping for more frownies when I came across the DermaGen.  I liked the variety of the patches as there are only 3 types with Frownies.  I also liked how the reviews said they were reusable.  I bought a pack well over a month ago now.  I love them.  They are easier to apply then frownies as all I have to do is peel and stick and with frownies I had to get them wet, but not too wet then hold in place.  I have re-used several many, many times, others seem to fade after about 3-4 uses. I am happy with this as frownies were only a one time use product.  They are a more pleasing color, however, I would like to note they start looking grungy after a few uses.  This does not appear to affect the product though, so I can deal with that.  What I am really excited about is the versatility of the patches.  I can use them on my neck which is beginning to show some wrinkling and on the forehead lines.  My major goal is to keep the line between my eyebrow away and these do this perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t used them on the neck enough to give an opinion on how well they work, but for the fine lines at the corners of the eyes and between the eyebrows, they do the job they are supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies before but when I ran out I decided to try this product. Very disappointing result. First, they don&#x27;t stay in place. And while people say they are more comfortable to use than Frownies because they&#x27;re soft, true but for the same reason they were ineffective. They didn&#x27;t prevent me from frowning while sleeping. In fact, my frown lines were worse when I woke up. Since they were soft and just followed the distortion on my forehead and sealed my frown lines in place. I don&#x27;t know why I frown during sleep but I do. So back to Frownies for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for about a month and I feel like they are really working. I like the result I get. They are much better then those paper ones. I&#x27;m the wife and I&#x27;m using them not Pete.</li>
    <li> Only last 10 days. It is a good product except that they come in low quantities. That is all I want to say.</li>
    <li> I love this patches . They do what is promised . Good material reusables .</li>
    <li> It is certainly true what the other reviewers have said about these DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches...they deliver the same results as injections, but no pain and much, much cheaper.  They are comfortable (I sleep in mine), they don&#x27;t irritate the skin, and they miraculously vanish forehead lines and frown lines!  Try them and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
    <li> I have been using these great patches during the night as suggested; I find them much more comfortable than frownies and very easy to clean and reuse. I have also found that they increase the efficacy of my Botox injections so that I need less Botox less frequently. I have also started wearing the frown patch during my workouts as my face tries to frown when I am concentrating; now I have no movement during my workouts.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.  Very cheap product.  description didn&#x27;t describe accurately what they were.  Would never buy these again.  waste of money</li>
    <li> been lookig for it price was  good delivery excellent</li>
    <li> Temporary, wrinkle free until you make ANY facial movements, then back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; you, no pun intended...lol!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW !!! After seeing reviews of this product, I figured I would try this for only 9.95. I wore them last nite and when I woke up the lines on my forehead and mouth area had disappeared. I am waiting to see how long it lasts, but very happy so far. I will buy more and agree with other people suggesting they make only certain shapes to purchase.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;m an avid buyer of many items on Amazon, etc., I rarely write reviews.  I just rarely have anything wonderful to report.  Years ago, when I hit 40, I tried an eye cream for \\&quot;puffy eyes\\&quot; that I had a horrible reaction to and it took my eyes over a week to look anywhere near normal again.  I was petrified to ever try anything other than olive oil after that. I have a low thyroid, which blesses me with puffy under eyes every morning.  When I did some research recently, I saw the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  Well, when I received the little package, I really wasn&#x27;t impressed, there aren&#x27;t even any directions but held my breath and tried them...WOW, they worked!  No redness and no puffy eyes the next morning!  I won&#x27;t be without them now.  I already ordered another package.  I ony wish they offered the circular eye patches separately, but I did try applying the others as the picture suggested and was pleased as well.  Give them a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> I am still experimenting with the patches but so far I am not impressed. I would probably would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used Frownies for years and thought I would try these based off the reviews.  They didn&#x27;t work for me.  The patch between the brows was not big enough. I even tried to put two together.  I was disappointed.  I think I will stick with the Frownies that I know work for me.</li>
    <li> Using for over a week.  Look great in the morning holds well throughout the day.  Give them a try you will be happy....without the lines.</li>
    <li> These just arent strong enough to hold the facial expressions I have at night. I would use them and still see wrinkles. Use the frownies. They work better and you get way more for your money!,,</li>
    <li> I like these patches because they are very comfortable to wear while your sleeping, and they really do their job, I have very pronounced frown lines and I have noticed that with constant use they seem to be less noticeable, so I&#x27;m going to keep on using them and hopefully I&#x27;ll get even better results.</li>
    <li> These patches barely stick and do nothing for wrinkles or complexion. Very disappointed. Packaging was very &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; looking. Arrived stuck on plastic sheets inside a padded envelope. Waste of money for sure</li>
    <li> I am not sure about this product.  I cannot reuse them as they do not stick once I peel them off. So i went throught the product really fast and feel it is too expensive to use on a nightly basis.</li>
    <li> can see them ... hard to cover but in dark places perfect</li>
    <li> I used this patches for some time - no positive results at all. I&#x27;ll never buy it in a future, it was just weisting money .</li>
    <li> CANNOT REUSE THESE, WISH IT WORKED</li>
    <li> Luv the Derma-gen anti-wrinkle patches.&lt;br /&gt;Better than Frownies. Reusable. Simple 2 use.Don&#x27;t hurt or irritate when removed. Amazing results. Told my friends. Ordering more. Don&#x27;t plan 2 be without.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really great product. I apply it every night before bed on smile lines and between the eyebrows, and I wake up with a suer fresh face, these &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; just give you that baby fresh face that is plump! I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> Don´t expect a lasting improvement, the effect is barely noticeable for a couple of days. I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> These do work if you wear them most nights.  I just put them on right before turning out the light.  They are comfortable to wear.  Would be good to wear before a night out too!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I needed a cream with it.  I squint so hard at night I wrinkle and contour the patches.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom who is in her 60s.  After a week of use, her friends have been asking her if she is using botox.  She is a fan!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use on acne and acne scarring.  Placing the product over acne helps to heal and eliminate acne break outs substantially faster. For me, it eliminates break outs in as little as one or two days. In addition, this product is helping acne scars to lighten.  I am amazed by this product, and after making my initial purchase, bought 3 more packages less than a week later to insure that I do not run out.  I may try this product on my fine lines, but for now am soley using the product on acne and scars. I could not be more delighted! I feel like I have found a miracle!</li>
    <li> After reading all the recommendations for this product on Amazon, I ordered a few sets, and have been using them for the last few nights.  So far, so good.  My primary goal is to minimize crows feet/undereye lines, which I&#x27;ve made worse because of scrunching my face into the pillow at night.  So I&#x27;m using mostly the crescent moon shaped patches, and I&#x27;ve also used some of the smaller round dots for adult acne spots (they are surprisingly effective for helping to flatten and get rid of those spots, by the way).  I haven&#x27;t had any problem getting the patches to adhere to my face well enough to make it through the night.  After using an eye cream, the delicate part is to VERY gently touch the skin under my eyes to minimize the wrinkles, then carefully apply the patch.  In the morning, when I slowly remove the patches, the lines are all gone, just as mentioned by other reviewers.  Unfortunately, the effect doesn&#x27;t last long, but I&#x27;m hopeful that with time and practice the lines will become less noticeable for longer periods of time.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve ordered more sets of the patches, because they do work for me as advertised and are comfortable enough for me to sleep in.</li>
    <li> This will be my third order of the Dermagen Patches. I cant be without them! With allergy and age, I have very pronounced bags under my eyes, also lip lines. Wear these at night...and they are gone in the morning! I also like wearing them before I go out..smooths away the age lines.</li>
    <li> Bought this on a whim. Definitley works better with each use. Stays on all night. I have used each patch over 3 times.</li>
    <li> I purchased DermaGen Anti-Wrinkle Patches based on all of the rave reviews. They arrived quick and the packaging was sufficient. I did have to go to YouTube to see the placement of the patches the first time I used them. They are very easy to use once you figure out which shape goes where. They were comfortable to wear through the night and stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have deep wrinkles already and I also placed them over acne scars to experiment. In the morning the wrinkles were smoothed out, as well as the acne scars. The effect lasted a few hours. I will be wearing them overnight and before I going out at night. I have already placed an order for two more packages!</li>
    <li> Not as good as frownies. this product seems like a better idea with the gel and all but in the end it doesn&#x27;t smooth the lines/wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;better than frownies, and I&#x27;m not so sure about reusing them. I tried the second time and it didn&#x27;t stick as well, plus it seems to wrinkle if you leave them on too long (not overnight) then the area has MORE lines than before.  None of this is true with frownies.</li>
    <li> Not only are they fragile and tend to bend and stick together, but they can only be used twice. You will need several packages of the strips to achieve the desired results. Not sure that I will re-purchage them.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with the results the morning after using the patches.  Hopefully they will continue to improve my eye area. Good results so far after one week.</li>
    <li> They say they are reusable but they are not. They lose their &#x27;sticky&#x27; quality after one wear.</li>
    <li> These are so comfortable, and reusable to boot.  My Frownies weren&#x27;t comfy at all.  I love these and will keep buying them.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> If you need a short term facelift, they do work. Long term...probably not. Short Term effects are pretty good !!</li>
    <li> These work really well to minimize wrinkles if you use them each night when you sleep. They&#x27;re more expensive than other brands and require a little &amp;#34;TLC&amp;#34; if you want to re-use them. However, if you take good care of them, they can last you more than one use.</li>
    <li> The strips aren&#x27;t as strong as I expected and if applied incorrectly cause more harm than good. They also have a tendency to wrinkle up after applied.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for several months. I work the early morning shift, and I think they make me look more rested at 3am. The skin is baby soft when you peel them back. I put them between my eyes and my 11 lines disappear completely. I also take the eye ones and put one on my top lip. I wish the triangles were bigger. I love them.</li>
    <li> The undereye and patches made other indents on the side of my eyes.  The forehead patch between the eyes lasted about 30 minutes and then the wrinkles came back.  This does not work.</li>
    <li> I used it just as the directions stated but saw no difference at all.  They may work for some people but they did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> These work OK. but nothing dramatic to report. The sad thing is the pads don&#x27;t last very long 1 to 3 uses is it and there isn&#x27;t much to package maybe 2 weeks usage total. I wont buy again...</li>
    <li> This is exciting stuff. I think people react differently to this kind of product, but I tested it out on a scar and on wrinkles. The effect was amazing. No, the perfected appearance doesn&#x27;t last, but 3 days later, it still seems improved. I have to assume with continued use, I might see a long-term benefit.</li>
    <li> They work well enough, but they need more sizes, and more options for purchasing. You should be able to buy a package of just one shape if that&#x27;s all you need instead of having to pay for the shapes you can&#x27;t use.They need many more sheets per package to make it a better value, because they don&#x27;t last for days. For me, the stick wears off after the first night.</li>
    <li> they actually do the job they claim to but save your money.. they work but they can only be used once... scotch tap is all the rage these days... read up on that and buy a roll because i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more effective and cheaper than this...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results.  There was absolutely no change whatsoever from when I put them on to when I took them off.  How can a sticky peice of rubber get rid of wrinkles???  I was fooled.  Over priced for sticky rubber.</li>
    <li> They did not work and kept falling off.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy these patches for my hubby to use them on his 11 lines, this was in September, so far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement at all,</li>
    <li> Not a permanent solution works until you wash your face.  Uncomfortable to wear and left red marks. If applied incorrectly can cause heavy wrinkling that lasts for about a day.</li>
    <li> Good item to prevent wrinkles from setting in. Better than Frownies, which as many others have mentioned, do fall off in the middle of the night.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I&#x27;ve used Frownies before, and when I could get the Frownies just right, the wrinkle between my eyebrows would smooth out. The Frownies were too inconsistent in getting them to stick just right, so I tried these. With regular use, they somehow trained my frown muscles to not crease the way they have been for forever. I don&#x27;t see that nasty line between my eyebrows when I see myself in video or the mirror anymore. Even if I have to go a couple of days without them because I run out, the &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; sticks...but not for long.  I&#x27;ll be using these until I can afford Botox, and then hopefully to stretch that out! I haven&#x27;t used the ones other than the triangles for between your eyes, and I wish you could buy a sheet of just those. I&#x27;ve saved the ones for other parts of your face for when I feel up to tackling those areas that are less pressing than my eyebrow issue.  Having to buy the ones I don&#x27;t use to me wasn&#x27;t worth taking off a star, though. They just work so nicely. I like that they&#x27;re clear, too.  Makes me feel like less of a dork wearing them! Plus, the merchant is a fast shipper, friendly, reliable, and since I&#x27;ve purchased so many sheets, they sent me a complimentary one this time.  If you&#x27;re unwilling or unable to do Botox, these are a pretty cool alternative.  It&#x27;s helped my self-esteem! I hope this helps you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while. It does work. It makes huge difference. I wish I had before-picture. i have tried other similar products and this one is the best. I Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> I have a fair, combination skin, and I am almost 30. I already have fine lines on my forehead because I frown a lot! So I have several of them, but it&#x27;s just on my forehead. I used all the patches and cut some to fit better. They say you can use the same twice so I did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it does improve the lines. However, I agree with other reviews that say that it is more evident in the morning (after you remove them) and fades during the day. You may be fine with that but I don&#x27;t like this Cinderella effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, I&#x27;d prefer a big one covering the whole forehead. In the morning you can actually see the place where the patches were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even think that there was an overall effect of reducing the lines, but I think it is inconvenient to use and aesthetically ugly. So I personally prefer to apply creams instead, but if you are considering more aggressive interventions, than it may be a cheaper, but also less effective, alternative.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have tried frownies and they do not stick and they are very noticeable when you wear them, dermagens are reusable and blend with skin and stick very well. I notice my forehead is much smoother in the morning. I will continue using these</li>
    <li> Work great! I like how thin they are as other brands that are thicker leave compression lines. Side note: My husband used a strip for a blister from new shoes! Stayed on all day with no pain. (Get your own these are mine) ;-)</li>
    <li> I am a stomach sleeper, thus I always wake up with deep creases under my eyes, on my brow and also on cheeks from my face pushing on my pillow eight hours a day.. Until I started using these patches. they stay put all night as long as your face is clean, they can be used quite a few times before losing the adhesive, and they dont break me out or irritate my skin. I love not having wrinkles under my eyes every morning.&lt;br /&gt;CosmeSearch sent them within hours after I placed my order, and I will be using these as long as they keep making them!</li>
    <li> Very few patches that don&#x27;t fit intended area and do not work. After using all of them absolutely no difference. Wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money. Surgical tape between the brows at bedtime works just as well and a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I used the whole package with no results.  This product did not work for me and what a hassle to use.</li>
    <li> This product is not recommended. It failed to deliver the results promised. Frownie&#x27;s actually work and I would recommend them whole heartedly. This product is very overpriced and ineffective. Save your money.</li>
    <li> I do like the product, but I would love to be able to buy just the triangle shaped ones for between the brows and it would be fantastic if they were a little wider across the bottom of the triangle like the Frownies brand. I prefer the size and shape of the Frownies and the fact that I can get a package of just the between the borrow triangles, I have no use for the other ones in the pack and have used all the triangles and am left with all the others now. I probably will not buy again until they have a package of JUST triangles. And as I mentioned I&#x27;d buy them ALL THE TIME if they were the same size as the Frownies. Otherwise, I do like the product and would recommend them to anyone who had use of all the patches and I would mention that I felt the size of the triangles were a bit smaller than the more effective size of the Frownies.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> i now have two white blotches underneath my eyes from wearing the patches as described. customer service was useless, i have to see my dermatologist for further treatment. i would be highly cautious using this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the derma gen anti wrinkle patches! I have been using them now for over three years! I use to use the paper frownies! The dermagen are so comfortable and flexible! My friends who are ten years younger can&#x27;t believe they have more wrinkles them me!</li>
    <li> These did not stay on well for me.  I had trouble keeping them on even though I let my moisturizer dry.  I prefer the Furlesse and Frownies line.</li>
    <li> This product is great to smooth out fine lines and wrinkles and I recommend it!  I put the little patches on at night and remove them in the morning.  Each package lasts a long time even though I don&#x27;t reuse them, they could be rinsed and reused.</li>
    <li> I did like this product i didN&#x27;t see a difference before and know.Very like to orderthis again sorry but it doesn t meen it not god.</li>
    <li> This product met my expectation. Use them when I want to have a fresh look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician..I understand cleaning the skin before applying patches and such. These were very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She put on crows feet, one on forehead, and tried one marionette line patch. Out of 4 only two were still on in the morning and those were the two crows feet small oval shaped patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the adhesive totally made my eyes puffy the morning after as well. I never get eyes like that. Felt like my skin had a reaction to the sticky material.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say that but: this is BETTER than botox. I have been using botox for a while and it reduced its potency over time around my eyes. However this thing worked!!! It is the only product I experienced to literally eliminate wrinkles over night. I recommend highly!!! Thank you DermaGen and CosmeSearch!</li>
    <li> I think I understand this product now....well I will not purchase it again, but to use good cream, humidifier and some gentle face massage.&lt;br /&gt;Yet if you are not patient enough to do these, this might work for you! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, I didn&#x27;t find it very re-useable, and I have neutral to dry skin tone, not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I did not see a difference when I used this</li>
    <li> Perfect! A+A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I have gone through 2 full packs and just placed my reorder. I only used each patch one time to start  and now I am reusing waiting on my new order to arrive.  Your eyes will look fantastic in the morning when you take them off!  It does not last all day but gradually the entire area will improve over the next week or two,there is a certain difference in 20 days of use.  I cleanse and moisturize including eye cream,wait for 20 mins to let it absorb and then sleep in the patches.  I leave them on as long as I can when I get up in the morning too. I have also before a night out worn them for about 5 hours at home and still get good results as well.  I am 42 and have nice skin but I am also a side sleeper and get the terrible pillow wrinkles under my eyes!  I dont even have crows feet or lip wrinkles but sleeping with your face smushed into a pillow is harsh on your delicate eye area.  I use to have these Biore ones but they went off the market and have not used anything like this for much too long.  They are VERY sticky and completely comfortable. Be very,very careful when removing them as it does pull and can irrate your skin,kind of like removing a band aid.  I have not had any bad reactions or have any complaints about this product.  They are affordable and effective, not perfect but really good and totally worth the price!!</li>
    <li> I used frownies the first time and didn&#x27;t like them much. Then, I found this, I started using them and I love them so much, gave some to my Mom which is stricter than me on using them daily.&lt;br /&gt;Recently we visited some relatives and they asked me if my mom had a plastic surgery or Botox. I laugh of course, but I know she looks awesome and she is 62, twenty years more than me. At that time she used them only for about a month. For me I am barely having some wrinkles so hopefully using this I don&#x27;t get more during the years coming.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this 100%, now I am giving this to my aunts too! :)</li>
    <li> These are very effective at preventing the lines caused by scrunching your face up as you sleep!  Easy to use, nice that they are reusable.  The only thing I would prefer is if they came in some kind of box rather than just a sheet.  But still - a great product!</li>
    <li> I am usually a little hesitant to buy these type of patches but I was talked into it. I used them last week and they actually worked a little. The lines between my eyes seemed less and the mouth to nose creases were significantly diminished. They were a little uncomfortable to sleep in like I thought they might be. The only downside was that the effects only lasted a couple of hours. Still it is a pleasant way to start the day so I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews I decided to try it.  The first night I used the arches Under my Eyes.  When I woke up and removed them, I honestly saw such a great improvement with my fine lines.  This product seems to plump the wrinkles out and I looked Incredibly Refreshed.  The second night I tried the patches under my eyes and along my smile lines. Same Results!  I&#x27;m so incredibly pleased with this product I immediately ordered more and told my friends.  ~I don&#x27;t want to be without this!  I just wish they made a full mask!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it had great reviews and thought I &#x27;d give it a try. The manufacturer suggested to sleep with them over night but the problem with that is it creates new creases around the product. They do stick really well and that wasn&#x27;t a problem but I had a new line on my forehead when I woke up. I will never be using these again.</li>
    <li> These little patches are awesome!  They are very comfortable to sleep in, stay on even over products, and can be used again and again.  They have really helped to soften my crows and lines around my mouth, which I&#x27;m sorry to report I have.  Great little product which I plan to stay stocked-up on.</li>
    <li> tried these because of the great reviews on Amazon.  I tried them and wow!  I woke up with no wrinkles!  Yes the results are temporary and sometimes by midday and sometimes by the afternoon, the affects wear off.  Also sometimes there are lines in the shape of the patch around where the patch was.  Although this is supposed to be temporary, results for me in the past few months seem to be more and more permanent.  I have applied wrinkle reducer (I used one of my creams: Neutrogena night cream, ROC night cream, and Olay Regenerist) before putting the patch right on top of it.  I think it helps my skin to absorb the creams.</li>
    <li> They are ok but for the money and comfort, don&#x27;t work that well.  They were ok but I would use other things first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Frownies for years and with good results between the eyes but I was looking for something that worked better for other areas of the face - below the eyes, n/l lines, etc.... I put these babies on under my eyes and the next morning when I pulled them off I pulled off with a SCREAM!  Worse than taking off a bandaid - in fact duct tape would have felt the same.  Don&#x27;t bother - just make your own or find another patch - sorry, didn&#x27;t work for me and was a waste of money. I am asking vendor for approval to return for refund.  I hope they have as good a return policy as Amazon when you shop straight from them instead of through a 3rd party.  Will let you know what they say.</li>
    <li> Save your money and get another product or save your money even more and just use first aid tape.  I looked on line and found that each patch can be used 2-3 times but isn&#x27;t that like leaving your make up on overnight?  Not so happy with this.</li>
    <li> I was quite excited when i woke up and it appeared the lines/wrinkles were gone, but then , like some of the other reviews sadly the lines were back by dinner time;(</li>
    <li> I have been using Frownies between my eyebrows for years, and while they do the job they are kind of ugly. So when I saw these patches, and after reading the reviews, I had high expectations. Well ... they may work on the forehead and around the nose, but if you have strong muscles to frown with these are not enough to keep you from doing it. What is worse is that it can happen that a wavy frown gets fixated over night. So I&#x60;m back to Frownies.</li>
    <li> I just wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money. I should have taken the time to read the negative remarks and have learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> The work beautiful, In the past I try another brand of patches but these patches are the best. I looking forward to buy others Dermagen products.</li>
    <li> These patches work well.  I put them on at night, and in the morning, you can barely see my wrinkles.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t last.  After an hour or so, those wrinkles are back.  Maybe over time, they would make a difference ( or if you could use them day and night).  The package says you can re-use the patches, but I find that they don&#x27;t stick well a second time.  Also, you need to use these on a clean face so you can&#x27;t apply lotion underneath.</li>
    <li> This product is somewhat helpful.  It is not one that is going to erase any wrinkles but they will smoother in the morning when you wake up.  That is always nice, but by afternoon the wrinkles will be back.  I specifically wear them to keep the wrinkles from getting deeper over night. So that is what I hope is happening.  They are not a cure!</li>
    <li> Not worth it for the price - prefer Frownies</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used these for four nights.  I have seen the most difference in my nasolabial folds.  I usually am drawn to notice them in the mirror, but since using these they have not been as striking in their depth to me.  I think these patches might be helping.  Was hoping they could do more for my crow&#x27;s feet, but maybe needs more time.  I like how soft they feel on my skin, and how smoothed my wrinkles are when first removing them.  I am hoping in time to see more dramatic results over my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tried using this a couple times with another cream under it and it actually made my skin have a reaction with redness and dry scaly patches that took a few days to clear up.  I used it again after without any cream under it and it seemed to be fine again.  I just don&#x27;t recommend using this with another cream under it unless it is recommended.  At least the creams I tried in conjunction with these patches were too much for my skin. I think it&#x27;s best to use these patches alone and not try to mix them with any other face cream.</li>
    <li> I used the patches on 4 different places on my face and left them on all night for 5 nights in a row and nothing different.  Some of them easily came off and don&#x27;t know if I put them on right or not.  They just didn&#x27;t work.  Maybe I expected something to happen too soon, but they were very uncomfortable to leave on for so long for nothing good to have happened.  My deep wrinkles are still deep and I really don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll work no matter how long I use them for.  Only lazer and surgery would probably do me any good, especially the nose to mouth vertical lines, I think only lazer resurfacing will work on those.  Seller ended up refunding my money and nothing was to be returned.  Very good guarantee and seller helpful.  Thank you.</li>
