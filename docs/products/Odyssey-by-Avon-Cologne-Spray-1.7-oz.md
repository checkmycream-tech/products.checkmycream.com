    <li> My order came when it was supposed to per email from amazon. Intact and ready to be sprayed. Thx☺</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. I been wearing this perfume from Avon for 10 years +. I love it and the price and shipping were excellent!! I&#x27;m a happy customer and will buy again from seller. A+</li>
    <li> Love it came on time.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my mother and she thought it was men&#x27;s cologne :-) I didn&#x27;t like it as I thought it smelled like an old people&#x27;s home . Gave it 2 star - one for afford and one for safe and quick delivery .</li>
    <li> If you want a soft smelling perfume that gets noticed odyssey is always the best. Got tons of compliments on it!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents so exotic for older sexy ladies......</li>
    <li> I had never tried Odyssey, it was advertised as smelling like mimosa, but to me it does not.  and, again, it does not last very long.  may just be the wrong product for me</li>
    <li> I have worn this cologne for years and I always get compliments on it! One of my co-workers had stated that I smelled as if I just stepped out of  the shower!</li>
    <li> Perfume from my childhood that brings back memories.  I remember why I like it so much the fresh scent is refreshing and smooth and subtle.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this for years now!  Love the smell</li>
    <li> I have loved this scent since I was 14 and still love it 30 years later.  At this price I will be ordering more.  It&#x27;s a timeless fragrance that receives many compliments when I wear it.  Soft and feminine but not too flowery or sickly sweet.  More of a crisp, clean woodsy smell of Lily of the Valley with a tinge of musk.  I hope Avon never stops making this.  Some people says it lasts all day but sometimes I have to refresh mine because it seems to wear off after about 6 hours on me.  But that isn&#x27;t an issue because the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> So many compliments when wearing this</li>
    <li> Odyssey has been the only perfume I have used forever. People recognize it when they are near me and often tell me it smells so good. My daughter had a friend take her on an errand one day. When she got in the car she told the girl that it smelled like her mom in there. It was an odyssey air freshener. Made my daughter smile.</li>
    <li> Odyssey smells so good. There&#x27;s nothing grandma about it. Maybe one associates Odyssey with grandma because grandma wore it but heck I know/knew teens that wore this and women of varying ages throughout the years. It&#x27;s a clean scent, a touch of musk, soap, and something sort of fruity. The bottle is ugly but this is a classic scent for sure :) And for a bargain. Love you, Odd-ball Odyssey perfume!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years. Fresh and light. This is a classic scent. I would recommend it to those who want a light cologne.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because it was my mother&#x27;s favorite. She passed away April 2014. I wear it when I want to feel close to her. Smells clean and beautiful just like her.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied on the time &amp; product</li>
    <li> Excellent product and timely shipping!</li>
    <li> i did not like the smell at all ..</li>
    <li> I have been using Odyssey Cologne Spray, by Avon every since it first came on the market.  I will continue to buy it on Amazon.com.  Thanbk you so much.</li>
    <li> Someone gifted me this perfume many years ago and I loved it. Light but noticeable, it brings on the compliments!! I used it sparingly but now since I can order it online, I did! Am so pleased with it. Definitely a 5 on 5. Will order more as I go through this bottle! Thanks, Avon, for Odyssey!</li>
    <li> I used to wear this years ago and still think this is my favorite Avon perfume. I have noticed that it seems to have very little staying power.  I use it as a room spray and it works well and the price is very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Just as I remember it. This was my mom&#x27;s favorite, thanks for the memories!</li>
    <li> Wife ordered a couple of bottles. Smells fresh and clean, not heavy. She wears it almost daily.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected,  delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> I  like odyssey by avon  because the scent is sutle and not over bearing . I have used this fragrance for many years and people still stop me and ask me what perfume I am wearing.It smells so clean.</li>

    <li> Very excellent fragrance, I do get a lot of compliment whenever I wear this item</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. My brother&#x27;s girlfriend wore it in the 80s and my mom bought some. We all wore it. I hadn&#x27;t smelled any in so long and decided to buy some. I put it on and it takes me right back to the 80s. It smells genuinely GOOD. A couple sprays lasts all day. Highly recommended for anyone who likes soft musk and lily of the valley.</li>
