      <li>fast and easy to use.  </li>

      <li>It&#x27;s worth ordering online if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
      <li>I really like these soap pads to clean the tub with.</li>
      <li>and it will clean my whole tub.</li>
      <li>This is a great little product that is perfect for a situation where you just need to get the tub/shower clean, though it seems a bit much for daily cleaning, especially when one considers there are only four pads in a package.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without using a face mask and gloves.</li>
      <li>It arrived promptly in 2 days, and I was ready to scrub months worth of grime and dirt away.      </li>
      <li>so they are fast and economical to use.  </li>
      <li>I guess I expected something more powerful.</li>

      <li>My only problem is that I can no longer purchase it in the store where I originally bought it.</li>
      <li>I proceeded to clean my entire bathroom and kitchen counter with just one scrub.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend to anyone who has allergies to chemical cleaners.  </li>
      <li>I love these little pads, they work so well in my shower.</li>
      <li>It got my needing to be scrubbed glass,tile, and fiberglass looking new again.  </li>
      <li>moved in my new place</li>
      <li>I thought I would try this product and to my amazement it looked like I had new doors</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to fumes from cleaning products.  </li>
      <li>My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t show any reactions to the scrubber material or the soap, and there was no offensive scent either.  </li>
      <li>so I wanted to scrub pretty much everything down in my shower.</li>
      <li>and I guess the people before didn&#x27;t clean their mess..</li>
      <li>With little notice, my parents were caming to visit, and I needed to clean my apartment (especially kitchen and bathroom) and fast.  </li>
      <li>so you&#x27;re not left with even more soap scum.  </li>
      <li>After the kitchen and bathroom were finished, the scrub was still completely intact, but I tossed it anyway knowing what a giant battle is had just fought.  </li>
      <li>The only trouble I have is if I don&#x27;t clean it on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>But it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple idea, little more than your average scrubbing pad that includes soap.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s soap on the scrubber, so no other cleaning products were necessary.  </li>
      <li>I had a heavy duty job on my hands, due to an intense work schedule that left much of my apartment in complete disarray for months.  </li>

<li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to wet the sponge.</li>
<li> My bathroom tiles dry and look  like glass after using these pads.</li>
<li> That is where you will have trouble with the soap not lasting very long.</li>
<li> I use it a couple times a week in my bathroom sinks....</li>
<li> It even scrubbed off SOME of a deep water stain (which I knew I would need a stronger heavy duty product for)</li>
<li> There&#x27;s enough soap to do the scrubbing, and very little rinsing</li>
<li> If I just wet down the tub and walls and not the sponge</li>
<li> That helps a lot to wet down the walls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> just wet down the tub, and scrub away.</li>
<li> The accumulated grime on my tub, which was impossible to fully remove with some other scrubs, came off easily with this little scrubber.  </li>
<li> I was surprised how well it cleans using only cold water.  </li>
<li> Because I usually get out of work after stores are closed, I Amazon-Primed the 1 Step Rub &amp; Shower Cleaner to work.  </li>
<li> A waste of money and aggravation.</li>
<li> This is for heavy duty situations.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to clean the glass shower doors but they still had water spots because we have very hard water in our area and the other products fumes were terrible.  </li>
<li> I have yet to find a product that can cut through the hard water stains like Zep does and still allow me to breath (I like breathing).</li>
<li> I also use the \\&quot;1 Step Car Cleaner\\&quot; pads and they take all of the hard work out of car washing.</li>
<li> The soap scum doesn&#x27;t come off as well.</li>
<li> I have well water which is very hard.</li>
<li> Tackles the worst soap scum, lasts long and no fumes.</li>
<li> Useless, didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
<li> It cleans as well as other products I have tried that have terrible fumes.</li>
<li> This should be removed because it is crap.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> But for those nasty water stains, it just didn&#x27;t work.  </li>

    <li> Useless, didn&#x27;t do anything. Tried cleaning my tub, which is relatively clean and this product sucked bigtime. Doesnt deliver what it promises.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product that is perfect for a situation where you just need to get the tub/shower clean, though it seems a bit much for daily cleaning, especially when one considers there are only four pads in a package.  This is for heavy duty situations. But it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a simple idea, little more than your average scrubbing pad that includes soap.  However, there are no harsh chemicals, and the pre-soaping is quite mild so you&#x27;re not left with even more soap scum.  There&#x27;s enough soap to do the scrubbing, and very little rinsing I had to afterwards.  Really, it&#x27;s the perfect combination of scrubbing and soap without trying to figure it out yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little product for a good price.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me. I have well water which is very hard. May work better for someone with treated water.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to fumes from cleaning products.  This product is perfect.  It cleans the shower with no fumes.  I had been searching forever for a product I could use that didn&#x27;t make me start coughing and gagging when I cleaned the bathroom.  I don&#x27;t have to search any more.  This product does a Great job cleaning without fumes!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is one-step: sponge, scrubber brush, &amp; cleanser all in one. However, bottom line - it does the job!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I love the fact that there is no chemical smells when cleaning. Everything is definitely one step. I have a fiberglass tub with a smooth finish.&lt;br /&gt;We get a lot of soap that sticks to out bathtub and soap scum.&lt;br /&gt;I just wet down the tub, and scrub away. You definitely don&#x27;t want to wet the sponge. That is where you will have trouble with the soap not lasting very long. If I just wet down the tub and walls and not the sponge and it will clean my whole tub. It comes out really clean. The only trouble I have is if I don&#x27;t clean it on a regular basis. The soap scum doesn&#x27;t come off as well. I also have a removable shower head that I can take on and off. That helps a lot to wet down the walls.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t deserve even one star. Very disappointed. Followed the direction but didn&#x27;t work. My Soft scrub does much better job.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this cleaner. Tackles the worst soap scum, lasts long and no fumes. It&#x27;s worth ordering online if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> My bathroom tiles dry and look  like glass after using these pads. I highly recommend this product to anyone that wants the ease of cleaning and look of shine!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. Not only does it make cleaning the bathtub/shower an easier chore than ever, you don&#x27;t have to deal with any fumes while doing it!! I used to spray my cleaner and then go running from the bathroom in search of breathe-able air. Not anymore. And it is a great cleaner too that actually does work!! I swear by this product. &lt;br /&gt;I also swear by the same manufacturers similar product - the one step car wash sponge. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> The \\&quot;1 Step Tub and Shower Cleaner\\&quot; works great!  I use it a couple times a week in my bathroom sinks....fast and easy to use.  I also get about three or four uses from each pad so they are fast and economical to use.  I also use the \\&quot;1 Step Car Cleaner\\&quot; pads and they take all of the hard work out of car washing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Cleans very well without fumes and burning to face hands, etc. I highly recommend to anyone who has allergies to chemical cleaners.  It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve ever been able to use without using a face mask and gloves. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was surprised how well it cleans using only cold water.  It cleans as well as other products I have tried that have terrible fumes.</li>
    <li> This product is basically 2 in. Cleaning product, and &#x27;tool&#x27;. Does actually scrub great!&lt;br /&gt;I moved in my new place and I guess the people before didn&#x27;t clean their mess.. Im a germ freak so I wanted to scrub pretty much everything down in my shower. Got everything out with just one. It even scrubbed off SOME of a deep water stain (which I knew I would need a stronger heavy duty product for)</li>

After the kitchen and bathroom were finished, the scrub was still completely intact, but I tossed it anyway knowing what a giant battle is had just fought.  My tub and the rest of the bathroom were restored to its sparkling condition prior to my move-in.      Because each bag comes with 4 scrubs (great deal!), I am well stocked for future cleaning projects.  A complete success, these cleaners are highly recommended!</li>
    <li> One step tub &amp; shower works great.  It got my needing to be scrubbed glass,tile, and fiberglass looking new again.  Even my kids noticed.  Very easy, so I just ordered more and ordered the one step car to see if it&#x27;s as easy.</li>

    <li> Do not buy. A waste of money and aggravation. This should be removed because it is crap. I can&#x27;t believe I fell for the bulls*** it said it would do.</li>
