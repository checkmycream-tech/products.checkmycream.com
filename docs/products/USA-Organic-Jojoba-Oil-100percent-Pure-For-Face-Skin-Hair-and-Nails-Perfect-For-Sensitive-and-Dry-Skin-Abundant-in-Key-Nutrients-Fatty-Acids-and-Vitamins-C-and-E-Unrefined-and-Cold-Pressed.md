<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice jojoba oil.  I make all kinds of DIY beauty products, always using pure and natural ingredients.  Foxbrim does a great job with their oil!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I combined it with some lavender because I had a blemish on my skin.  The blemish is already almost gone (only been about 6 hours since applied!  There&#x27;s no odor to the product and I can wait to use it in combination with other essential oils.</li>
    <li> i received this for free to leave honest  feedback. I gotta say Foxbrim jojoba oil is supreme. I am actually liking it better than my Argan oil!</li>
    <li> I just started using the Jojoba Oil so the verdict is still out. I will update my comments in a few weeks. I just started using the oil a week ago and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in hair texture, etc. I do like the fact that it has a dropper, so handling the oil is easier. It has an usual smell, but nothing so bad that I can&#x27;t use it. It reminds me of the smell of Argan Oil. More to follow on results.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer!  I have used many expensive moisturizers over the years and this is the best!!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time, sealed, has the USDA organic stamp,and is very good quality.  I am very satisfied with the product and the customer service!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I’m going to talk about a few things I like about this stuff, but first things first NOTHING I’ve bought at ANY store has tamed my frizzy hair as quickly and effectively as this Jojoba Oil…wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Jojoba Oil can be used with all skin types from oily to dry, young to perfectly aged, and even acne prone skin. I have sensitive skin myself, my hubby is on the oily side and all my kiddos seem to be on the average side of things, we’ve all successfully used it!&lt;br /&gt;2. Reduces appearance of pores&lt;br /&gt;3. Helps with scars and stretchmarks (that’s right moms better get yourself some because it totally helps)&lt;br /&gt;4. Amazing shelf life!!!!&lt;br /&gt;5. Used as a carrier oil for essential oils&lt;br /&gt;6. Rebuilds collagen&lt;br /&gt;7. Helps with hair growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you check out the back of the bottle it suggests a few ways to use the oil which by the way, I tried them all and they all rock! My face, lips well skin all over and my hair all loved this oil. Seriously it’s truly an amazing oil that has so many uses I couldn’t possibly list them all here. What I also love is that it can be used as a carrier oil. For those of you that use essential oils you probably know what I’m talking about, but for those of you that don’t, I’ll explain a bit. Essential oils are pretty much the go to for my family and most of my friends for ailments of pretty much all sorts. Drops of essential oils are dropped into a carrier oil and can be used in many ways as well. I’m actually now partial to jojoba oil after trying this oil because of the fact that it mimics our actual skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance and replace this oil as your carrier oil, try a little on your hair and feel the difference between frizzy or dry or just horrible hair days and smooth awesome soft hair. Try some on your face, skin or look up some of the hundreds of recipes online that have this versatile ingredient listed. I can honestly say you won’t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has a money back guarantee in the event that you don’t love their products which I can bet you’d probably love the Jojoba Oil as much as me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is also cruelty free which means it was NOT tested on animals. This product is also certified organic by Ecocert and there are no additives whatsoever found within this bottle just 100% Jojoba Oil! This is hands down one of the oils you SHOULD have in stock in your home take my word for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**ck guarantee in the event that you don’t love their products which I can bet you’d probably love the Jojoba Oil as much as me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is also cruelty free which means it was NOT tested on animals.

My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> I love how this product works in hair or on the skin. It has helped my hair with spilt ends and dryness. It leaves a nice shine and a little goes a long way. Impressed with this oil.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair so i&#x27;m always on the search for new oils I can introduce into my hair care and such.&lt;br /&gt;This oil makes from Foxbrim makes a great addition and has moved up to being one of my favorite oils.&lt;br /&gt;The spread-ability is one of the reasons I love it, some oils are very thick or too thin- this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;Also the scent makes me think of light peanut butter, a good scent (&#x3D;.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever&#x27;s left after massaging my scalp and rubbing through my hair, I rub into my hands and nails. My nails have grown over time with using this so that&#x27;s a great benefit as well. Other things I use this for includes lip scrub and applying while i&#x27;m getting ready to go under any lip balm. This is also great because it melts into the skin fast and leaves you smooth, it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this if you want shiny hair (especially for my curly girls), long nails and soft,supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for free to review, but all opinons are my own &amp;#60;3*</li>
    <li> This is an amazing oil.  I use it as a makeup remover, daily moisturizer for my skin and lips.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin terribly oily. I love it!</li>
    <li> Oh my my skin and hair loves this not greasy just right.smells so good. I have locs and this had no build up. I did receive this product for review</li>
    <li> Jojoba oil is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; oil. I use it for my skin, hair, nails.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes skin, hair, and nails&lt;br /&gt;-Easy drop applicator&lt;br /&gt;-Trustworthy Brand&lt;br /&gt;-Mix it with some other base substance for improved results&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is a great addition to have moisturized skin and can complement lotions and other skin moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Put a nice amount of drops into your bath and you&#x27;ll come out with some great feeling skin!</li>
    <li> I love this  product!  GREAT pure oil at a fair price! I will buy again! :-)</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it everyday with a blend of oils for my skin. I do love Fox brim products.</li>
    <li> Love Jojoba Oil!  I always passed this oil by in Health Stores, thinking it was too expensive!  I wish I would have found out the uses &amp; benefits earlier. I didn&#x27;t even know how to pronounce it! I googled Jojoba Oil &amp; now know how to pronounce it.  I use it everywhere on my skin.  It really soaks in MY skin &amp; is not greasy or sticky..  I am going to use it as a carrier oil &amp; mix it with my Peppermint Oil which I feel is a little strong for using on my temples for headaches.  I received this oil at reduced price for a fair review.  Right now, it&#x27;s offered at a reduced price-Try It!</li>
    <li> Jojoba oil is a great carrier oil for essential oils. Quality jojoba oil is important, and this one is quality. It&#x27;s very light and non greasy, it absorbs easily into skin and it mixes well with other oils. It&#x27;s completely odorless and works great alone, or as a carrier oil. I love that it&#x27;s 100 percent natural and pure and I&#x27;m glad it came with a dropper/pipette for easy distribution. I would recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
    <li> Was expecting it to be a fragrant oil from other jojoba products that I have used before, so was somewhat surprised that it has virtually no scent, but it works as a great carrier oil, or moisturizer on it&#x27;s own.</li>
    <li> The jojoba oil works great for all over body massages, it also works better than other carrier oils when you are using &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; types of essential oils.  I have made a blend of oils for a shoulder injury and this is the best carrier oil for it.  It really doesn&#x27;t have a scent to it and the oil scents come through nicely.  This works great for dry skin also.  It is a thicker oil and you need to adjust your time and rubbing for full absorption of the oil.  If it ends up getting on your clothes or your sheets, it has not stained anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used this oil in blends and butters and it makes them silky and rich feeling.  A new trick that I learned was to place a glob of vanilla olesestrin into the oil to infuse the scent and it is heavenly. This type of infusion doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well with other types of carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a safety seal in place so you don&#x27;t have any leakage issues.  The bottle is large and you only need a small amount, this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this bottle of Foxbrim Jojoba Oil at a great discount to review , but did not expect to be so impressed. I use Jojoba Oil frequently as a carrier for using Essential oils and have to say that this is the nicest so far!  Its got great slip, but absorbs quickly leaving no slimy trail. There is absolutely no scent left behind to interfere with my EO&#x27;s. And the fact that it is Certified Organic makes me happy! I love that the packaging includes the dropper top and its glass and big enough to actually get the amount of oil I need easily, plus I am a klutz and it was easy to dispense without spilling it everywhere! I am super impressed with this brand and will be buying more!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product, I have been using this for awhile now and I love the way it makes my skin feel.  It is so soft and smooth and my husband has started using it also, he says so that he can still look young for me when he is older. He is so sweet.  I have tried other foxbrim products and the quality is always superior.</li>
    <li> I am a professional makeup artist and a licensed esthetician and I love this jojoba oil! I was looking for an organic, cold pressed jojoba oil and Leven Rose&#x27;s jojoba oil fit the bill perfectly. As someone who has been in the beauty industry for over 20, experience has shown that it is better for your skin to use pure ingredients in skin care, rather than products that have been highly processed and with a lot of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;Leven Rose is making a very high quality product for much less than Whole Foods or beauty stores are selling organic jojoba oil for. It comes in an amber glass bottle with a dropper- that is the right way to keep oils and prevent them from turning rancid. Keep it in a cool dry place that is out of direct sunlight. The glass dropper allows for consistent and precise application.&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that is easily absorbed into the skin. It is used in many moisturizers and auyurvedic formulas.&lt;br /&gt;To apply it to yourself: mix 3-4 drops with some organic rose water and gently press into your skin. I use it daily on myself as well as on my clients with sensitive skin/clients who want organic skincare/vegan clients. Also for dry/dehydrated skins you can mix it into your moisturizer. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product smells bad and made me break out.  I have tried another brand of jojoba oil that was making my acne go away unfortanatelly my kids dropped the bottle, so I decided to try a different brand just to compar, but now I regret it because know I have to restart from the beginning</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the way it feels on my skin. I wish I would have used this 10 years ago and maybe my skin would look better .</li>
    <li> Just used this in my hair to keep the friz down. Love it. Doesn&#x27;t make hair oily or greasy looking. Comes with convenient dropper for ease of use. Big bottle so i shall get lots of use out of it. Using it for my dry skin as well. Will use this also for my gauged ears for stretching, and for my wood jewelry. Love the numerous uses i can get out of this one product. Awesome product to receive for review.</li>
    <li> Great oil!!! It will be a great addition to my essential oils!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair and skin soft like a baby!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to say. Generally speaking Jojoba oil is one of the more expensive ones to buy. Foxbrim is priced fairly, especially considering that it&#x27;s organic and cold pressed. I&#x27;m very happy with this oil (so are my skin and hair).</li>
    <li> Never have used Jojoba oil before...liking very much so far...appreciated the email identifying uses for this oil. Nice product, nice packaging....like the dropper feature.</li>
    <li> Enjoying my Jojoba oil.</li>
    <li> While this product leaves your skin super oily after use, it works tremendously well for a moisturizer. I recently spent a little too much time in the sun and found myself with a little burn. I put this on my sunburned skin and it seemed to sooth it very well. (I am not a doctor or nurse or anyone with medical knowledge so don&#x27;t depend on this review for your sunburn cure) however for me it did the trick. I also use a small dollop on my skin before and after I shave. My legs have never been so moisturized. I&#x27;m in love with this product!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Jojoba oils in general, but this one is amazing. You can tell it is 100% pure. I have stretched ears and use the oil to continue stretching and for the healing process. It has also helped my 2 month old&#x27;s cradle cap. So as you can see we have any uses for it. If you search on a search engine, you will find MANY more ways to use jojoba oil. It is definitely worth it, and this brand of it is amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a high quality jojoba oil to use in my homemade face creams and lotions.  This is a high quality oil, and I use it religiously!</li>
    <li> This is a great carrier oil for essential oils. I also took the advice on the jar and tried it as a lip therapy. This is a long-lasting and effective lip moisturizer. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this Jojoba Oil! I have really sensitive skin that hates almost everything I put on it. I&#x27;ve tried everything! I&#x27;ve decided to give the Foxbrim&#x27;s Jojoba oil a go since it&#x27;s recommended for sensitive skin. Let&#x27;s just say, I am never going back! My skin has never felt so hydrated. I&#x27;ve been having some troubles with acne and scarring but since I&#x27;ve been using this I&#x27;ve noticed my acne has been significantly better and my face just looks fantastic! I mean, the very first night I used it I noticed improvement. I didn&#x27;t have dry patches anymore! The oil itself isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy which was such a pleasant surprise. It also smells wonderfully. I&#x27;ve been using it as a body moisturizer too since it absorbs rather quickly and doesn&#x27;t stay on the skin&#x27;s surface like a lot of other moisturizers. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of that sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I acquired this item through AMZ Review Trader for reviewing purposes.</li>
    <li> Love this oil!  I imediately mixed it with another therapeutic oil and tried it and it mixed perfectly and was very smooth in application. I would definately purchase again!  I purchased item to review it and this is a very positive experience.</li>
    <li> Foxbrim has done it again -- sold me yet another of their fabulous products.  As a celiac (gluten free) person I need to trust the products I consume and use on my skin and hair.  This Jojoba oil is top quality.</li>
    <li> Smooth, Great to mix with my oils as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Smooth, Great to mix with my oils as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t  tried this  oil,it is the bomb!!! Been  using  for a week on skin and can already see results.</li>
    <li> I love using this as a carrier oil with my essential oils. Make it a different smell each time depending on my day. I like how light it is on my skin and makes it feel so soft. I use it on my skin after every shower to keep my skin hydrated and protected. I love adding it on my face before my makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added it to the ends of my hair to protect from blow drying and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large bottle is amazing well worth it! The dark bottle seems to keep it fresh longer. The dropper makes it easy to use and add right where you need it. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product is so good. I love how it makes me feel. It came well packaged and works just as described. Time to buy some more. :) Thanks for the great product</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  I mix with my current moisturizer and it makes my skin soft and smooth without feeling greasy.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have ever written a review.  I absolutely love this product so much I wanted to share my experience.  I have used the oil for a face moisturizer and it has made my face feel soft and also has helped in reducing a deep wrinkle that I have had for years.  I also have used it on my nails &amp; hands.  Within 3 days of using it morning and evening on my nails I noticed a big difference in the strength and my hands have gotten really soft.  My nails actually feel healthy now where as before they were constantly chipping and breaking.</li>
    <li> Works great with essential oils. Very good quality.</li>
    <li> I love to try all oils and they are so great for our hair and skin! Jojoba Oil is great for all skin types’ especially dry skin. This oil is great for sensitive skin and can even be used on acne prone skin without clogging your pores. Jojoba oil reduces the look of pores, reduces the look of scars and stretch marks. It can be used as carrier oil for essential oils. Jojoba oil also helps with hair growth and rebuilds collagen. It’s also amazing as massage oil. The label on the bottle also has suggestions for use which is great; I love when companies do that right on the packaging. I will definitely be purchasing this oil in the future.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with a discount code for review. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it because some companies say organic and it isn&#x27;t. This product was very good. I used it on my hair and scalp. I also used it with my deep conditioner. My hair felt great!</li>
    <li> I really like Foxbrim&#x27;s products.  Unlike other brands, they list all the ingredients clearly and include directions on how to use the product for hair, body and other uses.  Jojoba is a great hair conditioner and it can remove make-up as well.  The amber bottle holds 4 ounces of a faintly scented oil.  that comes packaged with a dropper which keeps things from getting too messy.</li>
    <li> Super value, I use it daily!</li>
    <li> I have been buying and using tjs and now brand jojoba for years now as a carrier oil for essential oils, for oil cleansing my oily skin(it&#x27;s amazing, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t start doing this in my twenties!) And mixing into homemade beauty products. The price for this is justified, it&#x27;s unrefined, cold pressed and I need to gush over the dark glass bottle with the dropper top. I end up with an oily bottle that leaves rings on anything it touches with the brands I have been using. I&#x27;m torn between hoarding and doling this out to myself over months drop by drop or using it for everything and buying another so i can use the bottle for all the things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this product so i could try it and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this organic oil. I use this as my moisturizer instead of lotion. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and a little goes a long way. Plus, Foxbrim products always exceed my expectations.</li>
    <li> I love using this jojoba oil in my skincare routine. After shaving, I apply it to my legs and it keeps them smooth and supple, all day long. Daily use has reduced blemishes on my legs, which was a welcomed surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is pure and certified organic, which I appreciate. When using oils, I prefer them to be free of chemicals, as chemicals defeat the purpose of why I use oils in the first place. I found this oil to be high-quality and a value for the price. Quite a bit of oil is included in the bottle. It has an easy to use glass dropper which dispenses oil drop by drop so that you can be sure you&#x27;re getting no more than what you need. And trust me, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Product provided for review without cost. All opinions stated herein are my own.</li>
    <li> This Organic Jojoba Oil is amazing!!!  It can be used as a makeup remover, daily moisturizer, pre-shave oil and lip treatment. I also like to use it on the ends of my hair to help prevent split ends.  This oil has so many wonderful uses and I love that it is organic....the only way to go!!!</li>
    <li> I use it on my son no more ashy knees</li>
    <li> Great multi-purpose oil.  Gentle on your skin and can be used as moisturizer and also as a make up remover without irritation.  Unscented and natural and can be used all over the body .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 4 because I am satisfy with what I have used it for so far. My review could change in the future.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and it is amazing. I have been using it on my lips since they have been dry with this florida summer weather and it has completely moisturized my lips.</li>
    <li> Great oil 100% organic it not stinks. .i used in my wet hair to help with frizz and in the body for moisturizer.is much to say i really like it that my honest opinion. ..</li>
    <li> My husband has lung cancer and is on a medication that leaves his skin very dry.  We have tried so many different creams and lotions (even ones suggested by the doctors).  Foxbrim organic jojoba oil has been the best moisturizer for him and has made his skin feel 100% better.  Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product when I was looking for something else.  I have been using this on my face to clear up some dry skin. Just in a matter of days, the dry skin is clearing up and no after effects like I had with other products.  I also noticed that my face seems smoother and clearer, like I am reversing the aging process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 3 days, but as soon as I apply it to my skin my face tingles a little and feels refreshed.  I know it&#x27;s early to write a review but it makes my face feel good that I felt I needed to comment about it.</li>
    <li> O.k. moisturizer.  I use it at night, but my skin is dry and tight by morning. But then again, it may just be me because I&#x27;ve always had dry skin. I haven&#x27;t used it as a carrier oil or for my hair, so it may be better for those uses.</li>
    <li> I use this and only this on my face as lotion. Everyone told me I would get blemishes from using it straight from the bottle. That is not true. This works so well as a fave &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; as well as a carrier lotion for essential oils.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have very dry hair so I apply it when it is still wet. A little goes a long way. It makes my hair shiny and soft. If I really want to hydrate my hair I put quite a bit on before I wash and leave it on overnight.</li>
    <li> I received this oil on yesterday and used it for the first time on my hair. I wet my hair, let it sit for around 5 minutes, then continued with my regular washing routine and after one use, my hair feels smoother and softer. IT hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled and i have thick, course, wavy hair. It doesnt have a smell, so that is great as it wont overpower the scent of your other washes/regimens. Also, if you make lotions and soaps like i plan to, you dont have to worry about covering up a smell you dont want. After one use, i am sold! It&#x27;s a great product, in my opinion, and i can imagine this will be in my routine for a loooong time.</li>
    <li> this oil is great for damaged hair and it had soo many uses I used for my and my daughter hair and lips , and I really trust foxbrim company I buy few products from them I really love the great quality in their products !</li>
    <li> I have never used Jojoba oil by itself before, but after using this particular jojoba oil, I&#x27;m completely satisfied.  I have used it in my hair and now use it in my face and body scrub that I make. I place on also trying to make a natural sunscreen which I will use this jojoba oil in also. Great product, doesn&#x27;t have any bad smell, and has helped a lot better than other products with many uses for my hair and skin!</li>
    <li> This is my first time purchasing Jojba oil. It&#x27;s not very easy to find and in a 4oz size! I accepted this to try for several reasons. It is it&#x27;s purest form being cold pressed and virgin oil. Foxbrim is crueltyfree and the oil is USDA certified organic!&lt;br /&gt;This company is out of Florida, which is also a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely picky on all essential oils! I&#x27;m a former Cosmotologist and MUA that worked at a spa. The scent is very light with a hint of sweetness. Jojoba oil is one of my top 2 essential oils to use. You can add it to your conditioner for dry frizzy processed hair. Add to ends for shine. Add to hand lotion, use as makeup remover,cuticle oil, dry lips,dry feet, add to shower gel,bath water, etc. Extremely pleased and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 this oil it is very light, moisturizing, organic, non-scented and not sticky. My skin feels nice and soft after I use it - the oil does not leave a residue or stain my clothes. This is can used on face and entire body. If you have sensitive skin test it before trying it.</li>
    <li> I have used this as a lip healer only, but it is the only thing that has brought me relief! Even in the summer, I have been getting mildly chapped lips and little cracks at the corners, but not any more, after using this just a handful of times. I have gone a week without using it and still no chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;The oil literally soaks into my lips. It does not lay on the top as other products have. It soaks in so quickly, that there is no time for the oil to drip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dropper does not hold the oil well, but I do not hold stars back for that. I hold a star back because I have only used this for one thing so far, and will come back to update my rating and review as I do more with it. For the one thing I have used this for, excellent.</li>
    <li> Nice feeling and moisturizing in my dry climate.</li>
    <li> this is a lot of uses in our house and really good, very effective!</li>
    <li> Great seller!  Great product! No problems here!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as described. This is a great carrier oil for essential oils it&#x27;s also a great moisturizer for skin, hair lots of uses.</li>
    <li> This pure jojoba oil is really a great value -- its 100% pure and organic and the bottle is huge!  The dropper inside the lid makes it very easy to dispense just the right amount.  So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this on my dry skin and on my  hair before I wash it.  The smell is very light and barely there.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using this every day since I think this bottle will last me forever!  Great buy, glad I ordered it on Amazon with free shipping and no tax! :)</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.  Well packaged.  Very good amount for the price.  I bought this wanting to try a more natural oil for my eczema.  This is a really nice oil with no smell that does not stay oily on the skin like baby oil does.  The picture is next to a 10 oz coke can to give you a little better idea of theamountt you get for your money.  As of the time of this review I am loving this oil and it is leaving my skin very soft without the oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this product for gently removing eye makeup. I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and this stuff works like a charm! I love how many purposes it has, too.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have used in rollers and cuticle creams. Suttle smell and smooth on the skin. I also use it on the ends of my hair to prevent it from drying out. Put on the tips after I comb out hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! I use it with my essential oils, love the way it doesn&#x27;t stay oily. My skin says:&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is an all in one for skin,hair and health. I bought this because i have Hypothyroidism and with it comes severe dry skin. A few drops of this and my skin feels like silk. My husband also enjoys this big time as it keeps his beard from itching like crazy! We have tried so many other options but this had been the one that has helped the most! We were lucky enough to get a discount for an honest and real opinion! Look forward to buying again from this company. Shipping was fast and the bottle was protected very well.</li>
    <li> Love this jojoba oil. It goes on the skin smoothly and effortlessly. I use about 8-10 drops for the face, neck and decollete area; my stressed by the Texas heat skin soaks it up like a sponge. I have been using it as a carrier oil with my favorite essential oils and as a make up remover; very satisfied with this product. The quality is also great which is very important to me.</li>
    <li> It mixes get with other oils for a great smell and moisturizer!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil. I use it in my homemade body butter and it is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried making it without jojoba oil and it is not the same. This organic oil is perfect for making many DIY products, like you see in other reviews; but you can use it all alone. It might be a little more expensive than other oils, but I have yet to find anything that works as well as jojoba on wrinkles, scars, and loose skin. It has many amazing properties making it a perfect oil for hair and skin. I highly recommend trying this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I used normally as my lotion. Who cares! :D</li>
    <li> I have tried many other brands of Joboba oil ( I have oily skin) but none have Foxskin&#x27;s quality. Great price, great product! I use it after a wipedown with Witch Hazel, (just wipe your whole face with the oil on a cotton pad) and voila! Beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> Great quality and so versatile! I have used on hair, feet, elbows, knees and hands! Leaves you feeling silky and not greasy!</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my lips each night before bed.  My lips have never been smoother and my lipstick goes on very evenly.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this oil.It&#x27;s great moisturizer for skin &amp; hair.I apply it on the ends of my hair to prevent split ends.So far-so good.My skin is also pretty smooth after using it.&lt;br /&gt;An update: after using this oil for a couple months,my skin looks and feels fantastic!It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.The great thing about it is that you only need a few drops to nourish your hair,face,body.I tried applying it after shaving my legs-the results are amazing!No bumps,skin feels soft and smooth.Great oil, I will definitely be buying more of it!</li>
    <li> This is the ***ONLY*** oil I&#x27;ve ever found that I can leave on my skin as a moisturizer without waking up to a nasty break out. I really didn&#x27;t think I would ever find the right oil. I tried olive, coconut, walnut, grapeseed (I like it but can only use for mu removal), argan, mineral (same case as grapeseed), sunflower......the list goes on. All of those gave me awful pimples and clogged pores when left on overnight. Jojoba just left me with soft skin. It&#x27;s incredible to me.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is organic and pure jojoba. Since it is oil you must be careful how much you apply. But friends are saying what are you doing your skin looks so nourished.</li>
    <li> I love Foxbrim products and the organic jojoba oil is no exception. Jojoba oil is known for its moisturizing properties. This fact makes it great to use on dry scalp, cuticles, and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use jojoba oil on the ends of dry, relaxed hair. It adds shine and makes it look extremely healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also great as a carrier oil. Add a drop of Jasmine and it becomes a wonderfully scent moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oils versatility makes it one of my favorite oils. Once again Foxbrim delivers another high quality organic oil I&#x27;ve come to expect from them. I highly recommend Foxbrim oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this item for review. I was not compensated in any way and my opinion was not influenced by the discount that I received.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin you will love this oil. Might sound contradicting, but jojoba oil actually mimics sebum oil, the oil our body naturally releases, and tricks our skin into thinking it has already released oil. Jojoba also does a great job at moisturizing and it is loaded with fatty acids, antioxidants and vitamins. If you have dry skin or combination like me, you will benefit from this oil greatly. Its antifungal and anti bacterial properties really help those with acne problems, it really soothes your skin.This one is cold pressed and virgin, including certified organic. Its great bc it comes with a dropper and in a dark glass bottle to protect the vitamins. Definitely recommend it! These are my honest opinions in trying this product.</li>
    <li> I have used jojoba oil before but it made me break out. This one doesn&#x27;t and feels so much lighter and better on my skin</li>
    <li> Really good oil in a big 4oz bottle. We use this oil daily after we shower. The dropper makes it easy to get the exact amount you want. Our skin feels softer and smoother. We use the oil on our nails too. We haven&#x27;t tried it in our hair but may in the future.&lt;br /&gt;The oil does seem to be good quality and not a watered down version.</li>
    <li> The Jojoba Oil was delivered in protective packaging, is in excellent condition, and as described on product page.  We purchased the oil in a promotion for testing and review.  We have been using Jojoba oil for many purposes, usually to condition our scalp and hair naturally.  We feel safe using this Jojoba oil since it is 100% pure and Organic and we like that it is also USDA certified.  Nice large size bottle, at a fair advertised price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I put it in body butter that I make and since pregnancy has left my skin dry and itchy this was just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product, odorless, no oily residue, use as moisturizer or for hair</li>
    <li> I love Jojoba oil! I get way better results with jojoba than I do with coconut oil when used on the face. I highly recommend Foxbrim products! I will 100% buy again!</li>
    <li> Love the soft skin this oil has given me in just three days!!</li>
    <li> I got this item for my hair. It is curly and this time of year very dry and unruly. I used this when I shampooing my hair and it helped with the texture. It was not as dry. But then I decided to use it after washing my hair. Best choice ever! My hair was so soft not at all unruly and shiny. Great choice for curly hair.</li>
    <li> My hair seems to have been damaged lately and I could not keep it tangle-free; I have used this in helping me moisturize my hair ends and it seems to have helped it. I also have liked using it as an extra moisturizer on my face. The bottle has simple instructions on using this product this way which is great for a quick reference to know what to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for 2 reasons... 1. to help with frizzy hair and 2. to help with dry skin on my feet. For my hair, I used it when my hair was wet similar to what I&#x27;ve used argan or moroccan oil for. It made my hair soft and less frizzy but it didn&#x27;t seem to absorb as much as I would have liked. It was oilier that other products I have used in the past. I would have also liked a scent with it.&lt;br /&gt;For my feet, I have only used it a couple of times but I can already see a difference with my dry heals. It absorbs well and my heals are feeling softer. I am going to continue to use it to soften the skin on my feet.</li>
    <li> I got this to review. I love how it makes my hair healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love using this in my hair! I put a little bit at the ends and style as I wish and my chemical fried hair feels great!</li>
    <li> This is a great multipurpose oil that is smooth, silky, not too greasy. I use it as my evening moisturizer and my skin has been so soft and hydrated. I also tried it out as a hair conditioner on my daughters long curly hair and it works beautifully. We live in a dry climate with harsh winds and have found this is a great product for our skin and hair care needs. I was in the market for a good natural oil, received a discount for trying this one out and we love it.</li>
    <li> Adds amazing moisture retention abilities to my hair, along with incredible shine!</li>
    <li> Foxbrim Jojoba Oil - Easy to see why Jojoba is considered the top oil for skin and hair.  So readily absorbed with no heavy feel and leaves hair silky smooth not weighted down.  I use this now two ways on my hair as a full hair mask with a hot towel then shampoo as well as an after shampoo on the ends lightly before blow drying. Very nice!!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic oil. Works and mixes well with my creams. It adds a nice moisture and does not leave greasy residue behind.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this oil!! I use it daily on my face and I love how it soaks in.  I will definitely be purchasing more when this runs out!</li>
    <li> This is an oil that I use as a carrier oil in my body butter, body whips, body scrubs. I will only use 100% pure oils and Foxbrim has a plethera of them. This is just ONE of my regulars.</li>
    <li> Item as decribed. Fast shipping. Packaging in tact. So far product seems to be good quality!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS.  I USE IT ON MY LIPS AND IT MAKES THEM SO SOFT!!  I PUT IT ON MY FEET AND IT HAS REALLY HELPED WITH MY DRY CRACKING FEET.  I HAVE EVEN STARTED PUTTING A LITTLE IN MY NIGHT TIME MOISTURIZER.  THIS IS AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I love this jojoba oil! Can you hear the excitement in my voice? Yes, I really do 100% love this product! The jojoba oil is so light I can saturate my hair with it and get lots of softness and shine without any greasiness or drooping. I can also apply the oil to my skin and have it vanish in seconds, leaving me feeling comfortably hydrated without being sticky or tacky. Best yet, to me the jojoba oil smells a little bit like coffee. I am not sure if it smells like coffee to other people, or if I just have a weird nose, but I happen to be a coffee addict, so to me this scent is fantastic. The aroma is also light like the oil itself, and not at all overbearing, so if you don&#x27;t like coffee, I don&#x27;t think this scent will bother you. I am also excited that I like this jojoba oil so much because I needed a good carrier oil to help make bath salts and scrubs with my lemon oil. Used alone, the lemon oil can be too strong. The jojoba oil dilutes the lemon oil enough that it does not cause irritation, ensuring I get a brisk lemon scent without any burning or sensitivity (citrus-based oils can sting if not diluted with carrier oils). I have also heard that jojoba oil can be used for shaving and scalp mssage--two applications I have not tried yet. All in all, this jojoba oil delivers on all it promises and is so versatile it will become a staple in my bath and body product arsenal.</li>
    <li> This is a reasonable price for this amt of jojoba oil, which is so nice for the face.  Have been using it and it is an excellent quality oil and works well w essential oils added.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE every Foxbrim brand product I&#x27;ve tried, and this jojoba oil really is no exception. I love that this oil is very natural and pure, and the texture/consistency is just perfect, right on point. It works really well on my skin and makes my skin feel so remarkably soft and smooth even hours after initial application. The bottle is very durable too, and it&#x27;s survived being dropped a couple of times already. Definitely a worthy product I would highly recommend to anyone in the market for jojoba oil!</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product 10 stars.  I have been struggling with acne for the last few years and really cleaned up my diet.  I did gluten free to decrease inflammation and organic to get rid of toxins.  It helped a bit then I switched to natural castile soap.  That helped quite a bit as well, but what finally put me over the edge of no longer having any zits was this Jojoba Oil.  I love my skin and I am never going back.  I no longer need to wear make up.  I got this item with a promotional so I would review it and I never expected it would change my face.  This product has brought life back into my complexion.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Great on hair and skin</li>
    <li> Best jojoba oil I&#x27;ve ever gotten. LOVE it! I use it on my hair, face, upper arms and thighs. Helps with those annoying bumps on legs and arms!</li>
    <li> My hAir loves it.  Makes it so silky.  I also have been using it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  Nice light oil.</li>
    <li> I love this product Jojoba oils is a little beauty secret you have got to know about! This is a a botanical extract of the seed of the jojoba tree. I like to use this product at night as if you wear during the day can make your face a little shiny looking but if you want amazing skin you will find time to put this product on whenever you can! Jojoba oil has helped reduce my breakouts and leaves my skin feeling so soft. I love it because its all natural no chemicals! This bottle is a nice large size that will last you a very long time. It also makes a great makeup remover and is amazing when used in your hair as a conditioner. This product has many uses so be sure you look for other fantastic ways to use it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I love it! This is something I will never go without!&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product free to review I give honest real reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! Beautiful! This oil feels rich going on but not greasy or too oily. It feels very natural. Great for acne and all skin types. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin and hair. Cleared up my acne and prevented further breakouts</li>
    <li> One of the best moisturizer for your hair. I use it before washing my hair and leave it for about half an hour, I have very curly hair, like 3c, and after my hair is dry I apply just a few drops in the tips of my hair, Excellent.</li>
    <li> I really like this Jojoba oil...  I haven&#x27;t used it long but it is such a nice pure oil without sticky residue.  I had my husband use it on his hair instead of greasy mens hair products and it looked so healthy and shiny without having a greasy look.. His hair is very fine and tends to stick up without some kind of hair product..  I think he has finally found what is right for him.  I also like Foxbrim products and how it is so natural and pure.  I can tell the company is proud of their products by how they contact their purchasers to make sure they are satisfied with the product and also with the delivery... which is always fast and nicely delivered.... I will continue to buy Foxbrim products  and  cant wait to use the Jojoba oil in so many different ways  It is great and so versatile.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome oil to pair with other oils!  An quite a deal for such a Large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is the closest to the oil your skin naturally produces, as far as giving your skin the best natural look, jojoba is the way to go. There are other oils that will improve the health and look of your skin, so my only drawback to buying this is that it is just jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product! The packaging is simple and sleek, functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I just think my skin looks and feels much more healthy and clear. I use it under both my moisturizer and my makeup and it is not too greasy for me. I will also probably start to use it as an oil cleanser, because I find other cleansers too trying. Adding a few drops with brown sugar makes a great sugar scrub! Have also been a few drops on my hair each time I wash it. This is a very versatile beauty product and I love that it is organic. You definitely get a good amount of a high quality oil for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product as a value for the price! I did receive a slight discount for honest feedback.  If you are in the market this product could work well for you!</li>
    <li> I use as a moisturizer after my shower and put a little in my hair in the evenings before washing my hair in the mornings.  It will make you a little oily - fair warning.  But I tend to have dry skin and hair so it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going for.</li>
    <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic and I use it on my hair all the time! Great product all around.</li>
    <li> Nice to the touch, shipped quickly. Dropper only fills up about 1/4 of the way when I squeeze it. Still great and would buy again</li>
    <li> I put a drop of this in a dab of conditioner when I shower to have sleek shiny hair. a&lt;br /&gt;And it helps a lot with the frizzies when I am in a humid area also</li>
    <li> This is a very generously sized bottle, and the quality is fantastic!  I love jojoba oil as an ingredient in haircare and have recently begun using it for oil-washing my face as well (put a 5-6 drops in the palm of your hand, and rub all over your face in a circular motion for 1-2 minutes.  Put a washcloth in the hottest water your hand can stand, wring out, then let rest on your face for a few seconds before wiping off).  This has given me a fantastic glow!  This is not my first Foxbrim product, and it won&#x27;t be my last.  Always a trusted source for quality skincare.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought it with huge discount. I love it, I use it before bed time and also after I wash my face in the morning. It helps me to prevent pimples.  I definitely recommend its to other people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about two weeks for dry, irritated skin and I think it&#x27;s great.  Wish I had begun using this during the brutal winter we just had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also impressed by Foxbrim&#x27;s initial follow-up email, with instructions and suggestions for use, after I purchased this product and the second follow-up email a day ago to be sure I liked the product and didn&#x27;t have any questions.  Foxbrim&#x27;s focus on their customers&#x27; satisfaction, and the fact that the Company is so proactive about it, is a major reason I&#x27;ll do business with this Company again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great experience all around!</li>
    <li> Pure, unscented, absorbs quickly and completely.</li>
    <li> Product is a great carrier oil. You can use it as a massage oil or therapy oil mixed with any essential oils. Also good to use with shampoo for extra conditioning</li>
    <li> I use this silky oil in the shower, tanning at the pool, and as a carrier for essential oils. Good quality! Will last quite a long time...</li>
    <li> This oil is great!  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I can have enough Jojoba Oil in my life. There are so many amazing things that jojoba oil is good for, it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular oil is unrefined, cold pressed and VIRGIN. THAT makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am using it for currently is to naturally moisturize my  face &amp; reduce my wrinkles. As I get older, I see the value of putting in the time to make myself NOT age horribly! It also is and can be used to:&lt;br /&gt;-Treat Acne Through Balancing Moisture (and fight bacteria)&lt;br /&gt;-Delicately Cleanse Face &amp; Remove Makeup&lt;br /&gt;-Condition &amp; Restore Under-Nourished Hair&lt;br /&gt;-Reduce &amp; Heal Scar &amp; Stretch Mark Damage&lt;br /&gt;-Treat Sun Damaged Skin&lt;br /&gt;-Pre-Shave Oil&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba oil is rich in Vit E and Vit B. Both of those vitamins are a YES to my face!!!</li>
    <li> My skin feels fabulous! Oil soaks right in &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy! Definitely would recommend the Jojoba oil! Plus it&#x27;s organic!!</li>
    <li> Never thought I would find a moisturizer potent enough to  heal my cracked alligator skin from frequent hand washing at work. This stuff is a lifesaver. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So wonderful on my dry skin. Leaves my skin soft and moist without ever feeling oily. Also a great base for makeup, or all over just after showering while skin is still wet. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> I love this Jojoba Oil. One of the best castor oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> many uses can be used as a daily moisturizer, makeup remover (or facial cleanser), Used as a carrier oil for essential oils I did receive a discount to leave a reveiw.</li>
    <li> I use the jojoba oil for my hair only because it is dry, dull, and damaged. I have used this product two times a week in between uses. About 10 minutes before taking a shower I apply the jojoba oil to the ends of my hair mostly. It may take you two shampoos and conditioner washes to get the product out it just depends on how much you applied to your hair. When my hair is dried I didn&#x27;t notice any greasy or oily feeling in my hair. After using this product my hair looks shiny and healthy rather than dull and dried out. The product smell does smell a tiny bit like those begging treats when I smell it from the bottle but in my hair it doesn&#x27;t smell like that. Also you get a glass dropper to better use this product. I got this product for free to review as part of a promotion.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, I used to buy Jojoba Oil at Trader Joe&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve now found this perfect replacement. Love the bottle size, price and brand. I have been using jojoba oil ever since I moved to the desert. It&#x27;s the oil from a native plant so it&#x27;s natural and keeps my skin from getting too dry. Won&#x27;t try anything else. Great product - will be buying again.</li>
    <li> I use jojoba oil in all my homemade body care product because it is AMAZING!  It is definitely one of my favorite oils and this jojoba oil from Foxbrim is way better than the last brand I tried.  The first thing I noticed right away was they packaged it in a dark glass bottle which is going to prolong its shelf life by quite a bit being stored properly.  I also love the dropper because I made a big mess trying to pour my old oil without one.  Most of the time I am using an ounce or two and this makes measuring easy. Even better, now I can easily take out just one drop to dilute one of my essential oils without making a mess.  This jojoba oil absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue and I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great product I use daily as a moisturizer along with other creams and serums..It is very lightly scented. .It works numbers on my hair and lips..I will soon gather a few mire oils and make a bunch if DIY  hair and body products</li>
