      <li>&#x3D;)</li>
      <li>but these are CHEAP!  </li>
      <li>Seems okay, but our travels have been curtailed since wifey broke ankle and cannot put any weight on that foot.</li>
      <li>Wow, how great to have my own hairspray, mouthwash, etc.</li>
      <li>They are a perfect size, with six different types of containers, and even comes with the ziplock bag (seems appears quite durable).</li>
      <li>I suggest you do the plastic wrap under the top trick to the bottles to prevent spilling.</li>
      <li>The bottles were pretty rigid which I guess is a good thing for traveling</li>
      <li>pieces inside look great so far!</li>
      <li>These make travelling with carry on so easy.</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to carry huge bottles of shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
      <li>I took these on 5 flights in July 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Passed through TSA no problem.&lt;br /&gt;No spills either; I filled each container about 3/4 of the way and then when closing them I put a piece of plastic (from a grocery bag) in between to act as a seal.</li>
      <li>This set feels as cheap as it is, but serves its purpose well.</li>
      <li>are great used for short hospital</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for traveling, just got a KTN</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>Should have shopped around first!!</li>
      <li>I found them very useful.  </li>
      <li>I bought this budget friendly travel kit for a trip</li>
      <li>These are exactly what I was looking for to use for traveling and bringing along my favorite hair products and body lotions.</li>
      <li>I love this set of travel bottles - the baggy the bottles sit in broke after using a few times, but the sizes of the bottles are great and they do not leak</li>
      <li>fair enough for the price I paid.</li>
      <li>love it thanks</li>
      <li>good product, compact for travel, and enough bottles for everything we need to put in the luggage for carry on.</li>
      <li>Good quality but wish there were extra bottles</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t use the clear bag..not a good seal but liked the different size containers</li>
      <li>I just keep them full and off</li>
      <li>Bottles are decent but bag broke before I was even able to use it on my trip.</li>
      <li>The head literally fell off the very first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>For the price, i guess i got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not even worth the time to return the set</li>
      <li>useful for traveling, and no need to check in your luggage if you fill your toner and cream into it.</li>
      <li>In addition, the bag that holds all the containers is just the right size to hold all the bottles for</li>
      <li>The sealing mechanism on the pouch broke on the 1st use - literally the first time I traveled with it.</li>
      <li>I now love all of the smaller bottles that came with it too!  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I bought these bottles only because I thought that I would be able to use by adding lotions.</li>
      <li>On eBay you can get this exact product at $2.</li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first night I used it.</li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first time I used it, and the bag was not overfilled.</li>
      <li>It was a great thick plastic bag to hold everything if I could have opened it.</li>
      <li>Screw-top short jars are good, but the bottles are a bit fragile - they are too brittle/hard and tend to break.</li>
      <li>Splurge with a few more dollars for the Go Toobs - they are much much better for travel bottles for people who travel frequently.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only handy &amp; sturdy-small enough for easy storage- large enough for  many uses- recommend product for all above reason.</li>
      <li>Bottles worked fine, but plastic container it comes in does not last.  </li>
      <li>Also the spray bottle (which is the main reason I purchased this!)</li>
      <li>but I did use the &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; dispenser for body lotion and the spray bottle with lid (really appreciated the cap) for &amp;#34;Aussie&amp;#34; brand liquid hairspray.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant</li>
      <li>Look to be very well</li>
      <li>However, keeping it all together in the plastic case is important in travel, and the pseudo zipper broke after the third use.  </li>
      <li>I found it had many uses other than just as a travel</li>
      <li>so they should not crack as easily as some of the more inflexible bottles.</li>
      <li>Seems to be decent quality, Its all plastic, I will update after my trip on leakage/durability.</li>
      <li>All the other containers are great but the spray bottle is a leaky mess.</li>
      <li>If you are buying for a single use, this will fit your need.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The bag that it came in is super cheap and didn&#x27;t last at all, but that&#x27;s not really a problem!</li>
      <li>I filled the spray bottle with my leave in conditioner and by the time I got to my hotel that night the bottle was practically empty.</li>
      <li>I filled bottles when I received it, but once on vacation the actual zipper stuck and  I tried to get it to open and was able to put zipp back off &amp; on, but it never came apart to open.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times and it leaks every time.</li>
      <li>They got crushed in my suitcase and would not return to their original shape.</li>
      <li>No leaks thus far!</li>
      <li>and I like to keep certain smaller items in my suit case.</li>
      <li>This bottles are flimsy and the zipper pouch broke early on.</li>
      <li>I personally had no problem with it, but I was quite deliberately gentle.</li>
      <li>The bag they all came in was useless - the zipper at top broke when I unzipped it the first time.</li>
      <li>OK bag is not good, the zip piece come off.</li>

    <li> Took these bottle with me on a three week trip to Europe.  I didn&#x27;t use the little bottles and jars on my trip but I did use the &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; dispenser for body lotion and the spray bottle with lid (really appreciated the cap) for &amp;#34;Aussie&amp;#34; brand liquid hairspray.  The &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; dispenser has a little stop clip that prevents the contents of the bottle from being accidently expelled.  No leakage whatsoever from any of the bottles.  Contents lasted the entire three weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the pump and squirt bottles.  Can&#x27;t seem to find these anywhere.  I now love all of the smaller bottles that came with it too!  No leaks thus far!</li>
    <li> Bottles worked fine, but plastic container it comes in does not last.  For the price, i guess i got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> bought these for a up coming trip! probably will put in a different bag but i didnt buy this for the bag! pieces inside look great so far!</li>
    <li> Nice variety of sizes and types of bottles. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t use the clear bag..not a good seal but liked the different size containers</li>
    <li> The zipper broke after my second time using it.</li>
    <li> I used this for a short trip, but it was perfect for the use, and about the quality, its ok! fair enough for the price I paid. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> this was a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel every week, and have found that 1 quart ziplocks for my liquids don&#x27;t last very long. Plus, I wanted some good bottles for all of my liquids. Well, this did not solve either issue. The sealing mechanism on the pouch broke on the 1st use - literally the first time I traveled with it. And the bottles/jars all leak. The inside of the pouch was covered in hairspray, cleanser &amp; gel, requiring me to rinse the inside of the pouch &amp; all of the bottles  EVERY TIME I USE IT...Disgusting mess. I will be transferring my liquids to other bottles &amp; throwing this entire set in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Bought it...didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> The zipper broke the first time I used it, and the bag was not overfilled. Cannot recommend this product :-(</li>
    <li> Bottles are decent, pouch was not worth a penny</li>
    <li> This set had almost every conceivable little container.  The pieces were slightly nicer quality than the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past from discount department stores.  They didn&#x27;t leak and can be reused.</li>
    <li> This pack I do regret buying. On eBay you can get this exact product at $2. It really is worth that much, because the zipper is so flimsy, and the bottles seem a tad shaky. If you&#x27;re planning on using these for travel I suggest you do the plastic wrap under the top trick to the bottles to prevent spilling.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.  Plastic very thin.  Worth less than what I paid.  Save your money and purchase travel size products.</li>
    <li> This bottles are flimsy and the zipper pouch broke early on. If you are buying for a single use, this will fit your need. However, look elsewhere for long lasting products.</li>
    <li> Great bottles! Wonderful quality for the price! The bag that it came in is super cheap and didn&#x27;t last at all, but that&#x27;s not really a problem! Totally recommend this!</li>
    <li> Bottles are decent but bag broke before I was even able to use it on my trip.</li>
    <li> Needed this for a plane trip so I could bring all my hair care stuff without the airport hassle. The bottles were pretty rigid which I guess is a good thing for traveling but it made it hard to get the shampoo and conditioner out when you needed it. Also the spray bottle (which is the main reason I purchased this!) leaked all over the inside of my carry-on bag - not cool! After I got back I found the same item in a local department store for about about half the price. Should have shopped around first!!</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles only because I thought that I would be able to use by adding lotions. Not so.</li>
    <li> It works like it says. Great for travel so you don&#x27;t have to carry huge bottles of shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
    <li> A nice variety of sizes with safety clip on the pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice if they came with labels.</li>
    <li> I bought this budget friendly travel kit for a trip I was planning- However- I found it had many uses other than just as a travel companion- I  am sending several as gifts- My grandchildren can use the kit for thier back packs for camp-over nighters -They are great used for short hospital stays- -&amp; I&#x27;m keeping several (at this price) in my guest bath room &amp;  in both my cars- .. added to elderly health care -animal emergency kits &amp; military gift boxs- &amp; purse storage-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only handy &amp; sturdy-small enough for easy storage- large enough for  many uses- recommend product for all above reason. &amp; seller for service- &amp; item as described-</li>
    <li> Going on a trip - these are perfect for pack your own carry-on toiletries! Seems to be decent quality, Its all plastic, I will update after my trip on leakage/durability.</li>
    <li> The components of this set are good, I&#x27;ve had no issues.  However, keeping it all together in the plastic case is important in travel, and the pseudo zipper broke after the third use.  If it was stronger, this would be a five star item.  Now I use this but then put it in a ziploc bag just bc I am afraid if anything were to open up, it would get on my clothes.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for traveling, just got a KTN so I don&#x27;t even need to remove it from my bag- but still all different types of storage solution- no more constantly buying new contact solution travel bottles that run you so much money!!</li>
    <li> These have allowed me to take several trips and passed the TSA check. The only thing I would like to see is more bottles for traveling liquids and less small compact containers</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this set. The price is awesome and the material is durable for travel. It is perfect for a weekend or five day getaway/vacation.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for to use for traveling and bringing along my favorite hair products and body lotions. Went through airport security with no problem. Perfect size and great price.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I found around the time of my purchase for an assortment of travel sized bottles for toiletries.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> This set feels as cheap as it is, but serves its purpose well. You will need to wash out the containers with soap before filling it with product, because there is a rancid plastic smell lingering on the insides. The zip on this is a sliding zipper, so you will have to be appropriately careful with it. Don&#x27;t pull too hard or it may come off the edge. I personally had no problem with it, but I was quite deliberately gentle.</li>
    <li> Good quality but wish there were extra bottles so you could chose the styles to take. For the money, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> All the bottles worked for what we were looking for in a small, travel size bottle.  Dispenses liquid with the best of them.</li>
    <li> I love this set of travel bottles - the baggy the bottles sit in broke after using a few times, but the sizes of the bottles are great and they do not leak</li>
    <li> These are not high quality; however, that doesn&#x27;t really matter.  One would only need to use them to ensure your expensive lotions, hair products and facials oils don&#x27;t get tossed out by TSA during baggage checks.  I found them very useful.  In addition, the bag that holds all the containers is just the right size to hold all the bottles for quick/easy carry-on luggage check removal.</li>
    <li> Very nice travel bottles and jars. Look to be very well made.i used the for my vacation and I am very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Unnecessary - a zip long bag works fine.</li>
    <li> A collection of various types and sizes of bottles. I used these in my last trip. Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> The bottles in this kit are very thin and they&#x27;re not sturdy. They got crushed in my suitcase and would not return to their original shape. Splurge with a few more dollars for the Go Toobs - they are much much better for travel bottles for people who travel frequently.</li>
    <li> These bottles are the best I have found for travel.  I have used them twice and they did not leak or break open. I usually pad them well and I did not use the provided carrying case, which was a bit flimsy. I used a regular plastic makeup bag to keep the bottles all together.  I plan to buy another set for my kids before our next trip.  It is a good mix of bottle types and they are a bit flexible so they should not crack as easily as some of the more inflexible bottles.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling or just using around the house for personal things.</li>
    <li> bottles OK bag is not good, the zip piece come off.</li>
    <li> good product, compact for travel, and enough bottles for everything we need to put in the luggage for carry on.</li>
    <li> These make travelling with carry on so easy. They are a perfect size, with six different types of containers, and even comes with the ziplock bag (seems appears quite durable). All that at a fair price.</li>
    <li> Seems okay, but our travels have been curtailed since wifey broke ankle and cannot put any weight on that foot. Drag.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was possible to be unsatisfied with plastic bottles but these are CHEAP!  The &amp;#34;zipper&amp;#34; on the bag broke before I unzipped it ONCE. The head literally fell off the very first time I used it.  Just holding the bottles in my hand makes me realize what poor quality they are.  Thankfully I made this purchase for the two smaller containers and this set was cheaper than others - though with good reason.  It&#x27;s not even worth the time to return the set but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this brand ever again.</li>
    <li> Item received as described.</li>
    <li> These are great! They are not cheap looking, they don&#x27;t leak and they are durable. I am very happy with them!</li>
    <li> Nice for traveling...perfect size and it comes with a pump bottle, spray bottle...even a little jar. Everything I needed. love it thanks</li>
    <li> we travel all the time and these came in real handy for packing on the go I just keep them full and off we go</li>
    <li> useful for traveling, and no need to check in your luggage if you fill your toner and cream into it.</li>
    <li> Screw-top short jars are good, but the bottles are a bit fragile - they are too brittle/hard and tend to break. The little round jars, however, I have been able to reuse. The bag they all came in was useless - the zipper at top broke when I unzipped it the first time.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for the gym instead of lugging around big bottles of shampoo and such.  It does the job as it is suppose to the only downfall is that the spray bottle tends to leak a little...</li>
    <li> All the other containers are great but the spray bottle is a leaky mess. I&#x27;m a flight attendant and I like to keep certain smaller items in my suit case. I filled the spray bottle with my leave in conditioner and by the time I got to my hotel that night the bottle was practically empty. I&#x27;ve tried it a few more times and it leaks every time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to take on the European vacation. The zipper broke the first night I used it. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> In concept a good idea--a little shaky on the execution. The bottles are not spill-proof for non-visous liquids. I would not purchase again, and will leave them in the trash rather than re-pack for the trip home.</li>
    <li> Does the job well. Always look up your airline regulations because these are on the bigger side. I love the little wide jar. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling</li>
    <li> I filled bottles when I received it, but once on vacation the actual zipper stuck and  I tried to get it to open and was able to put zipp back off &amp; on, but it never came apart to open. The part that actually zips came off on the plastic bag rendering it permanently zipped, and would not open. So it was useless to me. It was a great thick plastic bag to hold everything if I could have opened it. I still have it unopened, and will eventually cut it.</li>
    <li> The spray bottle and the squeeze bottle both leaked.  Good thing I had them in a zip-lock so they didn&#x27;t leak inside my suitcase.  I bought this primarily for the pump bottle which is great.</li>
    <li> These are essential for traveling. They are the perfect size &amp; easily visible for liquid checkpoints at the airport. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I took these on 5 flights in July 2014.&lt;br /&gt;Passed through TSA no problem.&lt;br /&gt;No spills either; I filled each container about 3/4 of the way and then when closing them I put a piece of plastic (from a grocery bag) in between to act as a seal. I disconnected the tube of the spray bottles to make this possible. When I got to my destination I reconnected them and removed the plastic and everything was as advertised (although I never did use the handpump, so I can&#x27;t attest to that)</li>
    <li> These are the perfect containers!</li>
    <li> Product works well! Seals well and refillable. Perfect for travelling</li>
    <li> I got this since airports confiscate all fluids @ their security checkpoints.  Wow, how great to have my own hairspray, mouthwash, etc. instead of buying it during my trip.  No problems at the airport security checkpoint for me with this.</li>
    <li> Nice set, nice variety.&lt;br /&gt;Has not spilled or leaked on two trips now.</li>
