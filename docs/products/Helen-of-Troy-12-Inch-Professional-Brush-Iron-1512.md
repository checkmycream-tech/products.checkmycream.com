<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had not been able to locate this size in any store. I have very short hair. This is exactly what wanted.  It is small enough to curl my hair.  Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> I have short, very thin hair.  This was recommended by my hair dresser and I love it.  Since using it, my hair is fuller and seems to be healther.</li>
    <li> I love this kind of curling iron...nice for short hair</li>
    <li> Its okay. Not what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> This is great I needed the smaller rod and it works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> perfect! just the right size for my short hair. heats up quickly and curls last a long time. wish they have a 1\4 size can get around my neck</li>
    <li> this mini brush is larger than last one I ordered.  its a cross between1/2 and 3/4 inch</li>
    <li> I never got the knack  of this professional brush. It got stuck in my hair!</li>
    <li> I luv, luv, luv this1/2 inch mini brush.  I have tried soooooo many others in the past but was never pleased and the quality could not compare to HELEN OF TROY.  I mentioned  my concern to my hairdresser one day and I was so happy he suggested to do a search on Amazon.  The brush is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used and the Amazon service can&#x27;t be beat.  I will no longer search - I&#x27;ve found the greatest!!!!  I&#x27;ll definitely order again!!!!!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!!!!&lt;br /&gt;K-Music</li>
    <li> As stated in other reviews, the black comb pieces fall off while you are using it.  Because my hair is so short, I&#x27;ll keep it and just keep putting the pieces back on.</li>
    <li> Delivered as advertised. So far, so good</li>
    <li> I bought one at Target, and this is way better</li>
    <li> This is a good little curling brush. It was hard to find a small barrel brush so I started looking online and came across this. It heats up quickly and has a &amp;#34;no tangle&amp;#34; cord. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these curling brushes for many years.Absolutely love them,even give them to my friends to try,also my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this grooming tool. She always has a spare incase it is needed.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. I bought it for my mother who is 78 years old with Rheumatoid Arthritis and she loves it.</li>
    <li> it did not heat up at all. I threw it away</li>
    <li> Have short thin hair and this heated brush does a pretty good job of giving my hair some appearance of having body.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new curling iron. Thank you so much. I will order again when in need.</li>
    <li> makes beautiful curls..</li>
    <li> Have been using the brush for some time now, it works great, gets hot enought to burn fingers, and is holding up under daily use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this curling iron for many years.  It gets hot enough to curl my unruly hair.  The reason I get another one is because all of the teeth are broken. I wish that could be fixed.  But I still buy this brand time after time.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted would recommend to anybody that wants small curls and cannot master the use of a curling iron.</li>
    <li> The purchase experience was great - I am not sure the tool works well with my hair but I will try again.</li>
    <li> I am not at all happy with it.  Does not curl well and I am going to send it back.  Not sure how to return it.</li>
    <li> Was a little disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a 1/2 inch curling iron with the brush and finally found it. The only problem is that it takes forever to heat up. However, it is better than what I had before which is nothing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a $15 curling iron. Does what that price point would be expected to do.&lt;br /&gt;Not even close to professional grade but does an &amp;#34;adequate&amp;#34; job.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion, I would rather spend more next time and get a better product.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this as I had been looking for one in retail stores for quite awhile. Heats just right and have had no problems with it. Would buy again if needed!</li>
    <li> The size of the barrel is perfect. I have a Helen of Troy in the 3/4 inch barrel that you can use to blow dry your hair and love it, but the half inch barrel you have to use with dry hair. The half inch barrel is good for shorter hair. I do wish this one is designed like the 3/4 inch barrel.</li>
    <li> Barely holds a curl on fine hair</li>
    <li> This another thing that you can only find on Amazon... it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever really given anything a poor review before, but this brush curling iron did absolutely nothing for my hair. If anything, it has just become a bulky circular brush for me.</li>
    <li> perfect.  My aunt wears her hair short and prefers to use a 1/2 inch curling brush to curl under the ends.  She was having trouble finding one and was unsure whether it was still possible to find a curling brush with this very small diameter shaft. I ordered this for her and she reports that it is perfect, just what she needed. If you want really tight curls on short hair, this is the curling iron for you.</li>
    <li> IRON WAS AS EXPECTED, GOOD FOR SHORT HAIR.</li>
    <li> If you have very soft hair its nearly impossible to use this, couldnt get a grip on my hair without it getting tangled in the HOT comb.</li>
    <li> The perfect curling iron. Love it</li>
    <li> I have very flat hair, no volume to it at all. Was hoping this brush would do the trick with a mousse added to my hair but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I guess I expected to much,gave it to my daughter,hope it works for her.</li>
    <li> I love the size and shape of this brush and keep buying them because this size is so difficult to find.  The major problem is that the barrel detaches from the handle with daily use and the barrel just spins so you can not grab the hair properly.  I&#x27;ve purchased at least 10 of these irons and they all do the same thing.</li>
    <li> does not get hot enough,takes a long time to heat</li>
    <li> Product as described. 5 star seller!  FAST shipping.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> OK, but teeth break out too soon.</li>
    <li> The product is good, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I wanted.  Too much fussing to get ready to go anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I expected.  Arrived promptly and good packaging.  Thank You</li>
    <li> No I&#x27;m not happy with this curling iron. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very  pleased with product size and heat. I have very fine hair and currently shorter length. The small size is just what I was looking for. I read reviews and decided I would try it anyway in spite of some negative comments. If my hair was longer than what you can wrap around your finger it would not have good results as longer hair tangles. I ve been able to use larger sizes in past but not at present style.</li>
    <li> Very sturdy and well made.</li>
    <li> I was very disapointed in the product as i thought it should notbreak within 2 weeks of use but iwood still buy from amazon as i have other things  it is hard toi use something when the brissle of trhe brush are broken for no good reason</li>
    <li> I have short hair and have had trouble over the years, finding a 1/2 in curing iron that was effective.  I love this one!  It heats up to a very high heat very quickly.  This is the second one I have owned, and I also own the 3/4 inch version.  Love them both.</li>
    <li> The curling brush works great on my short hair.  The only problem is that after only four uses one row of the comb teeth came loose and slid off of the curling iron.  I will be returning this one but hopefully they will send me a new replacement.</li>
    <li> The tip on the end is a little short.  Not much to hold on to without burning your fingers .</li>
    <li> Takes a while to heat up. I have short extremely fine hair so it is hard to curl. This keeps the iron off the scalp and is easy to use with the brush. I don&#x27;t mess with my hair much, I am 79 years old, with a few twists here and there looks ready for day. I am not sure this would do thick hair. It gives me the bit of body I need and some control.</li>
    <li> After using a different brand  for a few years which heated almost instantly and could be set for really hot heat, this brush/iron came as a surprise. While it will eventually get hot enough to be effective it takes more time than I like to spend waiting.</li>
    <li> Worked to shorter great. Anyone can use this simple brush.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for, if you have very short hair it works great.  I recommend this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> This is  a great item for all types of short hair!  This is the only place I can find the 1/2&amp;#34; brush..</li>
    <li> great curling iron for short hair.</li>
    <li> This curling brush fits the texture of my hair and it works great, will probably order it again if and when this one goes bad.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I thought it worked as a electric curling brisk. But it&#x27;s just a curling iron.hard to curl short hair without burning yourself.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a 1/2 inch curling iron for quite some time. Have thin fine hair and it works great for me.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for my short and sometimes almost shoulder length. It gives you enough curl to jazz it up a little bit. It does not take long to fix your hair with this brush/curling iron.</li>
    <li> The diameter is good but the bristles are too far apart. It couldn&#x27;t hold my fine, short hair long enough to turn the barrel. I burned my thumb twice in the space between bristles.</li>
    <li> my mom  has had the same curing iron for 20 years. hers broke, and no store in town or within 50 miles had one that was the same size. Amazon did. It was perfect and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Works great.  If you need a 1/2&amp;#34;, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I regret taking a chance on this product. Confirm reviews that complain that this product does not get hot enough. This brush curling iron doesn&#x27;t generate enough heat to even bend hair - not what I consider professional quality. I have grey hair that is relaxed and only wanted to add some body to my flat hair. It is not worth the effort to return this product due to the cost of shipping it back to Amazon. Save your money!!</li>
    <li> This is just not very hot.  Maybe none of them are, though.  Curls are not very impressive with my straight hair.</li>
    <li> Love it easy to handle</li>
    <li> The curling iron was great, especially in size.  The only problem I found was the HI setting was not hot enough to hold a tighter curl.</li>
    <li> I really like the size. This didn&#x27;t get very hot at all. I would send it back if it wouldn&#x27;t be such a hassle.</li>
    <li> It is hard to find a 1/2 inch brush  iron.  This heats quickly and does a nice job.  A great price, too!</li>
    <li> Cheaply made.  One row of teeth fell off the first time I used it.</li>
    <li> This curling brush does nothing to my hair. No matter how long I use on a strand of hair there is no curl.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t grasp fine hair very well.</li>
    <li> What do you expect when you buy a curling iron? The good news is, it&#x27;s a 1/2&amp;#34; curling iron. You can&#x27;t get them in any store so I was happy to see this one online. It works fine. I don&#x27;t expect too much from a curling iron. I do expect it to work. It does. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this iron. It does not seem like 1/2inch to me, I have short hair and could barely use it. It does not grab the short hair. Also the red heat index light does not work. I was going to send it back but it is not worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> We love this curling iron.  Sometimes the little brush pieces come out, but can be put back in easily.  Actually they do that so that you can clean the iron!</li>
    <li> great product.  Speedy shipping.  Good value.</li>
    <li> this is the worst thing I ever bought. lost a bunch of hair. I have used curling irons and brushes before - this one is a disaster. I am not sure i want to waste my money returning it. It was my worst purchase on Amazon. I wish I could give it ZERO stars.</li>
    <li> Very flimsy product, brush portions fall out, would not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this curling iron for my mom because she&#x27;s been looking everywhere for one and had no luck finding one.  She absolutely loves it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product while I was away with the hopes of using it for a special occasion I had coming up when I returned home. To my dismay, this did not work. It barely heated, let alone curled my hair. Maybe it was defective. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I heat this for a good long time and it never really gets hot.  I don&#x27;t want to burn my hair or scalp, but my hair is SO straight, that I need firm curls.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this curling brush. It&#x27;s great especially for short hair which is what I have. And you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> I now have this curling brush in 3 sizes and I love them all. They are so much easier to use than a standard curling iron.Even heating and my fine hair doesn&#x27;t get caught on it.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot so it doesn&#x27;t do a great job</li>
    <li> It is just great, I cannot buy it anywhere else</li>
    <li> This curling brush was a must when my hair was cut short and my larger one just didn&#x27;t do the job.  Could have a couple more rows for best performance in holding the short hair but works great.</li>
    <li> Great Brush Curling Iron for my short hair. If I could change one thing, it would be to extend the Tip a bit to protect my fingers from the touching the heated part..</li>
    <li> After 4 months of occasional use, the teeth are falling off and the barrel rolls.  It takes forever to heat up.  Wish I had never bought it.</li>
    <li> I should have kept the box and returned but I didn&#x27;t.... the brush had one of the spokes loosen about the fourth time I used it...have had this happen once before but it happenened when the brush was about 2 or  3 yrs old.  Was disappointed. But you get what you paid for I quess</li>
    <li> One of the combs fell off on first use.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have purchased.  I dropped the first one and some of the teeth broke off the strip.  Now, I have replacement teeth if this happens again and a backup curling iron.  It is very difficult to find 1/2 inch barreled curling irons in our local stores.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased, thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is a very good curling iron.  Works well on my straight, fine, short hair.  I use it in between wash and hot air brush styling when I need a little lift and touch up on the hair style.  It works great.</li>
    <li> just what I needed for my short hair.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough for a lasting curl.</li>
    <li> this is plastic and horrible does not work correctly and get tangled pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to using an iron and it really gets hot. I do like it tho and have only used it once and got lots of curls. I just need to get used to an iron.</li>
    <li> because it does not heat properly. it takes a long time to warm up. it does not get warm enough to curl hair.</li>
    <li> Curling iron does not get hot enough for me. Does not do what I need it to do.</li>
    <li> The cap that holds all the plastic bristles on to the wand  comes loose and the bristles can slip right off.  I only wish there was anoither brand that made a 1/2 inch curling brush.  I haven&#x27;t tried to glue it yet but that might solve the situation.</li>
    <li> The light indicating the curler is on burned out the first time I plugged it in but the iron still gets hot. Just have to remember to turn it off or unplug it when finished.</li>
    <li> the combs break off - have had it for a couple months - the hair it is used on is very fine - would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> just what I wanted!!  It arrived as promised and was just as described.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron for shorter hair.</li>
    <li> This one replaces one I&#x27;ve had for years on which the cord finally wore out.  I was hoping I could find another just like it as I really like the size for my short hair.  I was so happy to see it is still made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a small barrel curling iron over the counter without spending a lot of money, but I knew I could find one on Amazon. I&#x27;m very pleased with it especially since I have short hair.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and this is the first brush curling iron that has worked with my hair, all of the others were to large around to be of any good.  This one really works and I use it every day.</li>
    <li> This is my third curling iron and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> awful, will not use it again.the brush sections come out and tangle hair...too painful</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s what i was looking for. it heats well, however,  one of the teeth broke off - no accident involved, just set it on the counter. that&#x27;s why i gave it 3 stars.  thinking of a toothless future.</li>
    <li> the combs fall out if you hold on to the tip at all. I need to do that to help hold the iron where it is supposed to be. it is longer that I thought it would be, to be a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> She liked it very much but I&#x60;ve got to admit it was a Christmas gift and I really don&#x60;t know</li>
    <li> Great quality and super for a quick curl</li>
    <li> I love it for my fine, straight hair. The bigger size brush didn&#x27;t make the curl I wanted. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Perfect size curl for short hair do&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> It was very easy to use and I didn&#x27;t burn myself as I usually do with curling irons.  This was a good buy!</li>
    <li> Great curling iron; bought for my mom and she is still using it!</li>
    <li> Great little iron. Works great</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because she could not find Half inch curling brush. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and really like the size and heat level, but don&#x27;t like how easy it is for the combs to slide/fall out. Besides being frustrating, the combs tangled in my hair when they slid loose and finally one snapped in two. So, I gorilla glued the broken comb and rotating end-knob in place just a few days after I received the curling brush. Now all the combs stay put and it&#x27;s working but you shouldn&#x27;t have to go to that extreme after purchasing any product.</li>
    <li> horrible wish i could return it.  doesn&#x27;t heat at all.</li>
    <li> Does not heat up well.  I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to get a good curt.</li>
    <li> Second one of these irons I have purchased. Totally happy with product. Hard to find 1/2 inch barrel. Only wish it had automatic shutoff. Also, brushes tend to come out too easily.    Has quit working on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; after four months.  This is infrequently used so it should have lasted much longer.</li>
    <li> It did not meet my expectations as I thought it was going to have air along with the brush.aspect. I was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> Only lasted a month. Definitely a piece of junk. The wand is no longer stationary, it moves when you try to wrap it around your hair.  I have had this happen in the past and if you continue to use it, it explodes in your hand  Don&#x27;t buy, very dangerous!!!</li>
    <li> Because I have real short hair.  I was looking for something to help me feather it back and this was just to big for my hair</li>
    <li> My wife said it was what she was looking for to curl her short hair.&lt;br /&gt;She would also like a 1/4 inch Professional Brush Curling Iron.  She had one&lt;br /&gt;for many years but it is shorting out and she would like to replace it with a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a 1/4 inch brush curling iron on the market?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot and the bristles are too short to really hold onto the hair.  I have not found it to be useful.  It is inexpensive and in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Works good, however, I would like one that heats faster.</li>
    <li> New wand and already several teeth broken.  It happened with my last one but not as quickly so obviously I am very careful with this one, thinking it is my fault they broke,  and the teeth are breaking off daily.  No one else has access to it.</li>
    <li> Size is ok, but it does not get as warm as I would like it</li>
    <li> pieces of the brush are falling off</li>
    <li> This thing is absolute bullcrap. I got it because it was cheap, and it just sucks so hard. I have normal shoulder length hair. The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are just little pieces of short plastic that don&#x27;t even GRIP the hair. Biggest piece of crap I have ever purchased. I&#x27;m offended that anyone could try to sell this to someone and claim that it works SO WELL. This thing might be okay for people with pixie short hair. But any longer than that and it&#x27;s basically just a brush that gets hot. Piece of crap. If you actually want your curling brush to curl your hair, go somewhere else. This is a sack of crappy lies/false advertising.</li>
    <li> This is just about the perfect curling brush.  I have purchased two now.  Broke the first one. (Not it&#x27;s fault, was my fault)  Would not hesitate to purchase again!!</li>
    <li> love it easy to use make hair look fuller</li>
    <li> Not for my hair. Doesn&#x27;t get very hot, and doesn&#x27;t grip at all. I can&#x27;t use this alone, would still have to touch up with a really hot curling iron afterwards, so I don&#x27;t normally use this at all. The only thing it&#x27;s useful for me is for the roots, since I don&#x27;t want a hot curling iron that close to my scalp anyway. I suppose it may be ok for thin hair, but not for me - mine is too thick for this.</li>
    <li> Had to keep trying to get it right, and now I love it. Great for short hair!</li>
    <li> I have had several of these and they break almost immediately.  I have very short hair and like a 1/2 inch curling iron but this one is not for me.  If they can fix it so the barrel is more stable then I would buy another one.  This barrel starts to slip and roll when you wind your hair on it.</li>
    <li> Really helpful for short, fine and thin hair!</li>
    <li> This is my second one...bought it as a back-up for one purchased earlier which is perfect for short hair-- it&#x27;s almost impossible to find something with a1/2 inch brush, so I wanted to have a spare.</li>
    <li> What can I say about a curling brush?  It works as it should and is great for short hair.</li>
    <li> I like the size of the barrel but the teeth slide up sometimes when the tip turns.</li>
    <li> It might be good for travel, but I don&#x27;t like it for every day use.  I used it for one week and just put it away and went back to my Conair.  The problem is that when I put my finger over the end of the brush wand as I style my hair, the end cap spins and the brushes slide out place.  I spend most of my time trying to put them back in place.  Additionally, it does not feel like a heavy duty, quality appliance.  It is very light and &#x27;plasticky&#x27;, where the Conair is heavy duty and metal.</li>
    <li> I much prefer the brush type curling irons. This is perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> Fab item so thrilled with it. Originally I picked this item because of the price and thought if it didn&#x27;t work then I&#x27;ve lost nothing. Bought this to take on holiday with me to USA, thought buying an American appliance having the us plug already on it would be far easier.  I have found that taking British ones and using an adaptor the appliance doesnt heat up very well.  I have just returned from US today and can highly recommend this item - my only complaint is why didn&#x27;t I discover Helen of Troy sooner.....</li>
    <li> I use it every day!  It is just right and heats very fast!</li>
    <li> These are the best!  I love the removable combs, because they make it so much easier to clean.</li>
    <li> Needed a quick and easy curling iron and this was not the answer. Does not have a clasp to grip hair and it did not work for me. I have short hair and it still did not curl. However,I did get burned a few times trying.</li>
    <li> Heats OK, but the very first week, the brush part started to come off and continues to come off each time I use it. Fix this, please.</li>
    <li> The nob at the end doesn&#x27;t stay in place very well and the bristles come off frequently.</li>
    <li> Great for curling fine, straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold on a regular curling iron.  Have been using one for years, this time I got&lt;br /&gt;two in case they stop making it, very hard to find a 1/2 inch one.</li>
    <li> I have used this Helen of Troy Curling Brush for years.  This is the first time I have ordered on line and was investigating how to return it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not always turn on. I have to play with the on button Turning it off and on.&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me how to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;PATHODGES</li>
    <li> I have bought this curling brush before and it is wonderful!  I have extremely short hair and so I need a smaller brush, 1/2 inch.  It provides the curl I need.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find the 1/2 inch curling brush, but I have to wear cotton cosmetic gloves to keep from burning fingers.</li>
    <li> did not like these. burnt my hand several times</li>
    <li> OK, I have been looking for this size curling iron forever.  It works great.  I have short curly hair and this makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> Used by my wife.  This is the only one she likes.  This is our third online purchase of the item (others broke -dropped- or wore out).  Still the best, she states.</li>
    <li> I love this curling brush.  I have a short cut for the summer and this little gem is perfect.  Very easy to use.  Heats quickly and produces just the amount os smooth, not tight curl I want.</li>
    <li> Good product, excelllent service</li>
    <li> a little tight in the shoulders for a large so recommend you buy a size larger</li>
    <li> Sent this as a gift to my step daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> I have short hair with many cow-licks and the iron works perfectly</li>
    <li> Well, finally a curling iron that works for short hair.  An extra bonus, you can take the brush portions off to use as a plain curing iron.  Heats up fast.  Works well.  Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and can not find a brush small enough for my hair. Curling irons yes, but not the curling brush. I have been using this kind of brush for many years.</li>
    <li> It works just fine. Only one I could find that has the right diameter for me. This was a replacement for one I burned up using the wrong current in Europe. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it was a heated blower like the 1 inch; not so. this is a mildly hot iron with firm plastic bristles sticking out. It does get hot enough to singe your fingers or ears; however, it does not get as hot as a flat iron or curling iron. This is best used on freshly washed hair that has already been blow dried and has no oils in it. You would be able to tame frizzy edges and get closer to your scalp to keep hair from bunching. I would also be able to use this on a child with soft hair. I would not try to curl with it because it will tangle like crazy. It is  alright if you know how to use it and do not expect too much of this item.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this brush. Three rows of the little teeth that are suppose to hold the hair fell out. I put them back in the wand but they immediately fell back out. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my secon curling brush by Helen of Troy.  Nice product but I wish the teeth would stay in place as they keep slipping out of the removal slot while in use!  Tip also gets hot so you have to be careful when using it.</li>
    <li> I had bought a one inch hot air brush and it was too big so you cordially exchanged it for a smaller one but the svmaller one (1/2 inch) is only a curling iron and not a hot air brush. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a 1/2\\&quot; brush for some time, with no luck.  Although I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and it&#x27;s great.  I have short, straight, fine hair, and this brush actually manages to give it some body.  Much cheaper than a perm.    Unfortunately, after about 4 months of use, the teeth on the brush began to break off.  It&#x27;s great while it lasts, but be prepared to replace it fairly often.    I don&#x27;t know where the author of the product description comes from, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a country where English is the chief language.

    <li> The best curler ever. Heats up great and just the right size for short hair. PERFECT</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and this is perfect. Those who say it doesn&#x27;t get hot must have defective ones, because mine gets hot enough to burn skin if you are stupid enough to touch the surface.</li>
    <li> having short hair my curling brush was too big to use. This works great - I would recommend it especially since it is so light weight and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It heats up very fast and is a great size for short hair.</li>
    <li> used this product in past---great value  last forever</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curing brush because I have very short hair and 1/2 in. curling brushes are VERY hard to find.  It gets hotter than other brands of brushes and I have several Helen of Troy brushes.  My only complaint is just like everyone else&#x27;s.  The blue tip gets loose and then comes off completely and then the rows of bristles come flying off of the iron!!  Without the tip on the curling brush it is really useless.  The end of the brush without the blue tip is very hot and you cannot use it.  I have used Super Glue trying to glue the blue tip back on the brush and it lasts only a couple of times and then it goes flying off and I&#x27;m right back where I started-- with no blue tip!  I have other brands of curling brushes that don&#x27;t get near as hot and their tips do not come off!!  PLEASE PLEASE do something about this problem.  I know it can be done!!</li>
    <li> Product is okay and works well.  But I have fine hair and while the 1/2&amp;#34; barrel is good, the bristles are not as close together as an old curling brush that I purchased in Sears many years ago.  That would make the product perfect.</li>
    <li> Purchased the 1/2 inch and 3/4 inch at the same time. Love them both.&lt;br /&gt;They work well on my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Best curling iron I have ever purchased.  Will buy more for gifts. No tangling.</li>
    <li> Not an effective item. Does not curl well at all</li>
    <li> The first iron I got the barrel started rotating on me and I threw it away.  The second one so far is doing ok.</li>
    <li> I thought it didn&#x27;t have temperature control. It actually has a high/low control. I used it on my mother&#x27;s very fine and scant hair (she&#x27;s 89 in two weeks) and thought it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> Great product! So much better than the last two Belsons I bought. Does what you want a curling brush for.</li>
    <li> would rather a 1/2 inch hoy hat  brush</li>
    <li> Have always used them. Couldn&#x27;t get them where I used to get themso I tried you and glad I di . Thank you</li>
    <li> Arrived in great time.  Looks to be exactly what I wanted but have not used it yet for right now have long hair but am anticipating getting it cut soon and I wanted to be prepared when that happens -- am sure I will love it.  These are very hard to find.</li>
    <li> Love the smaller size wand. Great for shorter hair!</li>
    <li> Just the right size, east to use!</li>
    <li> Love it &amp; does  a great job curling with no frizz.  The black tip could be a lil longer tho.</li>
    <li> I had an excellent experience with you. And highly recommend to others as well. Satisfied with your product. Sales clerk was pleasant and very helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these curling irons and will continue to buy it. They perform well and are small enough for business trip travel. I tend to drop mine so when I do the comb stems break, thus my need to purchase a new one when this happens.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed ! Love It.</li>
    <li> THIS BRUSH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BEST FOR MANY YEARS.  I PURCHASED A DIFFERENT ONE TO SEE IF THAT WAS BETTER, IT WAS NOT, I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN IT, NOT SURE IF THAT COMPANY WILL ACCEPT RETURNS OR NOT.  I WENT BY THE REVIEWS ON THAT CURLING BRUSH, I GUESS YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T ALWAYS DEPEND ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE SAY ABOUT A PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE HELEN OF TROY CURLING HOT BRUSH.</li>
    <li> Great small barrel hot brush styler</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars because it is, in fact, 1/2 inch and does get hot, although you have to watch your fingers. It gets really hot. However, I didn&#x27;t read the description clearly enough, and since I have a Helen of Troy 3/4 inch hot /air/ brush, I thought this was a hot air brush also. It doesn&#x27;t really meet my needs, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the product.</li>
