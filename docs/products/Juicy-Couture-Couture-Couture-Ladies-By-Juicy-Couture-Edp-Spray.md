      <li>It was perfect!!</li>
      <li>I know the reccommended use says daytime, but I find this to be the perfect night time</li>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>Perfectly package, arrived on time, and just a great and legit place to get a gift</li>
      <li>/&gt;This has been the best fragrance I have experienced with</li>
      <li>and I was very pleased to have received item within 3 days!</li>
      <li>Definitely a great price for something I use all the time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great smell, and I get complimented when I wear it.</li>
      <li>Everything s just great .</li>
      <li>Great.  </li>
      <li>It made me feel good to know what i have purchased.  </li>
      <li>I used to be a Dior Fahrenheit guy, but since the refresh it wasn&#x27;t good.  </li>
      <li>But once you put it on and leave it on, it fades into a beautiful scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>Love it!  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this perfume!</li>
      <li>cant speak for everybody, but I personally love this scent!</li>
      <li>the bottle is amazing</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had any kind of compliments of the scent what</li>
      <li>Im sure most people would think this is more of a spring/summer time scent though.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>but that is was authentic.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I find this scent to be more on the floral side with some sweetness to it.</li>
      <li>I bought this more for the memory than anything else.</li>
      <li>I assumed since Couture is supposed to be so great that I didn&#x27;t really worry about how it smelled.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite go to scent.</li>
      <li>I love holding her close,  </li>
      <li>The  new \\&quot;parfume\\&quot; arrived quickly &amp; when it was unwrapped the metal logo fell off the front of the bottle(that should have put up the antenna); I had just purchased some fingernail glue &amp; that worked perfectly for remounting the logo.....</li>
      <li>Lucky to find it in a spray-not easy, as it&#x27;s not one of Juicy&#x27;s most popular scents.</li>
      <li>I enjoyed and loved it so much.</li>
      <li>This scent was a bit more floral than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s still very nice if you&#x27;re going to a classy event.</li>
      <li>First, my fiancee always smells nice.  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery!</li>
      <li>her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its light, and inviting.  </li>
      <li>Light and not over powering</li>
      <li>I opened to sniff &amp; it smelled like Juicy (yah, I was wearing my own Juicy); and, after the real Juicy ran out....</li>
      <li>so a great daily spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Å</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the perfume</li>
      <li>The perfume supplies a nice light and very feminine fragrance.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;notes&#x27; that are left after about 30 min. are kind of nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  </li>
      <li>Like most of you, I love Juicy &amp; gave myself a bottle for Christmas to carry me thru the New Year.</li>
      <li>and I wanted to original purchase that I made....</li>
      <li>Such wonderful classy perfume.</li>
      <li>This seller is a very credible company and when they say 100% original they are for real..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since it was first gifted to me several years ago by a family member at Christmas.</li>
      <li>; but I disagree; it lacks that &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; smell of &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; perfumes (I&#x27;m 28 years old and think it&#x27;s a wonderful young or middle-aged adult fragrance).</li>
      <li>but this one has staying power which makes it all the more my new fave.</li>
      <li>Just dont apply too much because it&#x27;s already strong</li>
      <li>My mother recently passed away and she liked this</li>
      <li>The package was in good condition and the shipping is on the due.</li>
      <li>This is too overwhelming and too \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; for me personally.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
      <li>I love it, and I get compliments, equally from men and women.</li>
      <li>Always seems to deliver fast after ordering!  </li>
      <li>It brings back so many memories to Christmas time (because I got it for Christmas</li>
      <li>Would absolutely reccomend!</li>
      <li>She had been raving that this was one of her all time favorite scents, so I decided to sample it but found it quite overpowering so left without purchasing it, however, after about 40mins the scent was positively alluring and I kept turning my wrist under my nose.</li>
      <li>Normally, fragrances fade quickly on me</li>
      <li>Because this one is definitely \\&quot;loud\\&quot; and you can most certainly \\&quot;hear\\&quot;</li>
      <li>price was right &amp; shipping was fast- thanks</li>
      <li>I bought her Victoria Secret Angels since I liked that one better, but it wasn&#x27;t really the best.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are very reasonably priced, very prompt with delivery,  and it is the real deal, no knock off perfume.  </li>
      <li>I like this scent much better after the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; period.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>Plus, the price was quite reasonable for a big-name</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I flew home that weekend and went straight to Amazon to order the set.</li>
      <li>haha)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like a lot of other perfume that fades into a very light scent too fast.</li>
      <li>If you want a more light &amp; subtle scent</li>
      <li>Just a light, delicate enhancement will do fine.</li>
      <li>Though I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it like most scents, it did give me a slight headache.  </li>
      <li>Silly Me because this fragrance is sexy, stays with me, and I love how I smell.</li>
      <li>Bought this in a roll on a while back and suddenly wanted more.</li>
      <li>so I mainly wear this in the winter.</li>
      <li>I was visiting a high school girlfriend of mine in Philly, for 4th of July</li>
      <li>So, when it came to Valentines day a little (1 ounce) bottle of Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum seemed appropriate.</li>
      <li>If you like perfumes that people will definitely know you&#x27;re right around the corner, then this one might be for you.  </li>
      <li>but I live in Israel</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been in search of a new fragrance and, while this one has been around for awhile, I was cautious of the hype.</li>
      <li>It may be a little too strong for some if you smell it while it&#x27;s in the bottle.</li>
      <li>and they not were only shock to hear how much i paid for the 3.4oz bottle</li>
      <li>I have ordered 2 bottles from this seller, so far.</li>
      <li>Amazon &amp; this is my first negative feedback; however, it is not my first disapppointment.....</li>
      <li>I get so much more compliments from the old style perfumes from Victoria&#x27;s Secret from year 1995.</li>
      <li>For me, I love Swiss Army Classic, another totally random find.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line, my Christmas Present Juicy is either old stock or pseudo-Juicy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just sweet (mostly floral and slightly fruity with a touch of spice) and subtle enough to wear every single day, and I get a lot of compliments.</li>

    <li> Perfectly perfect/Awesome!!!👍💓😊</li>
    <li> Bought this in a roll on a while back and suddenly wanted more. Lucky to find it in a spray-not easy, as it&#x27;s not one of Juicy&#x27;s most popular scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this perfume since it was first gifted to me several years ago by a family member at Christmas. It&#x27;s just sweet (mostly floral and slightly fruity with a touch of spice) and subtle enough to wear every single day, and I get a lot of compliments. I spritz a little on my pulse points &amp; in my hair. One 3.4oz bottle lasted almost two years! Just bought my second bottle. Definitely a great price for something I use all the time. Some online reviewers elsewhere have said it smells &amp;#34;old lady-ish,&amp;#34; but I disagree; it lacks that &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; smell of &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; perfumes (I&#x27;m 28 years old and think it&#x27;s a wonderful young or middle-aged adult fragrance).</li>
    <li> somebody told me this may not really be the same as the product I purchase in store.  I wish I knew the truth to that.</li>
    <li> I agree with another reviewer in that I like this scent much better after the \\&quot;dry down\\&quot; period.  The &#x27;notes&#x27; that are left after about 30 min. are kind of nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  This is too overwhelming and too \\&quot;flowery\\&quot; for me personally.  Though I wasn&#x27;t allergic to it like most scents, it did give me a slight headache.  If you like perfumes that people will definitely know you&#x27;re right around the corner, then this one might be for you.  Because this one is definitely \\&quot;loud\\&quot; and you can most certainly \\&quot;hear\\&quot; it announcing itself!  If you want a more light &amp; subtle scent that&#x27;s very similar, try \\&quot;Pretty\\&quot; by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
    <li> I ordered the perfume in the picture which I already had previously so I know of this product and i got a different juicy perfume, what sucks is I ordered it to the states and i told them not to open the box but I live in Israel so when I got it I was very upset :-(</li>
    <li> Great.  Love it!  Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> I was visiting a high school girlfriend of mine in Philly, for 4th of July and we went shopping at Juicy Couture. She had been raving that this was one of her all time favorite scents, so I decided to sample it but found it quite overpowering so left without purchasing it, however, after about 40mins the scent was positively alluring and I kept turning my wrist under my nose. I flew home that weekend and went straight to Amazon to order the set. I love it, and I get compliments, equally from men and women. It&#x27;s a night scent, but sometimes when I feel like causing a stir from the mundane, I&#x27;ll wear it to the office as it keeps my senses on luscious all day.</li>
    <li> Like most of you, I love Juicy &amp; gave myself a bottle for Christmas to carry me thru the New Year. The  new \\&quot;parfume\\&quot; arrived quickly &amp; when it was unwrapped the metal logo fell off the front of the bottle(that should have put up the antenna); I had just purchased some fingernail glue &amp; that worked perfectly for remounting the logo.....so-o-o-o nieve....I opened to sniff &amp; it smelled like Juicy (yah, I was wearing my own Juicy); and, after the real Juicy ran out....the one ordered from Amazon didn&#x27;t smell like Juicy anymore; and, time had tolled on returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, my Christmas Present Juicy is either old stock or pseudo-Juicy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have purchased over 40-items on Amazon &amp; this is my first negative feedback; however, it is not my first disapppointment.....I do not punish a Seller with negative feedback simply because I didn&#x27;t like a product I purchased!</li>
    <li> This scent was a bit more floral than I was expecting, but it&#x27;s still very nice if you&#x27;re going to a classy event.</li>
    <li> My wife loves Juicy Couture products for her and for the baby. A lot of her friends seem to feel the same way. So, when it came to Valentines day a little (1 ounce) bottle of Juicy Couture Eau de Parfum seemed appropriate. It was. The perfume supplies a nice light and very feminine fragrance. It&#x27;s not overpowering, and that&#x27;s the way I prefer perfumes. Just a light, delicate enhancement will do fine. Plus, the price was quite reasonable for a big-name brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
    <li> Perfectly package, arrived on time, and just a great and legit place to get a gift</li>
    <li> Always seems to deliver fast after ordering!  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this perfume! It brings back so many memories to Christmas time (because I got it for Christmas haha) so I mainly wear this in the winter. Im sure most people would think this is more of a spring/summer time scent though. I know the reccommended use says daytime, but I find this to be the perfect night time scent.&lt;br /&gt;I find this scent to be more on the floral side with some sweetness to it. It may be a little too strong for some if you smell it while it&#x27;s in the bottle. But once you put it on and leave it on, it fades into a beautiful scent that&#x27;s not too strong. It&#x27;s not like a lot of other perfume that fades into a very light scent too fast. This is one of the perfumes that actually lasts on me AND my clothing all day long! I could still smell it on my shirt almost a week later of applying it. Just dont apply too much because it&#x27;s already strong so you don&#x27;t want to choke yourself or anybody else with it haha. All you need is a little.&lt;br /&gt;I cant speak for everybody, but I personally love this scent!</li>
    <li> It was great! It smells just like the one I bought from Nordstrom a few years ago and was a third of the price. Would absolutely reccomend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of a new fragrance and, while this one has been around for awhile, I was cautious of the hype. Silly Me because this fragrance is sexy, stays with me, and I love how I smell. Normally, fragrances fade quickly on me but this one has staying power which makes it all the more my new fave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always hearing about Couture this Couture that...so I was curious and I felt like this was a descent price and I purchased it. I assumed since Couture is supposed to be so great that I didn&#x27;t really worry about how it smelled. When I got it through the mail they attatched a note......sorry, we gave you a different one because they only have this one it smells the same. SO HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT IT SMELLS THE SAME. I was angry at first, because they didn&#x27;t bother to contact me and ask me if I would prefer the alternative and just send it anyways. What if I didn&#x27;t want the alternative and I wanted to original purchase that I made....Anyways I was and still a little unhappy about that! The ALTERNATIVE smells okay so I kepted it. I haven&#x27;t had any kind of compliments of the scent what so ever so I won&#x27;t buy again! I get so much more compliments from the old style perfumes from Victoria&#x27;s Secret from year 1995. I&#x27;ll stick to that!!!!</li>
    <li> price was right &amp; shipping was fast- thanks</li>
    <li> Perfume smells wonderful and I was very pleased to have received item within 3 days! Will reorder in the future.</li>
    <li> Such wonderful classy perfume. My cats stole the pink zipper ribbon and pin, and I need a replacem,ent of that. .But the bottle is amazing</li>
    <li> It was perfect!! Thank u!</li>
    <li> I received my Juicy Couture and I am unable to use the bottle that I have received I am very unhappy with the response that I have not received either I sent an email to the supplier and no reply either.  I really enjoy the perfume but I am unable to use the item it will not spray at all.  I don&#x27;t understand what I am to do with the bottle of perfume. I have e-mailed the sell and at this time I have not received a reply as of today.  I just want to return or tread it in for a bottle that does spray. Please contact me as soon as possible so that we can decided our next step.</li>
    <li> Everything s just great . I enjoyed and loved it so much. The package was in good condition and the shipping is on the due. Nothing to worry about this product and the seller. thanks</li>
    <li> First, my fiancee always smells nice.  I am a big fragrance guy myself even up to Creed levels.  I like them to be non-overpowering and applicable to the situation.  For me, I love Swiss Army Classic, another totally random find.  I used to be a Dior Fahrenheit guy, but since the refresh it wasn&#x27;t good.  In my last order of it, I got a sample for the Swiss Army and been with it 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes Viva La Juicy...I didn&#x27;t care for it.  I bought her Victoria Secret Angels since I liked that one better, but it wasn&#x27;t really the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever want to tell my partner she should smell like another I was with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to Sam&#x27;s and she wanted to buy a different Juicy Couture fragrance to try.  I didn&#x27;t like it (nor Sam&#x27;s) but I am glad those idiots messed her order up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been the best fragrance I have experienced with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its light, and inviting.  I love holding her close,  It&#x27;s not expensive so a great daily spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Å</li>
    <li> B-day gift for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite go to scent. It&#x27;s a great smell, and I get complimented when I wear it. Light and not over powering</li>
    <li> I have ordered 2 bottles from this seller, so far. They are very reasonably priced, very prompt with delivery,  and it is the real deal, no knock off perfume.  Will continue to order from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> This seller is a very credible company and when they say 100% original they are for real.. I went to Lord &amp; Taylor and had them check out the perfume for me and they not were only shock to hear how much i paid for the 3.4oz bottle but that is was authentic.  It made me feel good to know what i have purchased.  I will definitely continue to buy from them</li>
    <li> I bought this more for the memory than anything else. My mother recently passed away and she liked this fragrance-- I wanted to remember her. I wear it now and again to remember.</li>
