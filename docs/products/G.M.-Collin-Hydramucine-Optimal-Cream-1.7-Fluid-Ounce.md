      <li>Great shipper ..</li>
      <li>As for this product it works beautifully to keep my skin moisturizer and hydrated so that it regulates it&#x27;s own oil production.</li>
      <li>and I love it!  </li>
      <li>Amazon by far has the best price as well.</li>
      <li>I love the feel of my skin</li>
      <li>and it does not appear authentic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great and my skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>

      <li>It is rich and moist.  </li>
      <li>and she was so right!</li>

    <li> This product works really well.  I love the feel of my skin and I use it twice a day and the bottle lasts for months.</li>
    <li> It is rich and moist.  I only need to use a drop or two which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to have a tiny travel sized bottle, but meanwhile, I just put it in another small bottle when I travel.</li>
    <li> Ultra moisturizing. This was suggested to me by my esthetician and she was so right! Amazon by far has the best price as well.</li>
    <li> Shipment arrived very quickly, high quality packaging. The product is fantastic for anyone with sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Nice &amp; reasonable priced.</li>

    <li> The product appeared unused but did not have any expiration date on the bottle unlike the other GM products that I bought before. It has a very strange stale smell like the smell of lotions that went bad after being kept for a long period of time. Tried to return the product but seller refused to take it back. Will never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great for the cold weather season. A bit heavy for the summer.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great shipper ..thanks</li>
    <li> I really like this product and I love the fact that the price was very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;The cream came super fast and it was the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it so far. I was told that there is a difference in the way my eyes look. Keeps the skin around my eyes so hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have surface dry skin on my checks. This is the only product that continues to hydrate and soften my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years now as my day cream , along with the treating mist. This is a winner.</li>
    <li> I also purchased this and it does not appear authentic. It smells different and the bottle looks slightly different. It smells horrible. Smells rancid.</li>
    <li> I have combo skin and am in my 50s.  Cream keeps my skin evenly moisturized and I do think helps with the anti-aging skin process!</li>
    <li> I first discovered this getting a facial and LOVE this stuff. It hydrates my skin but never leaves it oily. It&#x27;s great and my skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
    <li> When I turned 40, my skin turned sensitive almost overnight. I had dry patches that just got irritated and red when I tried to put moisturizer on them - yikes! Collin Hydramucine Cream fixed that! This cream &amp;#34;floats&amp;#34; onto your skin, giving it lots of moisture without any oiliness. It somehow also adds a suppleness that is more like my 30 year old skin! EVERY time I was my face I will smooth on Hydramucine to lock in moisture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year and I love it!  It isn&#x27;t oily to the touch and I get a lot of compliments about my skin since using the GM Collin products.  Try it, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  It&#x27;s a little expensive but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Thought it was the gel</li>
