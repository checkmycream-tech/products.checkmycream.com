<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Sadly, didn&#x27;t work well for me.  I&#x27;m used to my oil cleanser and feel like it removes my mascara and makeup better than this does.  I&#x27;ll just have to put up with the oil cleanser being slightly more drying. I&#x27;m really not someone who&#x27;s skin breaks out, but with this it did.  Still, it&#x27;s not a bad cleanser.  And although this isn&#x27;t a hugely important factor--the smell seemed very artificial and somehow inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is a remarkable product. It strips the skin of all presence of makeup - any kind of makeup, and so quickly. Just dab, give it a mo, wipe away with a damp cloth/napkin and you&#x27;re done. Leaves skin soft, never irritated. Does not hurt if gets into your eyes.</li>
    <li> Works well on my aging skin. My skin has never been cleaner... I like everything about it!</li>
    <li> I wish I loved this as much as the other reviewers. I had difficulty removing the residue from this off of my skin. My face definitely didn&#x27;t feel clean after using. I&#x27;ll stick with the Basis facial cleansing cloths.</li>
    <li> 5 stars: I thought I would get the older packaging if this version but it turned out I got the new one and I loved it. It did arrive a day earlier then said which was good. I got mine from bizarro. I used it yesterday&#x27;s night and this morning when I woke up I had no allergic reactions whatsoever!! :) although the smell is not good its okay because there was no added fragrance but I wished they would add a flower like rose petals (hopefully not lavender because lavender is bad for the skin) so in a nutshell I loved this but for the stars if I could I would give it a 4.5 When I received it too it the lid and spatula inside came very oily.  UPDATE: Now changing to 3 stars. It is okay, but i did not use it.</li>
    <li> I have always been scared to try the oil cleanse, but this stuff makes it incredibly easy. It definitely, DEFINITELY needs a foam cleanser as a second step, but it takes off makeup ridiculously well and gives you a nice moisture boost. Since it&#x27;s almost a sherbet consistency, it doesn&#x27;t run all over, and it goes directly where you apply it. My complexion (combination, mostly oily) has never looked better since I started using it in tandem with Skinfood&#x27;s Egg White Pore Foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> It smells good and does clean very well. It is solid therefore I don&#x27;t worry that it will split out and easy to carry.</li>
    <li> Awesome makeup remover ever:) it removes mascara like a breeze! Its very moisturizing, does not strip your skin.Only con..i wish instructions were in english too.</li>
    <li> I used regular Zero clean, ( in the blue jar),  prior to this. I like both products equally. It is effective in taking off makeup as well as lifitng dead skin cells at dry patches. It makes the skin soft and is a great first cleanser. I bought this one from this company because they use prime. I got a great price and two day shipping! )</li>
    <li> It was fast shipping and excellent item.</li>
    <li> Best make up remover I&#x27;ve used so far. Very gentle and does not leave the face greasy. Light scent is also pleasant I will definitely buy again!!!</li>
    <li> this stuff is heavenly. My white towels actually stay white now because it removes all the dirt and mascara. All of it, completely.</li>
    <li> Smell subtly and wonderful with a light pink color.  The texture is smooth soft solid and goes on face not too greasy like oil cleanser can get.  Has a scoop inside for hygienic application.  However 3 stars since this does not remove eye makeup as well as it does with foundation.  So if you are like me and want a one stop shop for all makeup removal in one bottle, this is not it. But if you only need to remove foundation then this is very nice.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  Does a great job and has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing. My makeup are all water proof, AND can not be budged when I wear it so its nice to know I won&#x27;t have to scrub my face until it turns red to get hopefully all my makeup off. With this, it takes me only 5 max with not scrub. My face feels fresh and clean with no nasty oil residue left over. I mostly like it for removing mascara because it doesn&#x27;t leave an awkward dark ring on my under eyes.</li>
    <li> So, I purchased this item based on a review by a Youtuber. I was extremely excited because I trust this Youtuber and any product I purchased based on her review has been pretty good so far! Regarding this product, I do have to say it does not come with instructions--- mainly because it&#x27;s a Korean product, so don&#x27;t expect to be taught when it you have it! Even so, it&#x27;s pretty basic. It smells pretty good, which is a great positive on my end. I hate products that smell chemically. Warning: don&#x27;t rub into eyes. I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure on how to use it, since it was just your basic massage kind of technique. I&#x27;ve always used make up wipes, and I would rub them on my eye lids for a complete clean. With Clean it Zero, I recommend being careful around the eyes. The product doesn&#x27;t burn one bit, which is great! However, it momentarily disrupted my vision when I tried to check if all my eye make up was gone. All it did was kind of put this transparent film over my vision? Blur might be an effect, but I have blurry vision anyway so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell. Moral of the review, be careful on the first couple of times using this product. I do think it takes practice, especially if you&#x27;re not use to oil cleansers. Other than that, it removed my make up and gave a brief second &#x27;fresh&#x27; feeling. Just because I like a good, deep clean, I went in with my Glam Glow product afterwards. I&#x27;m not in love with this product, but I do like it! It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll have to get use to, and I find nothing wrong with that. I find it as an experience to learn and practice different types of skin care.</li>
    <li> This was a much needed addition to my nightly skin care routine.  I don&#x27;t use makeup, however after using this along with my normal cleanser my skin is much cleaner.  Somehow although being an oil cleanser it gets deep into your pores to pull out dirt.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup, rinses cleanly away, smells pleasant, comes in a cute jar. What more could you want?</li>
    <li> Highly recommended ,soft non greasy and best takes your make off without scrubing</li>
    <li> I love this product. Even removed waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Amazed with how fast my makeup was completely removed! yet this balm was gentle on my skin, I actually saw a brighter and imperfection free complexion.</li>
    <li> This product just blows me away. When you unscrew the lid, there will be a plastic spoon type deal on the underside of it to scoop the product out for less contamination. The texture of this product is like a balm and once you start rubbing it into your face, it turns into an oil. It literally just melts your makeup. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it stinging your eyes if it gets in them. After I took it off with a wet washcloth, my face felt silky smooth and looked brighter than it does after I use an exfoliant! Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great product.</li>
    <li> It can remove my make up easily，and it&#x27;s very gentle and nice，will buy it again</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!!! It will clean all waterproof makeup and it doesn&#x27;t take much. I would def. recommend this to everyone who wears make up and re-purchase this product.</li>
    <li> This product came opened already. The card board box was not even close all the way. The scooper inside has grease on it. The cap was not close all the way. However, consider the product surface is still full and smooth with a clear plastic cap on it, I will keep it. Just feel like it&#x27;s an used scooper though&lt;br /&gt;Performance: this is my second jar. I did not buy my first one here. I love this cleaner. It&#x27;s my holy grail for the lower price oil cleansing products. It does what it suppose to: clean off make up, sun screen, dirt, exceed sweat and oil - without stripping my screen off. I can not leave without oil cleanser</li>
    <li> This feels amazing on my skin! Only cleanser I will use now!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing facial cleanser I have ever used.  It removes eye makeup etc without leaving skin dry.</li>
    <li> I have been testing out a bunch of different Korean face cleansers, and this is by far my favorite one! I enjoy the scent (it&#x27;s not strong!) and it doesn&#x27;t get messy like my other oil cleansers. My hard to remove makeup came off immediately and this product did not irritate my sensitive skin at all. I would highly recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I love this. it removes the makeup very well! I even forget to use my clarisonic...</li>
    <li> very good product!! love it!</li>
    <li> The product is great. My face feel clean, and unlike the cleansing oil, this product does not leave you an oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that the box was opened when it came.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is legit or not since I never used other ones, but it&#x27;s a great product. ^^</li>
    <li> This stuff works great! I have really dry skin and it cleans all of my makeup off as well as moisturizes!</li>
    <li> I really like this as a makeup remover. It leaved my skin feeling very clean but not dry. You don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of it, just a pea size amount, rub it in on your face, add some water to emulsify then rinse off. Have already ordered another one.</li>
    <li> Clean it Zero is fantastic.  I use it when I remove my makeup and regardless of how waterproof something is it removes it all.  The packaging is adorable too,  I love having it sitting on my vanity.  It comes with a little lid inside to cover the product and a spoon sits on the lid. I do wish the little spoon was a bright color or something instead of a clear/hazy plastic, however,  I&#x27;ll take a clear spoon over none.  As for the product itself,  you only need a small amount,  maybe more depending on how much you are trying to remove.  It scoops out semi-solid and melts to an oil on your face.  It feels nice on the skin and doesn&#x27;t have any drying effect because it&#x27;s so oil like.  Be careful around the eyes though,  it is mildly irritating,  but I do tend to have much more sensitivities that most to products around my eyes.  It does sting a bit if you get any in the eye area and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this for hardcore mascara remover because of that reason.  However when just try to remove light makeup or even decently heavy eye makeup(minus mascara) it&#x27;s pretty easy to avoid getting into or under the lash line.  I really recommend this if your looking for a new makeup remover.</li>
    <li> i am in love with this stuff. The smell, the texture, the fact that it gets every single speck of makeup off my face and doesn&#x27;t make me feel stripped &amp; dry afterwards. I had doubts that the oily consistency would remove completely with water but you could even rose with cold water and it would wash right off completely. Amazing and highly recommended. Will be a regular in my routine! I like the original formula (pink container) the best. The green/blue sensitive formula seems to not get my mascara off as easily.</li>
    <li> I love this make up remover.Your face are very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, and makes me feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some rave reviews about this stuff, but honestly, I&#x27;m underwhelmed. Leaves my skin feeling a bit tight and dried out. I think it&#x27;s just too harsh for me. My skin is sensitive, but not usually overly dry or oily. Meh. It does remove my makeup well and it&#x27;s not terrible, but not ideal for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff gets all my makeup off. I use a lot of waterproof eye makeup to help me battle the oil slick that is my skin. Clean It Zero gets it all off. I love the texture of the sherbet. It makes it fun to use! Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> love this product!&lt;br /&gt;P: skin feels smooth after&lt;br /&gt;  won&#x27;t make your skin feel dry&lt;br /&gt;  Easily remove makeup and even waterproof eyeliners&lt;br /&gt;  Not greasy or have those &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feel&lt;br /&gt;  it smells so nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C: none</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product, especially because I saw that Song Ji Hyo uses this cleanser/endorses Banila Co. However, it broke me out consistently whenever I used it. I thought maybe it was other factors so I stopped using it for a while, stopped breaking out, then used it again and broke out again so I had to toss it. But, I will say that it does a very good job of removing all your makeup and has a very pleasant smell to it. Obviously will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT/APPLICATION:&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a spatula (I didn&#x27;t use it because I prefer to use my skincare products with clean hands). Has a very light, sherbet smell that kindof makes you keep wanting to use/smell it. Product is kindof chunky when you scoop it out at first, but then it melts as soon as you rub your fingers together, which always fascinated me. Easy application, easy to remove. Does not sting your eyes either.</li>
    <li> very good product, it is worth to wait that long time to get it.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is very gentle and help to clean make up completely.&lt;br /&gt;like it!!</li>
    <li> Works well. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging and really gets all of your makeup off.</li>
    <li> This product dries my skin out. It indeed cleans makeups to zero in seconds. But it plunders the water in my skin at the same time. Not exaggerating, my skins(especially around eyes) shrunk (yeah it shrunk) after I removed my makeups and I was forces to put on some cream immediately. I like gel or cream make up removers. My fav product is make up for ever so divine which is a moisturizing make up remover. I was disappointed about this product and I decided to turn back to so divine remover.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;t use it if you have dry skins.</li>
    <li> Really like the product. Smells very nice and I like the way my face feels after using it.</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s my best and favorite so far.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted to see if I could find a lower priced solution to the Eve Lom balm cleanser that I have used for a couple of years. I liked it well enough, but I won&#x27;t be replacing the Eve Lom with it. They are both oil based balm type cleansers that are formulated to fully remove makeup and rinse cleanly. The Clean It Zero performs reasonably well, but the Eve Lom takes less effort to remove my waterproof eye makeup. I needed to wash twice with the Clean It Zero and use more of the product to remove all my makeup. Also the Eve Lom rinses more cleanly. The Clean It Zero left a greasy feeling residue even after rinsing multiple times and finishing with a clean washcloth. I know that fragrance is a very subjective topic, but I also didn&#x27;t care for the fragrance of the Clean It Zero. It&#x27;s floral and almost candy sweet. I&#x27;ll use this tub because it&#x27;s not an awful product, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t get it off of your eyes.</li>
    <li> good makeup remover will buy it again</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use this before I use my regular face wash. My skin has been quite clear lately, perhaps that&#x27;s because this product removes all makeup and residue. My only complaint is that there is not enough! I go through it so quickly.</li>
    <li> I give 4stars cause after cleaned my face feel very dry.</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup remover i had ever try.. It take everything off like it say Clean it zero. This is my second purchased. I really love it!! Will purchased it again when im half way done.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash! I use this and a foam cleanser at night to wash my face and this one leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth. It smells just really nice and light - not overpowering. My boyfriend and I both use it and I&#x27;ve noticed how clean and illuminated his skin has started to look. I like the texture of this... it kind of feels velvety. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue and hasn&#x27;t dried out our faces. (BF has dry skin and I have sensitive) It&#x27;s also full of antioxidants...so great for the skin! It takes my makeup off really easily- even my tough waterproof mascara.</li>
    <li> Takes off eye makeup COMPLETELY, very comparable to the effects of Clinique&#x27;s cleansing balm which I love but not the price. Doesn&#x27;t leave as much of an oily residue as Clinique&#x27;s or any other but I still use a cleanser afterwards.</li>
    <li> Very good quality with low price! I am kinda dry skin and it works good on me! Will buy it again</li>
    <li> my skin is sensitive and get well with it.love it.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. It removes all makeup and leaves my face feeling so fresh and clean. I didn&#x27;t realize how much makeup stays on your face with just regular face wash or makeup removing wipes until I used this product.</li>
    <li> This is the first cleanser I have tried that really removes waterproof mascara! It is easy to use and has a soft, pleasant scent. Rinses easily with water. Caveat: No instructions in English.</li>
    <li> Easy on the skin, removes eye make up, gentle on the eyes, easy to wash off, feels great after. Product ships from Korea, so you may wait a few weeks, but it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> This really does remove any extra makeup without irritating my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing makeup and I have a hard time removing my (non-waterproof) mascara using this. Usually it takes two cleanses to completely remove my eye makeup. It also doesn&#x27;t rinse clean. I normally double cleanse anyway but there is no way I could get away with using this without a separate cleanser afterwards because of the thick film it leaves on my skin. As someone with oily, acne-prone skin this scares me a bit but after a a few weeks of using it I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the big benefits of oil cleaners for people with skin like mine is that they are great at pulling gunk out of congested pores. This product does not do this for me. My pores have been very clogged since I started using this and I will probably be giving it away and switching back to a cleansing oil.</li>
    <li> It works so amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You feel comfortable and smooth, quite stretchy, and can no longer feel dry skin to breathe. Almost like a moisturizer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly importantly, it&#x27;s very easy to remove the water-proof makeups. Also it&#x27;s a big jar, 100ml, cost-effective!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> I LOOOOOOOVE this so much! Its so gentle and yet it even removes my waterproof mascara. Definitely a must!!</li>
    <li> I really wonder how I would get my makeup off before this, I love the way my skin feels after</li>
    <li> It smells good and very easy to remove make-up, even heavy one. It is not too oily but moisture, so you can feel refresh after washing your face by using it. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product. Love the smell and how it melts. I love using this for facial and neck massage, and it really deep cleans pores while I massage. For people comparing it to other balms and oils; this IS greasy. It&#x27;s supposed to be. Common sense and the product don&#x27;t seem to go together for some people.&lt;br /&gt;It really cuts makeup well though I only use it for face makeup. I&#x27;ve used it for eye makeup removal as well, and it worked extremely well, but as a balm it was a bit ungainly to remove. Leaving the balm on my lids and around my eyes and pinching it onto my lashes down to the base and letting it sit for a minute worked extremely well. No, it wasn&#x27;t like swabbing my eyes with oil and it all coming off in one of three swipes, but it all came off at once when I use it on my eyes and left my eyes extremely moisturized, but removing it at once took an oil cloth to do my lashes to slide the mascara off while swiping the rest of the makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;I stick to liquid oils for most as common sense since it obviously isn&#x27;t going to seep into waterproof mascara as well as oil and isn&#x27;t as versatile in the eye area. As a face makeup remover, it&#x27;s freaking fantastic and rinses clean for a balm and completely clean for me, but as a user of the 2-4-2 method regardless of oil or balm, I wash my face with a Korean face wash for pH balance and moisture for two minutes after using the Clean It balm.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me and leaves my face very soft and ready for the rest of my night routine.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! It has a pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t too strong and it gently cleanses all makeup and dirt off of the face. I like that it&#x27;s in a balm form that turns into an oil when you rub your hands together--not as messy that way.</li>
    <li> very gentle. didn&#x27;t break me out on my acne+sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;texture is very creamy and as a cleanser, works great.</li>
    <li> Love how it&#x27;s not too oily and leave my skin pretty soft. Takes off all my make up pretty good and makes my face feel clean. I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> Cleans makeup, dust, right up without leaving very greasy feeling.  Waterproof makeup comes off easily too.  Still needs to wipe clean with tissue and then wash again with regular face wash of course.</li>
    <li> i like it very much! and may be i will buy it later! really cute! very nice! i like it !</li>
    <li> Cleanses gently and deeply. Removes all my makeup and rinses off better than any cleansing oil I have used. It is also really easy to travel with since it is a balm and not an oil. So far this cleanser is good for my acne prone skin as well!</li>
    <li> Works great, no greasy, no acnes, doesn&#x27;t sting eyes</li>
    <li> It hydrates my dry skin very nicely and removes everything quickly without having to use too much product. I really like this stuff! It also smells pretty good! I totally recommend this to anyone looking for something hydrating that will remove makeup easily without extra tugging or extra products.</li>
    <li> Really just as effective as any cleansing oil. Rinses clean with water, no greasy residue. The smell gets old for me. Next time I might try the sensitive version.</li>
    <li> love it, i will definitely buy it in the future</li>
    <li> Excellent product ! Love it</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it removes my makeup but it stays caked on like grease and it&#x27;s hard to wash off. I was expecting it to be real simple precedure but the removal of it takes longer than necessary. So it does the job but it&#x27;s a hassle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and its so soft on my face. Does an excellent job getting the makeup off especially my eye makeup.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. It feels amazing and has a very subtle, extremely pleasant smell. Very effective at removing make up, non-irritating and non-drying. Comes with a plastic cover for inside and a small spoon (use this to avoid getting bacteria on your hands in the product!). On top of all that, it&#x27;s very easy to remove with water only, although a washcloth does help. Before this I was using Pond&#x27;s cold cream which was so irritating to get off my skin and definitely required double cleansing. Double cleansing is a good idea but with clean it zero you may be able to get away without it depending on your skin since the product washes away so easily. Will definitely be buying again and again.</li>
    <li> This product did do as intended but unfortunately it made me break out. It did smell nice and remove makeup well, maybe this is for someone without acne prone or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Intro:&lt;br /&gt;I am a novice in the make up remover realm and I&#x27;ve been saving up some funds to try a few asian brands. I read a ton of fabulous reviews on this product on its unparalleled effectiveness and convenience. The only other make up removers I&#x27;ve used are some neutragena eye make up remover I tried years and years ago that I hated because it got everywhere and felt disgusting and greasy (at the time, I was in high school and had no idea what to expect or how to use make up remover thanks to American cosmetics marketing) and various off-brand asian make up removing cloths (which worked great but felt wasteful and were a little hard to travel with). I read great things about this on Skin and Tonics blog found here: http://skinandtonics.com/banila-co-clean-zero-cleansing-balm-review/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great soft consistency. In the jar, it&#x27;s a semisolid, but when you rub it between your hands, it becomes more of an liquid oil.&lt;br /&gt;-It removes all my make up every single time. I used to clean my make up brushes with regular soap, then one day used this instead and the difference was shocking. My stippling brush has white bristles and no matter how many times I would wash with soap, the white bristles remained tinted with foundation, so I kind of just came to accept it and didn&#x27;t think too much about it. When I used this, they became pure white again. And it&#x27;s doing it to my face every time I use it? Uh-mazing.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells awesome, apparently like cherry blossoms.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to put into a mini travel jar and take on trips. It came with a little sticker in the box, so I stuck it on the lid of my travel container. Also comes with a plastic crescent-shaped spoon thing that I used to transfer it.&lt;br /&gt;-Washes off easily with water into a milky emulsion and takes all the makeup and gunk with it. Leaves my face feeling great, not dry and not oily, just &amp;#34;supple&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The fragrance COOOULD be an issue for someone with sensitivities to fragrances? I&#x27;ve never had a sensitivity to fragrances so I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a little pricey for me. I think I&#x27;m going to keep experimenting with different make up removers and see if I can just get away with a cheaper one? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s worth every penny! I&#x27;m just on the cheap side and want to see what&#x27;s out there for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> This works really well. After using it i feel my skin so smooth and especially it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Will buy this again</li>
    <li> Banila Co Clean It Zero is considered a &amp;#34;Holy Grail&amp;#34; product by many fans. It is first cleanser aka oil cleanser in a sherbet form. All the benefits of an oil cleanser but not in a liquid format. It is a whipped consistency which melts after application to the face. It even smells nice- sorta fruity- but not a heavy perfume scent.  There are many ways to use this  product but the two most popular: 1) Apply, immediately gently remove the makeup using the fingertips only by applying gentle pressure using circular motions, wash off using water 2) Apply, wait 3-15 minutes, use gentle pressure and circular motions with fingertips only remove makeup and dirt,  wash of fusing water  I favor the former since I tend to like to get the cleaning done swiftly in order to get to the hydration steps in my skincare routine. Both are valid methods.  Since I don&#x27;t use a lot of makeup or heavy coverage, keeping the cleanser on for a longer period seems like an overkill for me.  Essentially, it cleans and it  doesn&#x27;t drip like a traditional oil cleanser. Easier to transport and smells delicious.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover! and it makes skin soft and moist after removing!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I bought this item twice and the first time I used it and I love it. However, when I got it this time, it looked like it has been used before. DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
