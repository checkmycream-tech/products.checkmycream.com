      <li>That might not be important to others, but I don&#x27;t like too slimy and too potent products.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this shampoo and enjoy the smell.  </li>
      <li>Smells good and leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>

      <li>My hair felt soft, it was easier to manage/style, and looked clean (</li>
      <li>Shampoo should do two things: clean your hair and leave it feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and it leaves me hair feeling clean and slick and feels great throughout the day.</li>
      <li>so I cannot say if it will really condition by itself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the bigger bottle but someone in my family keeps giving me free shampoo.</li>
      <li>They do have a good selection of options for those with different hair types: oily, dry, normal, treated, etc.</li>
      <li>good product but other shampoos available for same price locally</li>
      <li>Ok, so I was lazy and wanted a quick fix in the mornings to my nightly tangles without spending 5 minutes letting conditioner soak in.</li>
      <li>I know there are shampoos that claim to fix split ends or make your hair appear more full, but I only expect the previously listed two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised how well this shampoo worked.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and it shines.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>None have ever let me done thus far.</li>
      <li>, it cleans my hair and leaves it de-tangled, but not heavy the way some conditioners can.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is extremely drying, I would only recommend it for fine oily hair.</li>
      <li>In the mean time, I&#x27;m glad I had a backup solution.  </li>
      <li>Made my ends super brittle and still left me extremely tangled.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I feel this shampoo washes the hair very well in one single use.</li>
      <li>For example, the other day my husband and I went on a date to a new restaurant.</li>

    <li> good product but other shampoos available for same price locally</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo and conditioner combo. I use it daily and it leaves me hair feeling clean and slick and feels great throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Shampoo should do two things: clean your hair and leave it feeling soft. That&#x27;s it. I know there are shampoos that claim to fix split ends or make your hair appear more full, but I only expect the previously listed two items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switched to Garnier a number of years ago, it was a random purchase at a small convenience store, as my shampoo broke during my trip. I was hesitant to try this brand, as it never struck me as a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; company - but at the same time, didn&#x27;t seem like one of those bargain brands that leaves residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised how well this shampoo worked. No gunk left behind; no negative reaction with my scalp (which I believe leads to dandruff); and no overpowering scent throughout the day. My hair felt soft, it was easier to manage/style, and looked clean (no greasy/grungy appearance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous versions from this line of shampoos and have not found one I don&#x27;t like yet. They do have a good selection of options for those with different hair types: oily, dry, normal, treated, etc. Try the one that you believe best matches your head and if you don&#x27;t get the desired effect, step up/down one on the ladder (assuming the ladder is dry/normal/oily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find the value of this shampoo, plus the ability to clean my hair as a good buy. The scent is mild, the clean is real, and in the end, my hair benefits. What more do you want from a shampoo?</li>
    <li> I love Garnier products!!  None have ever let me done thus far. I like the 2-in-1 for it&#x27;s convenience and ...because it&#x27;s Garnier!~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought another Garnier Shampoo. It is called strength and length.  I will let you know how that turns out and update it on this review.</li>
    <li> You NEVER do anything about it.This is the third time its happened. I would not recommend anyone buy this stuff if they dont know how to pack it!!!</li>
    <li> The best combo shampoo and conditioner out there I recommend this to all my friends I even use it on my dogs</li>
    <li> This is simply the best shampoo ever! Great clean without a dulling build up, always leaves my hair manageable &amp; looking great!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my hair, but I really love the smell and the texture of the shampoo/conditioner. That might not be important to others, but I don&#x27;t like too slimy and too potent products. This is perfect. I just wish my hair felt smoother or shiny or something.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is extremely drying, I would only recommend it for fine oily hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the after effect of this product. And it also smells amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Leaves me with flakes...&lt;br /&gt;maybe because its a 2-in-1 not sure, but I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I have to wash my hair more often.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all my 20-something son will use with his long hair.</li>
    <li> Has just enough conditioner to soften hair. Not like some conditioners that leave hair feeling greasy. Great for anyone with oily, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the bigger bottle but someone in my family keeps giving me free shampoo. Not what I&#x27;d choose. THIS is what I choose. It&#x27;s best during the summer and spring, though.</li>
    <li> Did not weigh down my hair like some other products do  Very happy with the product and I will buy again</li>
    <li> I enjoy this shampoo and enjoy the smell.  I&#x27;m picky with the smells as I do not like the typical &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; smells.  This worked great.  The only issue I have is it was just removed from subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> Nice product.Smells good and leaves my hair clean and soft. I love Garnier hair care products. Good stuff</li>
    <li> yuck smell! burns my eyes . doesnt rinse out . get aveeno much better</li>
    <li> This was definitely not cheaper online than in local stores, but for a while I had a hard time buying the 2-1 locally.  That problem has been resolved now.  In the mean time, I&#x27;m glad I had a backup solution.  I like this formula, it cleans my hair and leaves it de-tangled, but not heavy the way some conditioners can.  It smells good like apples and pineapple.</li>
    <li> BE CAREFUL WHEN USING PRODUCT -- YOUR HAIR WILL BE TOUCHED ALL DAY. UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TOUCHED DON&#x27;T USE THIS!!!! A++</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this product and love it!  I have youngk children at home and it helps cut my time in the shower.</li>
    <li> I tend to switch shampoos every time I finish a bottle so I have used quite a number of them over the years. I color my hair regularly to cover grays and I have long thick straight hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo has a mild scent that I find very pleasant. It is not overwhelming and does not linger too much. I know this is a 2 in 1 shampoo, but I always use a conditioner in addition to any shampoo so I cannot say if it will really condition by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I feel this shampoo washes the hair very well in one single use. For example, the other day my husband and I went on a date to a new restaurant. When we got home my clothes and my hair stunk of grease. It was so gross. I washed my hair with this shampoo once - followed by my usual regimen of conditioner. All the grease smell was gone. My hair was shiny and when I straightened it with the flat iron it looked just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
    <li> For the price this is as good of a shampoo as you&#x27;ll find. Makes my hair soft and it shines.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it isn&#x27;t a Proctor &amp; Gamble product.</li>
    <li> A product with quality at exceptional low price. I get it every 2 months as a Subscribe and Save product from Amazon, it is a perfect deal.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what it says it is and it came in a timely manner with no damage. Keeps my hair clean and smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells good, and keeps from having to lug around two bottles.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but leaves my hair rather dry, not silky.  Price is low but so is my satisfaction. I would not recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I was lazy and wanted a quick fix in the mornings to my nightly tangles without spending 5 minutes letting conditioner soak in. This dried out my hair something awful. Made my ends super brittle and still left me extremely tangled. I had a paddle brush stuck in my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So kiddos, if you have short oily hair, this is for you. For my long haired friends, just walk away.</li>
