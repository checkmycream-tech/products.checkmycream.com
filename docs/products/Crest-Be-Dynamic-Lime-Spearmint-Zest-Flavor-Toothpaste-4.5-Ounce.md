### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Really delicious toothpaste.</li>
      <li>These Crest flavors have been awesome.</li>
      <li>but I think it&#x27;s about the best tasting toothpaste there is!</li>
      <li>Best tasting tooth paste ever!  </li>
      <li>Leaves you mouth feeling great!  </li>
      <li>Best toothpaste EVER.</li>
      <li>Excellent spearmint flavor, and even whitens my teeth.</li>
      <li>This is the best flavored toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
      <li>they taste REALLY good together!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and ..... I liked it!</li>
      <li>They are all good but this and choc are my favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;And surprisingly, for me....</li>
      <li>This dissipation is actually good, because we found the chocolate taste unnerving.</li>
      <li>I love the taste, great combination of lime and spearmint.</li>
      <li>Leaves a very nice after taste, but the chocolate mint is still my favorite.</li>
      <li>Refreshing!</li>
      <li>Love the flavor!</li>
      <li>I am in love with this toothpaste!</li>
      <li>this toothpaste and will continue buying more!  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to the adventurous tooth brusher!</li>
      <li>This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste.</li>
      <li>Spearmint Zest toothpaste is a nice change of pace</li>
      <li>but it is a nice change of pace.  </li>
      <li>a word, nice.</li>
      <li>By far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tasted!</li>
      <li>Came super fast, nice change in flavor &amp; your teeth feel good, used a coupon too, so good price!</li>
      <li>We appreciate the good taste, the clean feeling and the healthier outcome.</li>
      <li>My teeth felt clean and refreshed after brushing which was probably the most surprising thing for me.</li>
      <li>Quite the wake up in the morning for sure.  </li>
      <li>Per ounce, the Be Dynamic/Adventurous cost more than the Cinnamon Expressions (and</li>
      <li>Interesting flavor.</li>
      <li>Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek Flavor Toothpaste 4.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the Crest Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have no complains :)</li>
      <li>It really has a nice bright taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hoping for more zing from the lime.  </li>
      <li>After finishing my tube I had to turn to Amazon to get more</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay to test</li>
      <li>Spearmint Zest was my favorite flavor of the 3.</li>
      <li>Love the vanilla flavored be.</li>
      <li>and we love it.  </li>
      <li>I also tried the vanilla mint, Be Inspired, which was OK</li>
      <li>I love love love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Love this flavor and the Vanilla Mint.</li>
      <li>Refreshing, cleans, whitens.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>They really did a great job at combing the 2 flavors of lime and spearmint.</li>
      <li>While it was not my favorite flavor, it was 2nd best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste</li>
      <li>For me this had the perfect blend of citrus and mint flavoring, didn&#x27;t taste like candy, and left my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
      <li>It does indeed have a crisp lime zest flavor which surprisingly combines well with spearmint.</li>
      <li>Mostly this toothpaste seemed to be just a strong spearmint flavor.</li>
      <li>The lime flavor is just the right amount to leave your mouth feeling refreshed, and the spearmint is a nice complement to the lime.  </li>
      <li>I think that Crest found the perfect balance so that neither flavor is overpowering the other.  </li>
      <li>I love how clean my mouth feels after brushing.</li>
      <li>I gag easy</li>
      <li>I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lime flavoring might give a bit of a boost to the mint taste, but we didn&#x27;t find the citrus taste to be strong.</li>
      <li>sure i will buy at full price though</li>
      <li>Seems to work fine</li>
      <li>reason i bought the item was because amazon had a coupon for the item and it came out cheap</li>
      <li>I love the flavor, but most of all I love how clean it makes my mouth feel for hours after I&#x27;ve brushed.</li>
      <li>Chocolate is the most potent taste so far in this line.</li>
      <li>My teeth are clean, though.</li>
      <li>but nothing special for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For me, this was good enough to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>Not too sweet tasting but still limey.</li>
      <li>and even I thought it was good to try something different.</li>
      <li>Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this great-tasting toothpaste.</li>
      <li>More fun than the usual grown up toothpaste, and still very effective.</li>
      <li>I have found a new favorite toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>But since I am a fan of lime and spearmint (separately), I thought it was worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t find it offensive or unusable, but it didn&#x27;t make me smile in the way I had hoped it would.</li>
      <li>My favorite tooth paste, no longer available in my local stores.</li>
      <li>I only hope my breath smells as fresh as it feels! :)</li>
      <li>but overall it is an interesting flavor and leaves your mouth clean.  </li>
      <li>you really love trying new things, and being the first kid on the block to do so, this stuff is pretty fun.</li>
      <li>felt that it foamed just the right amount.</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of zing to it and it doesn&#x27;t taste like you are brushing your teeth with food.</li>
      <li>Again, the lime is pretty powerful</li>
      <li>Yes, it sounds kind of strange....</li>
      <li>The lime does fade after a little, leaving a pleasant mint taste.</li>
      <li>so in the end I think as long as your teeth are clean, that is what matters most.</li>
      <li>I like its smell, very unusual in the comparison with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mint flavours.</li>
      <li>so I was pretty excited to try all three of these new Crest</li>
      <li>(I got 2) since I was no longer able to find it in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I know they have a similar one again, but this time I wanted to try this one as I love</li>
      <li>price in most local stores is $4.99, and amazon&#x27;s price is comparable.  </li>
      <li>I may even return it after the first use to try the vanilla option.</li>
      <li>all three of them cost more than standard mint gels).</li>
      <li>left my mouth feeling a bit more fruityish but still worked none</li>
      <li>It has a different taste, mostly spearminty with a bit of lime.</li>
      <li>Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest, Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek and Inspired  Vanilla Mint</li>
      <li>so if a toothpaste is strong peppermint, it causes me major problems.</li>
      <li>Gets my mouth very clean, and has some actual sparkle to it.</li>
      <li>I recently received a sample of this toothpaste from BzzAgent to try out and was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked the Lime Spearmint Zest toothpaste.</li>
      <li>In our family of four, two like plain old mint gel toothpaste, but two of us LOVE more unusual flavors, with the current favorite being Crest Cinnamon Expressions.</li>
      <li>However, the flavors are at least original and effective.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife bought this flavor by accident a while back and we love it.  The toothpaste has the added benefit of not using triclosan as an ingredient, an endocrine inhibitor that other toothpastes often use as an anti-bacterial agent.  We appreciate the good taste, the clean feeling and the healthier outcome.</li>
    <li> Leaves a very nice after taste, but the chocolate mint is still my favorite.</li>
    <li> You have to like lime but I think it&#x27;s about the best tasting toothpaste there is!</li>
    <li> Zestyyy.  It&#x27;s like a mojito in my mouth</li>
    <li> By far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tasted! So nice for a change from the boring mint.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste EVER. We stumbled upon it at drug store and now buy it exclusively through Amazon. Love this flavor and the Vanilla Mint.</li>
    <li> Many years ago Crest had a vanilla mint flavor that I quite enjoyed as a disruption to the mundane regular toothpaste flavors. I know they have a similar one again, but this time I wanted to try this one as I love lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not anything like a normal natural lime or spearmint flavor. It tastes totally artificial like lime salt flavored lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it offensive or unusable, but it didn&#x27;t make me smile in the way I had hoped it would. Also, it created almost no foaming action in my mouth. It went flat right away and was almost like brushing your teeth with mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I congratulate Crest for stepping out of the normal box and trying something different, but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me at all. I may even return it after the first use to try the vanilla option.</li>
    <li> Well if you don&#x27;t like lime, move on now because wow - it is front and center.  I have no doubt my kid if he tried this would spit it out and proclaim it way too sour.  I managed to actually use it and once you get past the initial shock it balances out some.  As others said, none of this new line seem to be too foamy.  However, the flavors are at least original and effective.  A half hour after use I still have a fresh lime/mint taste in my mouth and it&#x27;s mostly refreshing.  I am not sure I see buying this often but it is a nice change of pace.  The chocolate one has a lot more repeat potential at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using this some more I actually think it is decent.  Quite the wake up in the morning for sure.  Again, the lime is pretty powerful but overall it is an interesting flavor and leaves your mouth clean.  Ultimately this comes down to whether or not you like lime enough to brush with it every day!</li>
    <li> Usually when I head out to my local pharmacy these get rediculously expensive. I ordered it online and I have no complains :) the toothpaste is the exact same as if I were too buy it from CVS, but much cheaper and super fast shipping. If you haven&#x27;t had this flavor before then I reccomend it so much. It&#x27;s the longest freshest lasting toothpaste and now I never want to use regular mint again. Only problem with this product is the size but other then that if you live by yourself or share with one person it should last a month or so.</li>
    <li> Excellent spearmint flavor, and even whitens my teeth.</li>
    <li> My favorite tooth paste, no longer available in my local stores.</li>
    <li> It seriously tastes like a mojito - mint and lime and sweet. The lime does fade after a little, leaving a pleasant mint taste. Gets my mouth very clean, and has some actual sparkle to it. More fun than the usual grown up toothpaste, and still very effective.</li>
    <li> Sick of spearmint and bored with peppermint, I was eager for a new toothpaste flavor. It&#x27;s definitely different, and very lime, so if you don;t mind going to bed, or work, with a mouth tasting like minty margarita, go for it!</li>
    <li> I like its smell, very unusual in the comparison with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; mint flavours.</li>
    <li> Non-traditional and non-mint toothpastes have always been around, just hard to find. Green tea, vanilla, I even tried a plum one from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;But Crest?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely lime. More like the flavoring used in lime jello or Green River soda, as opposed to fresh lime. If that sounds too sweetly cloying, the small spark of mint evens it out a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste is subjective, too bad they don&#x27;t have tiny sample sizes to try. For me, this was good enough to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;If you really love trying new things, and being the first kid on the block to do so, this stuff is pretty fun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m open to trying new stuff so I was pretty excited to try all three of these new Crest Be touthpaste flavors. Like licking the wall at Willy Wonka&#x27;s I gleefully brushed my teeth over and over to give them all a shot. What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was how wrong they tasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be Dynamic&#x27;s lime spearming zest was the most like toothpaste and tasted like spearmint gum until that wore off (very like gum) and left a strong lime flavor which was slightly distasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not a fan of these flavors. Couple that with the numerous artificial colors (Be Dynamic has Yellow 10 lake and blue 1 lake)and ingredients (sulfates, sucralose, etc) and I just don&#x27;t see how I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s more like a gag gift than a toothpaste and I think we will likely see these come and go on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved samples of these for review through BzzAgent and Crest.</li>
    <li> pricey but after brushing i stil dont feel very tingly but feel dry mouth</li>
    <li> Daughter loves this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> Not worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Really delicious toothpaste. Not too sweet tasting but still limey.</li>
    <li> Saw these, then tried them, really fresh and different. They are all good but this and choc are my favourites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word, nice.</li>
    <li> The Crest® Be Dynamic™ Lime Spearmint Zest was not what I expected. As a classic mint toothpaste girl, I was surprised that I did enjoy the lime twist. My teeth felt clean and refreshed after brushing which was probably the most surprising thing for me. Usually the more fruity out-of-the-box flavors leave me feeling like I need to give my teeth another brush with just mint. I would recommend this to the adventurous tooth brusher!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this toothpaste! I love the flavor, but most of all I love how clean it makes my mouth feel for hours after I&#x27;ve brushed. I only hope my breath smells as fresh as it feels! :)</li>
    <li> These Crest flavors have been awesome.</li>
    <li> Came super fast, nice change in flavor &amp; your teeth feel good, used a coupon too, so good price!</li>
    <li> Best tasting tooth paste ever!  Leaves you mouth feeling great!  I hope Crest will continue making this product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. After finishing my tube I had to turn to Amazon to get more (I got 2) since I was no longer able to find it in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like citrus flavors and don&#x27;t really care for regular toothpaste mint flavors. For me this had the perfect blend of citrus and mint flavoring, didn&#x27;t taste like candy, and left my mouth feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for more zing from the lime.  It tastes sort of blah.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.  My teeth are clean, though.</li>
    <li> item arrived fast and when needed go to say the &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of this toothpaste is a bit different than the rest but you get used to its like other things. left my mouth feeling a bit more fruityish but still worked none the less.&lt;br /&gt;only reason i bought the item was because amazon had a coupon for the item and it came out cheap so why not&lt;br /&gt;not sure i will buy at full price though so if there is another sale on this item i might jump for it</li>
    <li> In our family of four, two like plain old mint gel toothpaste, but two of us LOVE more unusual flavors, with the current favorite being Crest Cinnamon Expressions. It has just the right amount of zing to it and it doesn&#x27;t taste like you are brushing your teeth with food. It really has a nice bright taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interest of exploring new things, we just tried two new Crest flavors, this Crest Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HB2JPOW Crest Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest Flavor Toothpaste 4.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;and the Crest Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HB2JPP6 Crest Be Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek Flavor Toothpaste 4.5 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mint Chocolate&lt;br /&gt;The minute you begin brushing your teeth, you get a burst of chocolate taste. Actually, it is probably a burst of smell, not taste, because as you start your brushing, the chocolate taste dissipates very quickly, leaving you with generic mint taste. This dissipation is actually good, because we found the chocolate taste unnerving. It just feels weird to have a chocolate taste in your mouth that you aren&#x27;t going to swallow. So we won&#x27;t be buying this toothpaste again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lime Spearmint&lt;br /&gt;The lime flavoring might give a bit of a boost to the mint taste, but we didn&#x27;t find the citrus taste to be strong. Mostly this toothpaste seemed to be just a strong spearmint flavor. This isn&#x27;t bad, but note that the Be Dynamic and Be Adventurous tubes are only 4.5 ounces each, compared to the 6.0 ounces for the Cinnamon Expressions. Per ounce, the Be Dynamic/Adventurous cost more than the Cinnamon Expressions (and all three of them cost more than standard mint gels). The Lime Spearmint seems so average that it isn&#x27;t worth the extra expense for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the two new Crest flavors, Lime Spearmint and Mint Chocolate are not a fit for our family. We&#x27;ll be sticking with regular mint gels and Cinnamon Expressions:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001G7PLM8 Crest Complete Multi-Benefit Whitening Expressions Cinnamon Rush Flavor Toothpaste 6 Oz (Pack of 6)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy ReaderHappy Reader</li>
    <li> Thanks to BzzAgent, I was able to try this great-tasting toothpaste. While it was not my favorite flavor, it was 2nd best in my opinion. They really did a great job at combing the 2 flavors of lime and spearmint. Neither flavor is overbearing and it is one I would still continue to use and buy in the future. My teeth felt clean afterwards still despite not being the regular mint so in the end I think as long as your teeth are clean, that is what matters most.</li>
    <li> I have found a new favorite toothpaste.  The refreshing lime/spearmint taste lasts longer than other similar toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I like this flavor- but my kids weren&#x27;t crazy about it.  It&#x27;s mellow, not very strong flavor.</li>
    <li> Yes, it sounds kind of strange....citrus and mint in a toothpaste?  But since I am a fan of lime and spearmint (separately), I thought it was worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly, for me....they taste REALLY good together!  The lime flavor is just the right amount to leave your mouth feeling refreshed, and the spearmint is a nice complement to the lime.  I think that Crest found the perfect balance so that neither flavor is overpowering the other.  If anything, I think the lime is slightly dominant, but it has to be in order to stand out from the spearmint, which is such a powerful flavor on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this toothpaste and will continue buying more!  I also tried the vanilla mint, Be Inspired, which was OK but nothing special for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price in most local stores is $4.99, and amazon&#x27;s price is comparable.  Kind of pricey for a small (4.5 oz) tube, but for me it&#x27;s worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is the best flavored toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;My wife calls it mojito flavored.&lt;br /&gt;It made brushing a fun time and regular habit as opposed to an often neglected chore.</li>
    <li> Very fake overpowering lime taste. Love the vanilla flavored be. This one is gross</li>
    <li> Refreshing! Why didn&#x27;t anyone think of this before?</li>
    <li> For what lime taste you get, It tastes a lot like lime Mike and Ike&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love lime Mike and Ike&#x27;s, but the toothpaste doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth as well as other toothpastes. I need to put more on to get that clean feeling to my teeth. The fact that it also tastes like candy tells my brain that my teeth are automatically not clean and that I need to brush again to feel clean. Overall, I prefer a minty toothpaste. This may be good for kids, but be warned they may be more inclined to eat the paste because of the taste. I got this as part of a BZZAgent program but I don&#x27;t know if I will be buying it soon.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of this, as I usually am a &#x27;tried and true&#x27; type that never deviates from toothpaste flavor, but I had the opportunity to try a sample and ..... I liked it! It has a different taste, mostly spearminty with a bit of lime. The lime is fairly subtle so my mouth is left feeling mostly minty. Anyways, it is toothpaste with a twist on flavor. Seems to work fine and even I thought it was good to try something different.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste. Refreshing, cleans, whitens. I gag easy so if a toothpaste is strong peppermint, it causes me major problems. I love the taste, great combination of lime and spearmint. I love how clean my mouth feels after brushing. I have a denture and porcelain veneers. I love love love this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Crest Be Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest toothpaste is a nice change of pace&lt;br /&gt;from the typical minty toothpaste flavors you are used to brushing your teeth with. I recently received a sample of this toothpaste from BzzAgent to try out and was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked the Lime Spearmint Zest toothpaste. It does indeed have a crisp lime zest flavor which surprisingly combines well with spearmint. It was not overly abrasive , yet I felt it&lt;br /&gt;had enough texture to thoroughly clean my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I felt that it foamed just the right amount. I like that this toothpaste contains&lt;br /&gt;fluoride, so my enamel will be protected by using this toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I give it two thumbs up. I received a total of 3 different flavors in my Bzz Kit&lt;br /&gt;from BzzAgent - to try : Dynamic Lime Spearmint Zest, Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek and Inspired  Vanilla Mint Spark.&lt;br /&gt;Lime Spearmint Zest was my favorite flavor of the 3. Vanilla Mint Spark came in a close 2nd and while  Mint Chocolate Trek came in 3rd.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay to test but I&#x27;d rather a tooth paste that actually cleans my teeth properly at the end of the day. Chocolate is the most potent taste so far in this line.</li>
    <li> Interesting flavor. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though. It&#x27;s like sour, but minty. Too weird of a combo.</li>
    <li> I had to try this Crest Be Dynamic toothpaste because the smell of spearmint beckoned me from the shelf!  I&#x27;m  a devoted Colgate Optic White user and didn&#x27;t think Crest could ever get my business, but they have something here.  Not only is the taste of this toothpaste unique and out of this world, but my teeth feel cleaner after one use, which usually doesn&#x27;t happen after using ordinary toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I might not use this toothpaste forever is the lack of whitener.  I feel like I need that.  But for cleaning and taste?  It&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Love the flavor! It is dynamic!</li>
