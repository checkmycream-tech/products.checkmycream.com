<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> While mine technically works, it does not feel sturdy if I ever need to move it. It feels as if the sides are going to collapse and come off. Great product if you intend to keep it in one spot.</li>
    <li> Simple to put together and great for storing my essential oils on display, 15 ml and 5 ml bottles fit perfectly!</li>
    <li> I love it. Easy to assemble and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
    <li> I bought this to organize/display paints for painting models. When it arrived, one of the corners was already broken off. There weren&#x27;t enough screws and bolts to hold it together, and one of the screws meant to hold it together got stripped almost as soon as I tried to put it together. We don&#x27;t mess around, though. We&#x27;re not using this commercially, so we pulled out the super glue gel... and this puppy could survive a fall off of a cliff now with the amount of glue holding it together. It is pretty, and it does the job. If you&#x27;re looking for something that will last and is high quality- this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Love this thing, it  holds every kind of polish (except Nicole by OPI)! I want a hundred more! :)</li>
    <li> Great nailpoloah holder. Holds almost 80 naolspolish, of all different shapes and sizes. Very compact too o fit mine inside if a shelf. Great pitches!!</li>
    <li> Total crap. Within the first month it had cracked twice. I ended up making my own after another couple weeks and it&#x27;s currently still in a pile of plastic shattered pieces in my closet.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and fits a lot of bottles!</li>
    <li> Wow this thing has room!!I knew it would hold a lot but yesssssss lol.It is simple to put together ,looks great,made well,came in mint condition and shipping was super fast!If your in need of a shelf for your nail polish then this is the one!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughters vast supply of nail polishes.  She loves it and it is such a nice looking display.  Very  pleased!</li>
    <li> it was exactly like the picture. easy to assemble, and very professional looking. I love this and will order more when i get more polish!</li>
    <li> I love this and I use it for my makeup on my dresser.  Great quality and price.</li>
    <li> Made a great mother&#x27;s day gift. I got a second one for myself.  It was easy to put together.</li>
    <li> I use it to store my burgeoning collection of essential oils -- it was a nightmare trying to locate the oil I specifically needed from a plastic shoebox that I was using prior to this purchase -- and these oils must be stored upright (due to possible leakage).  Now I can locate the oil I need within seconds.  Oils whose bottles are too large to fit -- no problem, they get repackaged in a smaller bottle that fits and labeled.  I make sure that the labels are turned frontward and since the shelves are nicely stepped, for the most part the labels are visible.  My unit arrived in perfect condition and was easy to assemble.  I really needed a better storage solution for my oils and this came just in time as it is now almost totally filled.  PS -- fits 5 ml -- 30 ml size bottles (up to an ounce in traditional packaging for essential oils).  The display racks for oils are much more expensive than this was.  I am pleased and now, organized.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and holds nail polish perfectly! I had my nail polish in a bin and it was such a pain to dig through, this display definitely makes a huge difference when you want to paint your nails!</li>
    <li> It came 2 days late and didn&#x27;t come with any screws or anything to put it together and there&#x27;s a peice of the shelf that came off from the back. The product would be good if I could use it.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the recommendation of another reviewer to use not for nail polish, but small containers of hobby paints. Some assembly is required, but it&#x27;s easy and requires no additional tools - just attaching the sides to the base with screws/washers. Screwing to finger-tightness worked fine for me - rack is full, but quite sturdy, and looks great.</li>
    <li> Package arrived on time and in great condition. I would definitely recommend this display to anyone. Great price compared to the rest of the market.</li>
    <li> Ive ordered this same one before which is why its gotten two stars, because that one came perfect. This one however, doesnt deserve one. Not only did it come broken, but im missing three screws and a nut. So, now Im debating on fixing it because I need it or returning it for another one and waiting again...</li>
    <li> I got the Nail Polish Rack Display and at first thought that it was broken. I didn&#x27;t realize that you had to actually had to screw in the stand, which I must have missed that part when looking at it online. Looking at it, I wanted to use it for storing my nail polishes and not have them on display so I actually left the sides off (to hold the rack up) and used the rack display (the place where you put the nail polish) by itself and is now in my drawer. I can still see all the nail polish colours which other products didn&#x27;t provide. It&#x27;s accessible and easy and I like it without the stand that came with it.</li>
    <li> helped organize nail polish drawer.</li>
    <li> Received item very quickly and intact....no broken pieces whatsoever.  The correct item . . everything perfect.  Even though foolproof to assemble, I somehow got it upside down and assembled it incorrectly. . . a few instructions would have helped alot. . . other than that, I am giving it to my daughter as a gift in a few days, so hopefully it is what she was looking for.  Looks to be exactly as described.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> it was just what i wanted- thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this for an essential oil rack.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as described. Holds even my largest sizes of nail polish. Comes well packed in styrofoam, inner box is padded with paper inside of the outer box. Comes with all the needed hardware, 6 nuts &amp; bolts that I hand tightened, took me all of 5 minutes to assemble. Love it! Seems sturdy and fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> wish I could give this ten stars. GREAT product.</li>
    <li> After reading some of the reviews, I decided to pass on this one, but then I kept coming back to it.  I went ahead and purchased and was glad I did.  This rack was super easy to put together and came packaged securely with no damage or missing parts.  It fits my China glaze, Sinful Colors, OPI and Sephora by OPI with no problem.  My Nicole by OPI bottles fit fine if you sit them sideways but have to be tilted forward at a very slight angle if you want the bottle to sit facing forward.  I did it this way and it&#x27;s okay.  I also have some Maybelline, Avon, Sally Hansen, etc.  These bottles are smaller/ narrower so you can fit many more of these than the 60 it says it holds.  I really dig this displayed look.  Pretty cool!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve searched a lot of these nail polish display, was afraid to purchase them and get them broken! But I actually shipped them to another country and got them in perfect condition, there wasn&#x27;t even any scratches !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The display hold so many nail polishes and also hold all sizes.</li>
    <li> ordered 2 got an email saying order was cancelled then got one but it was broken inside a box not damaged</li>
    <li> The best organizer for my nail polish, very happy with it</li>
    <li> Great for my needs.  It holds all my Essential oil bottles (probably would hold up to 64 of the 15ml ones).  It fits perfectly in the cabinet where I keep them so now I can see all the labels at once.&lt;br /&gt;I know there are a lot of reviews out there that complain it came with no instructions on how to put it together, but seriously, there is only one way the pieces fit together... not too hard to figure out.  Took about 5 min tops.  And it was SUPER well packaged so I don&#x27;t get why people were complaining about that either.&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;m very pleased!!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Holds even my China Glaze. Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> I used this for my essential oils and it works great to take to vendor fairs or even have them in my office.  I got two of them and I love it.  My oils fix excellent on it.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. Minor (imo) chip in the back. I despise the hassle of online returns and was hoping mine wouldn&#x27;t reflect the reviews of many that said they too received theirs broken but... Solution: super glue. Holds polish well and plenty.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and made of thick plastic</li>
    <li> Item arrived with no scratches or broken like other reviews have indicated. It was packed well. It&#x27;s the perfect size to set on the edge of my desk, and it does hold at least sixty bottles of mixed brands, including OPI and China Glaze. If the bottles are smaller, you could easily fit more than the suggested sixty.</li>
    <li> First one arrived no problems.  The second one arrived broke as did the replacement. ...Done</li>
    <li> Great nail polish rack. Sturdy and displayed my polishes on a cool chic way. Way better than having them in my Tupperware box.</li>
    <li> The shelves themselves looked wide enough to store all of my nail polish bottles and the rack itself was small enough to fit on a small table, but when I received the packaged and opened it up, one of the screw holes was hopelessly cracked, I couldn&#x27;t even dream of assembling it, which is a shame because it looked really easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have all my nail polish organized. thanks to these beautiful rack.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about getting anothe one soon.</li>
    <li> This is a great organizer for nail polish.  I am a polish collector and my dresser was getting overrun by the bottles, but this conveniently organizes everything and provides more space on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for what I needed but it wasn&#x27;t a traditional use.  I do corporate events and I used it to display ribbons that attendees can select to stick to their name badges.  :-)</li>
    <li> holds all of my polishes. easy to put together and looks great</li>
    <li> Love it! Came a lot sooner than expected. Said it would take a month but came in two weeks! No scratches, great packaging and I got my screws too. Just be careful when putting it together. The side pieces are set for a certain side so just don&#x27;t go screwing them on without trying both sides first. Sturdy too. Will def be ordering another, I have over 70 colors!</li>
    <li> Review will never leave your queue unless you actually write something so here it is.  We have many of these in our vaping store and they work well at what they&#x27;re designed to do, no complaints.  3 Stars is simply due to the fact every time we order these we get at least one, if not two, that are broken and we&#x27;ve tried a couple of places with the same results.</li>
    <li> This stand is perfect for storing single or even multiple eye shadows (depending on the size of the container). It is very easy to see all colours at a glance. I use much more of my makeup now that it is in full view. This rack is clear acrylic, sturdy and strong. Simple to assemble with screws provided.</li>
    <li> Love it. Was weary to order based on previous reviews but I&#x27;m glad I did. It took only about  2 days total from purchase to arrive at my house. Product itself is minimalistic and clean, perfect fit for all my Essie/OPI/china glaze polishes. All pieces were in tact, came with proper amount of screws, and no damage to the product itself. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I use these for all my Vaping juice.  This holds sixty 30oz bottles no problem.  I have several for juice and my wife uses some to hold her little crafting jars and bottles.</li>
    <li> Using for holding miniature tabletop paints. Works very well to organize  a painting table.</li>
    <li> It came in relatively quickly. It was pretty easy to put together. It was exactly what I was needing, but both sides were cracked. I would buy again if it wasn&#x27;t cracked.</li>
    <li> Happy with these.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this stand.  I used it for my nail polish but ended up ordering more for my other cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Love this table rack that holds my large collection of nail polish</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great thing to have because I have over 80 different polishes and used to store them in a large plastic box on the floor...It wasn&#x27;t pretty... I always thought these stands were only in stores  and they used them for their &#x27;own&#x27; displays so I was really pleased when I saw this stand that holds so many bottles...It says it holds up to 60 bottles but it held 63 of my bottles... With this stand sitting on my bathroom counter top, I can put the extra bottles underneath the stand so nothing looks messy. The back of the stand is open so all you have to do to get the bottles inside of the stand is to pull it forward, get the bottle you want then push it back. You can easily find the right color too...it used to take me forever to find the color I wanted. With this, it just takes a few seconds to find it.</li>
    <li> First, i didn&#x27;t find the screws needed to put this thing together. Emailed seller. She said they will mail (snail mail) and will take maybe 3 more days (on top of the days i had waited for the rack to arrive). I was very disappointed. They won&#x27;t even send the needed parts the expedited way. Then I tried to put the thing together and realized the piece of glass i had noticed sitting on one level when the item arrived was actually a part of its side. I thought that the piece of glass just got in the box by accident. Emailed again with photo attachments. She said they will send replacement. When I had said send it the fastest possible way because i need it for my work, she didn&#x27;t reply. After some time she did (reply) but had said \\&quot;Your\\&quot; item has too many problems\\&quot;. She said she will refund and told me that i have lost nothing. I lost time and wasted my money and energy and brains with them.</li>
    <li> As a private individual and not a nail tech, my personal polish collection has grown to close to 120.  I have one rack already that hold 60 polishes and so it became clear I was either going to have to edit my collection (which wasn&#x27;t going to happen) or add a rack.  I opted for the latter and am enjoying seeing all the polishes at the same time.</li>
    <li> No matter how many times I take it apart and put it together again, it is slightly uneven. Besides that, great product.</li>
    <li> Bought this little gem to put on my bookcase to store my essential oils.  It is super easy to put together and is really sturdy.  I filled it up pretty quickly and I love it because now I can easily view all my oils.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very stable. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t revive my whole order!!! How do I get a hold of the pple that sent it? I only recived the top part but no screws or the legs to help it stand 😩😳</li>
    <li> I bought this to hold my paint jars for my model building hobby.  The plastic used is slightly flexible not the usual brittle type and is sturdy enough to be durable.  The footprint is small and a second set would sit just alongside of it if you needed more space.  The shelves will hold all types of the smaller paint jars except for the rare half ounce Tamiya jars.  Each shelf will hold 16 of the dropper bottles such as Vallejo and 10-12 of Tamiya or Model Master in addtion to other liquids you migth use in this hobby.  Each bottle is clearly visble and easily accessible.    *****update:  I liked this product so much I ordered another.  Though it was the same item number, the one I received was dimensionally bigger by about 1/2 an inch each way.  Still just as functional and useful, but they are not identical in size in case your tight for space.</li>
    <li> This is great for the Disney Vinylmation figures it fits 7-8 across nicely. It arrived it great condition and was super easy to put together.</li>
    <li> The rack is just what I wanted.  But the screw holes did not match up on one side.  It works, but should not have had to do that.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this. It is so super cute on my dresser. It fits all my polishes. Now I&#x27;ve ordered more to fill my new polish holder. I love it. It came just as pictured and took no time to put together. It wasn&#x27;t cracked as some other viewers have stated but it was so nice and neat looking. I absolutely adore it.</li>
    <li> Good case for storing alcohol inks!  love the clear finish too!  Glad to have found a case for my art inks!</li>
    <li> This arrived very quickly and is as described. It did have a small crack on the side, but not really a big deal. I filled it with my polish and it holds all 72 bottles of all different sizes. It really has made choosing a color easier tahn digging through a big basket.</li>
    <li> Excited, just arrived today really fast delivery just ordered a few days ago. I really like this ,it was very easy to put together,  and holds all of my polish makes my vanity look soooo much better....luvin the organization.</li>

    <li> This works very good for what I needed it for!!</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish rack. It&#x27;s a perfect fit for my closet and keeps me 100% organized. Great deal!</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say. Its a nail polish rack, lol. Holds my mini perfumes as well and does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came in great condition and is very sturdy. Would recommend :)</li>
    <li> Too small really unless you are using sample bottles- I returned  the one I ordered</li>
    <li> Perfect for my essential oils. Very easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> Using this to hold standard 2oz bottles of craft paint in my studio (Folk Art, Ceramcoat, etc.).  They fit perfectly, the lip on each shelf keeps them from falling off, and I finally have my paint organized so I can find what I want at a glance!</li>
    <li> i use it to store my 15 ml essential oil bottles and it is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side pieces are flimsy and the screws weren&#x27;t right but I&#x27;m not storing heavy items on it.  It was easy to assemble and it does exactly what I want it to do.... store 60 bottles of essential oils inexpensively.</li>
    <li> This is great! Before I had all of my nail polishes in an old shoe box. Now, I can see them all clearly, organize them, etc. Great quality and promptly delivery. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> I Love this!  Very easy to put together and well made.  I was able to put 66 nail polishes on it.  I did not realize how many polishes I had but I have to buy another.</li>
    <li> They work great for what I bought them for.</li>
    <li> This item shipped super fast, came well packaged and is exactly as described. It took me exactly 1 minute to put together... You don&#x27;t even need a screw driver. Love having my nail polishes organized instead of in a plastic bin like they were!</li>
    <li> great product, great seller</li>
    <li> Very happy with this stand. It is exactly what is offered and picture. It&#x27;s sturdy and fits perfectly on my vanity. No complaints does its job.</li>
    <li> does what I need it to do, couldve purchased for less though. Shipping too high</li>
    <li> the rack arrived with broken corners</li>
    <li> This is my favorite way to store and display nail polish. It&#x27;s very quick and easy to put together. I also love that I can select my nail polish at a glance because of the tiered design. So great I bought a 2nd one! Now I just need to stop buying nail polishes to fill them.</li>
    <li> First one came broken during shipping but they replaced it pretty quickly for me.  It is easy to assemble and stable.  I have a lot of polish and it is nice to see what I have at  glance. I think i might get another.</li>
    <li> Product was good. Does the job nicely. Very disappointed in how long it took to get here! Received it well after Christmas!</li>
    <li> Works. Not very sturdy but works.</li>
    <li> another item that made me very happy will keepit stock, the price was great after looking in the stores this rack came at a great deal.</li>
    <li> Received item in timely fashion and was a Christmas present. When my sister opened it up on Christmas morning we found that it had been cracked on the sides. Still usable but not a nice surprise</li>
    <li> This is the second order which went very smoothly, first order had to return due to damage</li>
    <li> I ordered the &#x27;Holds 60&#x27; one from Amazon/E-Discount.  Everything arrived in perfect condition and with all hardware intact.  It holds lots of CND polish and although it is a snug fit, it also holds my Gelish bottles perfectly.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like picture, exactly what I expected. In great condition. Worth the money to purchase rather than a do it yourself project.</li>
    <li> My daughter has organized all her nail polish in her room.  Looks really nice in her room.  Better than throwing them in a drawer and not knowing what colors you have.</li>
    <li> I love looking at all my polishes lined up on this rack. It is great to have them organized and displayed where I can see them all. This is a nice rack!</li>
    <li> 4 stars because it only had 5 shelves instead of 6 as advertised.  I didn&#x27;t make a stink about it because I am satisfied with the number of polishes it holds.  These store OPI, China Glaze, Kleancolor, Nina Ultra Pro, and Revlon quite well.  Smoking price tag!</li>
    <li> This display is perfect for my polish collection!  Fits OPI gelcolor bottles and Le Chat Perfect Match bottles!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> love this item it took some time to put together</li>
    <li> Stand is Great. Problem is packing of it. Way to thin. Stand was cracked when arrived. didn&#x27;t want to send time sending pictures. Otherwise stand is great. Holds everything. Wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Can finally organize my insanely massive collection of nail polish. I bought 2 units to start out, but thinking i may need to buy more lol. All in all no cons so far. but i also just got them so we will see.</li>
    <li> After throwing my growing polish collection in shoe boxes I decided to splurge on a nail rack.  I really am happy I ordered this one!  The acrylic rack was super easy to assemble, only 4 screws and nuts.  This rack is tall enough to show off most of the bottles without making them easy to fall over.  The rack holds all my brands.  The only one that was hard to get in was the Nicole by OPI, they have to go sideways.  Otherwise I have a great fit with China Glaze, OPI, Zoya, Butter, Revlon, Sally Hansen, and others.  The Maybelline bottles are smaller, and they shift and slide, but are completely steady in the rack.</li>
    <li> Loved this! Came in in an appropriate fashion, sturdy, no cracks, looks nice and neat and most importantly organized! This is also super easy to put together! Great product, I may be having to purchase another one soon!</li>
    <li> I bought this rack for my 10 year old daughter who LOVES nail polish and has quite a few bottles.  Before she kept her bottles of polish in a plastic bin or all over her dresser.  Now she can display all of her polishes and keep them nicely organized.  She absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my 2ed order of this product. I did not use mine for nail polish but for hobby paints for painting game miniatures. Each rack will hold 78 Reaper or Vallejo paints. It will also hold P3 and citadel paints just fine. There are other paint racks out there but they cost a lot more than these do and these look very nice and take up less space on your table top.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband...he builds a lot of models, and this was perfect for his model paints!</li>
    <li> The item is uneven once you screw it together. I tried to make both sides even with the nail polishes but that doesn&#x27;t work kind of stinks. I did put a piece of cardboard to even it out but it still kind of stinks it wobbles. I would return it but I do not want to go thru the hassle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s decent. Makes the polish look alot neater and easier to see the color selections. Just thought it would had been larger or longer.</li>
    <li> LOVE this!! I&#x27;m using it for essential oil storage!</li>
    <li> Love this I actually use this to put my makeup in.  It works perfectly and fits all of my foundations ranging from Mac, Dior, Yves St Laurent.  The only one that doesn&#x27;t fit is Kat Von D but that&#x27;s just because bottle is bigger.</li>
    <li> This is great. It&#x27;s easy to assemble and is the perfect size. The angle is steep enough so you can see all the bottles on each row. I&#x27;m ordering another!</li>
    <li> Thanks Is very fast and good comunicatio. AAA++++</li>
    <li> Accommodates a lot of bottles  of various sizes.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
    <li> This rack is perfect to keep all my nail polishes organized and neat. The size is perfect for a table on a bureau. I would recommend this .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not using this for nail polish bottles, but for the 1oz bottles that I am using it for, it&#x27;s perfect.  One side of it did come with a small crack in it, but not enough to affect the function of it.  Or even enough to warrant sending it back for a new one.  This one is already full, I might have to get another one, soon!</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly; I got it only 4 days after I ordered it and it was in good condition with no pieces broken or cracked. It had been packed well with the item&#x27;s white box placed inside a bigger amazon box with padding. However, the amazon box I received it in was bulging at the top and the corner had a large hole torn out of it but this may have been due to the post office and not the company,at least I hope.The white box the item came in was fine but when I looked inside, the screws and hex nuts to put it together were just in the bottom rolling around loose instead of being sealed in a separate bag and one of the nuts was missing. Luckily I happened to have some extra small hex nuts on hand from another project so I could still put it together. There were also no instructions with it which was a little annoying but I managed. When together it does seem sturdy and well made and I was able to fit more than 60 bottles; about 70 but I don&#x27;t have OPI bottles. I think it was still a good purchase, if pricey, I just wished they&#x27;d take more care with the handling.</li>
    <li> Bought this following one of the reviews that said it was perfect for holding paints for miniature painting.  It holds my reaper and Citadel/Games Workshop paints with no problems at all. It also wipes clean easily if you have a spill unlike some of the wooden stands out there.  It&#x27;s great to have them all so nicely displayed.  It only gets 4 stars as one of the assembly screws threads were crossed and I couldn&#x27;t use it to assemble the stand, but used a spare I had from another project and it worked just fine.  I liked it so much I have just ordered another one to hold my ever expanding paint collection.</li>
    <li> This nail polish rack has been a tremendous help in organizing my many nail polishes. It was very simple to put together and seems quite sturdy. I found that it fit almost 70 bottles for me, so if you have some smaller bottles such as Julep, certain Wet n Wild or Maybelline nail polishes, you will probably fit more than 60 bottles on the rack. My only issue with the item is that when I received my package I thought it was odd that all of the screws were thrown into the box and were not in a bag. All in all though, a great product.</li>
    <li> Item arrived sooner than expected and as described.</li>
    <li> I use this to hold all of my Young Living Essential Oils...LOVE it! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Holds all my gel polishes.</li>
    <li> This arrived within two days of ordering, perfectly intact with all the parts (the main rack plus the two sides and four screws/nuts). Assembly was easy, and even though this unit is made from plastic, I was pleased with the quality because the unit seems heavy and really sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, these fit OPI, China Glaze, and Essie nail polish bottles. I was a little disappointed that my Nicole by OPI nail polishes (purchased from Target) do not fit facing forward, so I had to turn them to the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this as a great organizing tool!</li>
    <li> i really like this one i put all my polish,everything organize everytime my client need to choice the polish no need to bring them to choice.</li>
    <li> Super easy to put together. Simple, yet does the job. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> The measurements were accurately represented in the package I received. It arrived in approximately four days and it was complete. It fits large bottles as well. It has a good design and I would definitely recommend it. The price is a bit high for the item, but I was happy with what I received overall.</li>
    <li> I have 59 bottles of nail polishes which were getting out of control in my little organizer so I looked for rack display that fits at least what I have now. There weren&#x27;t many options on Amazon especially because I didn&#x27;t want to spend tons of money for an, after all, organizer. When the item came, it was truly easy to assemble. The material is hard and solid plastic as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later on, I added 4 more china glaze and 2 smaller bottles, they all fit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether I&#x27;d buy it again or not, I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s pretty big, the wall-side width is 14 inches and front width is 9 1/2, and of course, that&#x27;s not the only thing I want to be able to fit on my dresser, so just be aware of its size before purchase. Other than that, a great product, solid and secure.</li>
    <li> this product is easy to assemble. it arrived without a scratch. it holds lots of bottles. it is easy to see the colors you have and sort them well that&#x27;s what i do. excellent!!!</li>
    <li> I literally just installed this... Takes about 5-min [or less] ... It holds a lot more mail polishes than I anticipated... I&#x27;m sure my mom will enjoy her gift</li>
    <li> This nail polish display rack is perfect for storing my daughter&#x27;s many bottles of nail polish.  The quality is great. It is sturdy and was very easy to put together (4 simple screws). It looks amazing on her bureau. It&#x27;s like being in a salon!</li>
    <li> Great product...very impressive</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to order this due to some customers receiving this product damaged, but my display arrived in great condition. The assembling was quick and easy. As others have said, all bottles except Nicole by OPI fit. This item was definitely worth the price for me.</li>
    <li> This item arrived broken.  I put a little glue on it to hold it together and it is holding up so far.  I sent an email to Amazon about the problem and never heard from anyone, so am posting.  Unable to give more stars because of the condition of the item upon arrival.  It does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do though if you don&#x27;t mind a little repair work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so fun to wear nail polish these days, especially with color trends. I love the tiered display so I can see all the different colors and shades at a glance. I just pick the one I&#x27;m in the mood to wear! It was a bit pricey, which is why I gave it 4 stars vs. 5.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter and I have 100&#x27;s of Opi nail polishes.  I ordered 2 table rack displays and need more!  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use it for craft paints and it&#x27;s perfect for 60 bottles. Arrived it perfect shape. No instructions but it doesn&#x27;t take long to figure it out.</li>
    <li> Item arrived safely without cracks or chips. However, two sets of nuts and bolts did not work, so I just used the rest 4 sets to hold the top and bottom together. I didn&#x27;t want to sent back and risk getting a defective replacement.</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble and sturdy.  I was able to store 74 bottles from various brands including OPI, Essie, ELF, Finger Paints, Revlon, Sally Hansen, Julie, IBD, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild, etc.</li>
    <li> no more nail polish scattered around my bathroom! I didn&#x27;t even realize how many I had till I got this, might need another, is AWESOME.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and awesome. Using for essential oils, it&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Easy to assemble. Various size nail polish bottles fit perfectly. Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from others reviews, and it works perfect for all sorts of modeling paints. Vallejo, GW, etc, even the larger hobby store paints fit well.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come with any papers or instructions. ..but it wasn&#x27;t rocket science on how to put it together it was on5lt 3 pieces. Holds all my polishes well. Would recommend</li>
    <li> nice practical&lt;br /&gt;fit just right of were I need to put it&lt;br /&gt;just to let you know your request of so many words for review is unreal</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter because I was tired of finding her nail polishes all over the place. Now they are in one spot and look great on display. Nice product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to assemble, stores all my polishes, and looks great on my shelf. Highly recommend for any nail polish junkie.</li>
    <li> I wanted a nail polish holder exactly like this for an inexpensive price. This one looked good so I was excited to receive it. There was a small crack on one of the sides but it looks great, hasn&#x27;t broken and works. So I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> All of my bottles fit well and it is exactly what I wanted!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of the screws it came with would not screw into the bolt.  It comes with 6 (3 per side) so I didn&#x27;t really NEED all six - I was able to just leave off one in the middle on one side and it&#x27;s still perfectly stable.  Basically, it&#x27;s just a little on the cheap side which makes sense with the price but I expect to have this for years!</li>
    <li> She uses it everyday and it saves me a TON of money because she doesn&#x27;t have to buy duplicates as there are no more misplaced nail polishes. Her friends all comment that they wish they had one.</li>
    <li> This is actually a little better than I was expecting.  It&#x27;s a good quality thick plastic.  It holds a lot of nail polishes and works for different shape bottles and brands and is sturdy.  My daughter keeps it on her dresser it to display her polishes.</li>
    <li> I use it for my hobby paints, can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I ordered a second after I saw how well the paints fit into the slots and maximizes space. Very sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
    <li> This rack was so perfect for all my nail polish I was so pleased.  Rack will hold all different shapes of polish bottles and are clearly visible making it very easy to choose the polish you want to use.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better visual ability for all my polishes which by the way, I have filled the rack already.  I would also recommend this rack as one you could display various collections...if you collect items like small figurines or thimbles perhaps.</li>
    <li> I use this rack for storing my essential oils.  I love that they are all within easy reach.  It didn&#x27;t seem that sturdy when it arrived but has held up well.  I would definitely buy another.</li>
    <li> My collection of nail polish has grown in the last few months, and I just don&#x27;t like storing them in a drawer. I like to be able to see what I have, sorted by brand. This rack works beautifully! I have already ordered two, and plan to order more as my polish collection expands. Highly recommend for the nail polish junkie!</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish display.  Got tired of saving the OPI boxes and acrylic trays to hold nail polish bottles.  Great way of knowing what you have also!  I recommend this to all nail polish gurus! :0)</li>
    <li> I have almost a 100 bottles of nail polich and I have been looking for some way to keep them orgainzed. This product is amazing and it came in the mail in less than a week!!!! Also it takes like a min to put it together,</li>
    <li> I needed something to organize my nail polishes and this holds all of my polishes and lets me see them to pick my next color. It&#x27;s sturdy, convenient, and attractive.</li>
    <li> It was a great gift for my sister, who is obsessed with nail polish. It held all of her things and was easy to put together. Sits nicely on her desk, I like that it didn&#x27;t need to be hung on the wall.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Do not purchase this. It came broken plus they sent no screws to put it together. Absolute waste of my time &amp; money.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Young Living Essential Oils. Holds both the 15ml and 5ml sizes and has a ton of capacity</li>
    <li> Screws constantly falling out.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to assemble.</li>
    <li> My mom really liked the nail polish holder.  Holds larger size nail polish like OPI and Lipmann.  Was a tad scratched, but if I don&#x27;t look at it no one will either.  A little pricy but everyone selling them are too I guess...</li>
    <li> Sits on my desk in the back bedroom.  Just the right size and now I do not  have to dig out all my nail polish to see which one I want to use.  I can see them all at one time.  Mine is already full may have to order another one.  very easy to put together.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to organize my nail polish.  This was great.  A small amount of assembly was required but it took 5 minutes or so to complete.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Rack, it&#x27;s very well made and very easy to ensemble. Package was delivered on time and in perfect conditions. I have no complains at all!</li>
    <li> It holds.like.80 bottles I have Essie,opi and Orly as we&#x27;ll wet and wild it so good im getting another one!!</li>
    <li> This is really great for any one that has a lot of nail polish, I got this for my sister and she actually got more then the 60 bottles that it says it holds. It is durable and you can move it around if you need to. It is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This rack is sturdy, fits all my weird shaped nail polish bottles, and fits on any shelf. Super cute and allows my polish to be organized beautifully!!! Love it. I&#x27;m gonna have to order another rack soon because she will be full!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, was easy to set up and makes a great impact. Using this for my person collection and it helps to see all of my polish at a glance. I had some smaller bottles, so I was able to put more than 60 per rack. Best addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> Fits most of my nail polishes very well (not so much the weirdly-shaped bottles, or the wide ones like the ones Five Below sells under the name, &amp;#34;Funky Fingers&amp;#34;. Other than that, I love this :)</li>
    <li> I have at least 10 brand names of polish (Opi, Nicole, Bath &amp; Body Works, Avon, Revlon, Wet &amp; Wild, etc. etc.) &amp; they ALL fit on these shelves.  Love that I can see them all at the same time.  It makes selecting a color so much easier &amp; a much more informed decision. I highly recommend this item!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you assemble it, there&#x27;s only 3 pieces: the main shelves &amp; the 2 sides.  All you have to do is screw the 2 sides (by hand) into the shelves.  Make sure it sits level on a flat surface.  If it&#x27;s off by a little bit, flip &amp; switch the sides.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have 2 and they both have held up wonderfully!  They seem like they could easily break but as long as you&#x27;re careful it should be ok</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my teenage daughters and they love it. It makes for a great holder and display for their many many polishes.</li>
