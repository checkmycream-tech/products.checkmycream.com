<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this thing! I have been using the cheap stuff all of my life. This thing is so much better in every way. It is easy and smooth&lt;br /&gt;getting my nail trim. It is sharp like a razor and the cut is so clean. Little squeezing pressure is needed to get my&lt;br /&gt;nails clipped off. The file on it work flawlessly to smooth out the edges on my nails. It will make nail-clipping much more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> The only thing that would make them better would be one of those pointy files to clean under the nails.</li>
    <li> Does not work very well. The blade is dull and the item does not catch the clippings.</li>
    <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Very sharp, sharpest I&#x27;ve seen.  Nice clean cuts, whereas others seem to leave an oddly rough cut.&lt;br /&gt; - Nicely curved, large enough curve for fingernails of all sizes.  (Not good for big toenails, but that&#x27;s expected)&lt;br /&gt; - Long handle with a nice heavy touch, longest pair I&#x27;ve seen making cutting super easy.  The solid metal feels great to touch.&lt;br /&gt; - Fine (yet deep) grit file, which seems perfect.&lt;br /&gt; - Groove on back of handle so finger wont slip.&lt;br /&gt; - Built-in nail catcher.&lt;br /&gt; - Affordable!  Don&#x27;t lose them and you&#x27;re set for a long time on good clippers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (that I can think of):&lt;br /&gt; - Nail catcher seems marginally effective.&lt;br /&gt; - Trimmings can get caught in the back of the join&#x27;t towards the back of the clippers.&lt;br /&gt; - Slightly larger than traditional clippers (not by much and only if size is a problem)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons lightly, I&#x27;m a harsh critic at times and I gave these a full 5 stars.  They&#x27;re great!&lt;br /&gt;I only bought these because I lost my last pair of clippers, which didn&#x27;t compare at all to these!</li>
    <li> This clipper is fairly narrow -- about the width of my pinkie -- but comfortably long.  It has a high quality sander built into the handle.  The metal and cutting edge are excellent quality.  The conturing of the handle and bottom feel nice in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Seki clipper in the Kyoto airport (uder the \\&quot;Green Bell\\&quot; brand name) to use up my remaining Yen.  That clipper was so amazingly high quality, that I searched for another available here in the US.  The narrow width of this clipper surprised me, however it works just as well as a wider clipper for all of my nails except my big toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this nail clipper.</li>
    <li> I am really disappointed. I ordered this a couple years band and loved it.  It cut nails like butter. (So also say several people I recommended this to.) I have been a big advocate amongst my friends. I gave mine away to a patient who had difficulty with regular clippers, knowing I could replace it. She loved it too. I am so bummed because I really treasured it. I actually looked forward to cutting my nails. They must have changed something, because my new one cuts just so-so, like any other clipper. I will give it two stars instead of one because it&#x27;s still a beautiful design. I recently ordered onther Seki design for a gift, which I tried, it was also so-so. I ordered this one again for myself not realizing it may be due to a Seki change.</li>
    <li> Expensive, but worth it! Very sharp, slim and compact. I must say, they&#x27;re making your nail clipping routine a pleasure, in a way, I guess &#x27; Still, $20 though! (you can find nail clippers in any convenient store for about $10 or less). Japanese made - which means Quality (I really hope so!). Ask yourself if you can afford it!? They&#x27;re just a nail clippers, after all!</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the catcher, which is very nice, but what surprised me is the sharpness and how much that mattered.  It is easier to cut my nails with these because I can slowly cut right through the nail.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this nail clipper that I am buying another to put next to my bed.  I had recently purchased a new cheapy one less than a month or two ago, and it was already broken.  One night when I was using it the silly thing completely fell apart and the pin actually flew somewhere in the bedroom...never to be seen again.  I had also been having difficulty using a fingernail clipper because of more arthritis in my fingers.  I love this one.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands at all to use and does such a great job that I have no interest in ever purchasing any other kind.  Thanks Amazon!  It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> I am not one to usually write reviews however I do read and rely on them. Since I read and rely on fellow customers reviews for my own purchase decisions and I found this to be the best product in this category I feel compelled to write a review. I recently found a super high tech mens nail clipper in a mens online gadget review called \\&quot;Klhip\\&quot;. It looked cool got good reviews in this online magazine and was fairly expensive enough for a nail clipper that I thought it had to be the best thing ever. For the record I as replacing a nail clipper I had loved that just recent snapped in the handle after about 7 years or so of use. Anyway the special nail clipper i bought was $50 usb plus shipping, i know a little crazy. Bottom line I never use it after trying it twice, it was too sharp and too flat and too difficult to get a nice cut. It left my nails cut way too close no matter what I did. After reading the reviews I just bought and received the Seki Edge Ss-109 satin slim clipper and used it today and it is by far the best nail clipper i have ever used. I know it sounds weird to get so excited about a nail clipper but after finding a product that is built so well, works so well, will last forever and all at a truly great price (value) I felt compelled to write this review for other Amazon customers to benefit off of. It&#x27;s definitely worth the relatively small price for such a great product!</li>
    <li> 2.5 stars. Sharp yes, but otherwise not the miracle I expected after looking at the high ratings. Even though &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; is in the name, the clippers are narrower than I expected. No way to get one straight cut across even small nails. As narrow as it is, I found it somewhat unwieldy compared to some less expensive clippers I&#x27;ve used. When open, the handle sits at a steep angle and the bottom of the clippers is slick. It is hard to explain the effect of that combination except to say that it feels like the clippers could spring out of my grasp. The indentation and the raised nub for the thumb on the handle and the raised pattern on the bottom are supposed to counter that, but it&#x27;s not enough to help me feel that I have a secure grasp. You have to open the clippers to use the built-in file and, again, I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; design in this. I haven&#x27;t found a way to hold it that one of my fingers isn&#x27;t resting or rubbing on the sharp edges. It migth have been better to have the file on the back or detachable. Additionally, the catcher seems to hold clippings only if I&#x27;m holding the clippers perfectly level, which I rarely do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just want something sharp and can temper your expectations, you might like this. If you are also looking for something that feels really good in hand, you should look for something else in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very nice tool, probably the best one I ever owned. Nice smooth fit and finish, decent size fits comfortably in you your hand. Long lever length gives you plenty of leverage to easily cut even tough nails.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for great clippers for years. My husband tried them out and he likes them. That says a lot.</li>
    <li> Solid, well built tool; sharp, smooth to operate.  I got tired of breaking the drug store clippers, so went for these as an alternative - I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase!</li>
    <li> These are very good clippers, I usually purchase Revlon brand clippers but the latest ones I purchased have not been very sharp they felt like they crushed the nail and left rough edges. I tried another brand with poor results also, they were not very sharp. I just received the Seki clippers and they cut cleanly and with very little effort. They are not inexpensive but if they last I think they are worth it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I need to trim broken nail edges and to quickly file off rough spots; I do not \\&quot;groom\\&quot; my own nails any more than needed to prevent catching on my clothing fabric and this is perfect for the job.  I came to this product after trying several others and the improvement in quality is immediately obvious.</li>
    <li> Great price, great product.  Best clippers I&#x27;ve owned... much better than cheap ones I have had before. Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would have given these five stars, but they were so dang sharp that they were unable to reattach my toe straight at the hospital. Otherwise, great product.</li>
    <li> I never put much thought into high quality nail clippers, that is until you ask to use your husbands that he carries in his pocket and they&#x27;re dull &amp; partially broken.  How can you use those?  So I surprised him with these because he clips his nails outside to avoid the clippings getting everywhere.  The clippings catch is a great feature and he told me last night these were super sharp, he wasn&#x27;t used to it at all from his last pair.  So beware and be careful if you&#x27;re coming from using an everyday drugstore pair of clippers to these.</li>
    <li> I was not particularly pleased with the narrow space between the blades.  That disappointment was more than offset by the sharpness and the ability to easily cut the nails.  Construction is as solid as advertised and I think this pair will past a very long time.  A little pricey, but only a worry if I lose them.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product very excellent condition and is with high quality&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
    <li> Our fingernail clippers were all beginning to get dull and dangerous, so we decided to give this a shot. As soon as my wife clipped the first nail, all she kept saying was &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;. Amazing how sharp it is, and the long, skinny handle gives great leverage. It also holds the clipped nails, so they don&#x27;t scatter everywhere. Very good quality - and pleasantly surprised by the performance.</li>
    <li> I bought these to use on my kids because they&#x27;re a bit smaller. However, they&#x27;re so sharp that they did not like it. So, I started using them myself, and it is pretty hard to control what you cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always gotten them inexpensive clipper from the grocery store, convenient store or walmart.  I finally ordered this awesome clipper and my only regret is I didn&#x27;t do it sooner.  It&#x27;s durable, solid, sharp, and ergonomically comfortable to operate.  It&#x27;s like going from using a Case pocket knife to a Spyderco.  Huge difference.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this for ages. It is solid and does not slip. I love it.</li>
    <li> It is the same exact cutting width as a cheap nail cutter. But it is longer, heavier, made from better steel, cuts better, and has a different nail file that doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the edge but rather is enclosed on all sides.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the cheap cutters that have a progressive force cut that results from bending the metal pieces enough until it slowly pushes through your nails, this one is instead a couple of really solid metal pieces that don&#x27;t bend but instead have little give and just use a very firm level. So once you push down on it, there is no waiting for the cut but it&#x27;s instantaneous and makes a louder click. So it is a faster more distinct cut than most people are used to, so you better make sure you have it lined up right the first time. Also it is easier to cut yourself because it is very sharp, so just be aware of that. I found that this Seki one is harder to get correctly positioned under your nails initially, but the cut is cleaner and does less damage to your nails. The reason I give this 3 stars is because it should be even longer to provide a better grip, and also because it&#x27;s just not worth $15. It&#x27;s not magical. I would look for an in between option in the 10 to 12 dollar range, but I couldn&#x27;t find one so I got this.</li>
    <li> Finally, a quality nail clipper!&lt;br /&gt;I never realized that nail clippers of this quality even existed.&lt;br /&gt;For 20 years, I had been buying junk, made in china, nail clippers of various brands and thought that there was nothing I could do about it. Occasionally, I found a korean clipper - tiny but sharp - not great..&lt;br /&gt;It was rather dumb of me.. but thanks to Amazon and amazon reviews, I found this great nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I am referring particularly to this particular model - the SS 109.&lt;br /&gt;I had also bought other \\&quot;toe nail\\&quot; size nail clippers by Seki - they were average, at best. I was rather surprised that this SS 109 cuts far superior to the toe nail clipper by Seki. I had assumed that all Seki nail clippers are the same - now I know that they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would assume that there are other high quality seki clippers but I am going to stay with this ss 109. I ordered about 10 of them, to share with family/friends overseas. This ss 109 is an amazingly high quality nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you have tried this ss 109 and have found a better nail clipper by seki or from Germany, please post here.. Until then, I would categorically state that this is the absolute best model of Seki.&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried the solingen/German models.. They might well be good but I am not going to try them..&lt;br /&gt;SS 109 is a great nail clipper. It is so sharp that it works just fine with my toe nails also. Only those with very tough nails might find it a bit small but since this is much more sharp than the seki toe nail version, this actually cuts the toe nails much better!</li>
    <li> These clippers have an excellent fine sharp edge. Very little pressure is required to use, even on tough thumb nails. An excellent investment.</li>
    <li> I cut my toes with old one with a lot of pressure, when I got this one just like cutting the butter.</li>
    <li> Another great find from reading Amazon reviews.  This is definitely the worlds best nail clipper. I could never go back to the standard type.  This is really not that much more money for the absolute best product in clippers.  It feels really nice and it clips beautifully.  I feel sorry for anyone having to use the standard clippers lol.  Get this, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> When I first used this, the edge was really sharp. Sometimes there wasn&#x27;t even a snapping sound because it sliced through my nail so smoothly. After just a few months, it&#x27;s now just like any other cheap nail clipper out there in terms of sharpness. The file works perfectly well. The product looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that really frustrates me is that this almost never catches my nails. The gaps on the sides of the front are too large. And when it does catch my nails, there&#x27;s this small hole in the back that often lets nails fall out. So I end up needing to very frequently empty out the few clippings that it has caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, because the nail catching issue alone is making me consider buying another clipper.</li>
    <li> very sharp, could be larger for those of us with bigger hands.  I Like the file it works very well.</li>
    <li> This  a man&#x27;s clipper, built like a tank and not chinese made feces.  Buy one, your friends will give you the &#x27;nod&#x27; of man approval...because you recognize quality.</li>
    <li> Cuts very nicely. It doesn&#x27;t really catch the clippings though but that&#x27;s tolerable. It&#x27;s also aesthetically pleasing. Overall, great clipper!</li>
    <li> These are by far the best cutting nail clippers that I have ever owned. The cut is smooth and the built in nail file is beyond this day and age. Yes! I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Yup, what a satisfying sound/clip these clippers make!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not so great at using the nail catcher but I just clip over a garbage can anyway ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers feel great in the hand, light-weight, and the cut feels great both during the clipping and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably look for a &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; version so I can tighten up my travel kit but these are great, as others have raved.</li>
    <li> Cut smoothly, evenly and even keeps clippings from going all over the floor&#x27;&#x27; I would recommend it to anypne who hates clippings all over the floor</li>
    <li> Fine quality.  nice for petite hands or childrens nails but not really for a person with larger hands.  It was relegated to bottom of the drawer even if it was a nice tool.</li>
    <li> This is a good clipper, however, just too expensive and not that much better than a cheap nail clipper, which is easily lost and replaced. I do like the built in file, but it is difficult to use because the top lever sticks up at an angle so you can clip!</li>
    <li> Who would have thought it made a difference what kind of nail clippers you use?  Well, I know now, and these are great!  My nails are hard as a rock, and these clip them like butter.  So nice</li>
    <li> My son has finally outgrown the infant nail clipper we have been using for the past 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;However, the adult size ones are too big, too bulky, too hard to handle, and they scare him because they are so oversized compared to his fingernails so he panics that we are going to nip the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to get him a better quality nail clipper, and I have the regular size Seki Edge and I really like it, so the Satin Slim seemed perfect for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well made and the perfect size for him.  He has taken over his own nail clipping once again and now that his dad doesn&#x27;t have to corral him and wrestle with him to bring his nails back to a safe level, there is calm in our home once again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a superior product, but got what is probably a Japanese drugstore item. Granted, it&#x27;s better than most I&#x27;ve come across in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Precision made and seems durable.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Slippery in hand, and has an annoying pointed end that pokes you when using.&lt;br /&gt;  Possibly due to the handling issue,it doesn&#x27;t completely finish a cut of the nail, leaving a shredd to further remove.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had cheaper Trim models that almost equal the Seki precision cut, and handle better. If this model wasn&#x27;t so &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; it would be a winner. Maybe for younger females,not over 55 folks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been driven nuts by nail clippers squishing and micro-cracking my nails before slicing through. I bought a toenail clipper of good quality, and that was a little better just because it had more power. Not great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this one because of the great reviews, and lo - they&#x27;re right! This little guy is really sharp. It cuts right through with a satisfying little click and leaves a sharp, clean edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails already look better; they&#x27;ve stopped chipping and wearing at the ends. I&#x27;m pretty sure the squashed, blunt edge left by other clippers was causing my nail problem. These are fast, easy, and sharp.</li>
    <li> Okay so they are clippers, they feel nice in the hand - what is the big deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLIP...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh.. there it is, effortlessly cuts and clean. No mucking around with many attempts on the toenails or fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an Aussie Bloke - my toenail clippings were used in ages past to shape boomerangs. Yes I reckon you could carve wood with them (my toenails that is), but these clippers cut them with ease.</li>
    <li> Probably the best cutting nail clippers ive ever used. Excellent quality workmanship!</li>
    <li> Works Great , clean and easy cut. Only draw back is handles are very small and slips out of your hands when using.</li>
    <li> I am 60+ years old and have used five and dime nail clippers forever.  I had no idea just how nice clippers can be!  These clippers breeze through my nails as if my nails were paper.  They are nicely weighted and look great.  They are so nice that I&#x27;ve bought some for both my wife and my mother as &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; presents.  I&#x27;m just sorry that it took 60+ years to discover these.</li>
    <li> Once you buy this clipper you&#x27;ll wonder why you have not bought it before. It adds a whole new world of ease to clipping your nails.</li>
    <li> It is enough sharp to clip nails. But I don&#x27;t like the shape of it really well. The shape in the front cause me always clip the nail where doesn&#x27;t need to.</li>
    <li> This clipper was not what I had hoped for. The edge is quite narrow so I must make five or so cuts on each nail. Making so many cuts, it&#x27;s hard to end up with a nice, smooth nail edge. The gap between the cutting edges is also small, making it hard for me to properly position the clipper for a cut. Also, for some reason, it&#x27;s mildly painful to clip a nail using this clipper. That&#x27;s probably somehow related to anatomy and so I suppose others may not experience pain, since I don&#x27;t see it mentioned in other reviews. The clipper seems well made and likely to prove durable. And it&#x27;s really sharp and cuts cleanly. However, in my use, most cuttings miss the catcher. Again, that may somehow relate to anatomy, though I wasn&#x27;t aware that my fingers or nails were special in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I really wanted was a clipper as good as the old La Cross clipper I used to have. Clippers purchased at retail pharmacies have been of low quality. Some mash the nail more than clip it. Etc. I&#x27;m going to order a $0.99 La Cross clipper that seems to resemble the clipper I used to have and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> This is the best clipper I have ever had.  Have let some friends use it and they want to know where they could purchase the clipper.  It is sharp and even cut toe nails with no problem.  However, I try to use it only for finger nails.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Paying $15 for a nail clipper, and seeing that this is &amp;#34;the best one out there&amp;#34;, maybe I was expecting too much. What I want is the clipper that my family&#x27;s had since before I was born... I think it&#x27;s from Japan... 20+ years and it&#x27;s still sharp and eager to clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this Seki clipper was impressive. It was like a hot knife through butter. Probably more effortless than that, actually. Dangerously sharp, as others have said. In a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a few months, I don&#x27;t know... it feels like it&#x27;s already lost its edge. Takes a little more effort to clip, and when it does, it leaves a bit of a rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to the file part of the clipper (which I have to use, because of these rough edges... hrmph) and the file is great. It&#x27;s different from other on-clipper files I&#x27;ve used; it&#x27;s more like fine sandpaper than metal with ridges in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the catcher doesn&#x27;t catch stuff flying out the side, since there&#x27;s quite an indent along the sides. And it doesn&#x27;t hold much, so you have to empty it every couple fingers, or else you&#x27;ll get overflow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wish this was better. I&#x27;ll still use it for a long time, especially when my other options are $2 clippers from the grocery store. Maybe I just have to go to Japan if I want a good forever-clipper.</li>
    <li> This is very nice and cuts nails like it should, but one has to be careful that you don&#x27;t cut the finger as well as it is very sharp.  I would order again.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> These clippers are well constructed.  Not cheap, they don&#x27;t fall apart...cut well too!  I recommended these clippers without any reservations. I bought 4 of them!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Sturdy, excellent quality.  Much better than regular drug store items.</li>
    <li> These are seriously excellent clippers. Sharp, and the blades meet precisely.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers work great, and the blades are actually sharp so they&#x27;ll cut rather than snap through your nails.  The included file is handy and works well to smooth out sharp edges after clipping.  Also, it&#x27;s made in Japan, which usually means quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a metal guard on the sides, which catches some stray clippings, but not all.  You can slide it back for easy cleaning.</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ll build and very sharp. cuts cleanly. my old one start to loose its sharpness after about 3 years but is still very usable and still sharper than those cheap one from drug stores</li>
    <li> 1) Fantastic!  They cut like a champ (w/ light pressure), store clippings &amp; file well&lt;br /&gt;2) Small size -- great for small areas&lt;br /&gt;3) Fat head (partially why they cut well) -- depending on your nail location, this might be a problem for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall -- very pleased &amp; worth it!</li>
    <li> These clippers are a joy to use. As with most people, I was hesitant to spent this amount of money for a grooming product when I was used to spending a 1$ at the local drug store for them, but I&#x27;ve seen the light. These clip so much smoother and the edges of my nails aren&#x27;t jagged anymore. Try them, and I guarantee you won&#x27;t go back to substandard clippers again.</li>
    <li> This is the first finger nail clipper I have used, that cut my nails with a perfect edge. Usually I have to turn the nail clipper upside-down to get a nice looking and smooth edge on the nails. This one does the job and I get rid of most of the white edge of the nails, without getting too close to my nail roots. I have a good grip on it and I don&#x27;t have to sweat to cut harder nails. I am in total charge. You will see and feel the great quality on this Seki Edge nail clipper as soon as you open the package. It stands out on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this finger nail clipper would not do the job on my toes, but I also bought Seki Edge toe nail clipper. That one has the same great quality, but is larger in size and more suitable for toe nails. It covers a larger area and you save time :-)</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a really good nail clipper for quite some time. I was getting sick of using the nail clippers you get from the drugstores because the end of my nails always felt and looked cracked out after I was done clipping. But these clippers don&#x27;t do that. They are pretty sharp which is probably why it gives you such a smooth clip, but at the same time it&#x27;s gentle enough on the nails. An amazing product and def. worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is a sharp and precise clipper, but I&#x27;m not sure it is worth paying any premium for it above and beyond the cost of a plain old regular drug store clipper.  It might take slightly less pressure to clip the nail due to the sharper blade and slightly better alignment, but I do not think it justifies the higher price.</li>
    <li> SUPER FAST SHIPPING. PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> High quality Japan made TSA friendly Nail Clipper for fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> I like the look and feel of this quality clipper. My wife says it clips so well she almost doesn&#x27;t need to file afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price. Its a quality tool.</li>
    <li> I have bought at least a dozen nail clippers and none of them did what I thought they should do. These clippers are very well made and they do the job better than any clippers I&#x27;ve tried before. Good job...</li>
    <li> Cut like butter.  Comfortable grip.</li>
    <li> compared to typical clippers, these rock.  not sure if it&#x27;s the extra leverage with the longer handle.  nails crisply clip off.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about quality steel. I try to only buy the very best and I believe that is SEKI. These nail clippers fit my finger nail contour as I am a woman. I could spend over a hundred dollars more and still not get a better clipper. I FEEL THAT YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT ANY PRODUCT YOU BUY THAT IS MADE BY SEKI WILL RIVAL THE BEST STEEL ON THE MARKET. I know, I have bought HENKEL, RUSSELL (EVEN THE OLD RUSSELL) KNIVES, AND I WILL PAY MUCH LESS AND GET A PRODUCT OF EQUAL QUALITY WHEN I BUY A SEKI.&lt;br /&gt; I just don&#x27;t understand how they sell such quality for the price.</li>
    <li> The instant you pick up this clipper you know that you have a well constructed instrument. It easily cuts through tough nails with precision. This is the sharpest clipper I have ever owned; It collects the clippings in a storage box which is part of the clipper. It is fairly effective but not perfect. I did not consider this feature in rating the clipper because my primary objective in acquiring the clipper was to get an effective clipper.</li>
    <li> I bought it  because it has the nail file and catcher.But it just doesn&#x27;t work at all.The  catcher does not catch well,and the files can&#x27;t hold ,the nails it catches will come out from the bottom.You can see from the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one  Seki Edge In-Grown Toenail Clipper , Stainless Steel,same thing!!&lt;br /&gt;And It&#x27;s not eligible for return.So I waste my $28&lt;br /&gt;I never wrote any bad reviews,but now I just feel I have to .</li>
    <li> I bought finger and toe nail clippers from Seki. Although they are more expensive than most clippers, they are worth the price! It is definitely worth it to spend a little more for a great product that will last years and years longer than a cheap $3-4 set of clippers.</li>
    <li> I love how they made small tools so delicate.&lt;br /&gt;This is surely gonna last. The touch of high quality steel is a pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic nail clipper, why have i used cheap drugstore ones my whole life?  For a small expense you can save time, have better nails and use a prescision tool.</li>
    <li> One word, OUTSTANDING.</li>
    <li> Just buy this and throw your cheapies in the garbage! This is the only nail clipper I will ever use again. Sharp, precise, a beautiful piece of workmanship &amp; no raggedy edges from elcheapo clippers.  Im a pianist and am OCD over my nails. Ahhh....perfection!  I also bought the Seki Edge toenail clipper. Excellent as well!</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers ever.</li>
    <li> I chose this clipper based on raving reviews - my old clipper became dull.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is very sharp and works fine, but the edge is somewhat short, so it requires more cuts than when using other clippers. The mouth does not open wide, so people with thick nails may have problems. The nail file works as well, but the lever has to be held together with the clipper body, as there is no notch to keep it in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail catcher simply does not work, whence four stars.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers.  They leave a really nice, clean cut.  My cheap clippers leave a ragged edge.  They are worth the money!  The toenail clippers are great, too.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.  It was hard to get myself to spend this much money for nail clippers but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> The nail clipper is sharp, precise, and well made.  Unfortunately, out of the 5 I ordered, 2 came in misaligned at the cutting edges and do not work as well as the others.</li>
    <li> First, let me clear up a few misconceptions from the product page. This toy is not a small ball, despite what Amazon may think. It&#x27;s really more of a sharp, nail clipping toy. And I appreciate Amazon warning me that children may choke on broken balloons, this product contains no balloons (alas!), neither broken nor unbroken. Finally, while Amazon lists the ingredients as Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and Vitamin E, it&#x27;s really mostly stainless steel and a bit of plastic for the label. But on to my real observations... This clipper is great! Everything about it feels precise and solid. When you flip it into clipping position, it just snaps into place without the fidgeting and wobbling I know from cheaper clippers. I used to think it was worthwhile to spring for the slightly pricier Revlons over the no-namers. Maybe it was, but neither of those can compare to the Seki. Clipping with this is easy, and results in very clean cuts. After having experienced clipping with the Seki (which feels like cutting), previous clippers I&#x27;ve used feel more like mashing, and the effort to make a cut is very noticeable. With other clippers, I&#x27;ve occasionally not been able to make a cut, and had to sort of reposition my hand or switch hands or whatever just to get a bit more oomph into it. I don&#x27;t see that being a problem with the Seki. There&#x27;s a little sliding bit on the bottom of the Seki, this is supposed to catch your nails? Highly unlikely, and if that little bit breaks off I won&#x27;t be sad for it. There&#x27;s also a file, and I guess it could be handy in a pinch. It doesn&#x27;t feel particularly coarse, and it&#x27;s a small and almost recessed patch on the handle, rather difficult to use. You won&#x27;t need to do that much filing with a clipper this good, but I still like to round off the edges a bit, and for that I prefer a [[ASIN:B00283O7LK glass file]]. A clipper this costly in a sea of cheapies really has to be good to be justifiable. And even though its bonus features are a bit tacked-on and useless (and even though it doesn&#x27;t come with balloons), this thing is absolutely justifiable.</li>
    <li> I do a lot of nail clipping: my own, my husband&#x27;s toenails, my elderly mother-in-law&#x27;s fingernails and toenails. I have noticed the quality of nail clippers deteriorating over the past decade or so. A few days ago, I was doing my mother-in-law&#x27;s nails once more at her assisted living, once more having SO much trouble maneuvering the clippers she had on hand without hurting her; my manual dexterity is excellent--it was the fault of the clippers. So I went to amazon.com, of course, and started looking. (I already knew that I did NOT like what you usually find in stores such as Wal-Mart and Walgreen&#x27;s these days.) The cost of these clippers seems a little high until you try them. It was love at first clip. I have NEVER in my life had a nail clipper cut so cleanly as these. I have never in my life used a clipper so easy to maneuver to get precise cuts on the edges on either side of the nail. My only question is: Since I technically bought these for my mother-in-law, how quickly will our family budget allow me to ditch the old clippers at our house and replace them all with seki clippers?</li>
    <li> This is a quality product that I initially ordered, however, it is more for women than for men as the &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; version is made for a woman&#x27;s smaller nail. This was not readily evident in the descriptions I read. I ended up giving this one to my daughter and ordering the SS-106 and the SS-107 for myself. All is now well in the kingdom! Great product.</li>
    <li> The Seki Edge Satin Clipper is excellent.  It is made by Green Bell, excellent size for finger nails and cuts the nail without splintering.  It is one of the best finger nail clipper I have ever owned.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re sick and tired of the presently available crop of nail clippers that smash, fragment and leave half cut pieces of nails hanging from your fingers, buy this!  Don&#x27;t even think about the price.  Buy it!  It is SHARP and cuts with the most positive action ever.  Just make sure you do not have a bit of the &amp;#34;quick&#x27; of the nail nor a bit of skin inside the cutters or - OUCH!  No stopping the cutting action with this one.  It cuts quick as a finger snap and completely through the nail - or the &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; or skin if you&#x27;re sloppy about it.  BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I also purchased the toenail clippers at the same time. They are both very well made, easy to use on &amp;#34;old hands&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m 63) and cut very nicely. I relied on the reviews to purchase and they did not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Where has this been all my life!!  Trust the reviews.  I was between this and the wider one, but I am very happy we got the narrow size, it is nice to hold and control.  These are so different from other clippers in terms of clean cut on the nails - it&#x27;s like other clippers don&#x27;t deserve to be called a clipper after using this Seki.  I&#x27;ve ordered more to give as gifts and as stocking stuffers.  Everyone should have a pair of nice nail clippers!!  Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love all of Seki Edge&#x27;s products. Their nail clippers are beyond amazing. Usually the cheap ones at the store leave a rough edge that you have to file away, but with Seki Edge products they cut straight through. My niece was terrified of getting her nails trimmed because of other clippers, then I showed her these and her response was &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t hurt! It doesn&#x27;t leave that stuff!&amp;#34; referring to the rough edge other products leave.</li>
    <li> Fits my hands (large) doesn&#x27;t slip. Slices through the nails without even a thought. Best I have owned. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say anything new that hasn&#x27;t been said in so many reviews. It&#x27;s super sharp and works just great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep it as simple as that. This clipper just works perfectly. My friends were surprised it costs that much, but it really deserve every cent. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great quality, made in Japan.  Would highly recommend.  Hmm, need to say something else-works much better than the dikes I was using at work, lol.</li>
    <li> A finely machined stainless finger nail clipper far superior to the more basic, cheaper ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  They&#x27;re sharp and effortless to use.  There&#x27;s a little separate piece which slides back from the nippers for clean out.  And a high grade file built into the back of the cutting arm.  I think they&#x27;re worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical as to wether this was going to stand up to the hype but discovered this is a quality instrument actually worth the money. This simple nail clipper defines elegance, the sharp cutter will clip your nails with a minimum of effort and ease of control.</li>
    <li> Going to buy another for myself. My husband has problem always with ingrown finger and toenails. With thick nails it has always been more than a hassle for him to cut his nails. He is always extra reluctant to have me help clip his nails (harder for him to see toenails). No problem now as this nail-clipper is not only sharp but does a clean cut, even on his toenails except the large thick toenail. There isn&#x27;t much need for filing either which is great since we also always carry a separate filer for the job. The one in this clipper does a great job also. Seki has always produced top-notched products. Hope they continue before the cheaper price competitive varieties out there drives the company to go the way of most when price governs mass customer preference in purchasing. Worth to pay extra.</li>
    <li> No more bargain clippers for me.  These are so easy to operate and the super honed blades make a sometimes difficult job extremely easy.</li>
    <li> Sharp, robust, but difficult to use as the lever does not stay in place and rotates left and right whenever you want to cut.</li>
    <li> Sharp, neat trim of finger and toe nails.  No ragged edges left after using on nails. Easy to hold and well made. Not bulky or heavy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the easiest to operate fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used, it requires minimal finger pressure to actuate</li>
    <li> My father tried this nail clipper and he totally loves it! Hand-made cutting edge is in excellent quality and when you hold it in hand it feels so good. With catcher, my father never needs to stand outside for nail clipping anymore.As Seki is a Japanese city famous for their craftsman, I think these guys should really be proud of what they made. Overall, seki nail clipper is a product that is carefully made with highest standard out there. Try it and you will love it, just like my father:)  どうもありがとうございます!</li>
    <li> These clippers are amazing. Im not a clipper connoisseur but I can safely guarantee that these will be one of the best sets you have ever owned. I was looking into getting new clippers and discovered Seki Edge. The reviews on Amazon are great. Most people had reviewed a different model though. I saw that this 109 model was a newer updated design with a major complaint addressed: built in nail file. They said it was slimmer and easier to hold but still cut sharp and clean. This is absolutely true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers are extremely well crafted and built. It screams quality workmanship. They are incredibly sharp and the nail catch feature seems to work well. The nail file is beautifully inlaid into the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is, as the name implies, THESE ARE SLIM. If you have large fingers, you may be unhappy that the blades aren&#x27;t larger. Also the jaws are relatively narrow as well. If you have thick nails (toenails, large thumbs, etc.), they may not fit in, though I have yet to have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is gonna be such a great small gift to give all the men in my family on Christmas. Set of amazing clippers and a small cologne. Perfect manly gift. That&#x27;s not to say these aren&#x27;t for ladies as well though...</li>
    <li> I am now a Seki Edge believer!  I wasn&#x27;t really sure if I understood the hype for the nail clipper. It is afterall just a tool to cut off your hang nails..... You can get much, much cheaper ones from your local drugstore or even from Amazon. The others don&#x27;t cost $20. The others ALSO all do not have 5 stars for their review. This is literally the highest rated nail clipper on Amazon, at the time of writing this review. I believe that it has earned everyone of it&#x27;s stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I took it out of the box, it was really tiny. It was about the size of my palm and I wear extra small gloves. Despite being dainty, it was pretty heavy for it&#x27;s size. I could tell right away from holding it that it was made out of heavy steel. It was not steel plated. This thing was real. Also, I was surprised at how easily the lever swung around.  The nail file part was smooth and had a nice texture.  I really liked the FEEL of this nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real magic happened when I went to cut my nail. It snipped right off.  I didn&#x27;t even have the chance to blink. I had to check my finger to make sure my nail actually was clipped. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. It happened so quickly, seemlessly, and easily.  The razor&#x27;s edge was swift. There was no fuss. It was done efficiently, effectively, and almost silently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I LOVE THIS NAIL CLIPPER. I will never go back. I highly recommend this. I join the legions of others who also have given this a 5 star review.  Also, I am in no way affiliated with the company.  You can check my reviews. I have like hundreds for other products. LOL. This is the best nail clipper!</li>
    <li> It definitely feels like cutting through butter.</li>
    <li> Excellent sharpness and nail cutting, but I removed the nail catcher because it would slide while trimming and was annoying.  Great trimmers otherwise.</li>
    <li> These Japanese nail clippers are the best i have ever used they are so sharp you don&#x27;t even feel it cut through your nail,I call them Samurai nail clippers.</li>
    <li> If you carry an $8 cheap Chinese pocket knife you probably will think this is a rip off. If you carry a $50 or greater pocket knife, this finger nail clipper is that much better than the $3 drug store ones. It trims my toe nails with ease, though it takes 3 cuts for the big toes. Best file ever on a fold up clipper.</li>
    <li> first time ever splurging on fingernail clippers.  Always just used cheap drugstore type.  Gotta say, I purchased these after I dropped my old ones off a 15 story balcony based on reviews..... and I am more than impressed with the quality and the ease with wich you are able to clip your nails.  My old clippers had to be a lot of pressure applied and always slipped around on my nail and in hands..... These sekis are almost effortless.  Highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Bought the toenail clippers also after these.</li>
    <li> The Seki products are wonderful. No rough or too squared off edges. I prefer this clipper to the wider square model my husband likes.</li>
    <li> I have four boys ages 9 and under.  They HATE having their nails clipped.  I decided to try this clipper, despite the price.  If it makes clipping 40 fingernails and 40 toenails easier each week, it&#x27;s worth it.  The blades are sharp and the long handle makes it easy to use.  It&#x27;s so easy to use that today my 8 year-old decided he wanted to clip his own fingernails!  He did a nice job and my life will be that much easier.  Highly recommended. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and clips toenails very quickly without having to use a lot of force. Took away one star because the nail clipping collection zone doesn&#x27;t always collect the nails, sometimes they fall out.</li>
    <li> Sometimes spending a little better to buy the best is worth it. These cut effortlessly, and look to last in the long term, which makes them worth the extra money. I believe in finding some big expense to cut (like skipping a vacation) and using the savings to get the best of all the little things--items like screwdrivers, nails clippers, combs--that most people usually get the cheapest dime store version of.</li>
    <li> Unlike the el cheapo clippers that you buy at drug stores, this one is incredibly sharp and requires very little effort to cut. It has a high quality build and feels durable. And most importantly, the hinge that connects the top and bottom pieces doesn&#x27;t look like its ever going to break, unlike my old clipper that I now discarded.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They cut really well. I bought my husband one for a stocking stuffer for X-mas. He loves his too.</li>
    <li> In a world of cheap clippers, this one stands out both for its esthetics and its build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s even a little (emphasis on the &#x27;little&#x27;) nail file built into the arm. Too small for a serious nail job, but effective for an on-the-fly touch-up job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter is a little smaller in width than other clippers I have used, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clipper for over 2 years now and I can definitively say I don&#x27;t like them. It gets the job done without fail and still sharp after 2 years 5/5 stars on cutting nails. However, when I start clipping into a nail, about 75% of the time the side of the clipper that is towards the middle of the nail gets stuck in the nail and is very uncomfortable and cringe-worthy to have to pull these clippers out of your nail to re-position them to go to the next cut.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy. I&#x27;ve never put any thought into things like nail clippers. I usually just buy whatever is hanging in the cosmetics aisle of the local supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geeze. What a difference a decent pair of clippers makes. No idea how long the blades keep their edge, but for now, it&#x27;s a night and day difference from supermarket brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> This is a good finger nail clipper. However, at least for me, it is too slim to clip my toenails. I guess it&#x27;s my own fault for buying a &amp;#34;slim&amp;#34; clipper. Other than the toenail problem, it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> VERY SHARP AND EASY TO USE.  THE BUILT IN NAIL CATCHER AND NAIL FILE ARE SUPERB. WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> Will buy more of this brand as I need new implements.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for a few years and thought I had lost it, but found it after a few days. I had ordered these and now it&#x27;s being used by my wife in her professional nail tech business. Seriously don&#x27;t know  of a better quality clipper out there and I have tried quite a few. Stays sharp, mine is over 3 years old and still clip with little effort and cleanly.</li>
    <li> Received the clippers today and they are by far the best clippers either I or my wife have ever used. Handle is longer than regular clippers and they are super sharp and cut right trough nails. I have a pair of clippers that I have owned for about 25 years that were made in the USA and they still work excellent today, but these clippers are a little better quality. I purchased these because my teenagers have lost a number of clippers and I wanted to buy another good pair in case they lost my good ole Made in the USA ones. I just hope they can stand the test of time as my old clippers.</li>
    <li> I liked it so much I used it as gift. I intend to buy more.</li>
    <li> had to buy a second one because my dad liked it so much</li>
    <li> The clippers work very well. Other reviewers said that it cuts so smoothly that they don&#x27;t have to file -- I do disagree with that statement.</li>
    <li> Bit pricey, but after using cheap nail clippers I decided to invest in this. It&#x27;s well made and it cuts soft and doesn&#x27;t leave me with flying nail clippings. I really feel like it was a good investment.</li>
    <li> I had no idea nail clippers could be so good. We have used the common ones and never knew there were options until recently. These are a pleasure to use, cuts quickly, precisely. What else have I been missing out on? :)</li>
    <li> This product is very sharp and precise, almost too good. Takes practice to learn how use it correctly or you will have little splits in your nail, too fine to see, but will snag on things.</li>
    <li> This nail clipper is very solid and strong. It never slips out of my hands and makes cutting nails (even toenails) super easy. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re sick of losing or breaking nailclippers.</li>
