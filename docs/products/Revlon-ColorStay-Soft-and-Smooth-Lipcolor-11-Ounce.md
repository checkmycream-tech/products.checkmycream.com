    <li> ... are what got me to make this purchase.  Although I do like the consistency and moisture, there is a sheen that is not, what I would ever call, satin.  All around good color if you like some sparkle.</li>
    <li> I love this shade and it&#x27;s smooth consistency. It does pretty good through drinking beverages and lasts quite a long while.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite lipstick.  Long lasting and a natural pink shade. I&#x27;m so bummed this was discontinued. Anyone have ideas for a replacement shade/brand?</li>
    <li> Thank you thank you!!  I have tried to find Satin Rosewood 295 lipcolor forever.  This is the best lipcolor!  I totally love it and don&#x27;t want anyother because it stays on all day and does not bleed around the lip area.  I was so disappointed when going to store after store looking for it and it just seemed to disappear. But was so excited when I googled and were able to purchase from you.</li>

    <li> Nice product that was very, very cheap, so I tried it...it does not last like the 16-hour-type products. Shipping seemed a little high, but it still cost less here than if I bought it in a store, so a great way to try it and find out about it. It does go on smooth, just has to be reapplied.</li>
    <li> I had been using this product before Revlon discontinued it and was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t find it anylonger.  Its a nice neutral rose-pink that goes with almost everything I wear, stays on longer than most lipsticks. A friend of mine who is a frequent shopper on Amazon found it for me again and now I buy this 3 at a time!  Its a great medium rose-pink that suits almost all skin tones (per Revlon).</li>
    <li> My favorite color that was discontinued.  Was so glad to find it.  It cost me more to ship the item than to buy it, but it was worth it.</li>
