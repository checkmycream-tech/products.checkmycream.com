      <li>This is the best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
      <li>else- the l&#x27;oreal vive conditioners were the best, and i used it FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tho</li>

      <li>Nice smell, great packing and awesome price.</li>
      <li>this is very nice conditioner.</li>
      <li>Also this is very good and comes close to what promises but the L&#x27;oreal has better lines!</li>
      <li>However, the scent is pleasant with this brand</li>
      <li>This is also a good leave on for 30 mins and rinse in treatments.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s sulfate/paraben free it&#x27;s not the best</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal has a good line.</li>
      <li>I have to take good care of it.</li>
      <li>they were going at a good pace.</li>

      <li>I have been looking for a good hair conditioner</li>
      <li>That was as good as this one.</li>
      <li>Loved all the Loreal products for smoothing.</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have any silicones, which are often featured in &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; sorts of hair products, so this could be good to try if you are looking to avoid those.</li>
      <li>This is a good product for that.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better  than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used smells very lovely!!!</li>

      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s sulfate free</li>
      <li>It really is an amazing smoothing conditioner.</li>
      <li>Awesome product and sulfate free, which is important to me.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I will never switch again.</li>
      <li>shampoo has a nice rosemary scent, but the conditioner has a rosemary + a horrid perfume</li>
      <li>I cannot pass up hair products that smell nicely on sale.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s nothing spectacular</li>
      <li>My hair looks nice when I use this.</li>
      <li>but I find it to be pleasant and not too strong.</li>
      <li>I found the scent to be pleasant, not to strong.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this great product!</li>

      <li>So far, the best poo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used it Rockstar.  </li>
      <li>This is a great, cheap, sulfate free option.</li>
      <li>My hair is soft, shiny, smells wonderful, and is more low-maintenance than ever.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling very healthy and smooth.</li>
      <li>I thought I liked this, but the more I used it the more coated my hair felt; and the more unmanageable it became.  </li>
      <li>This line seems too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I am now using Coppolla sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and love it!  </li>
      <li>and it makes my&lt;br /&gt;hair very soft and makes it smell so good!</li>
      <li>Love it and would not trade it for another product.</li>
      <li>With hair to the back of my knees, and being the hair freak that I am this product is one of the best conditioners you can buy.</li>
      <li>I am in love.</li>
      <li>Works ok, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again though</li>
      <li>I also use it with the Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment</li>
      <li>and I have received many compliments on how &amp;#34;good I smell.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard great reviews about L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Intense Smoothing Conditioner, so I decided to order it and try it out for myself.</li>

      <li>One of my favorite conditioners.  </li>

      <li>I love the smell of this conditioner.</li>

      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I had so many split ends from the damage.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice smell, and its sulfate free.  </li>
      <li>The thing I like most about this, is that it doesn&#x27;t contains alcohol.</li>
      <li>And I have never been able to replicate my salon results no matter how many times my stylist taught me how and told me what products to buy.</li>
      <li>I figured rinsing it out would get rid of most of the smell though.</li>
      <li>I love them--I cannot stop buying them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have lived with curly, frizzy hair my whole life and have dropped hundreds of dollars on expensive hair care products. The latest product I&#x27;d been using is the super expensive Bumble and Bumble line.  Nothing has made my hair smoother and more manageable than L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s EverSleek line. It is a life changing product! I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the perfume wasn&#x27;t so strong.</li>
    <li> Wow!! I started using this a few days ago. My hair came out so shiny and smooth.. I found the scent to be pleasant, not to strong. My hair is very thin and curly. And tends to frizz. This stuff is so calming. The no silicone/ sulfites, makes a huge difference. I am slowly switching all my hair products to only ones free of silicones/sulfites. L&#x27;Oreal has a good line. I was shocked how well my hair responded to it.</li>
    <li> this is very nice conditioner. Leaves my hair silky and not frizzy, in combination with an after shower product.</li>
    <li> I really LOVE these products. I am Puerto Rican, so my hair is between wavy and curly, but, also it is coarse. One big problem is it gets really dry from heat styling. These products have been my saviors. I have gotten Keratin treaments, but, it is just so DARN expensive, plus the fumes are so harmful !!!  So I decided to give my hair moisture in a different way. These products are starting to get my hair healthier. I use the shampoo, the conditioner and the heat protection, believe me they really work against FRIZZ, which is another BIG issue here in Texas.</li>
    <li> I have course, frizzy, hard to manage hair. So I got a Keratin treatment. One of the requirement is to use Sulfate free shampoo and conditioner after the treatment. So I stumbled upon this product...I am sooooo glad I did!  This is the best conditioner I have ever used! It made my hair so soft and shiny after each wash. I am so happy with this product I decided to keep on using it...If you have dry, course hair, this conditioner should help make it easier to manage.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have a problem with hair care products...it&#x27;s an addiction, really. I love them--I cannot stop buying them. I cannot pass up hair products that smell nicely on sale. This being said, I picked this up the other day in a haste not wanting to buy professional products from my local Target and I was shooting for something Sulfate Free (simply because the girl who does my hair tells me to). This was the best smelling of the 3 offered at Target (the others smelled medicine-y/too herbal to me). I used the shampoo/conditioner thinking it was a temporary use and I&#x27;d put it in the cupboard for future emergency use. Well, I used it once and I loved it but for some reason any time I change shampoos they seem to make my hair look good for at least the first day BUT i&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my only complaint is that my hair is oily but only because I cannot keep my hands out of it! It feels and smells so nice and the price is a quarter of what I&#x27;ve paid for professional! I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could! Try it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used Wen for the past year &amp; it has done wonders for my hair. I didn&#x27;t like the price - so I decided to try this loreal shampoo/conditioner combo.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a nice rosemary scent, but the conditioner has a rosemary + a horrid perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so strong that I&#x27;m not sure if I can last the day without shampooing my hair again to get this smell out.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever use this conditioner again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jury is still out on the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Leaves my hair feeling very healthy and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy after a while as some of the others do.</li>
    <li> This conditioner goes well with its elder shampoo sibling. In fact, I have seen both of them running with my money from time-to-time and they were going at a good pace. Read my comments about shampoo for an \\&quot;all you need to know\\&quot; review.</li>
    <li> Better than the other keratin products I have used.  Makes my hair silky but not oily.  Loved all the Loreal products for smoothing.</li>
    <li> This review is for my sons and i.&lt;br /&gt;My hair: down to mid back when straight, fine strands but thick hair wavy and dark brown. (Color processed and regularly blow dried n flat ironed)&lt;br /&gt;my son: same hair but lose curls and down to his midback as well when combed straight(virgin hair never blow dried or flat ironed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: didn&#x27;t need a lot of product&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels softer and silkier and not knotty.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;my sons curls were tighter like it wasn&#x27;t being weighed down&lt;br /&gt;somehow had feels light maybe because it&#x27;s not being weighed down&lt;br /&gt;my waves seemed the same&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:hair was more frizzy (based on air dry results and no extra products on hair) because fine strands went being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will try with products on it after a wash and will update this as needed.</li>
    <li> My hair is much less frizzy, softer and so smooth after using this thing. Love it and would not trade it for another product. I was recently in Houston in August and this kept my hair under control. I am in love.</li>
    <li> Used a 2 day free sample I received in the mail; not impressed. Used it after the eversleek intense smoothing shampoo. Did nothing as promised. No different from the Pantene or Tres eme, Matrix or Sheer Blonde that I normally use. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this line nor would I recommend it since I saw no difference. It was weird to me that the \\&quot;intense conditioner\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t very thick when the gross leave in conditioner they sent along with it has the consistency of lotion. You would figure it would be the other way around.   Skip this unless you can get a free sample from their website first; it may or may not work for you.</li>
    <li> Was excited to try this product since I have heard it is better for your hair not to use sulfates and it is an \\&quot;intense smooth conditioner\\&quot; since I have frizzy hair. Putting it on in the shower though I immediately noticed that it had an overwhelming floral scent, just like a REALLY strong perfume. I figured rinsing it out would get rid of most of the smell though. I rinsed and towel dried it but it still had a really strong scent and I could feel the back of my throat was feeling a little funny, but I kept thinking it would lessen soon so I left it to air dry. As the minutes progressed I started sneezing randomly and having to blow my nose, and then I started to get a headache. I gave it another 10-15 mins still somehow thinking it would get better, but my headache only increased and I finally had to run and wash my hair again to get the smell out. Now, I do tend to be somewhat sensitive to perfumes, but I have NEVER had any kind of reaction to a hair product before. If you have even a slight problem with fragrance or perfumes DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> The condtioner and shampoo leaves my hair dry When I dried it, it was frizzy and the volume was overdone,</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy, unruly hair that I would just flat iron in the past, but I just don&#x27;t have the time with an infant. I&#x27;ve tried several different products and methods (including no &#x27;poo), but nothing could tame my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some digging, I found that I needed something that was sulfate free and this was the product that fit in my budget. It&#x27;s fantastic - my hair has never looked better, and I can feel the difference. I used the shampoo and conditioner, along with the leave in creme, and was able to let it dry naturally without my hair exploding on my head.</li>
    <li> My Girlfriend wrote: My favorite part of using L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverSleek Sulfate-Free Smoothing System Intense Smoothing was how smooth my hair actually was! Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair and nevertheless I didnt need to use a huge amount of the product, so thats a big plus for me!</li>
    <li> Love this Conditioner, I recently switched over from Dove moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I use the Evercreme shampoo with this conditioner on my ends and I found it has really helped smooth my hair. It is way less frizzy, and more soft and smooth. Best of all (to me) is the way that it made my hair less tangly and easier to brush post shower. I also use it with the Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment I find these three products have really improved my hair. I even find i have to wash my hair less even with the added oil on my ends. I used to wash my hair every day, but now i just have to wash my hair once every three days. I wish this product same in larger sizes since I&#x27;m planning to keep buying it. I only do one shampoo and one conditioning every shower so I dont have to use that much but a larger size would be great for value!</li>
    <li> I&#x60;m very glad with this product. I have a curly hair...so for me it&#x60;s very difficult to find some products. After use this conditioner...the result is amazing, my hair is very soft and with good aspect.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is a good seller.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner.  It gets the tangles out fast.</li>
    <li> My thick, curly hair has gotten more coarse and frizzier as I&#x27;ve aged into my 40s, and it&#x27;s really hard to find a shampoo and conditioner that will help keep it under control. I really don&#x27;t like having a &amp;#34;halo&amp;#34; of friz by the end of the day. These products (I use both the shampoo and the conditioner) really help. My hair feels soft when I get out of the shower, and although I do use a leave-in conditioner, I don&#x27;t have to nuke my hair with spray to keep it under control. Hooray!</li>
    <li> I had try all the everpure line. I really like them. Great shampoos and conditioner. Nice smell, great packing and awesome price.</li>
    <li> trust me.. try it, best thing to happen to my hair after trying all other expensive conditioners available in market</li>
    <li> This smells great but it just did not work. My hair is thick and frizzes very easily so I was pretty excited when I saw this product but it ended up doing nothing. Seriously, buy Dove products. Dove is the only brand that has never let me down.</li>
    <li> I noticed a big difference the first time after using this product, tried all kinds of other hair products to control my hair this worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and this is healthier I can relax knowing my hair will be smooth pretty and softer definitely silky and improved over time with continued use. I have long curly hair that Im growing longer I have to take good care of it. This stuff is amazing Thank you God and thank you l&#x27;oreal please do not take this off the market this is better than herbal essences and Dove. God bless you all and have a nice day. :D</li>
    <li> Conditioners are supposed to make the hair smooth and untangled and silky... I have used Aveeno brand earlier and this particular product come close to that in performance. I thought L&#x27;Oreal would be good since I had used another conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal in past but this one is a total failure, would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an affordable natural alternative for my frizzy, moody hair and this one gets the job done. Not only did I noticed a huge difference in softness, there was less frizz and my hair smells great all day long. It also keeps my hair from over drying and smelling like chlorine, as I like to swim often. Overall a great and cheap product for those who want less frizzy and more soft hair. I gave it only four stars as the only downside is that it tends to weigh my hair down and my once voluminous thick hair is now flat and thin. I suppose it&#x27;s a sacrifice for soft and frizz free hair.</li>
    <li> I have incredibly thick, wildly curly, very long, colored, damaged, and insanely frizzy curly hair. I have tried nearly every product and gimmick for hair imaginable. I&#x27;ve tried natural remedies, mixing products, only using one product line, and only using expensive salon products. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverSleek line is the best thing I have ever used.   I&#x27;ve been using this product line exclusively for over two months now. I get constant compliments about my hair. My curls are controlled, frizz-free spirals. This product line is border-line miraculous. I have never been so happy with a product. My hair is soft, shiny, smells wonderful, and is more low-maintenance than ever. I shampoo, condition, apply leave-in conditioner and serum to wet hair and then let it air dry. It takes minutes.   My only complaint is that I do wish they would make larger bottles so it would last longer. My hair absorbs massive amounts of product, and while I love wearing it long, it can be an expensive habit. I am a college student, and I&#x27;d like to be able to buy larger quantities at a slightly discounted price.   Overall, this is the best hair product line I have ever used. Honestly, I will never switch again. The shine and softness of my hair continues to improve, and I love that the product is sulfate and silicone free. I cannot recommend this more strongly.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, super damaged and overly chemical treated hair. I already tried many kinds of conditioners but none of them can rescue my hair! I saw this one that is sulfate free so I just wanted to give it a try to see is there any different compared to regular conditioners. To my surprise, this one really made a huge different and it works wonders to rescue my hair along with the shampoo of the same line! It has a really nice light smell too! The only problem I have with this bottle&#x27;s  design is it&#x27;s hard to get the conditioner left in the bottle when it&#x27;s nearly empty. I hope L&#x27;oreal will come up with a much bigger bottle design rather than just this smaller size and with pump so it would be easier!</li>
    <li> Most products, even for curly or wavy hair, are loaded with silicones, so it&#x27;s SO nice to have a good conditioner for curly hair that isn&#x27;t absolute crap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is sulfate-free which is a bonus, but I find that the shampoo in the EverSleek line isn&#x27;t that great.  I like the EverPure shampoos better.  With Eversleek, you can actually co-wash (\\&quot;conditioner-only\\&quot;) your hair.  This means that you can use the conditioner as a shampoo, because there is no silicone to make your hair greasy.  Lots of women with tight curls do this because it adds moisture to their hair, others just think it&#x27;s gross but, when done propery, it really isn&#x27;t.  This is a good product for that.  Other products like this will cost well over 20 bucks a bottle.</li>
    <li> All the products of l&#x27;oreal Also this is very good and comes close to what promises but the L&#x27;oreal has better lines!</li>
    <li> This works so well for curl girl hair!</li>
    <li> I have been using L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free products since they marketed them. Very happy with their other products. Particularly this one is the worst product since- hair feels like dry rope. I did not send them back but trashed them. Please do not waste your money like me.</li>
    <li> wonderful sulfate free conditioner that won&#x27;t make your fizzy. Your hair will just look beautiful.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is good and thick (a lot of other conditioners I tried are watery these days), makes my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> I must say that I am satisfied with the product.  It works well with my hair and leaves it soft and manageable.  It&lt;br /&gt;is just that I can buy it at any CVS or the like.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great product for me - I have straight hair that has become quite frizzy and flyaway as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  This is like a flat iron in a tube!</li>
    <li> OMG! This shampoo and conditioner product team has proven to ba a miracle for my thin yet ultra defiant curly hair! I live in the Seattle area where humidity is constant and I&#x27;ve tried just about everything to fight my thin, unruly curly tresses that never look good. My preference is keep my hair straight, but as we all know, curly hair and humidity always wins. I picked up this shampoo/conditioner set after returning another brand I thought I&#x27;d try (but couldn&#x27;t stand the smell) and I am SO glad I did!!! I felt the difference immediately when combing through my hair after showering, but refrained from being too excited.   As usual, I sectioned my hair off to dry in stages. As I began drying the first section the difference in my hair became obvious...  Normally I would saturate each section in serum to tame the frizz before drying, and then have to reapply the serum afterwards, still in hopes of the best. I&#x27;d then only truly achieve frizz free hair after applying a flat iron, section by section again. This enrire process would easily take an hour+ every day.   Today, with this new system, I not only eliminated the added serum on my hair, but was able to dry it all in less than 15 minutes with only a 2 minute flat iron touch up to straighten a few crown waves; no taming of frizzy hair needed. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair today even after walking throughout downtown in raining weather!  All in all, I&#x27;m SOLD!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner, it smells good (not to much), makes my hair soft and easy to comb through. I will buy this again! The thing I like most about this, is that it doesn&#x27;t contains alcohol.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, and frizzy hair. I had been using Herbal Essences Hello Hydration shampoo and conditioner for the longest time, but decided to switch to sulfate free products to see if it would benefit my curly hair. When I first used it, my hair felt amazingly soft. I was super excited. After about a month of sticking with it (because I didn&#x27;t want to throw away the bottles and waste money), the ends of my hair were so damaged and dry. I had so many split ends from the damage. I was trying to take care of my hair so that I could grow it out, but so much for that. I literally just got a good couple of inches cut off my hair just to salvage it from this horrible disaster.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I treat my hair horribly during the summer--chlorinated pool, in the sun with no hat, the beach, perpetual pony tail, etc.  This conditioner keeps my damage to a minimum and my hair smooth for a fraction the price of salon conditioners designed to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like this as well as I hoped I would. I used all of the products recommended but my hair felt dry and straw like. I love everything I&#x27;ve ever used from L&#x27;Oreal, just not this line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy I decided to try this product. I like how my hair feels and looks. You can watch my review here: [...]</li>
    <li> I use this to smooth my curly color-treated hair.  It feels and smells divine.  I would compare this conditioner to other higher priced brands and I love that it does not contain damaging sulfates.  Colorado tends to be very dry and this conditioner has helped hydrate my scalp and reduces my tendency towards frizz.  I use this conditioner every time I wash my hair and I have noticed no build-up.  I have been growing my hair out for the past year so I sometimes put the conditioner on my hair at night and sleep with it on until I wash my hair in the morning.  It truly makes my hair feel and look  wonderful.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that does not want to behave, is dry and you use a lot of products this is for you without the price tag of professional beauty products!!!! You don&#x27;t need the sulfate in your hair products!!! My hair was very glossy,smooth yet not weighed down! Love this shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> This has a terrible strong perfume.  I had to shampoo it with a different shampoo after it was all dry because my husband and I could not stand the perfume odor.  The shampoo and conditioner both have this same fragrance.  It&#x27;s such a shame because my hair did feel nice and soft but I don&#x27;t want perfume in my hair.  I have tried many brands and only had this problem once before.</li>
    <li> With hair to the back of my knees, and being the hair freak that I am this product is one of the best conditioners you can buy. Silicone&#x27;s coat your hair destroying and possible way for moisture to get into the cuticle, and parbens do the same giving the appearance your hair is healthy but all it is is coated in plastic and heavy waxes, sulfate also does tremendous damage and none of these three ingredients are included in this product. Its hard to adjust to for about a week after that your hair looks completely different.Put this on your must have list.</li>
    <li> I used to work for L&#x27;Oreal, and one of the things I learned is that if you wait long enough, the technology that is in their salon brands (such as L&#x27;Oreal Professional, Kerastase, Redken, etc.) make it to their mass market lines. :)  And being that the company was originally founded by a scientist, they actually do a decent amount of R&amp;D on their products (€857M in R&amp;D across all brands in 2013).  I can&#x27;t say I know which technologies might be in this product, but this is one of the few conditioners I can use that leaves my hair smooth and relatively frizz free (and I have coarse, thick, unruly hair.)  This product doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily, but then again, I try not to apply too much conditioner near my scalp.  It&#x27;s on the thicker side for conditioner and has a fairly mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Smooths hair.  Exactly what I was looking for to add to my rotation.  One of the few loreal conditioners I have found without mineral oil or silicones.  My hair looks nice when I use this.</li>
    <li> My hair got extremely smooth after using this product. Delivery is very fast, I got it three days after making the order online.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product to all of you who want to get your hair smoother.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s extremely thick and heavy.  I don&#x27;t use it more than once a week because it leave my hair heavy and it gets greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I buy this from my local store. I will never use another shampoo or conditioner on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.  Every styling issue I have ever had with my hair is GONE, and I see a major improvement in my hair from a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on how healthy it looks and people are astonished I dye my hair every month and it still looks his way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Cant beat the price for perfect results.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!!!:)</li>
    <li> This makes my hair super sleek and after flat ironing the style holds far longer than with other conditioners. Less frizz and flyways as well. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product has taken on two teen girls with significant chemical damage, and one pre-adolescent with layers and layers of wavy/frizz. So far, reviews are positive from the bathroom squad.</li>
    <li> I used too much and found that it left my hair flat and  oily looking.  But the second time I used a very small amount(this stuff is very rich and dense) and I was extremely pleased with the results.  I found that for my hair that less was more with this particular product. It is now my favorite conditioner.  My hair is soft, shiny, not frizzy in high humidity, and does not tangle after washing.  It is also free of harmful sulfates and also  non-water soluable silicones which cause build up on hair which can then only be removed with sulfate shampoos.</li>
    <li> This has worked great. In the heat and humidity of North Carolina my hair is staying very frizz free. And since I invest a heft amount of money in coloring my hair I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s sulfate free so i feel comfortable leaving it in for a few minutes without risking fade.</li>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair feel light and healthy.  I alternate shampoo and conditioner with a cleansing conditioner (also by L&#x27;Oreal) and couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic silicone free conditioner that leaves my hair soft, smooth and clean.  Try the shampoo as well!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is a very good product. It detangles hair very easily, better than any other brand that I have used.  I highly recommend this great product!</li>
    <li> just used this shampoo for the first time it&#x27;s not bad I guess it&#x27;s nothing spectacular but it smells nice and made my hair very curly/wavy I only bought it because it&#x27;s by L&#x27;Oreal and it&#x27;s sulfate/paraben free it&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s better  than most shampoos I&#x27;ve used smells very lovely!!!</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair as silky as the other cheaper conditioners. Will not be buying again.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this EverSleek line. I was expecting my hair to be silky and smooth, but this left a coarse texture. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair so soft. this is a must</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  Leaves my coarse, curly hair feeling so much smoother!  No parabens, no silicones, no sulfates.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I did try the product. I just can only give it a Ok rating. I used less expensive products. That was as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t use any other conditioners now since I discovered the Loreal sulfate free products.  This one in particular give alot of volume and keeps the frizzies away when it&#x27;s humid or foggy :o)</li>
    <li> One of the best conditioners. My daughter and I use every day.</li>
    <li> I thought I liked this, but the more I used it the more coated my hair felt; and the more unmanageable it became.  I ended having to use a hair clarifying shampoo on my hair several times to get it back into more manageable condition.</li>
    <li> Nice and thick, leave on for a few minutes then rinse. My hair really responded to this product. It was recommended by a friend, as my hairdresser was after me to improve the condition of my hair. This really delivers.</li>
    <li> This line seems too good to be true. My hair is a bit wavy but I don&#x27;t have much of it. These products make it look like I have a head full of smooth, wavy hair! And it lasts for 3 days between washings. No oiliness or grittiness at all. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do it make it shiny looking, but at least it doesn&#x27;t make it look duller. Would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have very thick and long hair.  I have to use a lot of conditioner to make it soft, with this I only have to use a little and it makes my&lt;br /&gt;hair very soft and makes it smell so good!</li>
    <li> I have thick somewhat curly hair (a full curl completes in about 2 inches) and I used this shampoo with conditioner for 3 weeks. There was no difference, my hair was still frizzy and unruly.</li>
    <li> It takes using this product several times before you can tell how great it works. For me, I leave it on a few minutes. It realy does keep the frizzes down.</li>
    <li> I used to get Brazilian blowouts several times a year to smooth my hair, which is normally wavy and frizzy. Since I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I haven&#x27;t had one in over a year. When I straighten my hair in the morning, it says straight all day. Before using this, it would look bad by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> let me begin by saying i&#x27;m a conditioner whore. i worked at a store that sold every major brand of shampoo/conditioner (grocery brands and luxury brands) and since i have super tangly, thick hair, I&#x27;VE TRIED THEM ALL. in the end, i found that l&#x27;oreal made the best conditioners- they detangled &amp; smoothed like nothing else- the l&#x27;oreal vive conditioners were the best, and i used it FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tho the &#x27;vive&#x27; line is still listed on loreal&#x27;s website, but all the major stores (target, walmart, walgreens) seem to have stopped carrying it. this &#x27;eversleek&#x27; line seemed to be what they replaced it with, so i tried two different conditioners in the line- this one, and the one w/ the green label (for chemically damaged hair). they both suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since conditioners start to &#x27;not work&#x27; if you use the same one too much, i always swap out different brands between using l&#x27;oreal vive. example, i&#x27;d use vive, then kerastase, then vive again, then davines, then vive again, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the one other conditioner that measured up to loreal vive was kerastase&#x27;s ciment anti-usure--- and, surprise surprise, it is made by loreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i&#x27;m really disappointed in this line. on top of not smoothing out my hair. the smell of this particular one is SUPER STRONG rosemary mint, and it made me feel kind of sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have thick, tangly hair like me, i&#x27;d highly recommend the kerastase ciment anti-usure and davines momo conditioners. unfortunately, those are salon brands, and must be purchased in salons. evidently there is a whole business that makes fake hair products that look just like the real thing and sell them to grocery stores and amazon at a discount. only salons buy from the actual manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone knows anything about the l&#x27;oreal vive line (and whether it will be officially discontinued), please comment on this and let me know. i&#x27;ve emailed loreal in the past, but got no response.</li>
    <li> I have this on Subscribe and save and I love it! It does what more expensive salon products do at a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal smoothing shampoo and conditioner did not work as well as other sulfate free  products.  I am now using Coppolla sulfate free shampoo and conditioner, and love it!  My daughter is using other products from L&#x27;Oreal...she really likes the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free shampoo and conditioner for volume and body.</li>
    <li> Wow! This really is a weightless anti-frizz conditioner &amp; so cheap! No more $30 conditioners for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, frizz-prone hair that gets weighed down very easily, turning lifeless and lanky, but this conditioner leaves hair feeling smooth with body, even when I straighten it.  I only apply conditioners to the mid-lengths and ends and use EverPure Volume Shampoo on the scalp and I&#x27;ve never been happier with my hair!</li>
    <li> not as good as what i had before but the best i could find</li>
    <li> I ordered this from Amazon, so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to smell it before purchasing. If I&#x27;d smelled it, I never would&#x27;ve bought it! The synthetic perfume smell is way too strong for me to handle. I have really long hair and the perfume permeated my hair. It was just off-putting. If you&#x27;re sensitive to perfumes like I am, you should shy away from this one. As far as how this product works, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than other smooth and sleek conditioners in this price range. If anything, it works not quite as good as others I have tried. It did leave my hair smooth, but I still had a frizz halo.</li>
    <li> This is a great, cheap, sulfate free option. It works great on my frizzy curly hair when nothing else has.</li>
    <li> At first when applying the conditioner it smells very strong and chemical like, fortunately after rinsing it out it smelled more like baby powder which is the fragrance that is left on the hair.  Since this product is silicone free it left my hair somewhat dull and dry. So if you have thick, porous hair and are use to most conditioners that leave the hair glossy this one wont. The only good thing is it did help with frizz.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this and the shampoo and finally used it today. (3/2/14) I didn&#x27;t think much of it. I didn&#x27;t expect much of it. After all, it is just another conditioner Is it perfect? No. Does it feel nice and smell good? Yes. I softens my hair but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I also like the fact that it is sulfate and silicone free. The price isn&#x27;t too bad either. It is 100% Vegan with natural botanicals and oils, so one can&#x27;t go wrong. I used it with the shampoo (see separate review) which was also a good product. I&#x27;m happy. I have fine, straight hair and find it hard to locate natural and/or organic shampoos and conditioners I like that don&#x27;t weight my hair down. For me, this is one I will keep in mind when making shampoo purchases.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me, I like it and the shampoo, as well. I have no problem purchasing it or recommending it to others.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for this product.  It is just too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very good to me.  I just don&#x27;t like that fake over-powering floral smell.</li>
    <li> I love this line of shampoo/conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal.  Use both the shampoo and conditioner together for less frizzy hair and a sleeker look.</li>
    <li> At least I can&#x27;t believe this is my hair. After my first use--I have hair that looks like it does when I get it done at a salon. And I have never been able to replicate my salon results no matter how many times my stylist taught me how and told me what products to buy. I have tried many products from the expensive to the dirt cheap. Well, this takes the cake in my opinion. I know there are still products I haven&#x27;t tried (as new ones come out all the time), but my hair is shinier, bouncier and straighter than I have ever seen it aside from going to the salon. Wow. And...it smells great and fits my budget! I tried Evercreme and it was okay, but this is the bees knees. I just wish I had tried it sooner!</li>
    <li> PERFECT all around !  Quality, ship time, price !!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner. It is good for daily use, I still need a deep conditioner but my hair is pretty dry.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Conditioner because of the reviews.  I really didn&#x27;t like it.  Made my hair feel/look oily.  I have really thick long hair and around the scalp area, it just was heavy and oily feeling.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> second buy! I think my hair is not as fuzzy as before</li>
    <li> Product along with shampoo it made my hair feel like it still hade product in it after it was washed out and dried...very unhappy with it</li>
    <li> Great frizz control, professional product.  Works very well and price is decent.  I live in Florida and it&#x27;s a must have</li>
    <li> This condition leaves my hair feeling super soft and shiny.  I ordered it a second time!</li>
    <li> My hair has a lot of damage from dying it pretty regularly, flat ironing/curling it almost everyday, etc. I&#x27;ve heard great reviews about L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Intense Smoothing Conditioner, so I decided to order it and try it out for myself. I am beyond happy with the results. After one use I saw a HUGE difference in the texture of my hair. It made my hair SO soft, shiny, and as an added bonus it smelled heavenly. It really is an amazing smoothing conditioner. After I run out of the bottle of shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;m using, I rotate to another shampoo/conditioner that I like so my hair doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;get used to&amp;#34; the same products and create build-up. When I run out of this I&#x27;ll be disappointed but will DEFINITELY keep it in rotation and continue to repurchase it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah&lt;br /&gt;hustlababy09.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> I ordered these 3 items as a hair treatment to replace my Brazilian blowout products and Matrix SleekLook. They didn&#x27;t even come close to being able to smooth my hair during shampooing in the shower or during blow drying with a round brush. The flat iron didn&#x27;t help. My hair felt coarse and full of fly always. I was surprised since this is the same company that makes Kerastase. I returned all 3, the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in creme. I have thick, curly, long, coarse hair that normally blows out straight with the right products. I re-ordered Kerastase Oleo Relax and Slim. It&#x27;s much more expensive but works every time. Maybe this product is for thinner, lightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good hair conditioner and I believe I have found it.  I would recommend this product to anyone who has issues with split ends</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner for people with color treated, dry or damaged hair. Can be a little heavier so you must balance every day use. I like to rotate it with my other conditioner (Terax). This is also a good leave on for 30 mins and rinse in treatments.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris products made in USA are the best in the world. If you don&#x27;t like to have a problems with your hear or skin,never buy made in the West Europe or worse is only from Russia.</li>
    <li> Works ok, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again though</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this...based on some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read.  Picked it up at CVS (and yes, my hair does respond well in general to Sulfate-free Shampoos.)  My hair - btw - is fine, slightly wavy and cursed by frizz.  Honestly, this stuff really did nothing special.  General shampoos like Garnier were just as good.  So far, the best poo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used it Rockstar.  Though that isn&#x27;t the magic bullet I&#x27;m looking for, either.  But this?  Definitely not a recommend....</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but with the climate I live in, it gets really dry and I get a lot of flyaways.  I thought this stuff would do well, since other straightening balms work ok on my hair, and it did, but it left my hair feeling really heavy and greasy.  Normally, I wash my hair every-other day, but I can&#x27;t get away with that after using this stuff.  I have to wash it by the end of the day or it looks dirty.  I have learned to only use it sparingly on the underside of my hair, where I get some frizz, but not anywhere near my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice smell, and its sulfate free.  If you have thick and kind of frizzy hair, this would most likely work well for you.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is sulfate free, smells really good and makes my hair easy to comb out when wet.</li>
    <li> When I use this conditioner, my hair becomes sooooooo flowey and soft. I use this conditioner every time I wash my hair .</li>
    <li> I have had better for less money. It has a funky smell too. I can handle just about anything (as long as it&#x27;s not that patchouli oil) but this just rubs me the wrong way.....can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s gone!</li>
    <li> It makes your scalp oily.</li>
    <li> I use this once or twice a week as I like to mix up my hair products so my hair does not get used to any one thing.  Smooths my long, curly hair pretty well.</li>
    <li> I am a 3c curly haired African American with a cabinet full of hair care products that failed to deliver.  L&#x27;Oreal eversleek line makes my curls form into boing boing curls and make my hair soft and shiny.  Love this product along with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> So I am in my twenties and I have hair of approximately 12 inches. When at home I noticed this stuff in our bathroom so I tried it and had to buy it after. It makes your hair feel so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-The softness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;-Nothing</li>
    <li> Bought this with the conditioner. It left my hair very tangled! I lost a lot of hair trying to detangle it.</li>
    <li> I have very course, long hair and this works great. Its smoothing and I love the fact that its sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I was purchasing high end salon products for $20-30 per bottle. I would typically switch brands a few times a year as the affects would seem to wear off after a while or I would get bored with the product. I find this conditioner to be on par with or better than those products. I have now been using this conditioner exclusively (or others from this same line) for over a year and I have abandoned all other brands. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a decent conditioner for the price.  It has a light smell, which I appreciate it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference to my hair, but it gets the job done for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This is a decent conditioner, although there are a lot of similar products out there (including a few from L&#x27;Oreal). Being sulfate-free, it is safe for color-treated hair, which I appreciate. I like that it is free of parabens and synthetic dyes, as well. It also doesn&#x27;t have any silicones, which are often featured in &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; sorts of hair products, so this could be good to try if you are looking to avoid those. You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a fragrance but I find it to be pleasant and not too strong. (The fragrance doesn&#x27;t stay with you after you rinse it out, either.) The conditioner rinses out without leaving residue. One thing I really did like about this conditioner was that it was so easy to apply and distribute throughout my hair. It really did make my hair soft and smooth, both in the shower and later when I got out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and waist-length and somewhere between wavy and straight. This seemed fine for my hair texture. It did not leave my hair oily (though I never put conditioner on my scalp, only on the length of my hair). I do think it helped lock in some moisture. In the end, this is one of many good conditioners I&#x27;ve tried in the last year, there&#x27;s just nothing that makes it really stand out above the crowd for me.</li>
    <li> I buy a lot of pretty pricey shampoos and conditioners in the quest to find good paraben and sulfate free products that don&#x27;t harm my long hair. This stuff is great--definitely tames fly-aways and makes my long hair look straighter without weighing it down.</li>
    <li> Weird smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky as I would like.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it says it will. I get this through the subscribe and save program. If you are wondering if this program is something you&#x27;d like to try I say go for it. I get the shampoo and conditioner and am never disappointed</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair moisturized and soft. I&#x27;ve got very dry, coarse hair which I treat with Brazilian Keratine. A friend recommended this product and now I&#x27;m totally hooked!</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner (and the shampoo) and think both are a good value for the money.  The scent is pleasant and my hair really does seem smoother and more manageable.  This line has made a believer out of me when it comes to sulphate free products.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite conditioners.  Awesome product and sulfate free, which is important to me.  Works great on my tangled hair.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this because I was using a Keratin straightening treatment and I needed a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to retain the keratin as long as possible. I LOVE this so much I have continued to use this even after my treatment has worn off. The one thing I did notice is that without sulfates, the natural oils your scalp produces to nourish your hair does not wash out as easily as with sulfate shampoos. However, my hair has never looked greasy or oily. I LOVE the scent. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and have even tried to talk some shampoo companies into making a fragrance-free items. However, the scent is pleasant with this brand and I have received many compliments on how &amp;#34;good I smell.&amp;#34; Always a plus. :)</li>
    <li> Love the way this product makes my hair feel and smell.  I have so many natural curls now that I don&#x27;t have product weighing them down.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy feeling like the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz, then try this product. It&#x27;ll make your hair feel like straw. I guarantee it. Just awful stuff. If you have color treated hair in need of moisture, this isn&#x27;t the shampoo for you. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> my bestie had this and i tried it. the result is better than all my other organic stuff. i stop using all my other organic stuff that&#x27;s pure organic so im been using this conditioner with my organic shampoo. I guess I used to use alot of hydration type of conditioner which didn&#x27;t do any to my asian dyed hair. and this works better and less tangle. I also switch conditioner every other time, I switch it with TRESemme Smooth &amp; Silky Conditioner. It took me awhile but I wish I discovery all these &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; type of hair care sooner &#x3D;) So its good for frizz and wave hair, asian type hair</li>
    <li> Horrible conditioner, makes my hair sticky and greasy after using it. Worst conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried. I just use it to shave now and can&#x27;t wait for the day this conditioner is out of my shower</li>
    <li> Always use the Loreal Smoothing products!  My daughter and I both have long, coarse, curly, thick, hair and these products work great on our hair type.</li>
    <li> I use this quite often (order thru subscribe and save to get monthly!) as this helps with breakage and also keep my hair smooth and looking shiny! I would def recommend!</li>
