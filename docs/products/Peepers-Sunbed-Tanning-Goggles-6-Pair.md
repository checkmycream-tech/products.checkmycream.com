      <li>Great deal on tanning goggles works fine for me.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping, great price</li>
      <li>i works great and very reasonably priced too.</li>
      <li>we have one set of eyes better pertect them..</li>
      <li>and all is well :)</li>
      <li>Glad I did so that I can keep one in my gym bag and another with me just in case I need it.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried, these goggles are a perfect fit, and they don&#x27;t allow any light to peak through to sides.</li>
      <li>They hold up well and were cheap.</li>
      <li>comfortable, protects eyes</li>
      <li>These fit the bill.</li>
      <li>reasonable and great product and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Work great and cheap now if my family goes to tanning bed without eye protection they get in trouble.</li>
      <li>The nose bridge is quite high, eliminating a tan line across the top of your nose.</li>
      <li>Much safer!!</li>
      <li>These little goggles are great.  </li>
      <li>Either way, these are nice little &amp;#34;goggles&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t impede the suntan but keep the headaches away after sitting in the sun for 30 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping...</li>
      <li>I figured I might as well get the multipack since it cost just about as much as just one.</li>
      <li>I have been afraid to float in the pool, but last summer I bought these, and they worked great!</li>
      <li>these are the old fashioned goggle that we used to buy.  </li>
      <li>great price, cost at least ten times less than in retail stores.</li>

<li> The dumb rubber string keeps falling off at the worst time.</li>

    <li> Quick shipping, great price</li>
    <li> Great product. They hold up well and were cheap. If you attempt to buy these else where you will pay around $5 a pair</li>
    <li> these are the old fashioned goggle that we used to buy.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like wearing sun glasses when basking in the sun.  These fit the bill.</li>
    <li> i works great and very reasonably priced too. I definitely will recommend this to others</li>
    <li> it works and they are well made. I will only use these. I have been indoor tanning for 20 years and have always used eye protection. I am not a fanatic about tanning, just serious about protecting my eyes</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> Work great and cheap now if my family goes to tanning bed without eye protection they get in trouble.</li>
    <li> I know these are for sunbed tanning, but I needed to protect my eyes when I sit in my driveway to catch some rays. I experimented with one pair and painted flowers over the little lenses. Either way, these are nice little &amp;#34;goggles&amp;#34; that don&#x27;t impede the suntan but keep the headaches away after sitting in the sun for 30 minutes or so. I would advise you to look into any reasons one is not supposed to wear them outside, but they have worked for me short term.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR MY ESTHETICS BUSINESS, GREAT PRICE</li>
    <li> These are perfect - price is great and they are first quality.  Nice to have a pair wherever I need them!</li>
    <li> The dumb rubber string keeps falling off at the worst time. But it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and protects my eyes. I figured I might as well get the multipack since it cost just about as much as just one. Glad I did so that I can keep one in my gym bag and another with me just in case I need it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Even when I move my head the goggles do not fall off.</li>
    <li> Compared to other brands I&#x27;ve tried, these goggles are a perfect fit, and they don&#x27;t allow any light to peak through to sides. The nose bridge is quite high, eliminating a tan line across the top of your nose. I opted to purchase the 6 pair lot for less than the price of 2 individual pairs.</li>
