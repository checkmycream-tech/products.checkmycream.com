<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is my third fragrance I purchase by J.S. and I love this one just as much as the original Fancy and Fancy You.</li>
    <li> Everywhere I go, people stop and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. This perfume is a hit with all the women in my family! Soft fragrance. I have reordered!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume and everytime I wear it; I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> This is my third time buying this perfume. It has a very soft scent and it lasts a long time. I get a lot of good compliments with this perfume.</li>
    <li> That would be a yes. I am not big on very strong smells or marinate on perfume like some people that sometimes just over do it. I get major headaches. All I can tell you about this perfume is that I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments with it sometimes after a while I don&#x27;t even smell it on me anymore, but people still do which is always a plus when your out. I do recommend this perfume, but when it comes to scents everybody is different so I don&#x27;t expect everybody to feel the same way. I would say this is more of a daytime smell and some would say perfect smell for spring, but I wear it all the time that is how much I love it.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves this perfume. I found it and the seller shipped it quickly, great price and came just as advertised. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I placed an order for a product on December 4th and followed up in January with two emails.  I never received a response.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I Love the smell of this fragrance however with this particular set the scent only lasts about two hours. I purchased this fragrance from a top retail store and the scent lasted the entire day.</li>
    <li> If you have not received your purchased yet and are trying to contact Amazon, but Amazon is not responding to you question...CONTACT DIRECTLY customer.service@perfumania.com.   They just got back to me after forwarding them my emails to Amazon regarding about my purchase. They were able to look up my order and provided me with the tracking number. Finally, what a relief!</li>
    <li> It was great gift set. The price was much less than what I paid for it at one of the retail stores. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a friend. Apparently I got a great deal. She told that she buys the small perfume because it is so expensive.</li>
    <li> Great scent!,&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Have to order some more, don&#x27;t want to run out!&lt;br /&gt;Love, love love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! have used it for a few years. I gave it out as Christmas gifts. Recipients loved it as well.</li>
    <li> It arrived in a timely fashion, and my aunt really loves the set.</li>
    <li> it was a gift for daughter she loves it</li>
    <li> purchased this as a gift for my friend and she loves she is planning on getting another bottle she thinks such great quality fragrance might go out of stock soon</li>
    <li> THIS ITEM IS FAKE SO DO NOT BUY!!&lt;br /&gt;I have smelled this perfume so many times and has used it, but this is FAKE, nowhere near the smell of the original one. and if you are giving it as a gift then definitely do not buy this as the receiver of the gift will think you have such poor taste..&lt;br /&gt;VERY DISAPPOINTED!! BAD SMELL... WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love through fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was on time.&lt;br /&gt;very pleased.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing the wifey and her friends love it. Smells like a stripper but a high class one. Kinda like one you may encounter in Vegas.</li>
    <li> I loved this perfume, I think I&#x27;ll buy for my girlfriend, I am a man and women they like smell that fragrance.</li>
    <li> I HESTITATED PURCHASING PERFUME, BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT.&lt;br /&gt;THE PRODUCT WAS IN FACT THE REAL JESSICA SIMPSON PERFUME, PACKAGING WAS PERFECT, I WOULD MOST DEFINETELY PURCHASE ITEMS AGAIN</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall how I discovered this perfume. Perhaps it was one of those inserts in a magazine. I just know that as soon as I smelled it, I loved it. It&#x27;s not overpowering, like some fragrances can be. It&#x27;s light and sweet and fresh. When you&#x27;re standing in line at the grocery store, waiting to check out, and a total stranger comments that you smell good, you know you made the right choice.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a great size for a great price!  After receiving this scent for Xmas one year, I fell in love with this scent.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I never buy products because of a celeb&#x27;s name-- in fact, I avoid them. This scent however, is wonderful. Every time I wear it I get compliments. Great price, and fast delivery by amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother for xmas, and she loves it not only did it come sooner then I expected, but with all kinds of really kool and nice samples!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SCENT, I HAVE WORN IT FOR YEARS, MY GRANDKIDS ASSOCIATE IT TO ME.  IT IS VERY SOFT AND GENTLE. THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR OR A ROOM WITH OVERWHEMING PERFUME SOMEONE WEARS.  I GET NOTHING BUT COMPLIMENTS ON THIS SCENT BY JESSICA SIMPSON.  I HOPE IT IS NEVER DISCONTINUED.  I WEAR IT DAILY. WHEN YOU WEAR THE SAME SCENT OF PERFUME DAILY YOUR NOSE CANNOT DETECT HOW &amp;#34;LOUD&amp;#34; YOUR PERFUME CAN BE. MY SISTER IS ALLERGIC TO PERFUME, BUT HAVE NEVER HEARD HER COMPLAIN ABOUT IT EITHER ... SO PLEASE ALSO BE AWARE OF HOW &amp;#34;LOUD&amp;#34; YOUR SCENT IS TO NOT OFFEND OR MAKE ANYONE SENSITIVE FEEL ILL</li>
    <li> Rápida entrega, excelente manejo y embalaje de la mercancía. La fragancia como tal es exquisita, ampliamente recomendado. Vendedor serio, responsable y dedicado.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift to my caregiver. She loves it &amp; I love the way scent she puts into the home when using it.</li>
