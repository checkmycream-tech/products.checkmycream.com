      <li>and it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, it was the correct model.</li>
      <li>This is great for a long trip...</li>
      <li>days worth of rx will fit for sure... really large sections, perfectly secure.</li>
      <li>The 2XL size is good for patients who are moderately medicated.</li>
      <li>I have a seven day holder and it works just fine, but the 14 day unit is a real pain.  </li>
      <li>After it is filled, it is OK and does not accidentally open during travel.</li>
      <li>I took the lock piece out - slides right out.  </li>
      <li>Price was right and item seems to work as described.</li>
      <li>This item is great to have if you have small children, or travel with medications.  </li>
      <li>Huge pill dispenser and with an 85 year old mother</li>
      <li>Love filling up enough for two weeks instead of one.  </li>
      <li>2 hinges broke the first week of use.  </li>
      <li>Good pill holder but was too small for what I needed</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s large, really large.  </li>
      <li>Each section is large and will hold up to 14-16 pills/capsules.</li>
      <li>I ended up returning these (I purchased 4) because they are too big for what I needed but the shipping and quality were just fine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Caution:  if you have painful, arthritic hands, or weak fingers, think twice before choosing this model--there is a good chance the lock, which requires pressing a spring-loaded release button while opening a cell, would require more pressure than you&#x27;re comfortable applying, and it requires good coordination with both hands.</li>
      <li>Big squares to fit a bunch of pills.  </li>
      <li>Shipped FAST</li>
      <li>I had one of these for many years but when the letters started to wear, I got a different brand and passed the old one on to my dog&#x27;s meds -- bone strengthener &amp; an antihistamine.</li>
      <li>Container is a decent size, and can fit a number of regular sized pills.</li>
      <li>The locking feature is easy to use and hinders curious fingers.  </li>
      <li>&amp; my elderly mother was in a tiz about how she would be able to take enough pills to last.  </li>
      <li>Thanks for a decent simple product.</li>
      <li>It is a little larger that I wanted, and the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but those are my own impressions.  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I watch my 18 mth old granddaughter during the day.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I call these the old people organizers.  </li>
      <li>I have an exact look-a-like product purchased from a local pharmacy that recently broke a hinge - after about 5 years of daily use!  </li>
      <li>Alas, the new pill container has a push-down latch on each day, so they easily came open, which isn&#x27;t a problem on the Ezy Dose</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this because I watch my 18 mth old granddaughter during the day.  I need my pills on the counter so I remember to take them.  What&#x27;s good about this pill organizer?  The locking feature works great.  You can open one (to take a pill) or all the compartments in the row (to refill).  What&#x27;s not so good?  It&#x27;s large, really large.  The &amp;#34;XL&amp;#34; on the description didn&#x27;t click with me when I ordered it.  However I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple months and it&#x27;s working fine.  So, I&#x27;m keeping it.</li>
    <li> Difficult to open and manuever.  Frankly was disappointed.</li>
    <li> It was my fault for not reading the description and buying a locking pill box, but the product itself only deserves 2 stars. To open the box I have to push the button until my finger is sore, and then the wrong doors pop open. Annoying and more trouble than convenient.</li>
    <li> Perfect for added safety.  The locking feature is easy to use and hinders curious fingers.  It&#x27;s probably not entirely childproof but it will help.  Also, the locking feature adds a bit of security in preventing spills if accidentally dropped.  A nice added feature.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t seem to find this item locally, but here it was on Amazon.  It was initially annoying to receive extended shipping and delivery times, but it was shipped almost immediately and arrived almost as fast as if it was coming from Amazon, itself.</li>
    <li> A little too big but it works fine.</li>
    <li> I like that this has enough spots for a week and AM/PM.  And if you are a business traveler, the lock will help it from coming open while in your bags.</li>
    <li> Not arthritis friendly-a bit disappointed!</li>
    <li> The individual lids will not stay open for filling.  I have to use 3 or 4 rubber bands to hold one side&#x27;s lids to the other sides&#x27;s lids to fill the compartments.  I have a seven day holder and it works just fine, but the 14 day unit is a real pain.  After it is filled, it is OK and does not accidentally open during travel.</li>
    <li> Huge pill dispenser and with an 85 year old mother, that is a good thing.  I had to take the locking device off, so I didn&#x27;t use that feature.  The rest of it was perfect.</li>
    <li> These are very big! but nicely made.</li>
    <li> I could no longer find these in the local pharmacy where I had purchased two others. Fortunately, it was the correct model. The 2XL size is good for patients who are moderately medicated. I use one row of pockets for AM and one for PM, so each container serves my needs for one week--not two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used these on trips for at least two years now, having tired of the tendency for non-locking pill organizers to spill their contents while in transit--especially when handled by TSA personnel.  They work, and they last well for a plastic product. Be careful to hold the unit firmly while closing the lids.  If you don&#x27;t, it will abruptly pivot over and throw pills all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  if you have painful, arthritic hands, or weak fingers, think twice before choosing this model--there is a good chance the lock, which requires pressing a spring-loaded release button while opening a cell, would require more pressure than you&#x27;re comfortable applying, and it requires good coordination with both hands. There is one release button for each row of seven compartments.</li>
    <li> This pill reminder is an excellent product for individuals who are young and have children around who might &amp;#34;raid&amp;#34; pills.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is too large for me as well as bit too difficult to open.</li>
    <li> This is great for a long trip... 2+ days worth of rx will fit for sure... really large sections, perfectly secure.</li>
    <li> Big and locks, just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Wow. Need instructions on hOw to use😱 not for the elderly.</li>
    <li> I call these the old people organizers.  It is a little larger that I wanted, and the locking mechanism isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but those are my own impressions.  Item received as described, and in good condition.  No complaints at all.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Great Idea, but I didnt know you had to unlock it every time you used it</li>
    <li> This is very big and holds all my vitamins and supplements.&lt;br /&gt;Items as described by seller.  On time delivery</li>
    <li> I use this every day, I love that it locks so my daughter cannot get into the medications.  Works great and keeps me on schedule with my vitamins!</li>
    <li> This was the only child - resistant multi-day pill container we could find.  Price was right and item seems to work as described.</li>
    <li> This item is great to have if you have small children, or travel with medications.  The lock device is easy to navigate and the pills don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for many years but when the letters started to wear, I got a different brand and passed the old one on to my dog&#x27;s meds -- bone strengthener &amp; an antihistamine. Alas, the new pill container has a push-down latch on each day, so they easily came open, which isn&#x27;t a problem on the Ezy Dose; it has a safety latch.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m back.  Thanks for a decent simple product.</li>
    <li> Love filling up enough for two weeks instead of one.  Big squares to fit a bunch of pills.  I took the lock piece out - slides right out.  Lids click and stay shut.</li>
    <li> We were going on a cruise that was going to have us 16 days gone &amp; my elderly mother was in a tiz about how she would be able to take enough pills to last.  This was &amp; still is a Godsend.  Great tool!</li>
    <li> Good pill holder but was too small for what I needed</li>
    <li> This is a great pill carrier. Each section is large and will hold up to 14-16 pills/capsules. I use it every day and will order another one to have as a backup.</li>
    <li> 2 hinges broke the first week of use.  I have an exact look-a-like product purchased from a local pharmacy that recently broke a hinge - after about 5 years of daily use!  Unfortunately, it has been discarded, so I cannot compare the branding in this review.  The Ezy Dose product is obviously not the same quality as my previous item.</li>
    <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s very large and it has a great locking system to keep from spilling out everything accidentally. Shipped FAST</li>
    <li> Container is a decent size, and can fit a number of regular sized pills. The locking mechanism probably needs more polish as it can get stuck easily. I just removed the locking mechanism. Besides that it works well as a pill organizer/reminder.</li>
    <li> I ended up returning these (I purchased 4) because they are too big for what I needed but the shipping and quality were just fine.</li>
    <li> Been looking for one of these for a while. The option of letting the lock mechanism stay in place for travel or taking it out is a nice option.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my father in law and he truly loves it. The quality was really good. I dont regret it</li>
