<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> I think this items was expired, I did not work at all.</li>
    <li> it is a great product, leaves your hair feeling silky smooth and gives you volume.. when you are using the product the smell isnt great but once you wash it off it leave no smell behind..</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I expected. I was kind of disappointed</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m fairly new with the Nioxin System my hair has already seen some visible improvements. My main concern with this product is that it contains SLS, (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) which is a harsh detergent that can aggravate hair loss- so what I did was I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap for Shampoo and the Hair Therapy + Hair Treatment. I stopped using the Nioxin Shampoo and I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
    <li> My husband started seeing new hair growth after one month.  No drugs, just total scalp care is doing the trick.  Use all three products as directed.</li>
    <li> used it 4 times already, and no noticible difference</li>
    <li> . . . . after faithfully following the instructions (sigh).  I still see stray hairs in the basin every day and notice more and more thinning  - even though my hair dressers doesn&#x27;t seem to share my concern.  Based on my experience, I say try another brand or accept the thinning.  I haven&#x27;t yet decided what I will try next.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to bite the bullet.</li>
    <li> Love! I&#x27;ve been using this for over 6 months and it definitely helps my hair grow fast!!!! I&#x27;ve used soo many hair products for thickness and length and this is by far the best.  I have very long, fine, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Never try this product.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it after reading few reviews, unfortunately I started losing hairs after applying Nioxin on hairs for couple of weeks and so immediately stopped using it. Am seeing doctor now following for hair fall :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation - don&#x27;t try unless u consult to doctor.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product after being told by friend that her dermatologist recommended it for her thinning hair. My hair is thinning due to medication &amp; age.  Started using the product and noticed my hair felt softer and looked fuller almost immediately.  The cleanser (shampoo) is a larger bottle than the conditioning bottle, so you will run out of it before the shampoo. It is a good \\&quot;try-it\\&quot; size before going for the larger product packages, which I plan on doing next.  The shampoo/conditioner smell wonderful of peppermint and will make your scalp tingle in a nice way.  I also used this product shortly after I had colored my hair and did not notice any significant color loss.  Also on the plus side, the product was much cheaper on Amazon than in the area salons I checked with.</li>
    <li> so far it has worked for me. my hair is thinker and stronger. i dyed my hair red and I still have the color it hasnt really faded</li>
    <li> Have used this product before and like it&#x27;s quality and results. This purchase gets 5 stars for price and also size of the bottles, conditioner a little smaller ( I always have more conditioner when I use up the shampoo!) Went out of town w/o Nioxin, used hotel shampoo, not a pretty sight!</li>
    <li> I have to say these products really help your hair being stronger and better looking</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER IS A HAIR DRESSER  AND RECOMMENDED THIS FOR THINNING HAIR.  IT SEEMS TO WORK BUT DON&#x27;T US IT EVERY WASHING AS IT DRIES YOUR HAIR.  I ALTERNATE WITH A CONDITIONING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.  GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I bought this system for my mother whose hair is thinning.  At this time, she has used it for about a month.  She says her hair is softer, but has not necessarily noticed a &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; of her hair.  She&#x27;ll be trying it a while longer to see if the results change.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty decent from what I can tell. Didnt help with &amp;#34;thickness&amp;#34; of my hair but is helping my hair grow</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 1 month now, I&#x27;m not sure if it really works but the last step of this you use kind of as a head massage while your hair is still WET. The bad thing is the wherever it gets on your face or forehead will be bright red for about 45 min.  They said this is working and to just make sure that you allow enough time for the redness to disappeaer before you go anywhere......what???  I will use it up but won&#x27;t buy anymore!</li>
    <li> Perfect one , for sick scalp specially</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would start to see results after a month of at least something. No regrowth, no nothing. Left my hair feeling scratchy and the tingle wasn&#x27;t very tingly as described. The scalp treatment was confusing as it was a hard squirt, not a spray so you ended up with a saturated area in your hair since it was such a concentrated spray. Switched to Bosley line after trying this. Will see if I get better results.</li>
    <li> This is some of the best shampoo I have found in a while.  My stylist recommended it and at 30 dollars a bottle at the salon, I passed.  Found it on Amazon for much cheaper.  After about 3 weeks of using it I notice a significant difference in the texture of my hair.  It was breaking a lot from all of the chemicals I had been using, and it finally has stopped!  Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Not in love with the smell of it like some of the other users. It does seem to work well and I do have new hair growth.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid Nioxin user for 10 years now. It does wonders in all of the departments that it claims, but one unmarked benefit is that it helps my hair grow a significant amount in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;As a hula dancer, long hair is very important, and I learned about Nioxin as a \\&quot;trick of the trade\\&quot;. I also am a fan of haircuts which does not benefit hula hair, so I make sure to start a nioxin system before any show/competition/tour to make sure my hair is back in full effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed growth from 1/2\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; with the smaller bottle systems, and up to 3\\&quot; with the large (like, costco size) bottles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to find the system that works for you, i think they even have a tool thing on their website. When you use it and well after, you feel a cool, minty, clean tingle all over your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend nioxin to anyone who wants to improve their hair!</li>
    <li> So I got this because I thought I had a genetic disposition to thinning hair as it was getting pretty bad.  It seemed like it was worse on this but could have simply been the fact I had an underlying condition causing the hair loss.</li>
    <li> I started using this in conjunction with a biotin and multivitamin regimen; also, some hypo-thyroid medication.  The one-two-three punch has stopped my hair from falling out.  However, regarding the shampoo system, I like how it cleans, and I like how it has thickened my hair.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that before with another type of shampoo, and honestly, that does go a long way when you&#x27;ve lost quite a bit (I don&#x27;t know if this would be a bonus to men, but for women, I suspect it is).  I will continue to use it.  I don&#x27;t think it is a miracle worker, but it sure helps, and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this system going on 2 weeks, but I do have to say my hair feels a little thicker and longer.  I am also noticing some baby hairs around the front of my hairline.  This sample system doesnt give enough product as I am not all the way to the 2 week mark and it is running extremely low.  I ordered another one to keep up the routine in hopes to see bigger better changes.  So far so good.  The smell is minty and does tingle but in a good way.</li>
    <li> I admit, after years of hearing about this product, I had high expectations.  This shampoo is a glorified volume enhancer, nothing more.  In fact, it dried out my hair so badly, I had to have half of it cut off.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Hair is still shedding horribly. Going to try the Ovation advertised on the radio next before I&#x27;m bald!!</li>
    <li> This was a waste of $26. I bought it and even have all full bottles of the 3 step system and can&#x27;t return because it has expired. Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier and was 1/2 cost of purchasing it at salon. I will definately order this product again if I can obtain the same price.</li>
    <li> The leave in scalp therapy, not only durnt my scalp but also the other skin on my body where it dripped. there was no warning of this in the packaging or instruction leaflet.  I will not use or recommend to anyone again.</li>
    <li> Ive heard great things about Nioxin. I was skeptical. I am 27 years old and my hair has always been thin and now, after having 3 kids, its falling out like crazy and I hate the lifeless, thin hair that is on my head. I was debating a wig, or scalp powder, but I figured I would give this a try first. I am glad I did! I have been using it for a few weeks now and my hair definately has more volume, and less breakage. I am even seeing some baby hairs growing in around my hairline. I am thrilled! When you wash your hair, the second step is cooling. Just like toothpaste cools your mouth, this stuff cools your scalp, its weird and I like it! The last step though, I have found that if it drips down my face, or gets on my skin anywhere, it leaves a spot that looks like I was burnt. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, just looks strange. For the results, I will deal with it.</li>
    <li> Great feel on my scalp and wonderful texture to my hair after every use. Now if only Nioxin would bring back their Root Lifter I would be able to get all my hair products from one source!</li>
    <li> My butician recommended it to help with my thinning hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results! Excellant product!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.  My hair finally has volume.</li>
    <li> they are soft at to the touch, AT FIRST. clips are good, slip alittle....&lt;br /&gt;the hair seriously sheds EVERYWHERE , ALLLLLDAYYYY!!!! it&#x27;s almost humiliating to where&lt;br /&gt;it in public. doesn&#x27;t really blend well with hair. other than that, i guess it looks natural.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results yet and I have been using the product for over 6 weeks now. It smells and feels good but no change on the hair.</li>
    <li> Did not make my hair thicker, or regrow.  Smells good though.</li>
    <li> first off let&#x27;s just say the price here on Amazon is significantly cheaper then Ulta. however, My girlfriend did not really notice any difference. She is Asian with that Asian here and was told by others it was great. However, she did not notice any significant difference for the price.</li>
    <li> I used the package for color treated hair and followed the instructions.  This product made my hair very dry.  I used the conditioner as well and my hair was dull and dry.  As far as the treatment, I didn&#x27;t see any real improvement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months now and absolutely love it!  It has definitely made a difference in the thinning spots on the top of my head.  A friend recommended this because it worked so well for her and I have not been let down.  It works great for me!  And I will use this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I have used this system and the #4.  After a month there is a noticeable difference in the thickness and density of my hair on the crown.  I highly recommend this product line!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than regular shampoo and conditioner.  May have dried out my scalp a little, which is not a positive.</li>
    <li> I got this product because my hair was thinning and very brittle.  I am hypothyroid and that causes thinning, dry, brittle hair and the medication I have to use for it makes it even worse.  I have been using this product  for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it.  My hair seems thicker, especially in the area around my forehead (bangs area), and it is so soft now.  Before I started using it the ends of my hair were so dry.  I will continue to use it.  The only issue I have with the system is the size of the conditioner, it should be the same size as the shampoo.  I&#x27;m already almost out of the conditioner and have over half the bottle of shampoo left.</li>
    <li> This product is great for thinning hair, is much more expensive in hair salons.  This works for both sexes, I buy it for my son.</li>
    <li> This Seems To Be A Good Product! I Will Be More Specific On The Next Review. D. Hinson.</li>
    <li> Its great after washing but my hair is still dropping though. Lets see in another month or so to verify how great the product is</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really makes my hair feel thicker. Just wish the conditioner was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> It cleans my scalp excellently but makes hair frizzy for the first day</li>
    <li> I find this to be a very effective product. I&#x27;m aging and find that my hair is slowly falling out. This product stopped the lost and I feel very secure now that I am using it.</li>
    <li> I love them very very much I hope it do what it says it will do help thicken and help grow my back my hair.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery,  great product</li>
    <li> The Nioxin shampoo and conditioner work really well, and leave your hair very clean and healthy looking. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for hair loss, but I certainly don&#x27;t think it hurts to use them, given all the beneficial ingredients in them. On the other hand, the scalp treatment and I do not get along. The burning and itching that occurs after I apply it is crazy. My skin isn&#x27;t usually that sensitive to things, but it definitely is to the scalp treatment. I used it for awhile despite the burning and itching, hoping that my skin would get used to it, but nope, I just had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair and not a lot of it and I noticed my hair felt fuller and stronger after a month of use!</li>
    <li> I have used this product off &amp; on for about 15 years. It does work great &amp; helps my hair look fuller. In fact, the little areas on each side of my forehead where the air was receding now have hair. In the past I have gotten bored with it &amp; found something that smelled better or was organic &amp; switched to it. Results - hair started thinning again. I am back with the Nioxin products to stay.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, due to some immune problems, I had lost a lot of hair.  My Dermatologist recommended Nioxin for scalp stimulation which was supposed to help hair growth. I used it and liked it and my hair did eventually grow back.  However, I don&#x27;t really attribute that hair growth to the shampoo.  That was the result of medication injected right into the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After menopause and going off hormone replacement therapy my hair really began to thin...hated that more than the hot flashes!!!!  I have continued to use the Nioxin because it does give my hair the feel and appearance of more volume.  More so than even some very expensive volumenizing shampoos and conditioners.....I&#x27;ve tried many.  But it does not stimulate hair growth.  My doc has told me I would have to use an actual hair growth product and once you start those it is a &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I give it three stars....it does what I expect it to do but it doesn&#x27;t give me more hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my hair has been falling out for a while now. I have really long hair and the nioxin wasn&#x27;t enough to last me a month, so I ended up using it more like every other day to make it last. I don&#x27;t see that much difference in my hair, it definitely doesn&#x27;t look or feel thicker.</li>
    <li> Love this product and the price was great!</li>
    <li> love the way my hair feels and looks</li>
    <li> I bought this product, because my hair was thinning on the sides, and someone suggested Nioxin 3.  They swore this product would do the trick.  I looked at the other reviews, and felt the good outweighed the bad.  Maybe it worked for the other reviewers, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to improve my hair at all.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather much, and I didn&#x27;t like the minty smell.  I also didn&#x27;t like the conditioner or scalp treatment.  The Nioxin also burned by scalp, so I am going to try something else.  I am totally unhappy with this purchase, and will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is like no other, it definitely makes my hair feel and look healthier. My hair is naturally curly and this product has made them stand out. I also do see that my edges have baby hairs coming out butit really didn&#x27;t stop my hair from falling off... But overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> It makes hair soft but i also combine it with little argon oil i notice some difference in hair not being thin i roccomend nioxin 4 for thinning</li>
    <li> Would be great if the 3rd leave in treatment didn&#x27;t give me welts everywhere my hair drips. As far as it helping my hair not fall out I think its done the trick but I guess something in it bothers my skin. It says in the instructions that it could cause tingling but I don&#x27;t think this is a normal reaction. If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin like I do this stuff works!</li>
    <li> Used for fine/thin hair. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair texture, quality, or shedding. Conditioner didn&#x27;t last very long because you need to use quite a bit of it at a time. Not worth the price. I have used other products that are a lot cheaper that worked just the same. Also this product is difficult to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this product made my hair look fuller or stop thinning, but it definitely made it appear healthier.  I think this system is good for a deep clean and to promote a healthy scalp which is the basis for healthy hair growth.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe, but even my hairdresser commented.  A product I will continue to use, and recommend to others, frequently!!</li>
    <li> I used Nioxin for a week and my hair was like straw, so dry and brittle and was falling out like crazy! I&#x27;d been using Ovation for a few years with great results but wanted to try something less expensive. I&#x27;ve ditched the Nioxin and went back to Ovation</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen hair growth yet, and its been about 3 weeks as the product suggested. I love the way it makes my hair feel though!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I use it because I have to take high powered thyroid medicine and it causes my hair to fall out.  This product makes my hair feel and look thicker!</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner, but made my skin itch, dried skin out. The spray turned my skin red. Had to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;Really don&#x27;t think  I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Heard wonderful things about this product, just got it, so I hope it works for me!</li>
    <li> My sister had the shampoo at home before I purchased this set. I have always had a lot of hair but noticed in past yeat that( coloring hightlights etc) it has gotten thinner. I have used these productsfor about 2 weeks and i can tell a diference. My hairdresser told me my hair feels thicker and softer.. love it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, right price, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Service was good.  Not sure of effectiveness of productl</li>
    <li> Made my hair look thinner and damaged my hair. Dried out my hair, and made it feel like elastic. Had more hair fall out and breakage. My hair felt weak and dry.&lt;br /&gt;And irritated my skin. My back and the back of my neck kept itching and burning. Never again will I ever purchased this product. too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I takes several months to see results but it does work.  My hair is thicker and is not falling out as much.</li>
    <li> Felt a tingling sensation after I used it the first time - need to give it time to work to see if there&#x27;s a difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after having some serious stress related hair loss. It did absolutely nothing for me.  My cousin had/has alopecia and it did help her go from baby butt smooth to full headed.</li>
    <li> Not impressed. I used it for the recommended 30 days but have seen no difference. I feel like I wasted my money. The shampoo and conditioner are nothing special - any shampoo and conditioner will work to clean your hair. The scalp treatment is what you are really buying and it does nothing.  I&#x27;ll stick to products that make my thin hair seem fuller.</li>
    <li> At first, I thought I was to young to use this hair product but it has changed my mind. I notice that I was losing tons of hair one day and my girlfriend told me about this product. I&#x27;ve seen the difference using this shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t loose that much.</li>
    <li> Good price, but under performs</li>
    <li> seems to help my thinning hair</li>
    <li> I have used system 4 but I beleive the problems are the same for the scaplp  treatment with all systems.  Since Nioxin switched from a liquid scalp treatment to their current foam, I have been so disapointed that I am consdering discontinuing it.  The foam sticks to your hair, rather than going directly to the scalp and makes my hair absulutley filthy and oily looking, dittio on the conditioner which I no longer use. The shampoo is fine althout I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvement.  It &#x27;s so bad that I washed my hair one morning and went to a salon to have my hair cut. The operator thought it hadn&#x27;t been washed at all, it looked so greasy.  I told him that I used the scaplp treatment and he said he was familar with the product and agreed that it made people&#x27;s hair dirty.  Nioxin used to have a clear liquid spot treatment for bald areas sold separately, that worked well as did their original scalp treatment with which I never had a problem</li>
    <li> I have always had thin hair on top of my head.  But the older I got the worse it became.  My sister was told by her stylist to try Nioxin and she recommended it to me. I was feeling sorry for myself because after radiation to my throat my thyroid was messed up.  So I have been using this product for some months now and people are really telling me they can see a difference.  I certainly can, because it does not take much time to fix my hair now that i have more to work with.</li>
    <li> It caused major scalp redness after 5 days. Stopped using and I still have itching and redness after a week. I think hair fall stopped for 2-3 days and now its even more than what it was earlier. Do not recommend at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a two weeks or so and so far so good. My hair seems to be doing just fine</li>
    <li> A friend recommended it to me and I am just as pleased as she is. It seems to really give my thinning hair more body.  I don&#x27;t seem to need the other products, just the shampoo. Too limp  with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like the Nioxin products.  I purchased another Nioxin product for Dandruff and liked it a bit better, so when I run out of this, I will return to that.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best product that helps with my hair falling out. Since using it, about 3 months now, my shower drain has remained pretty clean. My hair is staying on my head were it belongs and not at the bottom of the shower.  I would say well worth a try if you need a product like this.</li>
    <li> my son is using it and he sees no change. he says it smells good! no harm it trying it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and my hair feels cleaner than before and it is soft, looks good and I can see hair growth</li>
    <li> I used this product before and wanted to try some others that were cheaper but am now back to using Nioxin again.  The other products just didn&#x27;t work and actually made my hair thinner.</li>
    <li> I want to think that this product worked, but there was not enough of it for me to tell. The bottle of condition was so small. It last me barley over a week, and you are suppose to use this a month before you see results.</li>
    <li> My hair feels a little thicker. However, I ordered the wrong number, since my hair is not chemically treated. Next time I&#x27;ll try a different set.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps your hair grow.  Keeps your colored hair in great condition as well.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  The first time I used it, I did not know what to expect but my hair has never felt so clean.  My scalp was tingling but my hair felt really soft and manageable.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with hair loss. It hasn&#x27;t really stopped my hair loss but it does make my hair feel and look a ltttle fuller. I love the shampoo. It makes my hair feel really clean and fresh. The scalp therapy does nothing. I would stick with just the shampoo and conditioner in the future.</li>
    <li> Have used all three products for about a month and really like the outcome. The shampoo is very sudsy and does a good cleaning. The conditioner is excellent, but the top product of the three is the scalp therapy. It&#x27;s applied after shampoo and conditioner, while hair is still wet. Just rub it into the scalp, then comb it through hair. Leaves scalp feeling fresh and hair very, very manageable. I really do like these products and intend to continue using them.</li>
    <li> Ok, FIRST of all.....Why is the conditioner bottle 1/2 the size of the shampoo bottle? Everyone knows or at least I do, you use WAY more conditioner that shampoo. I don&#x27;t wash hair everyday but do condition. So that&#x27;s very disappointing and I feel a little ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;SECOND....I recently went from blonde to dark brown and this has stripped the color from my hair. Back to the salon I go. My girl said that this product is harsh on dye.&lt;br /&gt;THIRD.....2 weeks in, I have notice a huge decrease in hair loss. I don&#x27;t see as many dark hairs on my white tile floor after blow drying. So that&#x27;s a big PLUS!&lt;br /&gt;FOURTH....I do see new baby hairs coming in. Not a lot but a few.&lt;br /&gt;So my final review would be...ditch the shampoo and conditioner and just use the scalp treatment!</li>
    <li> I bought the kit and now I only buy the shampoo and conditioner.  They work wonders to make my hair much thicker.  I am used to having very fine hair but now it&#x27;s noticeably thicker and I have had comments from others that it&#x27;s much thicker and looks better.  I don&#x27;t care for the third item in the package as it made my scalp oily.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement from using the product but it is still nice as a shampoo and conditioner.  Maybe a bit expensive for that use though.</li>
    <li> made my scalp itch after using once</li>
    <li> buy from amazon and pay less than at ulta or a salon. great product that works. i used it 3months on 4 months off for thinning hair due to thyroid issues and stress.</li>
    <li> I had lost my hair because I was under a lot of stress.  All over my head I would loss hands full of hair daily.  After the first was it stop.  I will be buying more until my hair is back long again. PERFECT</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has been 3+ months of use now and my hair loss is definitely less. I use both the shampoo and conditioner at each wash. The spray is pricey so I only use it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For a year now I have been experiencing major hair loss. I have lost more than half of what I had. I went to my obgyn and asked her to run tests because I felt like it was hormonal. She said there are no hormone test that can be done. I did request thyroid and that was slightly elevated. My ob said my levels were ok, even though they were elevated and recommended I see a dermatologist. The dermatologist said the only thing that might help was to use mens extra strength rogaine. I tried rogaine for a few months, didn&#x27;t see any charge in loss of hair nor did I see any growth. I became tired of the messy daily regime and stopped using the rogaine after 3 months. After research and doctor visits and trying different methods, I came across Nioxin 3. Another person reviewed that it had helped to stop her hair loss. I figured I would give it a go and I am ecstatic to say that after about a month of using Nioxin, I am no longer losing hands full of hair. I still have normal loss, but nothing like before. I&#x27;m so glad I found this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just started using it but expecting it to work well.  My daughter in law has been using it for a year of so and she thinks it&#x27;s helped her hair growth..</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, I Love the product. Amazon&#x27;s price is great. I hope you continue these prices.</li>
    <li> So much more affordable than in a salon.</li>
    <li> I started using this when my hair was falling out due to stress. I love this product. The shampoo does tingle, and has a eucalyptus smell. The therapy (conditioner) also has the same smell, but the results are well worth the smell. My hair appears fuller. My mom has thinning hair, and I bought her a set of this. To her, her hair is thicker looking. It does not grow back your hair, but it does thicken your hair to cover the thinning areas.</li>
    <li> I have used this system before and really loved it.  Now I am wondering why I ever stopped using it.  This deal was excellent and it arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Initially, this system did me a lot of good - I could see results on one side of my head and thought the other would follow, but it didn&#x27;t, or hasn&#x27;t as yet. The product is good for keeping my hair hydrated, tho, and it doesn&#x27;t break easily like it did.</li>
    <li> Had my doubts although it was referred by my brother&lt;br /&gt;Amazingly works&lt;br /&gt;Less hair falling out&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is filling up&lt;br /&gt;I only used it for 3 weeks so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy from a different seller next time, the conditioner was like half used, wonder if it was a return</li>
    <li> This product made my already thinning hair terribly damaged. After having children my hair was very healthy, but very thin. I used this product in hopes of strengthening and thickening my hair, and it did the complete opposite. My hair fell out in clumps. I read some reviews that said that ones hair may fall out at first and to just keep using it, so I did, but it never stopped falling out. Now, the hair that I have left feels dry and damaged, and even thinner than before. Save yourself some heartache and stay away from this product. I&#x27;m a 35 year old female who looks almost bald from this product. Stay away.</li>
    <li> Three stars right now just because it smells nice.I&#x27;m on week one and have not notice anything yet.I&#x27;ll give a up date in a few weeks.I hope it works.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Week two.Still have not notice anything new as in hair.Will update again in one week.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Week Three.I still don&#x27;t see any new hair.It feels thicker.Plus I had to reorder another box-Scalp Therapy ran out and scalp Treatment was running low.Will be updating again in one week.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Week Four.Maybe I need glasses but I don&#x27;t see any baby hair coming in.My hair feels different.I will keep updating because I had to order another box due to the fact I ran out of the scalp therapy.I just wish they could give us a shot and we can have full head of hair again.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Week five.I have to tell you the truth I can&#x27;t see any new hair but I like using it.Smell nice and the price is not bad.Like I said in week four I had to but another one so I think I&#x27;ll stick with it for a few more weeks.Will update.Bottom line try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:Well I&#x27;m getting another one #3 and I see that my hair is thicker and feels better.</li>
    <li> This product works very well on fine, color-treated hair. Will be able to tell more with continued use as to if it will&lt;br /&gt;thicken my hair, so far very satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair. I use all three parts. It truly makes your hair look thicker. I also have new hair growth. I highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> Seems to give me the volume I was lacking before .</li>
    <li> After having very thick, long hair, I lost about 70% of it after surgery.  Then, I tried many shampoos and conditioners, none of which helped in thickening my regrown and very thin hair.  This last &amp;#34;trial,&amp;#34; I bought the Nioxin System 3, and it is a complete miracle!  I finally have my thick hair back when I thought that I never would!  And, it doesn&#x27;t strip my color as other supposedly similar products always did!  This group of products cleans gently, and the conditioner tingles while it is working.  After rinsing it off, I squeeze out the extra water (in the shower) and apply the spray-on thickener to about 6 parts in the hair on my scalp.  Then, I just dry my hair (not on the hottest setting) and put in my flocked rollers for 10 minutes.  How wonderful to have my hair back - it feels so great again!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing book.  I learned so much about Booker T. Washington and his journey to discover himself through his work in research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nioxin System 3 Thinning Hair for Unisex Cleanser Kit is a work in progress.  I just started using it.  I&#x27;ll see how it work after many uses.</li>
    <li> has helped with the scalp issues, but I am yet to see any changes to the thickness of my hair</li>
    <li> I found it worked well for what I needed - I would recommend this for women (or men) who are expieriencing age or stress related hair thinning.</li>
    <li> I could see a diff in my hair within the first few weeks. I ordered more to see what happens after a month</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product</li>
    <li> this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and it actually made my hair fall out more sadly.</li>
    <li> My hair has been getting thinner as I age.  I was looking for a product that would give my hair some volume.  Have used several products that supposedly adds volume to hair...with little or no success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this product for about two weeks, so really don&#x27;t feel qualified to say it is wonderful, nor could I give it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;.  What I have observed is that my hair does look fuller to me.  It is difficult to describe the results I do not have more hair, just an appearance of thicker hair , therefore,  healthy and fuller.  At this time, I would probably purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final decision to be made after I used this for at least a month.</li>
    <li> No noticeable changes in hair.</li>
    <li> Cheaper here than in the stores. this product really works i had my doubts. no more hair in the bottom of the tub.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I bought this product. I cannot tell if the Nioxin made in the States was better than this one made in Mexico because I am new to the product. I used it 4 or 5 times and that was enough. It made my hair very VERY DRY. No matter how muh conditioner I used, (the same brand) I got the same results: dry, dull, lifeless. Then, I changed and paid much more for the Kerastase one. Boy can I tell the difference. Maybe Nioxin works for hairs that are strong or coarse. My hair is fine, I am in my forties but I do not mistreat my hair with frequent coloring or drying, so the shampoo should not have dried my hair as it did. I assume it is the change in the formula. I got the Mexican version, very bad. What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;If you want excellent results, then try Kerastase Specifique Bain Stimuliste GL. I got it in a salon for $36, cheaper even than in Amazon or in Kerastase web page. All Kerastase line is excellent.  This Nioxin deserves only half of a star if possible.</li>
    <li> Great stuff ,ordered more</li>
    <li> Its still early to say whether its working. Ill wait another month with new update</li>
    <li> The products were exactly what I needed.  Thanks for your prompt shipping!</li>
    <li> Works well from the first time so I don&#x27;t know that it will change your hair growth in a biological sense but it does make your hair look fuller and feel fuller! the price on amazon is just right, I would not spend salon prices for this</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son.  His hair was so thin he was embarrassed.  We both noticed a difference before we finished the first set.  I have bought 2 more!  He is on his second set and his hair is getting full again!  He is so excited!  Love this product and the price is great!!!  We will be ordering again soon!!!!</li>
    <li> Love these products from Nioxin. I have used them for two years and noticed new growth within 8 months. My hair is shiner and has a fuller appearance so easier to style.</li>
    <li> Great stuff my hair is thicker and longer in a very short time. Love it.</li>
    <li> Still undetermined on the overall opinion of this product. Second order of the System 3.  The scent is lovely and refreshing. I feel a tingling sensation when I apply the shampoo. The conditioner does indeed leave my hair feeling softer. What I&#x27;m not sure is if it doing what I purchased it for...prevent thinning and add  body. I ordered it a second time because I am not disappointed with its cleaning and conditioning but I want to give it a chance to work as advertised. The leave in spray I am not quite sure what I should expect from it, but I continue with the entire process hoping for less thinning.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for a month now, and I feel like really works. I need more! I plain on using all time now!</li>
    <li> Very good seller and received promptly. Bought for a friend who really likes.  I used to use myself for over a decade.  Will continue to use every day!  Thanks....</li>
    <li> The product is good but for women who has long hair like me would use a lot more conditioner than shampoo. I purchased this package from viewing the images instead of reading the details, the conditioner is 1/3 less than the shampoo. I had to deducted one star for the package only. The product itself is great, i have color-treated hair and my hair color remains the same after a month and  I didn&#x27;t shed as much hair as other shampoo.</li>
