      <li>There is, however, a good deal of information online about derma rollers and I read a bit before using this.</li>
      <li>Another thing that I really liked about this product is the fact that this company has great customer service.</li>

      <li>I am glad that I did!  </li>

      <li>Check out YouTube, as I did, and you&#x27;ll see how effective the Derma Roller is on the before and after shots.</li>
      <li>So I am a happy, satisfied customer:)</li>
      <li>After months of rolling I can honestly say that I am seeing results.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s easy to</li>
      <li>It will take time, but it will help you skin more in a direction of looking more radiant!</li>
      <li>:) So he can have his own.</li>
      <li>Very quick shipping!</li>
      <li>I thought the concept was interesting</li>
      <li>I recently bought this great product!</li>
      <li>and I have started feeling confident about myself.</li>
      <li>I’ve not had any problems with using it, and do feel that my Vitamin C serum is penetrating much more deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just make sure to keep this germ-free to the extent</li>
      <li>It works better if used in tandem with skin serum.</li>
      <li>Finally, I love that this product is painless.</li>
      <li>Although the plastic box the roller has come in can be made more interlocking as the box keeps opening</li>
      <li>We started with 0.5mm and now using just mostly 1.0 mm.</li>
      <li>Just as my skin began to look healthy and renewed.</li>
      <li>I needed something more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>no mention of how often to use it or how many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is softer, lighter, smoother, and it feels better.</li>
      <li>And I love the rosy glow it has now.</li>
      <li>This is one of the better derma rollers I have tried.</li>
      <li>The more i use it the more radiant my skin will look.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my derma roller just 2 days after placing my order – talk about quick shipping and great customer service!</li>
      <li>The plastic box is perfect for storing the derma roller so that it remains as clean as possible between uses.</li>
      <li>I have been able to see a significant change in the tightness of the skin on my face.</li>
      <li>They are incredibly easy to use and durable.</li>
      <li>The box comes with instructions that are easy to follow.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t believe in plastic surgery or any harmful or strong chemicals to help me with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am an artist so product and packaging design is important to me.</li>
      <li>And I can feel my skin radiant and smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin is glowing and it feels like my serums are being absorbed more fully into my skin.</li>
      <li>gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t yet experienced the results as I have only used it for</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I purchased it primarily for my face, I also use it to help scars on my legs fade faster.</li>
      <li>Fabulous product that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Get these injections for $500 and look like you&#x27;re 12 again!\\&quot; Sound familiar?</li>
      <li>The outside box was cheap and damaged a bit in shipping, so when I opened it – I was pleased to see such an attractive roller in a nice plastic case.</li>
      <li>The derma roller, made of durable plastic not likely to easily crack, is comfortable to grip, rather like using a good shaving razor.  </li>
      <li>It is a bit deeper and works better on stimulating more collagen production and new skin cells.</li>
      <li>I read up about how to use the derma roller and was really excited to try it for myself.</li>
      <li>I don’t expect miracles, and expect that I may be rolling for some time to come, but so far I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>For those that don&#x27;t know the derma roller is a bunch of needles that poke in and clean out your pores.</li>
      <li>The cardboard box provides some safety precautions (e.g. not sharing it with another person, keeping the needles clean, etc.)</li>
      <li>skin feels clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>therefore purchased this product through Amazon hoping it will be something different and more effective.</li>
      <li>I have a big problem with the &#x27;crows feet&#x27; on my face becoming more and more noticeable.</li>
      <li>I was super excited to get the Derma Roller so fast and be able to try it tonight before I went to sleep.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have wonderfully smoother, even toned skin with out all the harsh chemically filled products or pills.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most unique high quality beauty products on the market.</li>
      <li>I love these clever devices.</li>
      <li>And yet it says to keep the head clean and store in a safe place (there is a clear carrying case for this purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Again it makes my Mom happy and hopefully makes her feel a little better about getting older these days.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a very nice product and a great option for those who cannot afford expensive treatments at the dermatologist!</li>
      <li>It is easy and fast to use, and provides me with a non-surgical way to manage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since I have kind of dry skin (especially on my face), I was delighted to receive and test this derma roller.</li>
      <li>Not only is the Derma Roller worth every penny, but it is easily worth much more!</li>
      <li>I would say it is worth the money you spend.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re in need of any kind of facial cleanser or anti-aging system-</li>
      <li>My laugh lines were lessened a bit as well.</li>
      <li>I love the results so far</li>
      <li>This roller is more on the gentle side, but really does work wonders.  </li>
      <li>I have never had problem skin, but as I get older and busier, I had noticed some fine lines in my face.</li>
      <li>I do not know the right size needles to use</li>
      <li>It arrived in a very easy to open package.</li>
      <li>But about a week later my skin started looking much more healthy -- glowing and clear.  </li>
      <li>If that is true, this would not be a very cost-effective treatment – there are no replacement heads included.</li>
      <li>After a week or so of using is my skin began to feel tight and flaked in places where my scars were deepest but a good moisturiser helped this.</li>
      <li>I notice my skin has become much more even overall</li>
      <li>at first I couldn’t understand why she mentioned this, but then I saw the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Well the first time I used it</li>
      <li>First some background info.</li>
      <li>Love the magenta-colored roller and ergonomic design of the white handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The idea is quite phenomenal, the serum is injected into the tiny pockets created in your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I thank the needles are to big ,they will not puncher the skin.I do not know the right size needles to use</li>
    <li> I love these clever devices. They are incredibly easy to use and durable. Since I started using mine, my skin has been positively glowing.  The derma roller is already giving me a more youthful look! It doesn&#x27;t take very long to use either, so I&#x27;d recommend it to even the busiest women.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical about using the Derma Roller, especially after viewing some of the YouTube videos of people using it and experiencing redness on their faces. However, I like to try every anti-aging product, so I ordered this one. First of all, it&#x27;s not at all scary. My skin is rather delicate, and I didn&#x27;t bleed or experience any undude redness; the minor redness dissipated within a half hour. I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month, so I don&#x27;t expect to have the collagen fully stimulated yet, but I can swear I notice a difference in skin tone. My skin is glowing and it feels like my serums are being absorbed more fully into my skin. At $20, this is a better experience than the Clarisonic, which is very expensive and doesn&#x27;t show any result. Check out YouTube, as I did, and you&#x27;ll see how effective the Derma Roller is on the before and after shots.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mom. She is worried about her looks and she says she thinks this works great. If shes happy I am happy! It says it does a lot of stuff according to the box...we will see! I do like that it tickles. Again it makes my Mom happy and hopefully makes her feel a little better about getting older these days.</li>
    <li> I thought the concept was interesting: you roll these micro-needles on the affected skin to improve its condition. I wanted to try this on my back where I was having some skin issues. The instructions on the packaging was simple and easy to follow, so I anticipate that anyone can use this without confusion.  The roller itself is small and portable, making it easy to bring with you everywhere, which is a plus!  Also, it comes with a clear container for storage.  Everybody is different when it comes to skin sensitivity, but so far I have had no problems from using the derma roller. Don&#x27;t let the description of micro-needles scare you. It felt good on my skin, like it was getting some stimulation or massage.  So far, I have no complaints.  I am looking forward to seeing an improvement as I continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have used basically every anti-aging device in the book, and this is the only one that has worked for me. My skin is softer, lighter, smoother, and it feels better. My stretch marks are disappearing, and wrinkles are fading. Friends who haven&#x27;t seen me in a while are astonished at the transformation!</li>
    <li> This is one of the most unique high quality beauty products on the market. I noticed a reduction in pore size and lighter looking black marks after only one use. My husband noticed that my skin was smoother and more even toned after only a few days of use. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have wonderfully smoother, even toned skin with out all the harsh chemically filled products or pills.</li>
    <li> Since I have kind of dry skin (especially on my face), I was delighted to receive and test this derma roller. So I washed my face throughly and followed the instructions on how to use this roller. And I did not need to press it down hard as I could feel it working. After using this roller on my face and neck, I did notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels clean and refreshed. And I love the rosy glow it has now. My skin is a softer and I can tell it has responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this roller very much, the one thing that I really do not like is that the instructions say NOT to re-use the head--it seems to be a one time use and I could not find a way to remove the . And yet it says to keep the head clean and store in a safe place (there is a clear carrying case for this purpose).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I followed the instructions and am very pleased with the results, hence my rating a 4.5 stars - I rounded it off to the nearest decimal place. It would have been 5 stars if the directions specified it could be used a second time or the head could be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Derma Roller provided for testing and review purposes].</li>
    <li> I was slightly skeptical about this product, however after using it for some time now I am beginning to see more even skin tone.  I have a slight reddening on my cheeks, with some acne scars and i have seen an evening of this with daily usage.  I&#x27;d recommend adding this product to your daily regimen (not replacing anything).  It will take time, but it will help you skin more in a direction of looking more radiant!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this great product! Since I am getting older, I am looking for natural ways to reduce any aging signs. This item does help improve my skin. I feel like I have fewer wrinkles. Plus, it helps my crows feet. I really dislike crows feet. I think I am going to get one of these for my mother. I told her about how good the results are on my skin! I also mentioned how it comes with a travel case. Another thing that I really liked about this product is the fact that this company has great customer service. Finally, I love that this product is painless. Why get injections if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
    <li> The GTO Derma roller (GMT-10 model, 1.00 mm) arrived from California quite quickly, only three days after the order had been placed, even though only regular shipping had been requested. That speediness in delivery was very much appreciated, and for me it does effect my experience of using it since If I were still waiting for it, I would not be writing this review. The package envelop had been torn a bit on one end, but the rectangular cardboard box  encasing the derma roller had not been tampered with at all, and so the derma roller was not at all effected.  Besides, when I opened the torn package envelope and the box itself, I found that the derma roller had been set into a clear hard plastic box (called a travel case on the packing slip included in the envelop), which itself was completely sealed in plastic wrap. The plastic box is perfect for storing the derma roller so that it remains as clean as possible between uses. The box specifies using alcohol (presumably rubbing alcohol) to disinfect the skin where the derma roller is used and the micro needles of the roller itself, so that is why so much attention is given to the packaging of this product and to providing the clear hard plastic box. The cardboard box provides some safety precautions (e.g. not sharing it with another person, keeping the needles clean, etc.) and some brief instructions for using the derma roller. Unfortunately, the box does not suggest how many times a day or how many times per week to use the derma roller. I have used it twice during the six days that I have had it, cleaning the skin area and the derma roller first with rubbing alcohol. The box does instruct that a nutritional lotion/cream needs to be used in conjunction with it even though the order site does not. If the lotion/cream is necessary, then I am unsure how to rate the effectiveness of the derma roller for reducing wrinkles since the skin can absorb an ant-wrinkle lotion/cream without it. The derma roller, made of durable plastic not likely to easily crack, is comfortable to grip, rather like using a good shaving razor.  I have rated it with three stars since I have not used it long enough to see any significant results and because if it is true that the head is only supposed to be used once (unlike razors that are used several times until the blades are dull), then the heads should be made so that they can be used more than once and several heads should be included in the kit. The box makes its use confusing when it specifies \\&quot;Do not re-use head.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> A friend had been using this for awhile and her skin had noticeably improved, which is why I decided to try it.. It&#x27;s true it does look a little intimidating and, yes, you should expect to see some redness in your skin.  At least I did. But about a week later my skin started looking much more healthy -- glowing and clear.  A week after that I started getting compliments and positive remarks, including from acquaintances who never seem to notice things like that.  So I am a happy, satisfied customer:)</li>
    <li> When I received this product, I was a bit skeptical, there was not a lot to it. However, I gave it a try, I will admit that it did make my skin a bit tender and after using it on my face I did not notice anything, except a bit of redness. When I got up the next morning, my face looked more vibrant, I did not see a decrease in wrinkles, but I did see a youthful glow. My colors started to even up some. I have not been out in years without makeup, just due to the fact of my skin discoloration, but now after only one use, I feel more confident to do so. I continued to use the product at night, after a few nights, I did notice the lines in my forehead were not as noticeable as they were only a week before. My laugh lines were lessened a bit as well. I will keep using the product, I have had nothing but compliments since I started using it, it is going to my best anti-aging trick that I have.</li>
    <li> The documentation is a little lacking, there&#x27;s a handy chart on the packaging to mark off uses but no mention of how often to use it or how many uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little prickly rolling this over your skin, but that was expected and not as bad as some other products of a similar type from what I have heard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this seems to be a well made product, just lacks a little in documentation.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine long term results but so far the results I have gotten are promising.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product that I have ever used. I have many dark spots all over my face. And I feel uncomfortable to go out. I have been using different products to get a clear skin. When I came across this product,I wanted to give it a try. I was not sure if it will really work. But I was surprised with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product and got it delivered pretty fast. The box comes with instructions that are easy to follow. I have been using it for a week now and I realized that my dark spots are looking lighter. And I can feel my skin radiant and smooth. I would say it is worth the money you spend. I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to deal with dark spots.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my derma roller just 2 days after placing my order – talk about quick shipping and great customer service! I expected a larger roller and was delighted to see a petite one instead, especially after imagining rather sharp micro needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one other reviewer mentioned, the verbiage on the box is pretty brief – I kind of thought there would be a little pamphlet included. There is, however, a good deal of information online about derma rollers and I read a bit before using this. The first of the five cautionary bullets says, “Do not re-use head.” If that is true, this would not be a very cost-effective treatment – there are no replacement heads included. I am assuming this will last for quite some time, especially if you clean it properly before and after each use. I think one of the other reviewers took this literally – at first I couldn’t understand why she mentioned this, but then I saw the bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an artist so product and packaging design is important to me. The outside box was cheap and damaged a bit in shipping, so when I opened it – I was pleased to see such an attractive roller in a nice plastic case. Love the magenta-colored roller and ergonomic design of the white handle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using this – I didn’t really need this on my face, but have a problem area on my upper chest. I decided to give this a whirl there – be careful, if you roll this too hard, you can scratch your skin. To clean it, I roll it back and forth on a tissue dipped in rubbing alcohol – the micro needles shred a cotton pad, so don’t use that. What I found the most effective after a little trial and error was to exfoliate in the shower first with my usual brush and anti-blackhead soap. Then after I dry off, I use lotion and the roller. I have done this just 5 times and I can already see the difference in this area – the tiny pimples and large pores have definitely decreased – soI am excited to see the results after a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice product and a great option for those who cannot afford expensive treatments at the dermatologist!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been interested in purchasing a Derma Roller for a few years now but could never find one that I could afford. Then I found the Derma Roller from Hermosa Naturals, and boy was I ready to make a purchase for only 20 dollars. I was super excited to get the Derma Roller so fast and be able to try it tonight before I went to sleep. For those that don&#x27;t know the derma roller is a bunch of needles that poke in and clean out your pores. There are spots of your face that you will really have to scrub your face and you will break the skin. The small amount of blood did not bother me since I know this was going to be the outcome. My skin already starts to feel cleaner. I look forward to the future with this device. I can&#x27;t wait to see how young my skin looks soon.</li>
    <li> I have never had problem skin, but as I get older and busier, I had noticed some fine lines in my face. I also recently lost a lot of weight and had some stretch marks on my stomach. I don&#x27;t believe in plastic surgery or any harmful or strong chemicals to help me with my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched around and found this amazing product! I have used it on my face, legs and thighs and it is great! I have been able to see a significant change in the tightness of the skin on my face. I use it as a part of my regular regimen and am so pleased with how much younger I am looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for using it on other areas, I am beginning to see some fading of my stretch marks! Any woman who has ever had problems with stretch knows the difficulty getting rid of them. Now, there is hope. I am really happy that I took a chance on this derma roller. It is tackling multiple problems at once without the cost of plastic surgery. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking to tighten, rejuvenate or eliminate stretch marks and blemishes. It rocks!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Anti Aging Derma Roller for ony a fe weeks and see a huge difference in the cellulite on my thighs!! I cant believe the difference in such a short amount of time!! I also used it on my face for my wrinkles and see a dramatic difference there too!!! I wish I purchased this years ago!!!</li>
    <li> Not only is the Derma Roller worth every penny, but it is easily worth much more! It makes my skin look younger and firmer--and it reduces the frequency of my trips to spa for facials. It is easy and fast to use, and provides me with a non-surgical way to manage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I purchased it primarily for my face, I also use it to help scars on my legs fade faster.</li>
    <li> First some background info. Im a 24 yo male, I work construction, I&#x27;ve suffered from mild-severe acne since my teens. After years of trial and error I finally have my acne under control, and started to notice the scarring left and the &#x27;uneveness&#x27; of my skin tone from the acne.&lt;br /&gt;I started asking around to find out about treatments and dermaroller was recommended to be by the dermatologist who also recommended the product that finally got my acne under control so thought I&#x27;d give it a go. She did warn that my skin time was unlikely to improve and may in fact worsen thanks to my meds before it got better, but I trust this dermatologist so went ahead with it. She recommended I check amazon for an affordable &#x27;at-home&#x27; kit, which is much cheaper than going in to the doc for this.&lt;br /&gt;The procedure is a little uncomfortable, my face felt a little numb after doing my treatments, but the sensitive parts like over the nose do sting more than other parts. After a week or so of using is my skin began to feel tight and flaked in places where my scars were deepest but a good moisturiser helped this. Just as my skin began to look healthy and renewed. I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this for almost a month now and my results have been great. But I know it differs for everyone. Each week I notice some improvement. I would definitely recommend dermaroller treatment! Especially for this price- it&#x27;s worth it for the confidence to go out and pick up those beautiful ladies!</li>
    <li> After purchasing the Derma Roller I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly it arrived. After trying it out several times I feel it is gradually improving my skin tone and appearance. I notice my skin has become much more even overall and it now has a rosy glow. The results I&#x27;ve experienced have been surprising. I&#x27;m going to try it out for a few more weeks but I will probably recommend this product to my friends that have been wanting to improve their skin but have not found a good solution...yet!</li>
    <li> This tool is useful prior to applying any of about a dozen proven skin serums that will help generate collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this derma roller, it gets the skin serums deep in my skin and I use about a third of the serum per application otherwise. That means I save money directly. Plus it feels like I&#x27;m getting results just using this. It has titanium needles. Just make sure to keep this germ-free to the extent possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most cosmetic produces have some high-margin, big-selling skin serums on their product list. What one uses will probably depend on their age and skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. Sample provided.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping! It was literally shipped out immediately. The product is just as described. White dermaroller with magenta detailing. I love the results so far and I can honestly say the dermaroller is a great investment if you are looking to improve your skin! Excellent communication, fast shipment, and a great product. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my service!</li>
    <li> I have been using derma rollers now for quite some time.  Unfortunately, I have been blessed with not so great skin. – scars, large pores, dark circles under my eyes – you name it, I have it!  When my last roller needed replacing I decided to give this one a try.  I am glad that I did!  This roller is more on the gentle side, but really does work wonders.  I’ve not had any problems with using it, and do feel that my Vitamin C serum is penetrating much more deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I will admit that the lack of instructions is a con, there are plenty of Youtube videos that will guide you through the process if you are a beginner - I personally prefer seeing a video with something like this, instead of reading instructions anyway.  After months of rolling I can honestly say that I am seeing results.  While I have only had the opportunity to use this roller for a little while, I have found it to be exactly what I was looking for.  My skin feels much softer, and I have received complements on my “glowing” skin – for me this is enough to make me continue on and give me strength that armed with this device I am now in control of my skin.  I don’t expect miracles, and expect that I may be rolling for some time to come, but so far I am very pleased with the results.  I would recommend this item for anyone who has problem skin be it from acne or wrinkles, you will see a difference with each rolling session.</li>
    <li> I have a dry skin so I tend to look older than what my age suggests. I tried various moisturizing lotions but all they did was make my skin moist for a while and then it dried up again. I needed something more permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I therefore purchased this product through Amazon hoping it will be something different and more effective. It arrived in a very easy to open package. Although the plastic box the roller has come in can be made more interlocking as the box keeps opening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part about the roller is the easy to use instructions on the box. I&#x27;ve been using the roller once a day and my skin has started looking fresher and younger. All I have to do is roll it in four different directions over the same area and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it on my face, arms and legs and I have started feeling confident about myself. I will continue to use it regularly and hope I actually start looking my age or even younger. I would definitely recommend it for any man or woman over 30 years of age.</li>
    <li> I was so happy when a friend of mine recommended this product to me because my skin just hasn&#x27;t looked better. After a few uses my pores have decreased in size and my skin feels and looks younger. I don&#x27;t like using a lot of products on my face because it gets very expensive but this derma roller gives me all of the results that I want, along with being one of the cheapest products I have seen on the market. The benefits from this purchase were incredible and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;I have used it a few days and already my skin feels so much better, as older males I spend a lot of money on products to help me fight aging, and make me look younger. The creams and lotions help but only so much, and they are very expensive. That is where this little dermaroller come in. I still used the creams, but I use the dermaroller to help drive the cream into my skin, and in the process it gets cream down further into the skin, to make it work more effectively. In just a few days my family is already noticing that my skins looks better and more of a natural glow to it. My wife says I already look older.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am going to have to order her one for her face. As a Minister I want to keep that youthful look as long as I can. I am finding the inexpensive little roller is the ticket to that. I urge any male or female who wants to look younger and have healthy looking skin to buy the Dermaroller. There is a lot of science behind this little roller. I am going to buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> Okl, So the shipping was quick, and initially, I was a little unsure about using it on my face because my skin is VERY sensitive. but my husband was VERY happy with it. since he uses it for his face and head, he doesn&#x27;t really get acne anymore around his scalp and his face is maybe 95% less pimpled. I use it for the bumbs on my legs before I shave, and now my legs are perfectly smooth and I am a little shocked with how well it works. I need to order another one. :) So he can have his own. lol</li>
    <li> Before I review this product that I&#x27;ve been using, I have to say that I have been looking for anti-aging products that actually work and show good results for a long time. I&#x27;ve bought many anti-aging products in the past to help with my wrinkles, acne, and the bags under my eyes, and they&#x27;ve never seemed to have gave me the results I&#x27;ve been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ever since I bought and used this derma roller, my face has improved drastically in a little under a week! The wrinkles have a much lesser impact on my face and don&#x27;t show as much, all of my acne is gone, and the bags under my eyes are almost invisible. Alot of people have been complimenting me lately, and I really feel and look younger. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be like in a month or so!</li>
    <li> I went ahead and ordered the Titanium 540 disk needle head and system. I have a big problem with the &#x27;crows feet&#x27; on my face becoming more and more noticeable. I was in need of a total facial cleansing system in general. After using this Dermaroller- I swear I&#x27;ll never buy another &#x27;miracle lotion&#x27; or pill that promises my face what it wants and needs, haha!&lt;br /&gt;The dermaroller has the science, history, and reviews behind it which was my motivation for buying it in the first place. Thankfully, I struck gold with this one..! If you&#x27;re in need of any kind of facial cleanser or anti-aging system- PLEASE DO NOT waste your money on those ridiculous expensive lotions and oils from the bottom of the lowest toilet bowl in Atlantis and by the graces of God and for $100 it can be on your face. Or- \\&quot;Get these injections for $500 and look like you&#x27;re 12 again!\\&quot; Sound familiar? Lies. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Get what works! And trust me- THIS is what works!</li>
    <li> The tiny needles make my skin tingle when i run the roller over my face. My skin had no adverse reactions to the treatment at all. I could feel it working and think over time it&#x27;ll make my skin look younger. The more i use it the more radiant my skin will look.</li>
    <li> I have had teenage acne onto my adult.years. although I stopped breaking out I was left with ugly acne scars. I tried everything from chemical peels to expensive dermatological treatments, however, nothing helped to remove the ugly scars. I was recommended this by a roommate and although I was skeptical I decided to give it a try. The first time is definitely uncomfortable but it becomes routine after a while and you don&#x27;t feel a thing. The idea is quite phenomenal, the serum is injected into the tiny pockets created in your skin. It has been a few months since using it and I can definitely see a huge improvement in the condition of my scars.</li>
    <li> This is one of the better derma rollers I have tried. Starting with the packaging, it looks adequately sealed and sanitary. The box has information about how to take care of your derma roller. You can buy a small water bottle sprayer from a cosmetic store or even on the dollar rack of a Target store. Fill it with alcohol and spray the needles before and after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has titanium needles and will not rust. The length of the needles are clearly indicated at the back of the box - 1.0 mm. We started with 0.5mm and now using just mostly 1.0 mm. It is a bit deeper and works better on stimulating more collagen production and new skin cells. It works better if used in tandem with skin serum. My wife is now regularly using it (2-3 times a week). She is getting compliments from her friends and sisters about how she looks younger at 47.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is well balanced and convenient to handle. It has 540 needles which is very common in this type of rollers. Of course it comes with a plastic cradle case to protect the needles. Never lay down your roller on the counter as germs can cling onto the needles and also the likelihood of damaging the tips of your needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for awhile but I recently moved and managed to lose it. Needless to say one of the first things I did when I get fully moved is order a new one. This product may look intimidating but it will do absolute wonders for you in your skin. Many of the wrinkles I had years ago have since disappeared and my skin has less blemishes. Get this product if you care about your skin it will work wonders for you!</li>
    <li> I finally received my derma roller and I am truly pleased.  I have problems with large pores and dull skin.  THANK YOU</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because I was interested in the results it produces for stretchmarks. The shipping was fast and the package was small and easy to open. I read up about how to use the derma roller and was really excited to try it for myself. It was smaller than I expected but that&#x27;s good because it&#x27;s easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t yet experienced the results as I have only used it for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box has instructions on how to use it and suggests using it with your favorite cream. I opted for coconut oil because I use it for everything. I chose not to use it on my face because I dont have issues there, but I use it on my belly and upper thighs where I have light stretchmarks. It tingles a bit after the first few treatments and the skin is sensitive to the touch, but other than that it&#x27;s not as painful as I expected, it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I am really looking forward to seeing the benefits of the derma roller.</li>
    <li> I purchased my derma roller and received it very promptly. This thing works great and I think everyone should research it to learn the benefits of these. They are so beneficial for your body and your health. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that you are supposed to only use the head once.(but that is probably more sanitary anyhow). I do recommend having some creams and serums for before and afterwards. And it really isn&#x27;t as painful as I thought. I will definitely be getting some for my family to try!</li>
    <li> My experience wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. It irritates my face. Well the first time I used it I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it ,but if irritation continues I&#x27;m gonna stop if improvement I&#x27;ll will redo my review. I was looking for an exfoliating product to feel my skin breath and see improvement to less black heads less zits if continuing using product and I see the product do that which it says it can do I will change my review. Thank you</li>
