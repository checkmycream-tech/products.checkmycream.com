### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;This is a win for me though!</li>
      <li>I did think this was a beautiful shade.</li>
      <li>and it was a great addition to my outfit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Violet Vixen is too gray for warm-toned bronze and brown skin, but would look great on a cool-toned ebony complexion.</li>
      <li>And I very surprisingly actually really liked it!</li>
      <li>Nice loved the color stayed on all day!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s creamy and bright</li>

      <li>I got this product free from influenced her</li>
      <li>but really it&#x27;s a light fuchsia, lavender color</li>

      <li>I received it free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
      <li>I felt that this lipstick went on smoothly and lasted for hours.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty shade, and the brand cannot be beat!</li>
      <li>Thanks Influenster!!</li>
      <li>This was easy to apply and only needed to put more on when I was done with eating.</li>
      <li>but it does not wear as bright as would be expected.</li>
      <li>Overall, the feel of the lipstick is nice.</li>
      <li>I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster</li>
      <li>and i think this is may favorite item sent thus far.  </li>
      <li>The color was really fun</li>
      <li>Except that it just didn&#x27;t look right on me.</li>
      <li>It went on super smooth and dried nicely, without cracking or smudging.  </li>
      <li>If I only applied it lightly the color was fine</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this lipstick, it lasts extremely long and the color is true.  </li>
      <li>first thoughts...</li>
      <li>I will definitely be trying more shades of this brand.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
      <li>My first opinion of it was &amp;</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>The next morning I tried it for the first time and was so happy the color wasn&#x27;t as dark as it looks.</li>
      <li>I received vixen violet, which if i&#x27;m honest is not a color i would typically buy.</li>
      <li>I was very timid to use it.</li>
      <li>the formula was creamer then expected i dont have many lipstick so am not an expert</li>
      <li>I received free this in my VoxBox from Influenster but these opinions are entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t really say because i don&#x27;t have a shade</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week straight and have gotten lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>If I applied it more generously the color was too much but lasted a little longer.</li>
      <li>The lipstick feels smooth and lasted all day long!</li>
      <li>I was lucky enough to get this in a Vox Box.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not usually a color I would purchase.</li>
      <li>YES, the pigment is vivid and lipstick stays on well, but it leaves a hot pink stain on my lips for a whole day after wearing it.</li>
      <li>On my first day I put it on at ten o&#x27;clock, went to lunch and then was surprised at one when it was still in place and hadn&#x27;t faded or smudged.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a dark color for my light skin and small lips&amp;#34; (I barely have a top lip).</li>
      <li>I am so surprised.</li>
      <li>I typically do not buy lipsticks from Covergirl.</li>
      <li>but i do have A few wet and wilds and its way better then them</li>
      <li>I thought that the lipstick color was exciting, different than other colors that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Influenster sent me Classic Tan (too yellow) foundation and Violet Vixen (too blue) lipstick for testing and commenting.</li>
      <li>At first I was a little concerned about the color</li>
      <li>This shade surprised me; I was a little nervous looking at it in the tube, but when I put it on it was a vivid but wearable purple.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately it was a little too bright for me.</li>
      <li>The stain is both a good and bad thing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So basically I am the type of girl that wishes she had the courage to wear lipstick, but never had the courage to try it.  I received this particular lipstick courtesy of Influenster for testing purpose, and actually loved it.  The color is crazy daring, however it actually added that needed bit of color to my face.  It went on super smooth and dried nicely, without cracking or smudging.  This maybe the first lipstick that I actually love!</li>
    <li> YES, the pigment is vivid and lipstick stays on well, but it leaves a hot pink stain on my lips for a whole day after wearing it.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie and I love lip products. I received Covergirl Outlast Longwear Lipstick in the shade &amp;#34;Into the fuchsia&amp;#34; for free for testing purposes but ALL opinions are MY OWN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The pigmentation is intense (in a good way!). Definitely for those girls that are not scared of color and know how to make a statement! I applies a bit dry but feels really good on the lips after application. This lipstick does not have a sticky feel to it which I absolutely love. The packaging is very simple but also cute!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It lasts some time but you will need to touch up especially if you eat or drink something. It tends to smudge a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Lipliner is a must to avoid unnecessary smudging! I also usually use a lip balm 5 minutes before, which makes the flawless application way easier.</li>
    <li> It does last, but the product dries out your lips. It also bleeds quite easily, so I would recommend pairing it with a lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a variation of this product for free through influenster.com for testing and review purposes, but the review is my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I got this in the #IDOVOXBOX from influenster. I gave this a half review because the color was terrible in my opinion and my skin tone, but i did try it and it was smooth but i licked my lips a few times and it ended up all around my lips and coming off so if you put it on to go out to dinner expect to check it. I&#x27;m also not a bit lipstick girl I&#x27;m more lipgloss i feel it is easier but this seems like an okay product.. i can&#x27;t really say because i don&#x27;t have a shade i like but i will see if my mother in law will try it and get back with that review if so.</li>
    <li> I did think this was a beautiful shade. Exactly what I was hoping for. Except that it just didn&#x27;t look right on me. (Sadface.) However, if this is your kind of color, I would recommend it. I received it as part of my Idp box from Influenster. But I always give my honest opinion on these things. A little of this lipstick goes a long way. You don&#x27;t have to spread it too thickly. It&#x27;s a pretty shade, and the brand cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> I received this for trial purposes from Influenster as part of their I Do VoxBox.  Although it was received for free for trial purposes, these opinions are all mine.  As a lipstick formula, it was easy to apply and went on smoothly. I&#x27;m not usually a lipstick person (although I am a makeup fanatic).  Unfortunately, the color that was sent to me is not a color that I usually wear and did not like the way this color looked on me.  I may, in the future shop for other colors in this collection, but Vixen Violet is definitely not the color for me.</li>
    <li> I got this product free from influenced her I have my doubts but the lipstick to last a long time it&#x27;s creamy and bright I&#x27;m loving it this summer</li>
    <li> I loved this lipstick. I am normally not a lipstick girl much less a PURPLE lipstick girl. I go for a more neutral look. But I put this on and fell in love and so did the husband. Though he liked it better on my than on him! ;) This was easy to apply and only needed to put more on when I was done with eating. I was lucky enough to get this in a Vox Box.</li>
    <li> I received this product in my IDOVoxBox and all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this color and it&#x27;s not usually a color I would purchase. I wanted to try it out anyways. It&#x27;s really not that bad on me and I kind of liked it. I don&#x27;t know that I would ever wear it day to day but maybe a special occasion. I do like that it does last long. Once you go throughout your day, it fades to a pinkish color and leaves a stain on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked this lipstick but I don&#x27;t think this was the color for me. I think that I would like to try other colors in this lipstick because it is long lasting.</li>
    <li> Nice loved the color stayed on all day! would recommend this to anyone! I tested this product for free but these are my own opinion of this product!</li>
    <li> Influenster sent me Classic Tan (too yellow) foundation and Violet Vixen (too blue) lipstick for testing and commenting. When you blot Violet Vixen, it goes from a blue violet to a pink plum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick lived up to expectations. It was easy to apply, blended evenly and felt great. I apply Violet Vixen, blot off the grayness and add pink gloss. This lipstick did NOT make me sneeze or itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violet Vixen is too gray for warm-toned bronze and brown skin, but would look great on a cool-toned ebony complexion. If you&#x27;re closer to my complexion try Fireball, Red Siren or Red Revenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree #GetItFree #FreeSamples https://www.influenster.com/r/974505?utm_campaign&#x3D;sum</li>
    <li> I received this in my VoxBox from influenster.com and fell in love. At first I was a little concerned about the color but it does not wear as bright as would be expected. On my first day I put it on at ten o&#x27;clock, went to lunch and then was surprised at one when it was still in place and hadn&#x27;t faded or smudged. The wear time is super long and the color is wonderful. Definite recommendation.</li>
    <li> I received this item from Covergirl for free but all my opinions are my own. I received vixen violet, which if i&#x27;m honest is not a color i would typically buy. However, I am trying to make it work. The biggest miss on this item is the stain it leaves behind. The stain is both a good and bad thing. The stain will allow your lips hold the color longer, however it leaves behind a hot pick color as opposed to a purple color. Overall, the feel of the lipstick is nice. it does have a typical lipstick smell, but you can&#x27;t smell it on your lips. I would definitely go and check out other colors in this line.</li>
    <li> I instantly fell in love with this lipstick very moisturizing and a perfect match for my skin I received so many compliments on this lipstick I received it free from influenster for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I felt that this lipstick went on smoothly and lasted for hours. The only downside to this was that I felt it dried out my lips. I had to put lip balm over my lips several times throughout the day to keep them moisturized.</li>
    <li> One word- OBSESSED! I absolutely love this lipstick, it lasts extremely long and the color is true.  It goes on very smooth and keeps my lips moisturized.  I received this as a free sample from influentser.com and i think this is may favorite item sent thus far.  (although they are all really good)</li>
    <li> *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster* I typically do not buy lipsticks from Covergirl. Partly because I don&#x27;t wear a lot of lipstick because it always come off when I eat or drink coffee. This shade surprised me; I was a little nervous looking at it in the tube, but when I put it on it was a vivid but wearable purple. I think it would look good on many skin tones, and would work in all seasons, but especially summer or winter. The lasting power was good, even though I was eating and drinking. I even got a compliment from my waiter at lunch!! I will definitely consider buying lipsticks in this line again.</li>
    <li> I thought that the lipstick color was exciting, different than other colors that I have tried. Unfortunately it was a little too bright for me. If I only applied it lightly the color was fine but it didn&#x27;t stay on. If I applied it more generously the color was too much but lasted a little longer. Unfortunately the color did not outlast some other types that I have and I had to apply it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received this product for  testing from influester but the review of this product is my own opinion&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received free this in my VoxBox from Influenster but these opinions are entirely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thoughts...purple...I like purple...but for my lips? I don&#x27;t know about this...I&#x27;m really pale. But my duty was to try it, so I did. And I very surprisingly actually really liked it! I put a pic below so you can see what it looks like on a pale skin.  I am going to have my niece who has a darker skin give it a try and see how it looks on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a win for me though!</li>
    <li> I generally don&#x27;t buy lipstick, so I was a little hesitant to try this one. The purple color can be a bit over the top so I&#x27;m going to focus on the lipstick itself. It felt like it was going to be dry but rubbing lips together a few times proved that to be wrong. The lipstick feels smooth and lasted all day long! Definitely would try other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cover girl product for free to review, but that does not influence my opinion</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very basic girl when it comes to make up: little eye shadow, eye liner, mascara, and some blush and I&#x27;m out the door. When I received this lipstick in my #IDoVoxBox from Influenster I was very timid to use it. My first opinion of it was &amp;#34;Wow that&#x27;s a dark color for my light skin and small lips&amp;#34; (I barely have a top lip). The next morning I tried it for the first time and was so happy the color wasn&#x27;t as dark as it looks. It looks like it will be a deep purple but really it&#x27;s a light fuchsia, lavender color and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a week straight and have gotten lots of compliments. It makes my non-existent lips look plump and lasts the entire day at work (8 hours). I will definitely be trying more shades of this brand. Thanks Influenster!!</li>
    <li> At first I was shocked by how the color looked in the tube - I thought it was going to be terrible BUT I am happy to announce that it looks amazing. The color looks so good on my lips I am so surprised. It is not as purple as it looks, instead it is a deep pink/red - awesome. I love it.</li>
    <li> I received this as part of the influenster I Do vox box. I have never used cover girl lip products and was very excited to try this product out. The color was really fun and it was a great addition to my outfit. It went on smooth and not cakey. And it didn&#x27;t fade easily and lasted for a good majority of the day! I would recommend this to my friends to try. I will definitely be buying this in other colors.</li>
    <li> I received this product free to try through the I Do VoxBox from Influesnter. Opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the color I just feel like I have to reapply to often, but I find that if i mix it with another lipstick of like colors it last longer, or if i put fundation on under it and it helps a lot. I love that its not sticky or cakey. I would recommend it to a friend if they were going to use it along with a lip-gloss.</li>
    <li> the formula was creamer then expected i dont have many lipstick so am not an expert but i do have A few wet and wilds and its way better then them it didnt irrated me in any way like any non stain lip stick you have to occasionally apply the color looks differnt way differnt on then what they look like in the tube so in my opion this collection is a must try on before purchase  i tested your COVERGIRL products for free, but all opinions are my own. i would purchase another one in the future</li>
