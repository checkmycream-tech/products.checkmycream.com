    <li> Great product serves its purpose and looks beautiful not your basic wig head.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to display my handmade projects.</li>
    <li> Love my new manne. Just as described in the post. I will be putting this mannequin to good use. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these in fleshtone/African American. They were shipped timely and packaged well. The mannequin heads are of great quality, large and perfect for my wigs. Will purchase more if needed.</li>
    <li> Service was great,came to my house the next day I was very pleased,she has eyelashes which is very cute and holes in her ears for earrings her neck is nice and long.Thanks,so glad I purchased this item.</li>
    <li> I loved the manequin head it was exactly what I wanted for my work! I use it to make my wigs for my customers</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just joined the wig wagon (got tired of the daily fuss)! I invested in a really nice human hair wig and wanted a quality display....at a reasonable price of course! This was that and more! It shipped fast too. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this. As I add to my wig collection, I&#x27;ll buy more for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought Tina and another one maybe her name is Megan. They are wonderful and display my products very pleasantly. Beautiful dummies.</li>
    <li> This mannequin head is attractive and very sturdy. It holds my wigs fine without toppling over. I really like her so far!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my needs</li>
    <li> Will still use it, but the color of mannequin was not as shown in the photo. The color was lighter than what the photograph shows. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Came very wrll wrapped snd on time,  beautiful face that compliments my product.</li>
    <li> This is for Jewlery display. The neck line is not quite right and it has no ears. You have to purchase a wig to to even make it passable as a jewlery display model.</li>
    <li> Product is as advertised, no surprises. A fair price for the value. I&#x27;ve only had mine for a month and I use it to keep my wig secure. If the hair is longer than 16 inches need something taller.</li>
    <li> Great for ladies like myself who wear wigs on a regular or everyday basis. Most of my wigs are about 14&amp;#34; long and this holds them perfectly meaning that the hair does not touch the counter. Love this much more than the syrofoam wig stands sold at beauty supply stores.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these for my wife (I shave my head daily but she didnt want to use me as a mannequin) and she is very impressed with the quality of this item. I see most everyone else stated the product arrived early. My tracking info stated there was a problem with the address and the item may be delayed up to a day. Well the products arrived as scheduled which is a plus. If my wife gives me more info on these I will update the review so far she loves them, she even named them, and I will probably never touch them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product though, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Looks exactly like the pictures</li>
    <li> I love it, can&#x27;t wait to take pictures of my jewelry with it. I would purchase this item again.  I received the item even before it was projected.  It was/is in great condition, brand new.</li>
    <li> I like how fast the mannequin was shipped; love the size and material of the mannequin, and especially love the facial make-up of the mannequin and that you can insert earrings into the ears which is my main reason for purchasing the mannequin for photo shots of jewelry.</li>
    <li> Love my mannequin head. I wished I purchased all three at the same time.</li>
    <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;so nice... made in good quality&lt;br /&gt;the skin is so soft and flawless&lt;br /&gt;worked greaaaat for make up tutorials... didn&#x27;t stain after removing the makeup and was easy to clean it&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply the make up after applying the base on&lt;br /&gt;loooooved it</li>
    <li> The item arrived in good order and well packed. &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62;&amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62;&amp;#60;O&amp;#62; &amp;#60;O&amp;#62;</li>
    <li> This product was great.</li>
    <li> Review on First Order: This Mannequin Head is very good quality, and I am glad that I did purchase it. It is sturdy and solid. However, it arrived with a medium size ink spot (?) on top of its head. Also, I think that it should have been packaged better.  The mannequin head should have been in plastic (or something) and the box it came in was closed up with tape in a way that was rather ship-shod. Maya Beauty was the seller for this first order. Other than that, my experience ordering through Amazon was great.&lt;br /&gt;Review on Second Order: I ordered two more of these mannequin heads and received them on 5/6/2013.  I now realize that this second order came from a different seller than the first order. This time the mannequin heads have a strong unpleasant smell.  Not good at all.  If the smell does not go away in a day or two, I will have to send them back.  I really like these mannequin heads and did not want to go through having to return them.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I was contacted by John from Fashion Display on 5/7/2013, and he told me that normally, any smell would go away \\&quot;after a while\\&quot;.  I do not believe that the unpleasant smell actually comes from the mannequin head, but rather, I think it comes from the styrofoam plastic-like net that covers each mannequin head, and they must have been wrapped in this for quite a while. The smell makes it impossible to use the mannequin heads for now, and it is unclear when exactly the smell would dissipate (if at all).  I gave a rating of one star because the company has refused to return or even exchange the item.</li>
    <li> Love my realistic head. I use it for hats and styling long hair wigs. It arrived sooner than expected. Thanks Amazon your an awesome search engine.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! It makes the wigs I make more sellable!  Will be buying more!</li>
