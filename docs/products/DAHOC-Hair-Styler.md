### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is working for the price very good compare to 10$ softer model that you can find in dance supply store in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>If your good with hair gadgets; buy it.</li>
      <li>I own one of these.  </li>
      <li>Once in they stay put and keep the dancers hair tidy.  </li>
      <li>Magic Foam Sponge Clip Hair</li>
      <li>It seems to be some kind of smooth rubber, so it&#x27;s flexible.  </li>
      <li>I have better luck with making buns via chopsticks, sock or [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>dont buy it if u love yr money</li>
      <li>I probably won&#x27;t spend any more time trying it though, because I&#x27;ve decided to chop it all off into a pixie cut.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s me/ not the product.</li>
      <li>I can easily put my hair up with this.</li>
      <li>Perhaps the size I ordered is too large, but I have been buying this kind of bun styler for years from Claire&#x27;s Boutique.</li>
      <li>Also, I paid about three dollars and the shipping was free, so you might want to shop around.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s pretty secure.  </li>
      <li>However, the main problem I have with it is that the connecting ends are extremely easily seperated.</li>
      <li>It does take a bit of practice to get them in at first.  </li>
      <li>Still trying to  figure out exactly how to use.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, long hair, and this is much too flimsy for even my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good but too small in size.</li>
      <li>Not that they break but my doughter loose them more often.</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced; just as the seller said it was.</li>
      <li>Maybe my manual dexterity leaves much to be desired.</li>
      <li>I really wish I could give it zero stars.</li>
      <li>but I gave it a high rating because it was delivered promptly and the item was as described online.</li>
      <li>I know other reviewers said that it definitely takes some persistence, but I didn&#x27;t really put much time in and gave up pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>My dancers love this product, few or no bobby pins and hairnets required.</li>
      <li>Now, maybe I didn&#x27;t get the exact same product, but the bun tool I received is made completely from a very flimsy and flexible rubber material.</li>
      <li>I like it and it will get some taking used to using again, but the material of the product describes was less than accurate.</li>
      <li>It is made from stiff plastic, and does not bend easily at all.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the same kind Claire&#x27;s used to sell this one is less than half the girth, making my bun look more like a loose, flat pancake.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t understand the directions or if my hair is just not thick enough.</li>
      <li>I think if I use a lot of product and tease my hair it might work, but I&#x27;m looking for something quick and simple to hold my hair up tightly for when I go running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really didn&#x27;t work at all as I expected.</li>
      <li>I had expected this hair piece to be more firm, and less flexible, but it still holds together an up-do fairly decently.</li>
      <li>My hair kept slipping out as I was rolling it, and by the time I got it all rolled back up it didn&#x27;t seem like it could close very well.  </li>
      <li>The instructions come in so many languages on such a small card that I really am having a hard time with learning how to use it.</li>

<li> Not very happy with it so far.</li>
<li> I have long hair past my shoulders, with long layers.  </li>
<li> I have very long hair though, at least halfway down my back.  </li>
<li> Cheap and impossible to use.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s small for long hairs.</li>
<li> It took a few tries to get the hang of it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Other than that, I received the product in about a week and a half.  </li>
<li> If you have long thick hair</li>
<li> Waste of my money.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
<li> I noticed some other reviewers state that this product is made of a hard plastic.</li>
<li> However, the little clasp is a plug style and it can be difficult to connect sometimes once your hair is already wrapped up, so I only give this four stars.  </li>
<li> You have to give it a few tries before you make your decision on the quality of the product because it takes a few fails before you get the hang of it.  </li>
<li> : I suggest that, like me, you spend no more than $3 to find out if it works for you.  </li>

    <li> This was a piece of total crap. If it were not such a pin to send returns, it would have gone back. I gave it to goodwill. Maybe someone else can get it to work. I really wish I could give it zero stars.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but too small in size. Made for small or medium hairs.people having long hair don&#x27;t buy it .  It&#x27;s small for long hairs.</li>
    <li> It did not really work well in my hair because of my layers.</li>
    <li> Cheap and impossible to use.  Would not suggest anyone else spend there money on something that is so impossible to use.</li>
    <li> I own one of these.  It seems to be some kind of smooth rubber, so it&#x27;s flexible.  I&#x27;ve tried the plastic ones and they&#x27;re terrible.  You have to give it a few tries before you make your decision on the quality of the product because it takes a few fails before you get the hang of it.  It does work and it&#x27;s pretty secure.  I had a bit of a difficult time when I first got it because my hair wasn&#x27;t quite long enough.  Let&#x27;s just say that arm pit length is about as short as you want your hair to be for using this.  Shorter than that and it will be difficult to use (althoug it may still work).  However, the little clasp is a plug style and it can be difficult to connect sometimes once your hair is already wrapped up, so I only give this four stars.  Once it&#x27;s in, though, it stays.  Also, I paid about three dollars and the shipping was free, so you might want to shop around.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, long hair, and this is much too flimsy for even my hair.  Perhaps the size I ordered is too large, but I have been buying this kind of bun styler for years from Claire&#x27;s Boutique. Sadly Claire&#x27;s no longer sells them.  If you&#x27;re looking for the same kind Claire&#x27;s used to sell this one is less than half the girth, making my bun look more like a loose, flat pancake.  I think if I use a lot of product and tease my hair it might work, but I&#x27;m looking for something quick and simple to hold my hair up tightly for when I go running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I received the product in about a week and a half.  Also, the packaging is as shown in the picture.  It&#x27;s just hard to tell how thin it is from the angle in the image.</li>
    <li> If you have long thick hair like I do this hair styler is not for you! It just can&#x27;t hold a lot of hair.</li>
    <li> I like it and it will get some taking used to using again, but the material of the product describes was less than accurate. I was looking for a rubbery material for how slick my hair is to hold while doing some part, but it is more of a hard plastic.</li>
    <li> We have several of these that we use for highland dance.  It does take a bit of practice to get them in at first.  Once in they stay put and keep the dancers hair tidy.  My dancers love this product, few or no bobby pins and hairnets required.</li>
    <li> Sucks. Don&#x27;t buy it. It&#x27;s a waste of money. THe rubber doesn&#x27;t bend like that and I don&#x27;t even think it fits together properly.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed AT ALL with this product.  It is made from stiff plastic, and does not bend easily at all.  I have long hair past my shoulders, with long layers.  My hair does not work with this product at all. I&#x27;m assuming that hair needs to be extremely long and one length to work.</li>
    <li> This one does the job for my daughter hair in ballet class. But two ends that will clasp together is hard to push to close  or pull to open. It is working for the price very good compare to 10$ softer model that you can find in dance supply store in USA.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this item coupe of time from amazon. Not that they break but my doughter loose them more often.</li>
    <li> even with instructions on the container, I have no flippin idea how to use this thing. Waste of my money. Ah well it was only a couple dollars anyway.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, nearly waist length hair with a gypsy shag cut (shortest layer above my chin). I can easily put my hair up with this. It took a few tries to get the hang of it. I wrap it from the middle of the pony, wrapping over not under. I can&#x27;t use it to curl my hair but it stays up and is neat looking.</li>
    <li> The instructions come in so many languages on such a small card that I really am having a hard time with learning how to use it. Not very happy with it so far. I hope with practice I can figure it out, I don&#x27;t like wasting my money!</li>
    <li> I noticed some other reviewers state that this product is made of a hard plastic. Now, maybe I didn&#x27;t get the exact same product, but the bun tool I received is made completely from a very flimsy and flexible rubber material. However, the main problem I have with it is that the connecting ends are extremely easily seperated. This probably wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if the rubber were a moldable wire material instead, but as it is, no thank you.</li>
    <li> Another useless product I don&#x27;t know how to use but I gave it a high rating because it was delivered promptly and the item was as described online.</li>
    <li> This really didn&#x27;t work at all as I expected. I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t understand the directions or if my hair is just not thick enough. Don&#x27;t buy it if you don&#x27;t already know it will work for you.</li>
    <li> dont buy it if u love yr money it notworth even 1 penny ...its a piece of plastic not able to hold hair its jst wastage</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t spend long enough with this product to figure it out.  I know other reviewers said that it definitely takes some persistence, but I didn&#x27;t really put much time in and gave up pretty easily.  My hair kept slipping out as I was rolling it, and by the time I got it all rolled back up it didn&#x27;t seem like it could close very well.  I have very long hair though, at least halfway down my back.  I probably won&#x27;t spend any more time trying it though, because I&#x27;ve decided to chop it all off into a pixie cut.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced; just as the seller said it was. Still trying to  figure out exactly how to use. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s me/ not the product. If your good with hair gadgets; buy it.</li>
    <li> I had expected this hair piece to be more firm, and less flexible, but it still holds together an up-do fairly decently.</li>
    <li> Maybe my hair is too heavy or too thick. Maybe my manual dexterity leaves much to be desired. I found this gadget to be great in theory but horrible in practice. For me it was far too flimsy and did not work with my thick, straight, nearly-waist-long hair.  I have better luck with making buns via chopsticks, sock or [[ASIN:B006K9OQSC 4pcs Magic Foam Sponge Clip Hair Styling Donut Bun Former Maker (2 Large+2 Small)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware: I suggest that, like me, you spend no more than $3 to find out if it works for you.  I tried on 4 separate occasions to try to get it to work with a variety of methods to twirl it into a bun... I threw it away this morning.  But since I spent less than $3 I did not feel too bad for it.</li>
