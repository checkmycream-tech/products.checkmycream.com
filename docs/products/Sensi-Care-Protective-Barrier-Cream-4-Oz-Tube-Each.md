      <li>Sensi-care makes the skin smooth and takes the redness away temporarily.  </li>
      <li>It works great enough said</li>
      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money!</li>
      <li>We had this product when our baby was at the hospital, and discovered on accident what an amazing jib it does to clear diaper rashes.</li>
      <li>Works ok fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It was doing such a good job</li>
      <li>Was hoping for 10.00 that it would work as good as the last time I purchased this.</li>
      <li>Improvement after first application!</li>
      <li>This stuff is definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>The top segment is by far the most effective but for cost or technical reasons is practical only for acute/short-term use.</li>
      <li>I use this on my elderly mother and it is easy to apply and protects her sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product when my daughter was in the hospital for RSV.</li>
      <li>I wish I would have known about this with our first child.</li>
      <li>My son had his first diaper rash situation at around 9 months and my pediatrician recommended this stuff.</li>
      <li>Will definitely order more as needed.</li>
      <li>No other diaper rash ointment was helping, but I could tell a huge difference after one use of Sensicare.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since I had 4 more rounds to go and the tube that I was sent home with was getting empty, I needed something to keep going</li>
      <li>It really soothes irritated skin.</li>
      <li>It really helps with the diaper rash for my 22 month old!!!</li>
      <li>I found the product much more stiff and kind of lumpy from other times</li>
      <li>And my tube lasted a good 6 months since it usually cleared up right away instead of having to constantly reapply.</li>
      <li>Just wondered if it was somewhat older or&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>We had never heard of this product however when my daughter was in the nicu after birth, they used this instead of a normal diaper rash cream.</li>
      <li>It is nice and thick.</li>
      <li>My son has Hirschsprung&#x27;s Disease with a shortened Colon and anus, and thus, goes to the bathroom a lot which on its&#x27; own causes him to get very raw and sore...</li>
      <li>Our daughter has super sensitive skin and this really works on her diaper area, first sign of redness use it and then next diaper red is gone.</li>
      <li>At the first sign of redness it is on our child and we only have to use it once or twice.  </li>
      <li>My 89-year old mother is bedridden and must rear adult diapers.  </li>
      <li>cost/benefit bargain in the group is EQUATE 40% (as far as I know, a Walmart brand) at about $2.80 for 4 oz tube.</li>
      <li>She developed a severe diaper rash a couple of months ago.  </li>
      <li>If yourself or your child doesn&#x27;t have my son&#x27;s problem, however, and doesn&#x27;t go as frequently this may work if your skin has a CHANCE to heal.</li>
      <li>It is not too hard to wash off as long as you use soap and warm water.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, nothing seems to actually cure the condition completely, but I&#x27;m hoping with consistent use this product may be able to do the job.</li>
      <li>The product I had is the same as in this container with new graphics.</li>
      <li>(Dollar General stores)&lt;br</li>
      <li>Mom&#x27;s skin is so fragile that so far this is the brand that they used in the hospital</li>
      <li>To this day, it is the ONLY product that has worked for my daughters sensitive skin.</li>

<li> I have not tried all the typical diaper rash and the specialized protective barrier products.</li>
<li> Sensi-CARE 3 typically runs about $9-10 for 4 oz and is a bargain @ $6-7 (shipping included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Snsi care was given to me in the hospital when after my secound round of chemo, I came down with diarrea and was there for  days.&lt;br</li>
<li> this product was a lot cheaper than expected too!!!</li>
<li> The only thing that worked when my baby had diaper rash with broken skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> We had this product when our baby was at the hospital, and discovered on accident what an amazing jib it does to clear diaper rashes. Seriously this will clear up a rash overnight. My wife and I swear by it. We use this as a backup cream so as not to waste, and use other creams as maintenance.</li>
    <li> It works great enough said</li>
    <li> really great for any type of skin rash  my elderly mother uses it &amp; loves it</li>
    <li> Best diaper cream! It was used on my baby in the nicu. If I see a little red I put it on and its gone in a day!</li>
    <li> There wasn&#x27;t a better cream for us. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> We use this as a protective barrier around our son&#x27;s g-tube.  It is the perfect concentration of zinc and consistency.  The smell is not as bad as the higher zinc concentration product we tried.</li>
    <li> Thick like toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Yes  I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
    <li> I have tried several types of barrier creams I find Sensi Care to be the best.</li>
    <li> Great product fast service no problems at all</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for clearing up diaper rash for babies. Within 1-2 diaper changes, the redness is gone everytime. I only use this for bad rashes, but it really is an amazing cream.</li>
    <li> Works ok fast shipping. Was hoping for 10.00 that it would work as good as the last time I purchased this. The manufacturer hanged packaging and I think slightly altered the lotion.</li>
    <li> Helped heal pressure sore</li>
    <li> Mom&#x27;s skin is so fragile that so far this is the brand that they used in the hospital and it helps.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my baby to get rid of her diaper rash and it works perfect. I would buy more if I have to.</li>
    <li> Excellent product to prevent skin breakdown in bedridden.</li>
    <li> Our daughter has super sensitive skin and this really works on her diaper area, first sign of redness use it and then next diaper red is gone.</li>
    <li> love this item it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> My 89-year old mother is bedridden and must rear adult diapers.  She developed a severe diaper rash a couple of months ago.  This product is the best that I have tried to date (I probably tried 10-12 products plus 2-3 home-made creams).  Sensi-care makes the skin smooth and takes the redness away temporarily.  The barrier seems to help keep the area dry and protected.  Unfortunately, nothing seems to actually cure the condition completely, but I&#x27;m hoping with consistent use this product may be able to do the job.</li>
    <li> This is an item I would not want to be without.</li>
    <li> THE PEOPLE WHO USE IT LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> A family member told me about this lotion that is used by hospital staff. I purchased it and sadly my son had a reaction to it. I guess he got my sensitive skin. :( We rehomed it to a family member with an infant who doesn&#x27;t show any issues using it.</li>
    <li> Must have product for when diaper rash appears</li>
    <li> Covers area needed and stays on to protect.  Extremely thick like caulk but does the job.</li>
    <li> Snsi care was given to me in the hospital when after my secound round of chemo, I came down with diarrea and was there for  days.&lt;br /&gt;Since I had 4 more rounds to go and the tube that I was sent home with was getting empty, I needed something to keep going and I could not find this PRODUCT IN THE LOCAL STORES.  So I had to order it.  THANK GOD IT DID NOT COST ME  $10.00 for product and $10.00 for shipping yet to boot.  I was going to go into a baby&#x27;s product called butt paste as the last resort..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or go for chemo at the hospital and go to the floor I was on and beg to buy a tube.  Like I said could notfind a store that had itonthe shelve.</li>
    <li> I use this on my elderly mother and it is easy to apply and protects her sensitive skin.  Worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to prevent chafing and pressure sores for the bedridden patient. It really soothes irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I have not tried all the typical diaper rash and the specialized protective barrier products.

The top segment is by far the most effective but for cost or technical reasons is practical only for acute/short-term use. The prices on Ebay for Sensi-Care 3 amount to extortion. The other groupings are by effectiveness level only and are separated only where I could detect a marked difference in performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost/benefit bargain in the group is EQUATE 40% (as far as I know, a Walmart brand) at about $2.80 for 4 oz tube. Sensi-CARE 3 typically runs about $9-10 for 4 oz and is a bargain @ $6-7 (shipping included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Sensi-Care 3 on Ebay, not on Amazon.</li>
    <li> NICU nurse here. We use this in the hospital when the babies bottoms get bad.  I recommended it to my sister and bought it for her.  It help my poor little niece.</li>
    <li> This was used to prevent my mom from getting another pressure ulcer in the coccyx area.  So far so good.  They used the same product at the hospital.  Because this product is thicker, it works better than some products with more zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> Nothing works better than this on diaper rash! We tried all sorts of different products, but only Sensicare cleared it up in less than a day.</li>
    <li> Better diaper rash cream than even what the doctor prescribed!</li>
    <li> This is the best diaper cream we&#x27;ve ever used. If my baby&#x27;s bum gets raw I put a thick layer of this stuff on and by morning she&#x27;s good as new. This stuff is definitely worth the price. And my tube lasted a good 6 months since it usually cleared up right away instead of having to constantly reapply.</li>
    <li> Desitin had been suggest for post-op issues, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. This one is pasty, works,and has NO odor.  Great for my sensitive skin and picky olfactory issues.  Not to mention there is no allergic response.</li>
    <li> I found the product much more stiff and kind of lumpy from other times I purchased it.  Just wondered if it was somewhat older or&lt;br /&gt;from another source.  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Regina Pritchard</li>
    <li> Horrible stuff, I hate to give a bad review but this is like muddy sandpaper and my poor bedridden mom got her first bum rash with it! I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for diaper rash. It is not too thick, goes on and stays on. Wiping off is easy is as well. Much better than others out there</li>
    <li> Works great on protecting against butt-skin breakdown.</li>
    <li> It is fine and we appreciate the prompt service.</li>
    <li> It really helps with the diaper rash for my 22 month old!!! Nothing else seeemed to work but this</li>
    <li> Great Stuff for skin care.</li>
    <li> Much better than any store bought brands.. Diaper Rash disappears in a day.. Even the bad ones.. Kiddo hasnt had diaper rash since we started using this product.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product when my daughter was in the hospital for RSV. She developed a bad diaper rash and this was what the hospital provided to help clear it up. This worked like magic. It is the only cream that stays in place after multiple diaper changes. So happy I can find it on Amazon. I love it!</li>
    <li> We had never heard of this product however when my daughter was in the nicu after birth, they used this instead of a normal diaper rash cream. I will never use anything else! It clears a bad rash overnight!</li>
    <li> We got this product from the NICU when our son was in the hospital.  At the first sign of redness it is on our child and we only have to use it once or twice.  I wish I would have known about this with our first child.</li>
    <li> It healed a sore butt. It is nice and thick. It is good for someone who must sit or lay most of the time.</li>
    <li> This cream was used while my husband was in the hospital and they sent the tube home with him. It was doing such a good job I ordered some fro  Amazon and have been very pleased with the results. Will definitely order more as needed.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a family friend and it is a great barrier for the bottom of adults that need severe protection this product was a lot cheaper than expected too!!!</li>
    <li> I got a tube of this during a hospital stay, and didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. Later, when my shoe was rubbing a sore on my foot, I applied this. It worked great. The product I had is the same as in this container with new graphics.</li>
    <li> Yes, perfect, been using it for awhile. It work great!!</li>
    <li> This product was thick but do not assume that it will adhere to the skin like Ilex! It does not. I was hoping it would as at the time I bought it, Ilex was back ordered through the manufacturer. My son has Hirschsprung&#x27;s Disease with a shortened Colon and anus, and thus, goes to the bathroom a lot which on its&#x27; own causes him to get very raw and sore...it&#x27;s terrible and he&#x27;s in so much pain - Ilex is all that works. Literally. Tried this since I couldn&#x27;t get that and this literally did nothing for him. As soon as he pooped again (he goes so often the skin doesn&#x27;t have a chance to heal), the cream came off with the poop. If yourself or your child doesn&#x27;t have my son&#x27;s problem, however, and doesn&#x27;t go as frequently this may work if your skin has a CHANCE to heal.</li>
    <li> The only thing that worked when my baby had diaper rash with broken skin. Improvement after first application!</li>
    <li> The barrier cream works well. It is not too hard to wash off as long as you use soap and warm water. Some of the creams just won&#x27;t come off all the way no matter what. It does the job of protecting the skin pretty good. It has no odor. It doesn&#x27;t slide and spread around like some of the creams do either.</li>
    <li> Great barrier protection against bed sores. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a nurse at my pediatricians office. To this day, it is the ONLY product that has worked for my daughters sensitive skin. Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried everything! You will notice a difference after using just one time!</li>
    <li> Good product, good quality.</li>
    <li> This cream was used on my elderly mother during her hospital stays and appear to help protect her skin from irritation.</li>
    <li> My son had his first diaper rash situation at around 9 months and my pediatrician recommended this stuff. I&#x27;m so glad that he did because it worked like a charm! No other diaper rash ointment was helping, but I could tell a huge difference after one use of Sensicare. It&#x27;s gritty in texture so I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis, but will always use this from now on for any diaper rash.</li>
    <li> This worked wonders on my infant&#x27;s diaper rash, when nothing else did.</li>
