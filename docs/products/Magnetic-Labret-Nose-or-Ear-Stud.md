    <li> Way too big and the magnet keeps movie. You can tell that it&#x27;s fake from far it&#x27;s just so huge and the magnet is even bigger</li>
    <li> These look so real, love it! I bought two.</li>
    <li> Works well on your nose although I&#x27;m scared it will get stuck BAHAHAHA but do not buy if for your lip if you have braces because it will just get stuck to those instead of staying on your lip since its magnetic</li>
    <li> I bought this product to convince my parents to let me get a Monroe piercing, unfortunately my braces interfered with the magnet causing me to not be able to wear it on my lip. So I put it on my nose and it works great as a nose piercing! The magnet is super strong and it looks completely real!</li>
    <li> It is a really good magnet and very comfortable! If you&#x27;re looking to use this as a nose stud I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, but works great as monroe or cartilage piercing!</li>

    <li> No it didn&#x27;t work right</li>
    <li> Its cute but the ring is too big and the magnet is way too big. You can kinda tell its fake, but not really. I still wear it anyway. Works good with big noses.</li>
    <li> a bad purchase. It is impossible to wear it on lip, since it keeps falling and there is big chance that you can swallow the magnet.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all, it kept falling off, couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
    <li> This product was the worst. The magnetic pieces did not work at all. I wanted to use it as a Monroe piercing and it was just bad. My advice is to just get the real thing. Also it was super TINY i could barley even see it. Not worth it.</li>
