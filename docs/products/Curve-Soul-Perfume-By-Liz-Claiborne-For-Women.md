<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I truly do enjoy the fragrance, soft, subtle, and oh so romantic, it is a Sexy Guy Magnet... Try it, you will like it!</li>
    <li> This, to me, is the most wonderful scent in the world and I am not being extreme! It is so clean and such a beautiful smell. It has natural phermones in it and I get complimented on it EVERY SINGLE DAY!  It&#x27;s also a plus with the husband because he loves me wearing it just as much as I enjoy it! It is by far a great product!</li>
    <li> Smells great. Arrived early. Im happy</li>
    <li> This is another fragrance that I purchased based on reviews without having smelled the scent myself.  Lucky for me, this was another very successful blind buy for me. Hooray! I smell the fresh, crisp scent of the bamboo and lotus almost from the second after my first spritz. I didn&#x27;t have any alcohol-like scent to endure when I first sprayed like I do with so many fragrances. The fresh smell is intoxicating! I don&#x27;t tolerate the heat well at all, so I&#x27;ve already begun my long season of staying indoors most all the time. What a splendid experience it is to be able to spritz this on as often as I like...which is like the best, most divine smells of the warmer months outdoors, without having to step outside my door. The fresh scent lasts longer than these types of notes usually do on me, which is a real treat. After a little while I start to detect a faint freesia, as well as the heart notes of glorious heliotrope and tiger lily. YUMMY! I am still enjoying this gorgeous, harmonious blend when I notice a faint, but comforting musk. Wow! This is going to be one of my all-time favorites, I can tell. I can&#x27;t wait until the scent starts to fade so I can indulge in a fresh spritz! Highly, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys green, fresh, clean and somewhat floral fragrances. I don&#x27;t think this one is going to disappoint anybody. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> So much cheaper than at the mall! Awesome</li>
    <li> I added this bottle to the paris Hilton fragrance that I provided to him for his mom , no complaints just perfection.</li>
    <li> I had googled perfumes that smell like queen latifah perfume, this came up,tried it, nothing good to the smell about it,  yuk</li>
    <li> This scent is so intoxicating! I love that its a strong, long lasting scent with a clean finish.  The notes pair so well together. I&#x27;d recommend this scent to anyone 21+ This scent may get you into trouble if you have a boyfriend or husband! ;-):-)</li>
    <li> This is s nice smelling perfume it seems to last and it is not to overpowering .The perfume is a good value and I will recomend it to other buyers c.m.</li>
    <li> I love Liz Claiborne products and was looking for a new fragrance.  After reading the great reviews on Amazon and seeing the reasonable price, I decided to order it.  This has now become my favorite fragrance!  It is a nice sized bottle.  Like many of the other reviews say, I too am getting compliments on the scent as I wear it to work every day.  One of my co-workers purchased it also after smelling the scent on me and she is now wearing it too (luckily, we don&#x27;t sit next to each other!).  It is not an overpowering scent and smells like no other perfume I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Its a soft sexy scent that lasts all day without re-applying. I simply love it, and its a great way to express yourself.</li>
    <li> Great smelling perfume</li>
    <li> i think this perfume is unique and i love the smell!!</li>
    <li> I love Curve fragrances. It was a no brainer when I saw this product, its price, and its reviews. However I CANT wear it. Its probably my chemistry but it smells awful on me!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nice but not at all long lasting!</li>
    <li> The scent was not what I expected. It is also very strong. I recommend not more than 1 spray. Lol.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all.It&#x27;s a car freshener now:/</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  It has a very fresh smell to it.  In this case, what you see is what you get.  It&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It practially has no scent at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean it&#x27;s just so light that it does not make any difference. The packaging is very nice though, and I like the bottle. But that&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not offensive, but nor is it impressive. What am I supposed to say about a perfume that just has a whiff of a smell and nothing more? Curve Soul is not my kind of perfume :(</li>
    <li> I like all curve perfumes for women, but this is one I had not tried yet. It smells so good! And lasts a good while. The product arrived on schedule and the company that did the shipping included with the order a free sample of another perfume (which also smells great! ), and a free small comb and mirror combination. Also, I got a coupon for an under eye cream treatment and also a free sample of that as well! And also, walmart sells the same perfume and it was way cheaper here on amazon!</li>
    <li> better than i thought for the price! smells great ! lasts a  long time and i always get compliments on it !!</li>
    <li> I like this perfume because it has a light and airy scent. It does last a while and the price was very good.I will buy again.</li>
    <li> good! I like it and may buy it as a gift for my friend or my mother. It is gentle smell.</li>
    <li> lovely and sweety smelling. I think this can be worned everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Not regret buying it since the price it not expensive.</li>
    <li> I felt kind of disappointed.  The real Curve Soul Vintage smells gloriously clean and fresh.  This one does not, not anything like the Vintage.  So, if you want Vintage, get the one in the purple box!  And get the bigger size, 3.4 oz, well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because for the price the fragrance was okay. I would probably recommend.  That is all I have to write about it.</li>
    <li> I received what I&#x27;ve ordered and it came faster than I had expected it to.I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> i like the scent , but it wasn&#x27;t me i gave it to my niece</li>
    <li> This scent is soo beautiful, light floral and sweet!! I am so happy with my purchase. It smells like a very expensive bottle of perfect and for the price you can&#x27;t beat this! Reminds me of spring and summer by the blooming sweet garden fields with a nice hint of sweetness and light aroma. Warms the soul ++++++</li>
    <li> Love the smell, very good price. I have received several compliments after wearing the perfume. I would highly purchase this item again in the future.</li>
    <li> Floral, fresh good for warm day and casual occasion. Nothing spectacular,I find it kind of generic, but I like to wear it on warm days. I think is the kind of fragrance that can be worn almost everywhere.</li>
    <li> Not her signature smell. Not like in the mall either. Not sure how, but this must have been a watered down knock off.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent if you are looking for something that is mild but not too strong. However, I gave it 4 stars because I sprayed the perfume on my arm and 3-4 hours later the smell seem to have disappeared. If you are looking for something to last a bit longer, this is not for you!!</li>
    <li> The aroma is soft. It is perfect after bath or day.</li>
    <li> Awesome stocking stuffer and soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> i just recieved this perfume .  for this price its pretty decent, nice clean smell, also it came with a violet lovely mirror &amp;lt;3 im very pleased</li>
    <li> My sister in law showed me her little bottle which it costed her $30 and I love the smell too, it&#x27;s very soft and not too harsh can&#x27;t believe the price compared from Macy&#x27;s</li>
