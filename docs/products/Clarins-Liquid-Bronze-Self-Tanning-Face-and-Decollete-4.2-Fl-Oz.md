      <li>It gave a pretty even tan and was easy to apply.</li>
      <li>(didn&#x27;t read the description very closely) but this product ended up working just fine.  </li>
      <li>Esecially great for year round face and neck color</li>
      <li>It gives me a nice facial glow.</li>
      <li>One nickel sized dollop on my face every morning after showering gives me the most natural tan glow.</li>
      <li>everyone want to know how I have such a nice tan all the time</li>
      <li>WORTH THE PRICE</li>
      <li>I have tan (Mediterranean ) skin to begin with, but this just kicks it up to a golden glow.</li>
      <li>Even if you are pale white, this will do a wonderful job  follow directions and enjoy  </li>
      <li>Very good and subtle.  </li>
      <li>gives me just the right tan.  </li>
      <li>A little pricey, but works better than many others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I have tried at least 10-15 self tanners over the years and this is the best by far.</li>

      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my legs.</li>
      <li>Bronze tan look not fake orange like Mytsic Tan booths leave you.</li>
      <li>The Clarins product did streak no matter how many different ways and cottons pads I used.</li>
      <li>I usually use an exfoliating face wash before bed, put this on with my fingertips, and it goes on perfectly smooth, even and very easily.</li>
      <li>I use this all year long to give my face a bit more color (I am fare skinned).  </li>
      <li>If you want soft and pretty color, buy this!</li>

      <li>Perfect when you need that glow after a cold, sunless winter.</li>
      <li>Not too much.</li>
      <li>When it starts to fade, it gets very splotchy</li>
      <li>The most natural looking facial tanner that exists.</li>
      <li>so you have to make sure you use it about every other day.  </li>
      <li>Clarins is a little pricier than most other brands but it definitely produces a superior result.</li>
      <li>anyone who wants a natural sun kissed color.</li>
      <li>Looks very natural..  </li>
      <li>Very natural.</li>
      <li>This is a good bronzer compared to other brands, however, I did feel like my face was a little greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have even used this a few hours before a special occasion, let it dry for a half hour or so, and you can easily apply your makeup right over it.</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to get a little golden glow going on up there.  </li>
      <li>Always get compliments about how I look naturally tan with it.</li>
      <li>It is also a thinner consistency like milk instead of a thick gooey gel which means it results in a more natural colour.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for the last week and my skin is SO soft and the tan looks very natural.  </li>
      <li>This facial tanner is natural,  subtle, pretty and golden.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a pinkish yellow color and doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
      <li>It looks very natural as long as you get it on even.  </li>
      <li>with all self tanners, at least I take great care (you don&#x27;t need a lot) to put it on very evenly and continue down my neck (as with make-up) on my ears (as I wear my hair short) and behind my head.</li>
      <li>It gives a weird very light color that doesn&#x27;t look like a tan.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product .0</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Lightweight and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.  The results are a nice golden color, and hardly any smell.  I have tried tons of self tanners.  Expensive but lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> have used this self tanning liquid for about 2 years.  gives me just the right tan.  everyone want to know how I have such a nice tan all the time</li>
    <li> Very good and subtle.  You don&#x27;t look like Stooge Beohner --  &amp;#34;orange man who leaks.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Save your money and go with Jergens. The Clarins product did streak no matter how many different ways and cottons pads I used. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> great product! I apply this when I want a little boost of color. Great formula and my husband likes the smell :)</li>
    <li> I actually thought I was buying a product to use on my entire body!  (didn&#x27;t read the description very closely) but this product ended up working just fine.  A little product goes a long way,  so I didn&#x27;t have to use very much to cover my legs. It gave a pretty even tan and was easy to apply. I am very pale so I am very cautious when buying self tanning products because they can look Really horrible and streaky. But this product worked great and I didn&#x27;t have the awful sunless tanning smell!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10 years. Very natural. It is not a deep tanning product. I use it year round. It gives me a nice facial glow.</li>
    <li> Have been using this self tanner on my face for years and it has been my favorite!! I receive many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I would do if I couldn&#x27;t find this. Perfect for the tanning bed, or to extend a tan. Bronze tan look not fake orange like Mytsic Tan booths leave you. In a word, FANTASTIC!</li>
    <li> I have always loved Clarins products.  In fact I used their Huille Tonic through both of my pregnancies and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks.  This is a good bronzer compared to other brands, however, I did feel like my face was a little greasy.  Still better than most others.</li>
    <li> This is the best self tanner on the market. Not too dark and works great! I&#x27;ve been using it for 15years+</li>
    <li> The most natural looking facial tanner that exists. Smells great and lasts for a while. One recommendation, don&#x27;t get a peel, microdermabrasion or harsh scrub and not expect this tanning lotion to not Bloch or come off.</li>
    <li> Great product,have used it for years!</li>
    <li> I got this self tanner around one or two years ago and I would not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While applying the smell is horrendous and it does not go away wishing 3 days even if you take long showers or baths. Since I&#x27;m naturally rather pale this tanner makes my skin only orange or yellow and not &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;. In addition the price is rediculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to throw this product away.</li>
    <li> Did not like this bronzer.  It darkened spots on my face which made them stand out.  And the color was very artificial.  There are so many other brands on the market that are so much better and more cost effective, i.e. Jergens.</li>
    <li> The reviews were so good for this, but I don&#x27;t like it at all. It gives a weird very light color that doesn&#x27;t look like a tan. It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; like the reviews claim. It&#x27;s like a pinkish yellow color and doesn&#x27;t look natural. I look sick when I use it. There are lots of good face tan products out there that work better. Save your money! You also can&#x27;t put makeup on after it develops unless you wash your face or you&#x27;ll look shiny.</li>
    <li> Worked well, didn&#x27;t have a bad odor!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It does not substitute for a moisturizer. One nickel sized dollop on my face every morning after showering gives me the most natural tan glow. I always get compliments on my tan, which is completely due to this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful. The bottle lasts about 6 months with daily application. Wash your hands after applying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the color. It looks very natural as long as you get it on even.  Having said that, there is no tint so makes it hard to tell where you have put it.  When it starts to fade, it gets very splotchy so you have to make sure you use it about every other day.  Also, it is expensive for how much you get.</li>
    <li> A little pricey, but works better than many others I&#x27;ve used.  If you put too much on, it can have a bit of a yellowish tint, but otherwise, great.</li>
    <li> Clarins is a little pricier than most other brands but it definitely produces a superior result. I have used it in its various iterations through the years and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used this self tanning cream (only on my face) for oh! forever! and I adore it! It is so natural looking and easy to apply. There is no smell.&lt;br /&gt;As with all self tanners, at least I take great care (you don&#x27;t need a lot) to put it on very evenly and continue down my neck (as with make-up) on my ears (as I wear my hair short) and behind my head. It casts a beautiful golden (not fake orange) shade.  Does not come off on your clothes, of course I wait some time for it to settle in. Usually I wear some bronzer, eye-make-up a coral/red lipstick and no powder and I&#x27;m off. When you wash your face at night, it&#x27;s like there was nothing there! You can use it on your body, but I wouldn&#x27;t waste it - I use something else.</li>
    <li> I have tried at least 10-15 self tanners over the years and this is the best by far. You can control the level of tan you want by applying once, twice, or several times in a week and not break out from the chemicals. Their formula is great because its non-irritating or greasy like so many of them are. It is also a thinner consistency like milk instead of a thick gooey gel which means it results in a more natural colour. Although it is not cheap, it lasts a LONG time because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The product is very thin and runny.  I stopped using it after a week.</li>
    <li> Seem to give me a little tanning glow.  Not too much. Am enjoying my tan!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on the skin too.</li>
    <li> I use this all year long to give my face a bit more color (I am fare skinned).  It does not have a yucky smell and goes on nicely with NO streaking.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with my moisturizer before applying face foundation.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> Clarins self tanner for the face is a fairly good product.  It&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as is advertised, but it goes on easily and you don&#x27;t need much to get a little golden glow going on up there.  It tends to highlight any skin aberrations more so than sun or bed tanning, but in fairness all the creams do so.  3.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about this product. Perfect when you need that glow after a cold, sunless winter. I usually use an exfoliating face wash before bed, put this on with my fingertips, and it goes on perfectly smooth, even and very easily. NEVER have I had an instance of it looking streaky. Always get compliments about how I look naturally tan with it. Just make sure to wash your hands after application, and it is perfect! Smells nice and leaves your face moisturized. I have even used this a few hours before a special occasion, let it dry for a half hour or so, and you can easily apply your makeup right over it. Wonderful product will never try another self tanner again!</li>
    <li> All of Clarin&#x27;s bronzers are fantastic.  Including this one.</li>
    <li> Very subtle change in skin color but enough to make it worth it. Very light scent.</li>
    <li> This gives you great, natural looking tan. One application gives you a nice glow, 2 applications gives you more of a tanned look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every day for the last week and my skin is SO soft and the tan looks very natural.  This stuff is fool-proof; not like other self-tanners I&#x27;ve used. The scent is light and the texture of the moisturizer is milky and creamy. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product anyone looking for a great, easy to use self-tanner.</li>
    <li> Gives a very nice color to the face and neck.  Looks very natural..  I am always pleased with Clarins products.</li>
    <li> Excellent for a natural looking tan and gentle on the skin</li>
    <li> I have learned to wash my hands well and to blend it in- if so- everything is great.  Just be careful or you will end up with stained areas on your fingers if you don&#x27;t use an applicator and a neck line if you don&#x27;t rub it in. Good color though- looks natural.</li>
    <li> Great smell, nice color on the skin, better than Jergens and Dr Hoffman towels by a mile. Esecially great for year round face and neck color</li>
    <li> This product works but has it limitations.  I can cause darking spots on face and doesn&#x27;t do a good job of bronzing.  It smells good</li>
    <li> This facial tanner is natural,  subtle, pretty and golden. It is everything that the orange facial tanners are not. I have tan (Mediterranean ) skin to begin with, but this just kicks it up to a golden glow. If you are looking for a deep bronzey vacation tan, do not buy this. If you want soft and pretty color, buy this! Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t smell or leave that sticky residue either. I give it 5 stars. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> All Clarins Self Tanning products are wonderful to use and produce a natural-looking tan.  The Liquid Bronze is easy to use.  I gave it 4 stars only because I prefer the gel.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is the product I expected. Price was great and it came in a couple of days!</li>
    <li> amazing!!!  anyone who wants a natural sun kissed color. Even if you are pale white, this will do a wonderful job  follow directions and enjoy  WORTH THE PRICE</li>
    <li> I will give this product a 5 star because it is the best tanner&lt;br /&gt;I have tried, and I have tried many!  It does not stain or streak,&lt;br /&gt;but goes on smoothly with a cotton ball.  It dries almost immediately&lt;br /&gt;and gives you a gradual natural-looking tan...no orange color or&lt;br /&gt;bad odor.  I am using it about twice a week with great results.</li>
