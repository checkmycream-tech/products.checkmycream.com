      <li>I bought them for my 5 year old and they are the best ones we have used, and we have been through many.</li>
      <li>I got one of these toothbrushes from my pedi Dentist, they give good coverage for my son&#x27; s teeth, the handle is really easy  for him to hold, and I feel confident a a mom that I m getting a better clean for my toddler&#x27; s mouth.</li>
      <li>and I thought the Jessie and Woody toothbrushes would be a good way of me making brushing time seem more like fun.</li>
      <li>My son&#x27;s favorite toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be a better selection for girls.  </li>
      <li>sure don&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Bought these for my son so he would be more into brushing his teeth and</li>
      <li>My boys LOVE these toothbrushes because they are a great fit for their hands and mouths and also feature some of their favorite action heroes.</li>
      <li>Toothbrushes as described - and I love automatically getting new ones every 3 months, because I never remember to replace my toothbrushes on my own.</li>
      <li>Great for a four year old who loves super heroes and the two-pack</li>
      <li>I buy these toothbrushes often for my boys, they go through them quickly as they like to grind their teeth on them.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassel.</li>
      <li>They seem to be a good size for their little mouths.</li>
      <li>Love the tongue cleaner on the back, will co tongue to buy</li>
      <li>Reasonable quality .</li>
      <li>Otherwise these toothbrushes last a long time, work well, and love that they came in multi-packs since my kids seem to chew them up quickly.</li>
      <li>Since this is an add-on item, I even had to wait until I was ordering other items to be able to get them.</li>
      <li>I have a difficult time finding the best size toothbrush for a 6 year old they usually have for toddlers and adults love that I can get these on amazon.  </li>
      <li>it works.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrushes are made well (Oral B of course) and just right for tiny hands and mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He loves opening a new package (we go through one brush about every three weeks) and it renews his interest in brushing.</li>
      <li>Website description clearly said USA but package does not specify where.</li>
      <li>We are trying to avoid China stuff when it comes to food and items that touch our bodies directly.</li>
      <li>I just found someone with a young boy and gave them away.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get to pick which Avengers you get, so you do need to be open to the possibility of anyone, but my kids didn&#x27;t really care in the end.</li>
      <li>By adding these, I lowered the cost of other items enough that these were effectively free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Granted, they were a little pricey, but worth it for my son wanting to brush his teeth</li>
      <li>Really wish there were other boy themes, or gender neutral.  </li>

    <li> Reasonable quality . My son likes them and use them!</li>
    <li> I got one of these toothbrushes from my pedi Dentist, they give good coverage for my son&#x27; s teeth, the handle is really easy  for him to hold, and I feel confident a a mom that I m getting a better clean for my toddler&#x27; s mouth.

    <li> I have a difficult time finding the best size toothbrush for a 6 year old they usually have for toddlers and adults love that I can get these on amazon.  It is good quality.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes are great! I bought them for my 5 year old and they are the best ones we have used, and we have been through many. The size is perfect for him and he actually is more enthusiastic about brushing his teeth since he gets to use his &amp;#34;Ironman toothbrush&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I only ordered this because I wanted the Toy Story toothbrush set that was pictured. My daughter is obsessed with Toy Story and I thought the Jessie and Woody toothbrushes would be a good way of me making brushing time seem more like fun. Since this is an add-on item, I even had to wait until I was ordering other items to be able to get them. I was so disappointed that we received DC comic toothbrushes instead. I didn&#x27;t even bother with trying to return them. It wasn&#x27;t worth the hassel. I just found someone with a young boy and gave them away.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favorite toothbrush.  Great for a four year old who loves super heroes and the two-pack was a great value!  He loves opening a new package (we go through one brush about every three weeks) and it renews his interest in brushing.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrushes with characters that my sons like. I got these as part of the Amazon subscribe and save program. By adding these, I lowered the cost of other items enough that these were effectively free.</li>
    <li> Nice design and size for toddlers. But wonder where this is made. Website description clearly said USA but package does not specify where. We are trying to avoid China stuff when it comes to food and items that touch our bodies directly.</li>
    <li> I buy these toothbrushes often for my boys, they go through them quickly as they like to grind their teeth on them. They seem to be a good size for their little mouths.</li>
    <li> Good value, good kids toothbrush , appealing to children. Kids will find the shape inviting and it will get them to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> Toothbrushes as described - and I love automatically getting new ones every 3 months, because I never remember to replace my toothbrushes on my own.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my son so he would be more into brushing his teeth and it works.&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrushes are made well (Oral B of course) and just right for tiny hands and mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super Heroes on the handles sure don&#x27;t hurt at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, they were a little pricey, but worth it for my son wanting to brush his teeth</li>
    <li> My boys LOVE these toothbrushes because they are a great fit for their hands and mouths and also feature some of their favorite action heroes. You don&#x27;t get to pick which Avengers you get, so you do need to be open to the possibility of anyone, but my kids didn&#x27;t really care in the end. My boys are 2 &amp; 3 and these work well for them (and are the same as the ones the dentist gives them) so I&#x27;d say you can definitely go younger than the age on the listing.</li>
    <li> My son is crazy about avengers. So bought this and he loved it. I ordered 2 pack as the design varies. Got all his favourite characters.</li>
    <li> The oral-b stages are the best kids toothbrushes.  I buy this size, the 5-7 years, for ages 2 and up, as I find the younger version a bit too small.  Really wish there were other boy themes, or gender neutral.  My 3 year old doesn&#x27;t yet know what the Avengers are, but he wanted something other than cars.  Seems to be a better selection for girls.  Otherwise these toothbrushes last a long time, work well, and love that they came in multi-packs since my kids seem to chew them up quickly.</li>

    <li> My son was so happy to get these in the mail! He loves them!</li>
