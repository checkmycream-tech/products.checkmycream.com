      <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
      <li>It could be that the tanning beds i&#x27;m using aren&#x27;t very strong since I have been tanning at my gym.</li>

      <li>Make sure it&#x27;s evenly dispensed.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>This lotion has no impact on your tan, it works more as a self tanning product.</li>
      <li>so it blends allot better, plus the brown spots it leaves in between your fingers</li>
      <li>the product is OK.</li>
      <li>or you will get streaking for sure.</li>
      <li>I love this lotion</li>
      <li>I have purchased many of these tanning products on line.  </li>
      <li>I go tanning more.</li>
      <li>Smells great and worked decent.</li>
      <li>It has a nice fresh sent and doesnt leave you with that &amp;#34;just tanned&amp;#34; smell after using the tanning bed.</li>

      <li>If you want quick 1 time tanning mega-bronze results, buy this lotion!</li>
      <li>i got an  awesome dark color using this bronzer !</li>
      <li>the brand is great and you can work your way up to a deep bronzer like this.</li>
      <li>I primarily use bronzing lotions</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so tan so fast!!!</li>
      <li>This lotion is golden and so am I!</li>
      <li>This is the best bronzer I have tried so far, and it is even better mixed with my HOT Blazin Bananas lotion</li>
      <li>you doesn&#x27;t wash off like some I&#x27;ve used, has a nice smell, and makes your skin feel soft, after getting out of the tanning bed</li>
      <li>but that is to be expected and can easily be covered with a good smelling lotion or perfume.</li>
      <li>This bronzer is great, right out of the bottle it looks like chocolate syrup pretty much, so I recommend already having a tan and using this to darken up, add more bronze to red color or if you are peaking and want to switch things up,</li>
      <li>The bronzers give you a nice, golden brown, natural looking tan....</li>
      <li>Deserves 5 stars, if your ok with it being high maintenance.</li>
      <li>It smells great but it leaves dark marks all over your body.</li>
      <li>Tried this for the first time today, and the results are unreal!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
      <li>this is the way to go definitely worth trying. ....</li>
      <li>I try millenium products before but this product is just as good as all the other ones if not a little better</li>
      <li>, Mr clean magic erasers remove that instantly, Js</li>
      <li>then it washed right off.  </li>
      <li>Love it it got me really dark fast!!!!</li>
      <li>I liked the original paint it beyond black.</li>

      <li>Nice dark tan achieved.  </li>
      <li>I am pretty dark and its amazing on my skin and leaves my skin so soft!</li>
      <li>the upside, I really do like the tan it provides but recommend mixing it well with another lotion that has silicone added to it so its an</li>
      <li>This is for people who really like bronzer.</li>
      <li>And when I took a shower my whole tan washed.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>You might want to make sure and have a wet wipe to use on ur hands.</li>
      <li>After one use, I have very noticeable color.</li>
      <li>and it really does work.</li>
      <li>Better than all the other lotions we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Does turn your hands orange if you don&#x27;t wipe them right after, but it does not last long and is an easy fix.</li>
      <li>It will tan you very quickly though just be careful wear gloves and wipe off toes heels ext...</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice, my first time and my last.</li>
      <li>This lotion was clumpy and looked like it was old!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love how this lotion turns you bronze without even going in the tanning bed!  You do have to be careful with the color on your hands and feet. Make sure it&#x27;s evenly dispensed. Instant tan.  I&#x27;ve decided to use this instead of going in the tanning bed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Solid Black bronzer (and love it) but wanted something different to switch it up. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> I try millenium products before but this product is just as good as all the other ones if not a little better this has more a bronzer then solid black. So if you want that little extra tan  this is the way to go definitely worth trying. ....</li>
    <li> This bronzer is great, right out of the bottle it looks like chocolate syrup pretty much, so I recommend already having a tan and using this to darken up, add more bronze to red color or if you are peaking and want to switch things up, cause it&#x27;s dark, I would wait to use this until after you get a base tan and have some good color, also don&#x27;t tan with this and then workout or sweat allot while wearing white clothing. Tan after cardio lol... Deserves 5 stars, if your ok with it being high maintenance. I&#x27;ve seen allot of reviews about this lotion streaking, I am naturally very pale, but always tan, you need to apply a generous amount with how dark the lotion is, I never streak because I apply it very heavily, completely covering my skin thick and I am usually a bit sweaty (I tan at the gym) so it blends allot better, plus the brown spots it leaves in between your fingers, Mr clean magic erasers remove that instantly, Js</li>
    <li> I LOVED this lotion when I bought it from the place that I tan. It gets you dark INSTANTLY. &amp; not orange. Since it&#x27;s so expensive there, I decided to buy 2 bottles from Amazon. I haven&#x27;t used the second one yet, but the 1st was EXTREMELY clumpy which made it hard to spread evenly. It reminded me of spoiled chocolate milk.</li>
    <li> Smells great. I got a very dark tan. This is for people who really like bronzer. You need to wipe your hands after you put it on. But it does the trick.</li>
    <li> This lotion has given us the darkest tan ever!  Better than all the other lotions we&#x27;ve tried.  The bronzers give you a nice, golden brown, natural looking tan....no orange, streaky, fake-looking color.  If you want to take your color up a notch, this product will do the trick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and buying lotions from the salons and over paying... I got this bottle quickly and it got me dark fast! Love it</li>
    <li> This lotion has no impact on your tan, it works more as a self tanning product. WILL STAIN HANDS! Not what was expected</li>
    <li> This is the best bronzer I have tried so far, and it is even better mixed with my HOT Blazin Bananas lotion</li>
    <li> The consistency is like running dark chocolate, not like lotion at all.  I primarily use bronzing lotions but,this one stains, and does not apply evenly. I&#x27;ve used it twice, my first time and my last.</li>
    <li> Great product! No need to say anything else. Everyone shiuld buy this product. I have reccommended it to all my friends. Thanks</li>
    <li> After using 3xs I already looked as if I had a natural glowing tan! You might want to make sure and have a wet wipe to use on ur hands. My palms had staining from the bronzer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for.  It could be that the tanning beds i&#x27;m using aren&#x27;t very strong since I have been tanning at my gym. It could also be that the older I get the less easy it is for me to get dark, but either way I was hoping for a dramatic dark color.  It does get me a nice golden color, but miss the days when I would get really dark.  I had never used Millenium products in the past but gave it a shot, I used to like Australian Gold products when I was tanning regularly in the past and I think I&#x27;ll go back to those.</li>
    <li> Olive skin tone and this product made me tan very quick tanning one-two days a week. I am very dark but this product does leave streaks immediately after tan. Will buy again just hate to see streaks after tan.</li>
    <li> This was a great product. Iv always used designer skin and the quality was just as good. It smells awesome and I have lots of scent allergies and it didn&#x27;t bother me at all! It definitely a deep bronzer. If you are really pale start with something less extreme or you will get streaking for sure. BVut the brand is great and you can work your way up to a deep bronzer like this. I am pretty dark and its amazing on my skin and leaves my skin so soft! Will be buying in the future for sure as its half the price as tanning warehouse or tanning depot!</li>
    <li> Ya u got darker till u took a shower then it washed right off.  Stained my hands brown for a few days.</li>
    <li> This brand is absolutely amazing for tanning products. This particular lotion does provide a rich and deep, dark tan. However, the con is that the lotion dries almost immediately after application. So, WARNING: if you do not blend  extremely well it will leave lines of orange on you. So less is more. I mean it.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, I really do like the tan it provides but recommend mixing it well with another lotion that has silicone added to it so its an easier application.&lt;br /&gt;What I recommend is purchasing a different lotion from this brand and using it instead, or in junction with this product. Preferably Paint it Black 100x by Millennium works well.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I used it for my first time tanning and it really does work. Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Amazing lotion. I&#x27;ve never been so tan so fast!!!</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened here.  I have purchased many of these tanning products on line.  This is the first that feel as if the product had been &amp;#34;watered down&amp;#34;.  I would not recommend this at all.  I threw it out but should have sent it back.</li>
    <li> Beeing fair skinned, maybe I&#x27;m too light colored to use this product. It left very visible streaks when applied and not natural at all on me.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! One of the best tanning lotions I have used. I plan on buying this product again. Smells great and does not dry my skin..</li>
    <li> Received this product and contents very thin and runny. I then Compared contents with 100$ bottle of same lotion purchased At tanning salon and completely different in looks and smell.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 tanning sessions still no results.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t get you very dark</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations! It has a nice fresh sent and doesnt leave you with that &amp;#34;just tanned&amp;#34; smell after using the tanning bed. The color results are great too! I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying this product.  It seams to work well, keeps your color well and doesn&#x27;t smell to bad either.  Some products leave you smelling like you just tanned, this one is great for not doing that.</li>
    <li> I dont know if i recived a bad bottle but it smelled horrible. It will tan you very quickly though just be careful wear gloves and wipe off toes heels ext...it takes forever to dry and you have to rub it in VERRY well or it will be blotchy. It also rubs off like the sticker on the back of a lighter. Dont touch anything for a long time after applying either it does and will rub off!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product.  Nice dark tan achieved.  No mess, no staining,</li>
    <li> It was great condition and I received it quick ! I was very pleased wh this product ! i got an  awesome dark color using this bronzer ! I have stopped the search for bronzers... paint it beyond black millennium product is the only one I use now !!!</li>
    <li> No problems with this lotion or order</li>
    <li> Smells great and worked decent. Not a favorite of mine but was worth it.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it does. The smell is great the color is great. Wear gloves to apply. Gives you a great even color.</li>
    <li> After trying solid black and black storm, I thought I would give this a try. Seeing that it was new for this year, I was excited to find out the results of using it. I just tried it out and all I can say is, wow! After one use, I have very noticeable color. This lotion is golden and so am I! I can only imagine the color I will get after using this within a weeks time. This will give a much more noticeable color change than solid black and black storm. I have not tried their other lotions, so I cannot comment on them. For the money, this cannot be beat. The fragrance is a little different, but that really does not matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and exceptional value.</li>
    <li> This product totally lived up to it&#x27;s expectations, it&#x27;s very dark and you get a dark bronze color immediately, and it stays with you doesn&#x27;t wash off like some I&#x27;ve used, has a nice smell, and makes your skin feel soft, after getting out of the tanning bed</li>
    <li> Best tanning lotion I have ever used. The bronzer keeps me dark even when I don&#x27;t have time to tan!</li>
    <li> This is probably my most favorite tanning lotion that I ever had. I always look for cosmetic bronzers in my lotion because I&#x27;m all about immediate results after leaving my tanning salon and this definitely delivered. Does turn your hands orange if you don&#x27;t wipe them right after, but it does not last long and is an easy fix. Smell is a little unpleasant after you&#x27;re done with your tanning session but that is to be expected and can easily be covered with a good smelling lotion or perfume.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped super fast (as always😊) the product is OK. Looks like chocolate pudding , must be rubbed in well</li>
    <li> Love it. Its all I use now. Note... wash ur hands well after applying. ;)</li>
    <li> Havent really noticed it being any better than my previous lotion made by this same company. Maybe I will notice it though next time I go tanning more.</li>
    <li> The tanning lotion wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It smells great but it leaves dark marks all over your body. And when I took a shower my whole tan washed. Away. I liked the original paint it beyond black. This wasn&#x27;t so great.</li>
    <li> The bronzing power of this lotion is incredible. Unlike other lotions, you can see the bronzer as you apply it. The color of the lotion is like chocolate! My only complaint is that it turns my hands &amp;#34;ashy-black&amp;#34;. I love this lotion so I am willing to over look the one tiny flaw. I keep a bottle of hand sanitizer in my gym bag. After I apply the lotion, I sanitize my hands and wipe with the towel provided in the tanning booth. It takes away that &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; look from my hands. LOVE THIS LOTION! LOVE THE PRICE! If you want quick 1 time tanning mega-bronze results, buy this lotion! (just wash hands after application and before tanning!!!)</li>
    <li> This lotion is Great! I tan several days a week, and it goes on very silky beacuse of the silicones. Easy to blend and no streaking. I have olive toned skin and I get a great sun kissed tan.</li>
    <li> Tried this for the first time today, and the results are unreal!  I look like I spent a week at the beach, minus the redness and peeling.  The color is believable (no orange), although I will probably not use this every time I tan to prevent the fake from eclipsing the real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. and by the way... I, too, did research on phenoxyethanol.  While the other reviewer&#x27;s claims do contain some truth, they are also blown out of proportion.  The information is out there.  Check for yourself if you&#x27;re unsure.</li>
    <li> Love it it got me really dark fast!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion was clumpy and looked like it was old! I can&#x27;t use it. It&#x27;s a nasty liquid with clumps of tanning lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t order this.</li>
    <li> Love this! Got me dark fast with no streaks!</li>
