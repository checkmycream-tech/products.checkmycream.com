<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Outstanding healing for dry or even seriously fragile or damaged skin.  When examining my skin that had been seriously damaged due to allergy to medication and I had been treating with this cream, my doctor was amazed at how much it had healed.  She said there was nothing she could have prescribed that would have worked any better than this cream.  It is also very soothing; relieving pain, redness, and itching.</li>
    <li> When I had my knee replacement the hospital gave me this lotion to use while I was there. I continued to use it once I got home and was able to really tell a different.  My skin didn&#x27;t itch and the appearance improved. It looked fresher and not as dry. I have been using it now for 4 months and love it. Its not greasy and soaks into the skin. I only apply once a day after my bath and it  last all day.  I have normal skin but lotions with perfume in them irritate my skin. I Have had  no irritation with this lotion. I highly recommend this product for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Bought 4 bottles already.  This is absolutely the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin cream I&#x27;ve tried.  I love it so much that I buy it by the case and keep my children and grandchildren supplied.  I discovered this cream when my husband was terminally ill at a care facility.  This was wonderful to use on his very fragile skin. It&#x27;s not readily available at most stores (never see it in this size).  I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this product.  This is the only hand cream she has found (so far) that prevents her hands from cracking during the winter months.  She carries a small bottle if it in her purse so she has it with her at all times. Her sisters and mother have also purchased this cream after trying some of ours.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream. Mother is 94 years and her legs were in very bad shape with sores and etc. Remedy cleared them up and thery are now not only well but very soft. I have started use Remedy and my skin is soft also.  It is not greasy. Love the product and get wonderful results from you&#x27;ll. Elizabeth B Cox</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt; It helps eliminate dry spots on my hands &amp; helps heal my wife&#x27;s cracked thumbs.</li>
    <li> I was told that you couldn&#x27;t buy this retail, but found it here and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks for promptness, as well!</li>
    <li> I tried this Remedy Skin Repair Cream for the first time after my Grandson was born.  A bottle of it was sitting at one of the nurses stations for the staff to use.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this lotion. I have used it two ways. Right when I get out of the shower/tub before I dry and when my skin is completely dry. It also works really well for my husbands dry skin from diabetes.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, which means that this will last for months! I love the simple, subtle scent - similiar to those orange-cream popsicles!</li>
    <li> This lotion is awesome!!  After years of too much sun and abuse, and constant hand-washing at work, my skin is extremely dry and damaged.  This is the first product that actually healed and moisturized my skin; other lotions were a (very) temporary fix and this lotion is making a true difference.  I am so impressed with the result that I even bought more to give to family and friends.</li>
    <li> Works well on winter skin!!!</li>
    <li> Some guys won&#x27;t use lotions, etc., but I&#x27;m REALLY OLD (bumping up close to 80), with badly sun-damaged skin, very thin, that tears easily.  This stuff seems to restore (at least for awhile) the oils/moisture that this particular Geezer needs for comfort.  I also volunteer at local hospital, and notice that the nurses use it to help their skin recover from the constant use of germicidal cleaners.  They like it, too...  Also, I notice that the hospital provides it to patients with skin difficulties.  It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
    <li> Worked as expected and smells great.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my Podiatrist for some acute medical problems. It has done a remarkable job for my legs and feet. My skin stays soft and moisturized. I am very happy with the results and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used the Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream before, but had forgotten how wonderful it is.  Product arrived in 2 days. I ordered a twin-pack for another family member and the price will have me ordering again.</li>
    <li> My father loves this lotion…got some while in hospital…so glad to find on amazon…it came today:)  thank you  He wii be so happy</li>
    <li> I never write reviews because I don&#x27;t have the time - but I had to write about this amazing product! I care for elderly through end of life and was introduced to this product through the nurses who provide hospice care, we had amazing results preventing bed and pressure sores, (one resident in bed for 7 months and not one sore!!) Oh and the pump is SSOOOOO worth it - those small tubes are a mess to open and use while changing messy diapers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must also review this product for my hands.They are a disaster every winter due to all the washing and cleaning I do - they have been an embarrassment for years. I have tried every lotion and potion on the market - even natural oils, expensive organics and gloves. Cortisone was the only thing that worked, a little. I read the description on Amazon while buying it for a patient, about using it for dry, cracked skin and tried it - since my husband also has cracked, bleeding hands each winter due to his job - and we were in disbelief!! The first night on our hands and the redness was gone - the pain and flakes were gone too!! Then the next night the cracks were gone!! After three nights (there were still some scabs) my hands looked and felt better than they have in  years!  I wish I had known I can use this all over. I could NOT be happier with a skin product than I am with this. BUY IT!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Fixes dry skin right up. Leaves you soft and smooth. Nice light fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the Remedy Skin Repair Cream.  As a NICU Rn, I was may hand to many times a day to count, and am always looking for something to sooth my dry sore hands, this did the trick.  Several years ago I had gone to visit my grandmother, who had very dry peeling legs.  The only lotion I had was my Remedy, so I put that on her legs, she loved it and I ordered several times so that the staff caring for her in the board and care home she lived in could use it.  I don&#x27;t think she ever had a problem with the dryness again.</li>
    <li> I first used this from a wound care center.  This is the best lotion I have ever used and I am 62.</li>
    <li> We love this lotion and it smells so very good.  My husband&#x27;s feet don&#x27;t crack and bleed in the winter since he started using it, and my hands are softer, too.  The aroma doesn&#x27;t make me choke like that of ordinary hand creams and it is a nice, thick, lotion.</li>
    <li> The skin repair cream lotion I discovered while in the hospital. It has a good texture and moisturizer. I am really enjoying this product. I will continue to use this for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a product known for it&#x27;s protective and healing properties in the healthcare system.  I bought this for my elderly parents, what a deal, one for them and one for me!  They love it.  You will notice a difference in your skin right a way.  As a nurse that washes her hands all day long this is the ONLY lotion that not only keeps them from cracking but keeps them soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;This is really good for thin skin or sensitive or dry skin.  Try it, you will just love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the very best skin repair product on the market. Healing properties are almost instantly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s very dry skin from medications and ulcerative lesions from edema were healed in a matter of mere days.&lt;br /&gt;We now use it daily and we both are reaping the marvelous benefits.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really great.  It is soothing and non-greasy, with a pleasant creamsicle smell.  We live in Minnesota and the dry air in winter is hard on skin.  In addition, I have excema and my husband has psoriasis.  This lotion absorbs into the skin and immediately provides relief that lasts all day.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t cure excema and psoriasis, but it does make your skin feel comfortable.  It is totally worth the money -- and you get a big bottle, which is a good thing when everyone in your family starts stealing it!</li>
    <li> I had very dry, itchy skin. So itchy that I would scratch till it was red and irritated. While visiting my sister-in-law, she let me use her lotion (Remedy Skin Repair Cream). She had gotten it from her mother who is a nurse and who uses it on her patients. My skin has been repaired! No more itching and scratching!!!</li>
    <li> This cream is recommended by our local Oncology Radiologist.  I used it all through my radiation treatments and did not have skin breakdown or redness at all.  That was a couple years ago.  This past weekend I forgot to put sunscreen on and got quite burnt.  I remembered I had some of this lotion left and started applying it to my burn.  It has taken out the sting and the skin isn&#x27;t dry and hard and hot anymore.  I am pretty confident my burn will heal without the usual pain and cracking!  Fabulous lotion.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> My father in law recommended this to me for my dry feet. Works ok but the one that starts with a C is much better</li>
    <li> Great skin cream. I am a devote bath and body works lotion customer and I would purchase again</li>
    <li> Wow! I was quite skeptical when I read all the reviews. I have severe problems with my skin from lupus. I was using a 15% sulphur MSM lotion but this is even better.</li>
    <li> Remedy Skin Repair Cream is a wonderful cream for not only moisturizing face and body, it is also like a miracle for abrasions, pimples, or other skin irritations.  This is a wonderful cream.</li>
    <li> I had trouble finding this lotion for my mother. I was happy to find it here. Fast shipping. A problem with the order was taken care of by the merchant promptly. I will reorder again when she needs more. Resonable price for this fantastic lotion.</li>
    <li> I received this cream when I was hospitalized and brought it home.  After I was home I had pressure sores on my feet and they were red and really hurt. I got out the tube of this cream and applied it. It made them feel better and healed my feet. I still use it on my feet. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Protects your skin, even on days when you forget to use it.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to my diabetic husband after he was hospitized... it has been most helpful in keeping his skin, in particular on his leg in excellent condition.</li>
    <li> Best lotion for dry skin</li>
    <li> my skin was dry and rough,but after using medline&lt;br /&gt;for a short period my skin stsrted to smooth out and soften,thank you for this product.&lt;br /&gt;  Grace haggerty</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for several years and love it.  I will continue to use this product on an ongoing basis.</li>
    <li> best lotion I have ever used.  great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> As described and on time. Pleasant feel and smell</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I work at a hospital and a sample of this was given to us by a sales rep. I got home and immediately searched for it. This is wonderful stuff. I have a 5 month old baby, and this can be used on all of us. Safe enough (and meant to be used) as a diaper cream, yet strong enough to clear up my husbands Eczema (better than the prescription stuff). This is the ONLY lotion that calms my hands down from &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; in the winter. After hand washing all day at work, to hand washing at home with the baby, and hand washing at the firehouse by night my hands are washed out. This lotion makes them feel so much better! I even used this after shaving to make my legs look less dry. I just cannot say enough good things about this stuff. Just buy it!</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good folks to deal with.</li>
    <li> I started using this cream in the hospital.  I begged for some to take home and have been using it for 2 years now.  It is the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This was used on my during my hospital stay. I loved it so much I order it often. My skin is so soft and feels great. It&#x27;s light and none greasy and smells good also!</li>
    <li> I had a weird dry spot on my skin for months, this product took it away in about a week time; after months without having it go away with other stuff. The only downfall is that it contains parabens, but its not to bad if you use it sparingly as it does what it is suppose to and helps heal your skin. On a side note, I do not like the orange hue that looks like dye that is applied with this oil (you can see the dye under certain lights, but its very light)</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for relief from very dry, (read old) skin.  Expensive if purchased from Walgreen&#x27;s but affordable if purchased on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for chapped hands.  Heals overnight.  Great for flakey, itchy legs.  Non-greasy, absorbs quickly.  I keep a bottle in my kitchen and in my bathroom.  Several friends have used it and wanted to know where to get it for themselves.  I know for a fact that they ordered it and then recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> If you have dry itchy skin this works wonders!  Does not leave a greasy feeling like a lot of other healing lotions do.</li>
    <li> My aunt used to work in a hospital and got two bottles of this. My grandmother and mother loved the lotion and since my aunt no longer works at the hospital, were unhappy they could no longer get it.  I was able to get both big bottles and my family loves them.  It is a smooth, refreshing, lightly scented cream and glides on and moisturizes.  My mother has plaque scoriasis and this helps her skin feel better.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the pump bottle &amp; the product in it.  When my husb was bed ridden toward the end of his life his home care nurse introduced me to the skin cream.  It was wonderful.  No red skin areas that couldn&#x27;t be taken care of &amp; -for the most part- prevented. Difficult to find in my area &amp; expensive.  The price is very good &amp; I love the pump bottle-makes it easy to handle.  I liked the idea of the 2 bottles together, free shipping &amp; one less thing I have to carry in myself.  I use it all the time for myself.</li>
    <li> The cream goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly, leaving a delightful aroma.  Have told many others about this item, and they are enjoying it as well.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. My sister works in a hospital, I went to her dept .one day and while I was there I washed my hands and used this lotion. GREAT stuff</li>
    <li> I mix this product with the Medline Remedy Olivamine Clear-Aid Skin Protectant and it works beautifully!  I highly recommend Medline products.  They&#x27;re excellent!</li>
    <li> I love this product . I&#x27;m 80 years old and have dry . thin skin and it sure improved the looks and feel of my skin .</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was looking for some so I ordered some for myself. My wife uses it as well. Not greasy and has a pleasant but subtle odor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Remedy Skin Repair cream for many years. My sister worked at Medline (for over 20 years) and brought me a bottle to try when they first introduced it. I use it on my face, feet, hands, anywhere I use lotion. I even put it on my lips - no unpleasant taste. It&#x27;s great under make up. I&#x27;ve used it under liquid foundation, as well as mineral powder. I&#x27;m about to turn 50 and I have barely any visible wrinkles, even around my eyes. I can say that a lot of it is due to this product. There&#x27;s no greasy feeling, the lotion soaks right in, and it has a very soft, pleasant smell. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized, soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion that is available today.  All natural ingredients and is very concentrated so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone even with good skin.....I discovered it working in the hospital environment and could never buy it til I found it here!!!! No wonder they have it sitting around in every department, it&#x27;s the GOOD STUFF!</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Not greasy, smells wonderful, and lasts!</li>
    <li> I Love the product and the company was quick with sending it out</li>
    <li> Love it!  Have used the Remedy Skin Repair Cream for a while now &amp; I love it.  My mother, sister &amp; nephew also use it.  Its the only body lotion I use.  And it&#x27;s also nice that it was properly packaged &amp; the bottles didn&#x27;t leak during shipping.</li>
    <li> This cream cures any dry, scaly, skin. Would recommend it to anyone that has skin problems.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin lotions you want to have around during the dry winter season. 5 STARS</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended this cream, and it has done WONDERS. It really does repair your skin! Dry or damaged skin soaks it up and you DEFINITELY see improvement. And this twin pack is a GREAT BUY!</li>
    <li> I work in an ICU, which is where i first discovered this product, it is great on patients skin, and helps prevent breakdown. We have a bottle out for the staff, and everyone loves it. It smells great, and makes the skin feel soft. So i ordered it for my family to use. We are in the pool 24/7 and it helps keep our skin hydrated and soft. I would definatly recomend it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this skin cream. I have EXTREMELY dry skin, and this is the very best I have ever used.  I will no longer use anything else. If you have really dry skin - you will be happy with with this lotion!</li>
    <li> Recommended by a wound care RN for my mom in the hospital for her fragile skin but I also use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product myself loved!!</li>
    <li> I discovered this lotion at a hospital when I was working on the ambulance. They had these bottles out for staff and gave smaller ones to some of the patients. It smells great and it so refreshing.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion for dry skin I have ever used.  I have very dry feet, my heels especially get cracked and split sometimes.  The very first time I used this lotion on my feet they became so soft its unbelievable.  I will continuing buying this lotion,  It is great to use right after getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many many lotions and this one actually changes your skin as it repairs damage.  The only lotion I will use, and as an added bonus it smells heavenly!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this skin cream. The hospitals give it to their patients which is where I got mine from but it was in a little tube.  I bought two large bottles with pumps so I can use it all over my body.</li>
    <li> My daughter was born with a skin condition that requires moisturizing cream twice a day and after using every cream known to man she likes this one the best. It has been a 18 year experiment to get to this one. A little advise though. Purchase the twin pack and save some money.</li>
    <li> This is a product in use at the ambulatory surgery center where I work.  EVERYBODY wants some several times daily because of the handwashing.  I buy it for home use, and we go through several a year.  Daily use by everybody, pleasant scent, really does what it says, nothing I know of to approach the olive oil it contains to refresh the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolute must for dry skin.  Recommended by this doctor to his patients and co-workers with the money to afford it.</li>
    <li> Very rich cream for skin</li>
    <li> Love this medical grade lotion. Never without it. Non greasy. Smells great. Absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon pricing is the best around.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream. Used by many medical professionals. This is my second order. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> it has a strange odor</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this lotion!  Recommend by my sister who is a nurse, she swears by this lotion.  Feels good, just started using it today so I&#x27;m relying on information I received that this will help my  dry and aging skin skin.  Package arrived within time frame and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I used this a while back and really liked the way that it helped my hands. Had trouble finding where I could buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and highly sensitive to fragrances.  This cream is wonderful!  Very lightly scented and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  Totally not greasy.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> and it smells amazing, first used on my husband in the hospital and I liked it so much I ordered some for myself.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for the all skin types. I highly recommend this for dry, itchy or irritated skin. We use this in the hospital on patient&#x27;s feet and other irritated skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Not greasy and keeps skin feeling moisturized  all day.</li>
    <li> This lotion works wonders on extremely dry skin. This is the only lotion that I have found that actually does what it says. When I&#x27;m starting to run low I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pumps came broken.  Was packed by amazon I believe. Did not prevent try to return, just going to use as is. This lotion is actually amazing.</li>
    <li> Got these items very quickly one downer is the tops on both popped open and was a mess.</li>
    <li> this cream is great on my feet and my wife love&#x27;s it,the reason I purchased this product several times,just to stock up.</li>
    <li> This is awesome lotion. I have gone through this lotion that I had to have, it&#x27;s that great.  I need to hide it from others using it....I have a lot of dry skin and my hands get so dry that they crack.  The bottle I first went through was a gift...again I say awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a while since I placed this order and think I had contacted the seller through amazon.  The only thing I can think of is that I requested new pumps as they were broken and I like the pumps, I really think that is the only thing that could be negative.  I don&#x27;t know, Amazon likes to know everything about a product and I do not wish to give anybody\market place a black eye from your company.&lt;br /&gt;I do want to clear any mistakes and wish for you a good seller mark.  I heard nothing until the last e-mail.&lt;br /&gt;Regards, Charlene Hein</li>
    <li> Took care of all of my dry and irritated skin</li>
    <li> This IS the very best repair lotion you will ever buy. I had bought a small bottle at a local pharmacy for a good penny. It&#x27;s very expensive if you don&#x27;t buy it here at Amazon!  Best price I&#x27;ve found. I have very dry skin. My heals crack my cuticles crack. You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this cream! My daughter uses it as well as my husband!  He can be very picky about his products but loves this one. The smell is pleasant and cream is not oily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with dry skin, no matter what lotion I use my hands would always be dry again 15 to 30 minutes later. But with the remedy my skin feel so much better and does not dry up so quickly... I use it from head to toe and I will not buy any thing else... I just love it !!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I love it!  Mild scent.  Not sure it&#x27;s edible, but my dog thinks so.</li>
    <li> I can not rave enough about this lotion. I first used it when my grandma was in a rehab facility for a broken hip, they used it on her chapped legs (from edema) . I have sensitive skin and cuticles get really dry and I apply this to my hands, body, and face daily and...no dryness or rough cuticles. Seems to have some sort of healing agent in it-!? I buy it in bulk now :) LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I bought this hooded cape  for my granddaughter to be Little Red Riding Hood.  She wore it to a Halloween party and was very satisfied.</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference in the way my skin looks on my arms or legs....I don&#x27;t use it daily but maybe 2-3 times per week.  Thought it would do more....smell is a little weird but not bad...will have to have more time before I would say yay or nay!  Not impressed so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this repair cream! It came in huge containers that will last a long time. I have very red raw palms and have had them for a long time. Twice a day and my hands are healing. Pleasantly recommend.</li>
    <li> None greasy and so softening, smell is nice but not too much. I highly recommend it, go buy it, it&#x27;ll last</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; a very good buy , I used this in the hospital &amp; I liked it , my son said go on Amazon &amp; may find it there &amp; I did ... Thank you .!!!!</li>
    <li> recommended by a tech in opthmalagist&#x27;s office who had to wash her hands frequently.  smells great but not a strong scent for those who are bothered by strong perfumes</li>
    <li> great for healing super dry cracked hands and feet. you will notice and feel the difference. and it smells good too. you can tell it creates a layer of protection above your skin. best to apply at night right after showering while skin is still moist before sleeping. should see results in 2 days! I know I did. great product here.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have purchased this cream!! It is GREAT!! It has a nice, pleasant scent and does NOT leave a greasy feeling on your skin. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING IT!!</li>
    <li> This skin cream is easy to use.  After rubbing it on my legs and arms, I immediately felt a difference.  I highly recommend this as I use it everyday.  I also have used it on my face and other parts of my body.</li>
    <li> They used to sell this lotion in this size where I work (hospital) but they were no longer able to sell this size. I was elated that I could still buy it on here. This lotion has a very light scent (like orange sherbet) that dissipates quickly, the best part about the lotion is that it is incredibly soothing to dry hands and does not leave your hands sticky or greasy. I am on my 6th large bottle of this lotion and it lasts a very long time. I recommend this for anyone with dry hands, I am a nurse with very dry hands and this works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I will definitely purchase again.  The hospital I work for uses this product.  I continually have to wash my hands at work and both my husband and son suffer from dry skin,  so this product is a must have in our household.  We have tried several different brand both lotions and creams and nothing comes even close to this product.  I highly recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> Best I have ever used.sWP</li>
    <li> SOLD AS PROMISED @ great price.WILL GET MORE IN 90 DAYS</li>
    <li> The best skin cream I have used!  I will never switch to any products after using this cream!  It&#x27; makes my skin softer and smoother.  Highly recommended especially for an elderly person&#x27;s skin like me!</li>
    <li> The twin pack is great for families. The amount of lotion lasts awhile, especially since you don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion as other brands. The lotion absorbs quickly and instantly relieves dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing skincare product. Relieves and nourishes dry skin without being heavy or greasy. Great price for the size containers. Product was packaged nicely and arrived very quickly after I placed my order. This is a product I keep on hand and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products on the market....I have found none better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can pay less for a normal lotion...but, this one penetrates into your skin...and, leaves no greasy feeling after you rub it in.  I have diabetes, and, my feet need a lotion to keep them soft to avoid breaks in the skin where dryness can occur....it does the job for sure.  I have purchased over the last few years several of these quart size containers...and they last for a long long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product</li>
    <li> I bought the twin pack and gifted one bottle to a friend.  The lotion has an olive oil base which is probably why it thickens up if you don&#x27;t use it often.  The lotion leaves my hands smooth and protected.</li>
    <li> THis is the best lotion.  I first learned about at the Billings Clinic.  I finally was able to order it.  It&#x27;s the best lotion on the market.  It smells good, it feels good and it works.</li>
    <li> We purchased this lotion because of our hospital experience.  While our son was in the NICU we were required to wash our hands an ungodly amount of times.  This lotion has been the only thing keeping our hands from bleeding!  Great product!</li>
    <li> Used to treat and sooth skin on legs, which must be constantly bandaged due to lymphedema.</li>
    <li> When I got 2 I gave one to my daughter, she an I both think it is  very good  for people that have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It will be some time before we need any, but will be getting more when need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found out that wearring sub hose it helps to kept them up being they are knee highs.  Other wise they would slip down, now they do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Van Knutson</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best for dry, irritated skin &amp; heals blemishes. Puts back all the vital nutrients skin needs to rejuvenate itself, especially good for chemo patients since the skin tends to dry out. Skin feels silky soft after just a week. Best when applied after bathing/showers to seal in the moisture &amp; applied twice daily. I love the pump! Only con is its not that great on dry, peeling feet/hands.  I found Elta melting moisturizer to be excellent for that, as it is parafin based.</li>
    <li> This is the best repair cream on the market.  I could not have been happier with this seller.</li>
    <li> I love Remedy Skin Repair and am so happy to find it online at this great price. I would recommend to all.</li>
    <li> the best skin cream i have ever used</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It&#x27;s the best ever for dry skin.</li>
    <li> ;love it and will order some today</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion before and is now the only lotion I will use. It is used in hospitals. Love it!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my radiation oncologist.  It meets and beats expectations!</li>
    <li> this is geat cream.and very healing. It is saving my hands this winter where usually my fingers crack  and bleeding. Worth the money. Takes only a little bit at a time so lasts. came as described sooner than expected</li>
