    <li> This is a great hairspray!  It does not make me gag when I spray it on my hair in my bathroom like some other hairsprays have done.  It is lightly scented and holds my hair all day, no matter what the weather.  You can even use it as a styling spray!  Absolutely my Holy Grail of hair sprays!  :o)</li>
    <li> I love this hair spray. It gives my hair body and keeps it in place without getting sticky.It works well when you use it to shape your hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray ever!!! It hold curls all day and is flexible. Does not feel stiff. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist gave me a sample can for Christmas last year. Only recently did I run out of my drug store hair spray and remembered that I had this hair product.  Now I haven&#x27;t used Aerosole hair spray since the 80s, so I was a little hesitant about how I&#x27;d like this product. But I loved it!  I have fine hair and it gave me tons of body and it didn&#x27;t feel stiff or sticky.  Scruples seems like a great product and I plan on purchasing the mousse or other styling products.  Give it a try - especially if you have fine hair like me and need body!</li>
    <li> I love this shaping spray.  I have naturally curly hair, and this is the only spray I use.  Excellent service from this company.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this styling spray, and although I usually buy it from her, I was away from home and delighted to find it on Amazon with prime shipping.  To be honest, I&#x27;ve also tried the Fantastic Sam&#x27;s styling spray and thought the only difference was the scent (Fantastic Sam&#x27;s has stronger scent).</li>
    <li> Thank you, great price for a great product</li>
    <li> This Scruples Hi Def firm shaping hair spray is awesome !!! Keeps your hair soft but yet has a super hold. I Love this product !!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for About 5 years. but when I moved no one here sold the product. So I began ordering on line. Excellent product keeps hair in place and easy to style your hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hairspray. It sprays &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky and wet. It smells nice and holds well.</li>
    <li> Great spray....good hold, keeps style in place. Just need to remember not to&lt;br /&gt;hold too close and away from hair or becomes a little stiff or heavy.</li>
    <li> I always use it.  It&#x27;s great. You can re comb you hair when you use it. Glad you had it.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Just spray and finger style.</li>
    <li> A light, nice smelling spray.  I spray it on my hair before using my curling iron and then again after styling and this seems to work well on my fine hair to hold the style and yet remains light and does not weigh it down.</li>
    <li> on fine hair like mine!! I like the hold that it offers especially in humidity here in Texas. Plus it is not sticky!</li>
    <li> Love this ,it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair to wet.  It has a light mist and holds very well ,also easy to brush through. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> I would rate the hairspray a 5 STAR. Experience a 2 STAR.  This hairspray is my favorite and I have been using it for 5+ years.  I have ordered through amazon several times and been completely happy with my order.  Unfortunately I recently ordered (4) cans of hairspray and received (3.5) cans.  One can was half empty.  Not sure if someone used half of it and put it back on the shelf or what.  It isn&#x27;t worth the time or money to send it back but I may seek other ways of buying it in the future.</li>
    <li> The formula has changed for this hair spray and it is no longer the super natural looking hold that I&#x27;ve so loved for many years.  Leaves hair stiff and artificial looking and the styling flexibility of the previous formula is gone. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> i love this hairspray, it keeps my fine hair workable with lasting hold. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Strong hold, no webbing, not too stiff, keeps style intact. Smells okay, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. Love Scruples.</li>
    <li> Works great for fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years.  Initially it was available from my beautician but she retired and closed the shop.  Found another shop in the area that carried it, but that also closed down.  Decided to try Amazon, and was able to get it.  Does not make my hair stiff and when I comb it out, it does not resemble straw.</li>
    <li> My mom being a hair dresser, Ive used this product for as long as I can remember, I love it. I am now out of state and cant easily get it so I ordered it from amazon. At the same time I ordered this hair spray, I ordered scruples mousse from a different company. I got my mousse 4 days ago and am still waiting for my hair spray.</li>
    <li> I use this for my fine fly away hair to keep it in place and not be sticky or stiff. It is cheaper to buy it from Amazon than to buy it from my hairdresser! It works for me have been using it a long time.</li>
    <li> have never had a hair spray that does not make my head itch until this one&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for over 5 years perfect in every way</li>
    <li> Great hold without feeling sticky and no heavy scent. For the price I feel this is one of the better hair sprays on the market.</li>
    <li> I use this hair spray all the time and love it.  Received it in a prompt timely manner.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this spray. I&#x27;ve bought it many times. It does not go on wet at all. It is very firm but the thing that I really like is how dry it goes on. Great hair spray.</li>
    <li> My new hairdresser uses this hairspray and it works well for me.  It holds but I can still brush through it.  It also gives my hair a nice shine.  Thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> Product works very well with my wife&#x27;s hair above all other products tried, would highly reccomend it to other women that like a natural looking finish to their hair</li>
    <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my hair perfectly without being sticky or hard.&lt;br /&gt;Works well in humidity and combs out beautifully.</li>
    <li> My Hair Dresser uses this in her salon, and I usually buy it from her.  Lately, she has been having problems with her supplier,  and doesn&#x27;t always have it.  It works really good, does not make your hair feel stiff,  and brushes out completly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I found Amazon selling it, for the same price I was paying my hair dresser, but could send it out immediately, I stopped looking for it at the Hair Dresser, and just buy it from Amazon, and I don&#x27;t need to carry it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> best hair spray on the market....  just will it was not so hard to find !!!</li>
    <li> GREAT SPRAY, FAIR PRICE  RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION AND ON TIME</li>
    <li> I think I am going to like this hairspray.  Not sticky, doesn&#x27;t show in hair.  Seems to hold.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I love this shaping spray because it gives a great hold to my flyaway thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;When I spray it on my hair can be styled and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it for the rest of the day!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Does not make my hair sticky to the touch. I have been using this product for years. Glad Amazon cares this brand.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  No lasting hold. Have used the mousse and love it, so was disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> The BEST hair spray for fine limp hair as it is dry and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.  I order this in multiples!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve re-ordered this product several times. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent that is overpowering and will fight w/ your cologne. I use this whenever I have a perm. I normally have fine straight hair, but when I get a wave put in this gives me the right amount of hold to keep the curl formed all day. Prevents them from going limp.</li>
    <li> Love this hairspray!! Works great when teasing for volume!</li>
    <li> Very nice firm hold. Smells great not strong. If you get caught in the rain your hair smells great again.  I thinks it&#x27;s a great item.</li>
    <li> Makes it easy to shape your hair.  Give it lift or make it fuller...it&#x27;s easy to do with this spray.</li>
    <li> This hairspray is light but still does a pretty good job of keeping my hairstyle intact, even in humid weather! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with fine hair such as myself.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d a different can then the past product as shown.  Totally different smell. The can that I rec&#x27;d does not spray,&lt;br /&gt;only a stream .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time now and have always like it.  Will order it again when I need more.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It works like a hair spray and a scrunch spray in one. I have a double part on the back of my crown and this is great to use to scrunch my hair up and keep it that way so that it lays nicely over the part. This is a large can of spray and worth the price of the $14 or $15 I payed especially since I didn&#x27;t pay shipping.</li>
