      <li>It is a good product, it smells good</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this product and it smells amazing when burnt on charcoal.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to have your home smelling great!</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
      <li>It burns with great smell and is very healing and is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Burns well smells better.</li>
      <li>Smells ok but just melts like sort of like plastic and end ups extinguishing the charcoal.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>If you love Copal, you&#x27;ll love this resin.</li>
      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied. :)</li>
      <li>These do evaporate kind of quickly so best to feed one little rock at a time onto your charcoal.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery good quality just watch about how many you place on the disk may extinguish the flame..</li>
      <li>Sweet nice clean resin.</li>
      <li>Perfectly clean and authentic.</li>
      <li>It melts Easy and doesn&#x27;t run over the sides of the charcoal.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn easily.  </li>
      <li>The resin, if it had come not crushed to powder, would have been great.  </li>
      <li>One you light it</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell very powerful at that point......</li>
      <li>Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Be warned, this is potent and deceptive when you first drop it on the charcoal.....</li>
      <li>I guess if you have sinus issues, you would not be able to smell it very well</li>
      <li>Good size bag IMO n will last me a loooong while.</li>
      <li>The chunks of copal were very mild scented and fairly large.</li>
      <li>The light color looks great against the black sand on my altar!!</li>
      <li>For the price, it is worth it...</li>
      <li>Lasts longer than I anticipated, so it was worth the cost.</li>
      <li>The few large pieces have burned well and release a great scent.  </li>
      <li>would probably buy it again, as it&#x27;s so cheap for such a large amount, as long as it smells good</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is quality product, most definitely white</li>
      <li>When you first drop it on, it takes a bit, and then sort of bubbles and melts into the charcoal......</li>
      <li>immediate response will be &amp;#34;that isn&#x27;t very much smoke....but give it 20 seconds or so, and you will have as much aromatic smoke as you could want.</li>
      <li>I put a good amount of salt on top of the coal, yet this resin still just dissolves almost instantly and loses it&#x27;s potency rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It will last forever, the smell is nice, not what i expected, but not bad.</li>
      <li>My neighbors dramatically slam their windows shut whenever I burn this, but then I get to enjoy my pungent peace and quiet.</li>
      <li>All went well with the order thanks so much</li>
      <li>I am experienced with buying raw incense materials and even though I have never purchased any white copal, I could tell this product was of a very high quality.</li>
      <li>but there was a good amount of dust in the bag itself and some of the pieces were very small...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
      <li>It is a really strong smell and that could be due to my inexperience</li>
      <li>but I have very sensitive nose.  </li>
      <li>If doing this in a small-ish room, you don&#x27;t need any more than a small piece about the size of a pea to produce smoke</li>
      <li>First, I read that this would elevate my spirit to another spiritual plane.</li>
      <li>so dense you cannot see clearly through</li>
      <li>May appear to be old, but looks are deceiving.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to resin, and when you open the bag, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything...</li>
      <li>The picture clearly shows solid pieces.  </li>
      <li>It took at least two hours before we could both agree that our nose hairs weren&#x27;t burnt off by the very powerful scent.</li>
      <li>strong aroma, you only need one or two small pieces, and the scent lasts a long time</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard, so it crushes easily for sprinkling over the coal- not gummy at all.</li>
      <li>I was really saddened to find a few burnable pieces completely surrounded by white powder.  </li>
      <li>Reading other posts tells me that this isn&#x27;t normal.  </li>

<li> it also didn&#x27;t seem to last very long once put on the charcoal..</li>
<li> I believe they likely offer better products, I just got a bad purchase.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> The Mayans burnt it and now I&#x27;m burning it to contact the Mayans and do other spells.</li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
<li> Dry, small, and crumbly.</li>
<li> The plastic bag is very thin and doesn&#x27;t preserve the copal very well.</li>
<li> , just I think the pieces are small and some converted in dust.</li>
<li> it starts POURING smoke out and the aroma gets very heavy indeed.  </li>
<li> , it turns into a gel within a few seconds, either this batch was bad or the product is bad</li>
<li> I feel really bad about this.  </li>
<li> Disappointed.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn easily.  It does smell good when I can get it to burn.  Lasts longer than I anticipated, so it was worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Good quality resin. It was used in Mexico for purification. The Mayans used it for diverse purposes. This granulated resin is good......</li>
    <li> This is quality product, most definitely white copal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to burn it on charcoal.  When you first drop it on, it takes a bit, and then sort of bubbles and melts into the charcoal......it doesn&#x27;t smell very powerful at that point......and then...BAM!!! it starts POURING smoke out and the aroma gets very heavy indeed.  If doing this in a small-ish room, you don&#x27;t need any more than a small piece about the size of a pea to produce smoke so dense you cannot see clearly through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, this is potent and deceptive when you first drop it on the charcoal.....immediate response will be &amp;#34;that isn&#x27;t very much smoke....but give it 20 seconds or so, and you will have as much aromatic smoke as you could want.</li>
    <li> Smells ok but just melts like sort of like plastic and end ups extinguishing the charcoal. Disappointed. I personally would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Dry, small, and crumbly. The smell isn&#x27;t very strong. The plastic bag is very thin and doesn&#x27;t preserve the copal very well. Will look at another seller.</li>
    <li> love it, love the way it was packaged, price was great, and shipping speed was great!</li>
    <li> For the price, it is worth it... but there was a good amount of dust in the bag itself and some of the pieces were very small...it also didn&#x27;t seem to last very long once put on the charcoal..but i like the aroma...</li>
    <li> Not quite what I wanted but okay.</li>
    <li> All went well with the order thanks so much</li>
    <li> Burns well smells better.</li>
    <li> Sweet nice clean resin.</li>
    <li> Burns nicely! Smells great!!  The light color looks great against the black sand on my altar!! ls great!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Great quality copal. It burns with great smell and is very healing and is very easy to use. Would consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> I burn it on charcoal. I put a good amount of salt on top of the coal, yet this resin still just dissolves almost instantly and loses it&#x27;s potency rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy it again, as it&#x27;s so cheap for such a large amount, as long as it smells good I&#x27;m satisfied. :)</li>
    <li> It burns to fast and over half of the bag was powder!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery good quality just watch about how many you place on the disk may extinguish the flame..</li>
    <li> First, I read that this would elevate my spirit to another spiritual plane. Accordingly, I gathered my family nearby so that we could all benefit from the scent as it burned in our charcoal brazier. The chunks of copal were very mild scented and fairly large. Packaging was excellent- double bagged inside a bubble envelope. Once this incense started to melt, my husband, unaware that I was attempting to elevate his spiritual plane, jumped up from the couch and started screaming that our house was on fire. My children panicked. There was a lot of running about, flinging open the outside doors, dousing the brazier with water, and overall mayhem. It took at least two hours before we could both agree that our nose hairs weren&#x27;t burnt off by the very powerful scent. After this incident, I took care to burn it only on our front patio. My neighbors dramatically slam their windows shut whenever I burn this, but then I get to enjoy my pungent peace and quiet. Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I feel really bad about this.  The resin, if it had come not crushed to powder, would have been great.  I was really saddened to find a few burnable pieces completely surrounded by white powder.  Reading other posts tells me that this isn&#x27;t normal.  The few large pieces have burned well and release a great scent.  However, the remainder was not burnable.  I believe they likely offer better products, I just got a bad purchase.</li>
    <li> I Like it, but don&#x27;t know how to use it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to resin, and when you open the bag, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything...so I was worried. I burned a lil bit and I like the smell. I&#x27;m posting pics with comments. Good size bag IMO n will last me a loooong while. Good seller (tom&#x27;s incense)</li>
    <li> Smells groce.  I know real good copal and this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great copal insence. It melts Easy and doesn&#x27;t run over the sides of the charcoal. Doesn&#x27;t take much to have your home smelling great! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful citrus-y smell.  These do evaporate kind of quickly so best to feed one little rock at a time onto your charcoal.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> It is a good product, it smells good but no exagereted, just I think the pieces are small and some converted in dust.</li>
    <li> It is a really strong smell and that could be due to my inexperience so I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either.</li>
    <li> I am experienced with buying raw incense materials and even though I have never purchased any white copal, I could tell this product was of a very high quality. I am very pleased with this product and it smells amazing when burnt on charcoal.  One reviewer said they could not smell it in the bag, I did not have this problem.  The resin has a very slight and subtle sweet smell.  I guess if you have sinus issues, you would not be able to smell it very well but I have very sensitive nose.  I will definitely order from this supplier again.</li>
    <li> these are heavenly, i burn them with cone incense or over charcoal. strong aroma, you only need one or two small pieces, and the scent lasts a long time</li>
    <li> May appear to be old, but looks are deceiving. This is very good Copal. The Mayans burnt it and now I&#x27;m burning it to contact the Mayans and do other spells. Thank You!</li>
    <li> When I received the bag, the copal had been crushed into powder.  The picture clearly shows solid pieces.  I&#x27;ll go somewhere next time</li>
    <li> Excellent and prontly service</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! It will last forever, the smell is nice, not what i expected, but not bad.</li>
    <li> Perfectly clean and authentic. I will definitely order from here again</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this! One you light it, it turns into a gel within a few seconds, either this batch was bad or the product is bad</li>
    <li> If you love Copal, you&#x27;ll love this resin. It&#x27;s very hard, so it crushes easily for sprinkling over the coal- not gummy at all. Would buy again.</li>
