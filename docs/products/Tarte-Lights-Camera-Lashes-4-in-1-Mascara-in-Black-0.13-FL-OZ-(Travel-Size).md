      <li>The mascara is very good &amp; the packaging is very sleek and eye catching.</li>
      <li>I loved how it looked like they took the tike to really wrap it up and put it in a nice sealed box!</li>
      <li>This is a great product; I got a sample of it in a subscription make-up bag, and loved it so much, I bought a full sized bottle immediately.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s outstanding.  </li>
      <li>mascara is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried hands down</li>
      <li>Makes my lashes look great and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like so many brands do.</li>
      <li>but as a regular mascara it is great.</li>
      <li>Great wear, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>Was strange packaging...but the product itself works great.  </li>
      <li>First tried a sample from ipsy glam bag and fell in love with this product</li>
      <li>Gives you full looking eyelashes without the clumping  like the cheaper brand do.</li>
      <li>i really wanted to give this one a go because so many people race about it.</li>
      <li>After years of trying every kind that came down the pike, I can honestly say that&lt;</li>
      <li>Huge plus right there.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know who recommended I purchase this but completely perplexed why anyone would have anything positive to say about it.  </li>
      <li>Great brush (no wierdo twists, just nice and thick), provides very thick lashes, with great</li>
      <li>This one is worth it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant to try an all natural mascara because I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to make my lashes stand out, but I knew that I needed to switch from the chemical laden ones that are at the drug stores now.</li>
      <li>It was kind of dry when trying to apply the mascara so it didn&#x27;t get a lot of coverage</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>haha!</li>
      <li>I love tart mascara with my blonde eyelashes</li>
      <li>and I opened it for the first time</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m most likely not ordering it again.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a difference between this and most other mascaras though.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this mascara</li>
      <li>It really made my thin lashes look spectacular.</li>
      <li>I have used better mascaras :/</li>
      <li>I would definitely repurchase and absolutely reccommend this to anybody!</li>
      <li>It was clumpy and rather dry, much like you experience with an older tube of mascara</li>
      <li>So far, I like the product.</li>
      <li>and I found it to be not thick enough for my taste.</li>
      <li>I have blonde eyelashes and this coats my lashes well enough and not too much.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much, because it really is expensive.  </li>
      <li>When they say waterproof - they mean waterproof, so make sure you have the proper makeup remover for it.  </li>
      <li>That really sucks, as I&#x27;m not one for spending more than a few bucks on mascara usually, but this stuff is usually worth it.</li>
      <li>It makes me wonder if the vendor I received it from, sells older tubes that are near or past their expiration date.</li>

<li> eyelashes look false</li>
<li> Lousy product with lousy packaging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is a great mascara! The brush gets every lash and gives good length and volume! One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve used... and I&#x27;ve used a lot haha!</li>
    <li> So far, I like the product. I haven&#x27;t really noticed too much of a difference between this and most other mascaras though.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have all those awful chemicals and it works great, makes my lashes look long and thick. I do let the 1st coat dry for a minute and then apply a second coat, but some people may not even need the 2nd coat.</li>
    <li> I never had a product make my eyes &#x27;pop&#x27; like this mascara I absolutely love this mascara one of my favorites now and i can see myself re buying this tarte product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know who recommended I purchase this but completely perplexed why anyone would have anything positive to say about it.  Lousy product with lousy packaging.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample size in a subscription monthly make-up bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes look false they&#x27;re so long!  I had a coworker ask me if I was wearing fake ones in photos thanks to this mascara - she couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Night and day difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t clump.  Even as it is getting older and starting to dry out in the tube a little, it still goes on without clumps and I never have to use another tool to separate my lashes and declump the make-up.  Huge plus right there.  I do not use any eye make-up remover and this stuff comes off like a dream.  I do not have residual mascara lingering on my upper cheeks after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this mascara again and again and again.  For reviewing purposes: I have average eyelash length, dark brown with blond tips from middle of eyelash out.</li>
    <li> I heard really great reviews about this mascara so I decided to try the trial size to see if I liked it. It was kind of dry when trying to apply the mascara so it didn&#x27;t get a lot of coverage and I found it to be not thick enough for my taste. I&#x27;ll stick with my Clump Crusher.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the appearance and performance of this mascara after seeing and listening to the Tarte rep.on QVC. It was clumpy and rather dry, much like you experience with an older tube of mascara you&#x27;ve been using for several weeks. It left tiny black flakes on my face and doesn&#x27;t add the length or the curl as advertised by the Tarte rep. on QVC. It makes me wonder if the vendor I received it from, sells older tubes that are near or past their expiration date.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. I have to apply several layers to get the color I want but it doesn&#x27;t flake or wipe off during the day, which is a huge plus to me!</li>
    <li> I read a review of mascaras that rated this one as the very best.  It&#x27;s pricey though, so I ordered a mini size to check it out.&lt;br /&gt;The review turns out to have been totally correct.  After years of trying every kind that came down the pike, I can honestly say that&lt;br /&gt;this is the best.  It&#x27;s outstanding.  Great brush (no wierdo twists, just nice and thick), provides very thick lashes, with great separation.&lt;br /&gt;To bad I love it so much, because it really is expensive.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll bite the bullet.  This one is worth it.  It really made my thin lashes look spectacular.</li>
    <li> Not the best mascara that everyone keeps saying. It did nothing for me in pictures. Nothing irl also</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I love this stuff, but when it came in the mail and I opened it for the first time, it seemed really dry and clumpy. I tried putting it on my eyelashes, and it flaked all over my face. That really sucks, as I&#x27;m not one for spending more than a few bucks on mascara usually, but this stuff is usually worth it. I&#x27;m most likely not ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried several, even the fiber one and I always go back to this one!</li>
    <li> Moves a little during the day if you are working out or sweating a lot but as a regular mascara it is great.</li>
    <li> Was strange packaging...but the product itself works great.  I have blonde eyelashes and this coats my lashes well enough and not too much.  Doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. It was broken and the mascara was completely dried up!!</li>
    <li> Awesome mascara - my third one.</li>
    <li> This is the best mascara ever !</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this mascara it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried hands down ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
    <li> I have used better mascaras :/ i really wanted to give this one a go because so many people race about it. I prefer NYC and 100% pure brand mascaras to this one :(</li>
    <li> This is a great product; I got a sample of it in a subscription make-up bag, and loved it so much, I bought a full sized bottle immediately. Great wear, lasts a long time, and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time like it said it would so im very glad about that! I loved how it looked like they took the tike to really wrap it up and put it in a nice sealed box! The mascara is very good &amp; the packaging is very sleek and eye catching. I absolutely love it! Thank you so much! I would definitely repurchase and absolutely reccommend this to anybody!</li>
    <li> Product had a defect packaging. Wand section did not properly fit the base. Whole thing dried up in a week.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure on this after some bad reviews but a friend recommend it. LOVE this mascara! It&#x27;s awesome. Makes my lashes look great and doesn&#x27;t dry them out like so many brands do. Try it for yourself!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size because it took me forever to finish the large tube. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of mascaras. This is the best mascara I have ever had! I have repurchased it already.</li>
    <li> Love this product. First tried a sample from ipsy glam bag and fell in love with this product</li>
    <li> When they say waterproof - they mean waterproof, so make sure you have the proper makeup remover for it.  I had been looking for a product that when you swim or out in the rain that it does not run and this one is it.  Gives you full looking eyelashes without the clumping  like the cheaper brand do.</li>
    <li> I love tart mascara with my blonde eyelashes it works so well.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try an all natural mascara because I didn&#x27;t think it would be able to make my lashes stand out, but I knew that I needed to switch from the chemical laden ones that are at the drug stores now. And boy am I glad I did! Lights, Camara, Lashes is amazing! My lashes look longer and fuller than they did when I was using a big brand mascara. This has become my all day, every day mascara and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, plus I&#x27;ve noticed very little drying and flaking! I love this stuff and will continue to use. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Works great and cheap!</li>
