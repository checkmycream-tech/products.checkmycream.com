<ol>
      <li>Excellent product and packaging!  </li>
      <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve used an still use today</li>
      <li>But he has raved about the Microtouch One razor saying it works wonderfully</li>
      <li>The razor is excellent.</li>
      <li>Tell me how I can get a good shave with it!!!!!</li>
      <li>I felt the price was fair.</li>
      <li>Sounded like a good idea.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to use either kind.  </li>
      <li>but probably not quite as good as the Mach 3</li>
      <li>Seems like a good money saver for me.</li>
      <li>my SUPER SHAVE came from the Vietnamese blades!!!  </li>
      <li>Love it will never buy a disposable blade ever again!</li>
      <li>I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO TRUST RICK&#x27;S PAID OPINION!</li>
      <li>Even Britain has some nice stuff...</li>
      <li>It is a good ol&#x27; fashioned razor just like the ones I had so many years ago.</li>
      <li>, it can take some getting use to but it works rather nicely.  </li>
      <li>Nice</li>
      <li>its a pretty good product, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHAVE!  </li>
      <li>The MicroTouchOne is by far the best razor, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
      <li>love it..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just that the two most noticeable packages contain the Vietnam blades.  </li>
      <li>I am 68 and had a razor like this many years ago.  </li>
      <li>He wanted to try this razor because he thought it would be a better shave.  </li>
      <li>but once I tried it I am so glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I went with Dollar Shave Club for men and LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying one of these razors</li>
      <li>Now they used the disposable razors for travel to make sure they wont lose their favorite razor that is used more often.  </li>
      <li>Interesting footnote...</li>
      <li>It gives you a good clean close comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>I have a pair of great utilitarian shoes made in Britain that are now 7 years old and going strong.  </li>
      <li>But products made in India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil and Chile all seem to be fine products.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to clean, and easy to change the blade.  </li>
      <li>I liked the razor that Rick Harrison advertized and because I really believed in his honesty and ethics I ordered one from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap.  </li>
      <li>First of all I ended up waiting more than three weeks for delivery from amazon.</li>
      <li>but this thing does not even come close to a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>I had forgotten how clean the shave is with one of these.  </li>
      <li>using the blade  need to get use to it, if there is another one that is better I would like to try it, other wise I&#x27;ll continue to use this brand for now, Thankyou</li>
      <li>I have used the blades that come with the razor and have used the special blades from Germany and still cannot get a close shave.  </li>
      <li>I have not tried the German blades, which might be superior, I do not know.  </li>
      <li>It is an over seas made version of the 1950&#x27;s Gillette super speed Fat Boy Razor.  </li>
      <li>Like many noted, it would be nice if the handle was a little longer.  </li>
      <li>but this produce is indeed worth buying instead of getting all of those dang razors all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>This razor is pure junk!  </li>
      <li>Seen on Pawn Stars as a great quality product, but I&#x27;d say that is completely dishonest and a scam.</li>
      <li>Foamy didn&#x27;t do much for Microtouch but was much better than gel for regular razor.</li>
      <li>He has super-thick facial hair, like sandpaper, but says it may work fine for guys with softer hair.</li>
      <li>I was immediately surprised on my first shave!  </li>
      <li>After many months of usage, I started having problems getting the razor open enough to be able to get the old blades out, and put the new blades in.  </li>
      <li>Only positive is that in trying to get it to work I switched, after 25 years of using gel, to original foamy shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>Very well built and sturdy.  </li>
      <li>Now I remember why I jumped on the multiple blade models when they became available .Dont</li>
      <li>My husband really likes this product...</li>
      <li>It is very well made.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
      <li>No way to get a real close shave.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for the razor blades and didn&#x27;t think much about the razor as I already had one.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the spokesman that advertises the product</li>
      <li>I really like the heft and feel of the razor.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really nicked myself.  </li>
      <li>Great Quality for such an inexpensive product, the blades last a long time.  </li>
      <li>What little bit it does is very very easy to clean, and takes about ten seconds.</li>
      <li>it do a decent job</li>
      <li>I had tried electric razors MANY years ago, and not only didn&#x27;t like the shave, but one of the models, the screen got a hole in it after only 6 months of use and I didn&#x27;t see it until it cut the heck out of my face!  </li>
      <li>This is a decent shaver.  </li>
      <li>With the thickness and growth of my beard in order to keep up with a comfortable shave i would have to use the single blade razor twice a day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone needing an inexpensive shave.</li>
      <li>Recommend this product highly.  </li>
      <li>So honestly I don&#x27;t have any negative feedback about this razor, and I highly recommend it...</li>
      <li>My husband normally uses a battery operated multi-blade razor.  </li>
      <li>Oh, and in case anybody cares, I did finally compare the German blades with the Vietnamese blades I received, and the German blades are better, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  </li>
      <li>I have shaved with it quite a few times to get more accustomed to it.</li>
      <li>The only problem I had with the MicroTouchOne was the short handle, but I got used to it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Yes, I made sure blade inserted properly and even tried another blade with absolutely no dice.  </li>
      <li>I used the same type of Gillette when I first started shaving.</li>
      <li>It was not, the first day he used this razor, he came away with multiple nicks on his face.  </li>
      <li>WOW!  </li>
      <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the double edge, and there were more knicks that with my other razors.</li>
      <li>Wish I had not thrown it away because I would certainly send this thing back.  </li>
      <li>So, and I want to make this clear...</li>
      <li>So far the problem has not repeated.  </li>
      <li>I am a 46 year old man.  </li>
      <li>Does not shave near as close as my multi-blade razor.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin and this product does not work.  </li>
      <li>That sure did not happen with the quadruple razor I had been using lately.  </li>
      <li>COULD NOT GET CLOSE EVEN AFTER TRYING MULTIPLE NEW BLADES.  </li>
      <li>generally does not complain or rave</li>
      <li>I cut myself far less often with this than with modern multiblade razors.  </li>
      <li>Works very well and is a hundred times cheaper than buying other brands.</li>
      <li>It is pretty heavy</li>

    <li> Worst razor ever returning mine and getting a refund!!! Waste of money</li>
    <li> Cuts your face to ribbons following scraping,  pulling and tearing the whiskers out of your face. Sounded like a good idea. I used the same type of Gillette when I first started shaving. Now I remember why I jumped on the multiple blade models when they became available .Dont take this leap back in time. Your face will thank you. Can&#x27;t speak for a Head Shaver embarked</li>
    <li> This razor did not meet my expectations.  Does not live up to its claim, very poor quality.</li>
    <li> Meets my expectations</li>
    <li> I wont rate any lower than five stars bc this is a quality product made in the USA. I personally had trouble with only one razor and switched back to the ease and comfort of multi blade razors. With the thickness and growth of my beard in order to keep up with a comfortable shave i would have to use the single blade razor twice a day.</li>
    <li> My husband has to shave every day that he works as he is not allowed any facial hair as a correctional officer.  His beard is so thick that it sometimes takes 2 razors to shave.  But he has raved about the Microtouch One razor saying it works wonderfully and I am no longer buying razors!!  What a money-saver!!</li>
    <li> 11-1-15 update to review:  After many months of usage, I started having problems getting the razor open enough to be able to get the old blades out, and put the new blades in.  I&#x27;m guessing that repeated soakings in water may have caused a problem with the innards of the handle.  I SOLVED the problem though.  I let the entire razor soak in Olive Oil overnight.  That was about 2 months ago.  So far the problem has not repeated.  Oh, and in case anybody cares, I did finally compare the German blades with the Vietnamese blades I received, and the German blades are better, but it&#x27;s pretty close.  I&#x27;m happy to use either kind.  I had tried electric razors MANY years ago, and not only didn&#x27;t like the shave, but one of the models, the screen got a hole in it after only 6 months of use and I didn&#x27;t see it until it cut the heck out of my face!  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been a slave to the expensive triple, quadruple, sextuple (?) blades pushed onto the American public for years.  They seemed adequate but the prices have just simply gotten outrageous.  So, having read the reviews on this razor, I decided to give it a shot.  WOW!  I was immediately surprised on my first shave!  It went without a hitch, AND the results were the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in YEARS.  Further, the next day, my &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; was low enough as not to be noticeable from 3&#x27; away.  That sure did not happen with the quadruple razor I had been using lately.  (I will not mention brand names as I don&#x27;t care to be sued, as these companies just might do that if you &amp;#34;disparage&amp;#34; their name.  Interesting footnote... one of the other reviewers mentioned that the package/advertisement for this product says there are German made blades that come with it.  But when they opened up their package, they found the blades were made in Vietnam and the container made in China.  Maybe they did not notice that there is a THIRD pack of blades in the container, below the razor!  These indeed DO SAY German made, and they are Germanmade.  It&#x27;s just that the two most noticeable packages contain the Vietnam blades.  So, and I want to make this clear... my SUPER SHAVE came from the Vietnamese blades!!!  I have not tried the German blades, which might be superior, I do not know.  While I cannot speak to all products made in foreign countries, I can say yeah, Chinese made stuff appears to have a lot of junk quality.  But products made in India, Vietnam, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil and Chile all seem to be fine products.  For example India makes some of the finest garments in the world.  Even Britain has some nice stuff... I have a pair of great utilitarian shoes made in Britain that are now 7 years old and going strong.  Try to wear other country brands of shoes and see if you get that quality.  I doubt it.  The vast majority of our fruits in the wintertime come from various South American countries, and I have yet to get inferior product from any of those places.</li>
    <li> me and my husband was watching tv.. and this commercial came on.. and he had said one of his friends used it and said he loves it.. so I ordered it 2 min later..when it arrived he used it and he said he loves it.. so get your dad or husband one for fathers day!</li>
    <li> love it.. my husband and sons swear it gives them a closer shave than just the disposable razor.  Now they used the disposable razors for travel to make sure they wont lose their favorite razor that is used more often.  blades are SHARP and can hold up to several shaves before needing to be changed.  would recommend and would purchase again</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and this product does not work.  I would not recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great Quality for such an inexpensive product, the blades last a long time.  I highly recommend this for anyone needing an inexpensive shave.</li>
    <li> Extremely difficult to use without getting nicked.  Takes three times as long to shave vs. Gillette Fusion.  No way to get a real close shave.  Only positive is that in trying to get it to work I switched, after 25 years of using gel, to original foamy shaving cream.  Foamy didn&#x27;t do much for Microtouch but was much better than gel for regular razor.</li>
    <li> Works like a razor should!  Excellent product and packaging!  Recommend this product highly.  Very well built and sturdy.  Razor blades come with it to!</li>
    <li> horrible product don&#x27;t waste your money. I used it several time and each time it gave me razor burn.</li>
    <li> I am a 46 year old man.  I bought this for the razor blades and didn&#x27;t think much about the razor as I already had one.  The razor is excellent. It gives you a good clean close comfortable shave. It is an over seas made version of the 1950&#x27;s Gillette super speed Fat Boy Razor.  It is very well made.  Must buy.</li>
    <li> its a pretty good product, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE YOU TRY TO SHAVE!  Or you will end up looking like a mummy, it can take some getting use to but it works rather nicely.  I don&#x27;t really care for the spokesman that advertises the product but this produce is indeed worth buying instead of getting all of those dang razors all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been using the same razor for weeks and its still sharp</li>
    <li> using the blade  need to get use to it, if there is another one that is better I would like to try it, other wise I&#x27;ll continue to use this brand for now, Thankyou</li>
    <li> It is a good ol&#x27; fashioned razor just like the ones I had so many years ago. I felt the price was fair.</li>
    <li> Tough to use after using 4 blade system for so long, but works as expected. Takes a little longer to shave as you need to be careful to avoids nicks and cuts. Would recommend as long as time in shaving is not a factor....</li>
    <li> Horrible shaver. Total scam. I should have known when i saw it on an infomercial.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for my husband.  He uses it everyday.  Loves it.  Would recommend to other male family and friends</li>
    <li> I really like the heft and feel of the razor.  I started shaving with one of these double edge razors about 55 years ago.  I had forgotten how clean the shave is with one of these.  It is easy to clean, and easy to change the blade.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this order was the length of time it took to get the product and that it didn&#x27;t come from the company that I thought I had ordered from.  I would buy again but only through another vendor.</li>
    <li> The blades are made in Vietnam. The razor is made in China. Extremely poor quality; feels like it&#x27;s made out of cheap tin, very loose and wobbly assembly I&#x27;d be afraid to shave with. Seen on Pawn Stars as a great quality product, but I&#x27;d say that is completely dishonest and a scam. This will be returned.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for a couple of weeks and cannot get a close shave.  I have used the blades that come with the razor and have used the special blades from Germany and still cannot get a close shave.  I believe that my electric razor gives me a shave as close.  My throw away razors give me a lot closer shave!</li>
    <li> My husband normally uses a battery operated multi-blade razor.  He wanted to try this razor because he thought it would be a better shave.  It was not, the first day he used this razor, he came away with multiple nicks on his face.  It has only one blade.  He threw it away the same day and went back to the razor he had been using before the next day.</li>
    <li> Love it will never buy a disposable blade ever again! Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> WORST SHAVE I&#x27;ve EVER HAD!!  COULD NOT GET CLOSE EVEN AFTER TRYING MULTIPLE NEW BLADES.  I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO TRUST RICK&#x27;S PAID OPINION!</li>
    <li> not as expected or sold</li>
    <li> i read the directions.  please tell me how to use it  I am 68 and had a razor like this many years ago.  This is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;Am open minded .  Tell me how I can get a good shave with it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a decent shaver.  Like many noted, it would be nice if the handle was a little longer.  The blades that come with it do a decent job but probably not quite as good as the Mach 3 I&#x27;ve used for years.  I haven&#x27;t really nicked myself.  I have a pretty tough beard and only shave a couple times a week.  Seems like a good money saver for me.</li>
    <li> Does not shave near as close as my multi-blade razor. I have shaved with it quite a few times to get more accustomed to it. What it does do well is to shave without clogging when you let the stubble get a little too long.</li>
    <li> Works very well and is a hundred times cheaper than buying other brands. Be careful though, it is very sharp.</li>
    <li> Cheap.  My husband hated it.  Used it once and said toss it.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this product... He says it shaves his face smoother than it has been in years...&lt;br /&gt;He generally does not complain or rave... just goes with the flow....</li>
    <li> I use this razor daily and it works extremely well. Use caution replacing blades they are extremely sharp and you get cut with very little notice.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying one of these razors but once I tried it I am so glad I did.  It gives you the closest shave I have ever had.  I will never use anything else now but one of these.</li>
    <li> I liked the razor that Rick Harrison advertized and because I really believed in his honesty and ethics I ordered one from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The razor was supposed to come with a travel case just like Rick Harrison advertized. and the blades are advertized to be made in Germany. First of all I ended up waiting more than three weeks for delivery from amazon. This is the second time they failed to inform us that the product was unavailable. but I promise it is the last time.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, there was NO travel case, but instead, a chrome stand to hang the razor on. Thirdly, the advertizement states that the blades were Solingen steel, made in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;Funny haw the small dispenser is imbossed with the words &amp;#34;made in china&amp;#34; while the blades themselves are wrapped in paper that says made in Viet Nam, Mfg under lic. of Dorco, Co. Ltmd Korea.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A CROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend said it &amp;#34;caught&amp;#34; on his face, especially around the edges and corners.  He has super-thick facial hair, like sandpaper, but says it may work fine for guys with softer hair.</li>
    <li> Nice but I just wanted to return to the basic!!</li>
    <li> hate it cuts up your face</li>
    <li> The MicroTouchOne is by far the best razor, and the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The blades last longer than any of the expensive ones like Gillette, and the single blade shaves better and doesn&#x27;t gunk up like the three, four, or five blade razors do. What little bit it does is very very easy to clean, and takes about ten seconds. It came with enough blades to last several months, and it pays for itself in just one month. The only problem I had with the MicroTouchOne was the short handle, but I got used to it very quickly. So honestly I don&#x27;t have any negative feedback about this razor, and I highly recommend it...</li>
    <li> I cut myself far less often with this than with modern multiblade razors.  I&#x27;ll never go back now that I&#x27;ve tried this.</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be a replacement for the double and triple edge razors I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. However, I was disappointed. The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the double edge, and there were more knicks that with my other razors. So I&#x27;m sorry Rick, but I disagree, and perhaps its just my beard. It is pretty heavy and I do need to shave every day.</li>
    <li> This razor is pure junk!  I do not have a heavy or coarse beard but this thing does not even come close to a clean shave.  I have tried it three times and in every position of the razor you can imagine and it is like it doesn&#x27;t even have a blade.  Yes, I made sure blade inserted properly and even tried another blade with absolutely no dice.  Total waste of your money.  Don&#x27;t buy this crap.  Had to tear carton up totally to remove this thing.  Wish I had not thrown it away because I would certainly send this thing back.  Horrible waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> I went with Dollar Shave Club for men and LOVE it.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve used an still use today</li>
    <li> this by far is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever used this razor blade will cut the hell out of your face before you know it&#x27;s even cut it will look clean and then all of a sudden blood!!!</li>
