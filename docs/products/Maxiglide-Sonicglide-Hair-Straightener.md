      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing.</li>
      <li>but if you take your time it is a nice result.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is my 4th Maxius Steam iron.  </li>
      <li>but  not to thrilled with the device.</li>
      <li>This one I&#x27;m not that thrilled with.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t even heat up, its luke warm, I even put my finger on it to feel it, and nothing.</li>
      <li>, I honestly feel that the steam feature of this straightener combined with my use of Grapeseed oil has salvaged my ends.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the original since 2005, the original is the best.  </li>
      <li>The first maxiglide I purchased was great</li>
      <li>Ordered this one from amazon, and let me tell you is great, works wonderful, the fact that the cord on this one was improve is a super plus for people with long hair like me.</li>
      <li>I have used the Maximus products for over 8 years and love them.  </li>
      <li>The top plate is NOT removable.</li>
      <li>and I got this one( which is suppose to be better).</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wish I ordered more than one because they are no longer selling the MX-597 on their site.</li>
      <li>Having to do so many more sections just seems like a time waster to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
      <li>I feel like  buying 5 more &amp;#34;just in case!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I LOVE this straightener.  </li>
      <li>Still satisfied with purchase though.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I LOVE it.</li>
      <li>I love the Maxiglide, I purchased it years ago watching an infomercial.</li>
      <li>I used to love Maxiglide, now that they have changed to the Sonicglide</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product however, the heat level could be much higher.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s a defect</li>
      <li>and it lasted 10 years or more  </li>
      <li>(I have to fill it more often), and it has leaked now and then.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>it is an ok 2nd best.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a relaxing system on my hair anymore! :)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Perhaps it will go away with more use.</li>
      <li>I love this item.</li>
      <li>You will not be satisfied with the performance of this unit.  </li>
      <li>If you can seethe dots on each side of the 4 sides, it is authentic.  </li>
      <li>This is the best flat iron that I have ever used.</li>
      <li>The steamer button didn&#x27;t work and it was not as effective as my original purchase.</li>
      <li>( pretty bummed about it as i&#x27;ve not found any replacement straightener that worked as great as my original Maxiglide did.</li>
      <li>I had one of these when they first came out and absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>I loved them when I used them the first time.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited!</li>
      <li>this is the first time it doesn&#x27;t work super great.  </li>
      <li>I relax my hair and was able to stop doing that for three years because my Maxi-Glide did such a great job for me... saved tons of money!&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really good, I only own it for a month</li>
      <li>Even the ones I have given as gifts have lasted a long time, and the recipients loved them!</li>
      <li>and it does get very hot!  </li>
      <li>It felt cheaply made and flimsy.</li>
      <li>It also makes a sound when pressed</li>
      <li>I can straighten, smooth and even curl it with this tool.</li>
      <li>I used a friends and it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>But you can just use a light weight moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Hopefully they will become available again.</li>
      <li>but so far it&#x27;s really good.</li>
      <li>I got this product before that was why I got another one when the old one is no longer good.</li>
      <li>No where near as good as the Maxi Glide.</li>
      <li>I bought a Maxiglide many years ago and absolutely fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>This product is good but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old Maxi Glide MX-597.</li>
      <li>If you use the right kind of water, it adds a nice shine and soft texture to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I already knew it was going to be great because I had already owned the original product (which concked out on me years back (BBBOOO)! ).</li>
      <li>I had one of the early original ones &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>, the performance of the flat iron is great.</li>
      <li>I have used twice and (no..it is not like the original MaxiGlide)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sonic glide look slighted bent outwards and doesn&#x27;t really close together when doing ones hair.  I need to hold it close at the top because there&#x27;s a small gap other than it was made for really thick hair not thin.</li>
    <li> Well,it wasnt the larger maxius I thought it would be.when i tried to look at the dvd it was all distorted.Does anyone test these things?</li>
    <li> I have had a Maxiglide in the past and it broke because my sister stepped on it. So to find one on amazon I was so happy! I love it! I have thick curly hair and sometimes I just want to wear it straight. I&#x27;ve tried every hair straightener out there and spent much money, but Maxiglide is the only one to get through my thick hair. I love this and I would recommend it to anyone ^_^</li>
    <li> I had purchased the original maxi glide years ago but it broke and I got this one( which is suppose to be better). I have course hair and the original maxi glide worked wonders my hair would turn out bone straight. With this sonic glide my hair was a disaster!! This is not made for course natural african American hair. I will be giving this to my niece who has much finer hair.</li>
    <li> I wish they would go back to the older model.  This isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
    <li> My hair is too short for this kind of nonsense, but my wife says it works really well...  :-)</li>
    <li> I have not bought this product yet. I used a friends and it is fantastic. I have natural thick curly hair and now it is bone-straight. i didnt have to blowdry it. My hair was wet and i combed it a little bit before using the flatiron. The only thing is that you have to get the tiny flatiron to get your roots. Thats nothing for me especially beacuse i have not straightened my hair in 3 yrs! I hope to buy it soon</li>
    <li> The steam feature did not work at all.  The item was returned.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron that I have ever used. I love it.</li>
    <li> No the straightener would not align or close properly and had a lot of vibration in it</li>
    <li> It is identical to the Maxiglide, so I don&#x27;t understand the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; branding.  The original Maxiglide was much less expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this iron for a year and it did the job . It would dry out my hair from the steam . But you can just use a light weight moisturizer. One day it fell and a piece broke off and the plate would slide so it made it very difficult to flat iron so I just purchased the babybliss pro Argan hear flat iron 1&amp;#34; and its ok but not better than the maxi glide . Jus know that once it drops that piece on the tip could break . But I would buy it again trying to find something similar but cheaper .</li>
    <li> This was an older version which I was not thrilled with but it still gets the job done...</li>
    <li> They have changed this product from their previous model from 5-8 years ago. If you have extremely curly hair, try something else or use a really good conditioning product to send your hair the message to straighten out.</li>
    <li> The old version is much better.. don&#x27;t waste your money. My hair was still frizzy and the noise was annoying.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get hot. I had one when they first came out and it lasted 10 years or more  It was great. When it died I tried the new one and it just wasn&#x27;t the same</li>
    <li> The product is very bulky and takes time to get use to.</li>
    <li> It takes a long time to straighten depending on hair type. But it stays straight until it gets wet and its an impressive straightness if you do it right. small section by small section and go slowly and you will see the best results if you steam as needed at least a hand width from the scalp. Remember to put in water and clean it. And it is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. hair type: curly course Italian hair. have used it for a few years. if you rush it will be a disappointing result but if you take your time it is a nice result.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of these for my wife after seeing the infomercial in the past.  I bought it for a valentines&#x27; day present.  My wife has no more splitend problems and her frizz is a thing of the past.  My mother in law loves it too.  I purchased one for her birthday present.  My father in law also loves this as his beautiful wife is even more beautiful!!!  Thanks again Amazon, You guys rock!!!</li>
    <li> i like it. Thanks for offering such a Product. it is nice especially for African type hair. it helped me a lot. thanks again</li>
    <li> The maxiglide doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as the ones I have had in the past.  It still works but not as good.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed! I seriously thought I was getting the legendery Maxiglide. NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t even heat up, its luke warm, I even put my finger on it to feel it, and nothing. Then I put it up to 10 to maximum heat, waited, luke warm, and useless. This is nowhere near the Maxiglide I had years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really miss the original Maxiglide that made my hair swing to and fro, off to look for another one.</li>
    <li> I love it!! I&#x27;ve hard one before and it lasted for a decade. It only broke because I dropped it or it still would be working perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;This new model is great and I am excited to see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;It straightens my wavy hair in the humid weather of Hawaii and it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t use the vibrate setting I used it without that. the size is perfect or shoulder length to apl bsl lengths and doesn&#x27;t make your arm or hand hurt, doesn&#x27;t burn scalp with steam .........easy to manuever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get my whole semi natural head straight in half the time. no arm ache!</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and only used it once Bc it didn&#x27;t heat at all. I didn&#x27;t return Bc I don&#x27;t like returning but will not purchase again from here. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> The item doesnt work well. It continuously shuts itself off and leaks water profusely.I had one years ago and swore by this product. It just wasn&#x27;t up to the previous standard  Bad investment.</li>
    <li> This straightener just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair the same as Maxius did. So, if you&#x27;re looking for a replacement, don&#x27;t get this tool. It is much smaller and doesn&#x27;t get as hot, so it was completely useless for me. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I have super curly frizzy hair &amp; have been using the Maxiglide for several years. Its the only thing that can straighten my hair. This new version - the sonicglide - I LOVE it. It not only has the old features; the prongs to keep your hair in place and the light steam to help straighten your hair - the sonic (slight vibration) helps your hair glide through. The design also allows you to flip the ends of your hair up, which is how I like to wear my hair. The issue that I have had in the past they have not fixed - there are 2 clips on the end that is plastic and if you are not careful they will break. I have learned to be very careful where I put the Maxiglide down so it doesn&#x27;t bang those clips. My last non-sonic version got a short in the cord - that is why I had to purchase this new version. In any case - I still give this product 5 stars. I received product quickly and it was wrapped securely.</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough.</li>
    <li> Love love love this flat iron.....my daughter has very thick virgin African American hair and it straightens it seamlessly with no pain....I love it.</li>
    <li> My older daughter has sworn by this product for years,  But had warned me they had changed these from the original Maxi- Glides.I ordered this one for my younger daughter. I was really disappointed in it. It did not straighten that well. It felt cheaply made and flimsy. I sent it back after one use. I purchased the remington wet 2 dry on sale at Kmart for 20$ and it works wonders , We love it!</li>
    <li> My hair is natural and naturally pretty dry.  My ends (60% of which is color treated) had been feeling unusually dry recently, I honestly feel that the steam feature of this straightener combined with my use of Grapeseed oil has salvaged my ends.  This left my hair feeling like silk from root to tip.  Definately a keeper</li>
    <li> Comparing this to the original Maxiglide the Sonicglide is a dissappointment.  It does not get as hot. I will keep it because I need it but  not to thrilled with the device.</li>
    <li> I love this because as a black woman it helps give me the relaxer look without any chemicals. I recommend this because it deliveries results. I have natural hair and this device creates a relax look for me. I love it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money. this a knock off of the real one. it leaks all over your hair and instead of having a silky finish you&#x27;ll end up with a complete mess.</li>
    <li> I apologize for the sarcastic title but this flat iron is so bad the hot metal pins will shred your ends cause major damage and the worst split ends this leaves you&#x27;re hair damaged badly in every way will even pull and damage hair follicles it took my hair a long time to recover about a year its unfortunate its still on the market I regret ever using this junk I am speaking of the old version that people claim to be missing I can not imagine the new one being any different as far as shredding you&#x27;re ends because of the hot metal pins just a bad design for hair hot raw metal pins awful.</li>
    <li> I use to own  the original one that used to be heavy, then in one of my many trips it falls and broke, order other one that wasn&#x27;t the original but a copy of it and only last a year, this time I  make sure I order from the very same company and to my surprise it&#x27;s really good, I only own it for a month but so far it&#x27;s really good.</li>
    <li> I think my original maxi glide was made with more heavier materials and my breakage was less than what I get using this Sonicglide. But I am going back to my old standbuy the hot comb! Heat is a known hair damager.</li>
    <li> I own several flat irons, and this is my current go-to for straight styling right now. The vibrating plates improve overall hair styling time and the pins help with separating out kinks and curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the plates are misaligned, so you have to clamp down just right before closing the plates and flat ironing. The plates are also difficult to clean. For the bottom, I take it out and run a cotton swab through and around the pins. For the top, I wipe it down and then use a pick to carefully clean out the holes. The top plate is NOT removable. This flat iron does not heat up quickly, and the temperature gauge is 1-10 only. I set mine on 10 and have thin, coarse hair. Sometimes I have to do 2 passes if I don&#x27;t align the pins, but only 1 pass if they are aligned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for hair getting pulled out, I lose more with other flat irons. Your head loses thousands of hairs a day. The only reason you&#x27;ll notice it on this flat iron is because it gets stuck in the pins and isn&#x27;t falling on the floor or your back, completely out of sight. The curling plates being on the outside of this iron are supposed to be functional, but it&#x27;s really useless since the pins snag your hair at the edge of the plates when you go to curl. Doing a bump under at the ends is doable. A full curl is not without a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The steam feature is great. If you use the right kind of water, it adds a nice shine and soft texture to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want straight hair, this can do the trick. If you want versatility in your iron, look elsewhere. This product is not as versatile as it looks at first glance.</li>
    <li> Love it. Straightens my thick wavy/curly hair with ease!!!</li>
    <li> I have this Maxi glide but i didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon,  It was a gift from my husband.  I was so excited when I got this for a Christmas present.  I love my fist Maxi glide, the one with the blue steam button.  The old one made my hair silky and I believe it even helped my hair grow.  After getting this sonic glide my hair has been severely damaged.  My hair use to be very long.  It almost looks as though my hair has shred.  I haven&#x27;t had the product 2 years and the blue light always blinks and when you push the grey button it doesn&#x27;t push out any steam.  The old one you could hear the steam.  I&#x27;m sorry for rambling ,but I would not recommend this product to anyone.  They should bring back the old version because the new one stinks!!!</li>
    <li> I have used Maxiglide products before but this Sonicglide is horrible.  It heats up then you start to use it and it stops working.  Now it doesn&#x27;t even heat up.  It also dried out my hair.  I can’t return it because it’s past the 90 days.  I lost $65.00 and I’m going back to the regular Maxiglide.  I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have received the item, and got shocked when opened it, it clearly shows that the straightener is used, some edges color were peeled off !</li>
    <li> I had one of these when they first came out and absolutely loved it.  I had it for years until the wire shorted out.  I tried to order a new one but couldn&#x27;t find one or one that was reasonably priced.  I was so excited when I decided to search again and this one came up.  It is exactly like my old one except it has the sonic feature and it seems to be lighter than the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it straightens my hair!!  Hopefully this one lasts as long as the original one did.</li>
    <li> I used to love Maxiglide, now that they have changed to the Sonicglide I DO NOT love it. I&#x27;m so disappointed. I have used this straightener for years! Now it just does not straighten like it used to. Was forced to go with a different brand.</li>
    <li> I got this product before that was why I got another one when the old one is no longer good. The new one I got was slimmer and it does not work as good as the old one I had. I am very disappointed at the result. JL from Cerritos, California</li>
    <li> Five Stars Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Works great on my hair</li>
    <li> Waste of my time and money. It doesn&#x27;t straighten, it tangled my hair up and even after several passes my hair didnt get straight. I am trying to get rid of it since I missed the time to send it back. Don&#x27;t purchase is product.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed, this didn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
    <li> Have owned quite a few Maxiglide hair straighteners and love them.  Needed a replacement for my Maxiglide XP that died.  This one is the same size which I like but, that&#x27;s about it.  It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as any of the other Maxiglide products I&#x27;ve used.  Also, have no clue with the &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; feature is all about - does NOTHING for me.  Overall, can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s a defect but it doesn&#x27;t stay on - I have to keep wiggling the cord to &#x27;start&#x27; it up again.  very disappointed</li>
    <li> This straightener is what my girlfriend has always wanted. Her hair is straight for a long time, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like burnt hair.</li>
    <li> Streamer doesn&#x27;t work properly . You can hear the clicking of the steamer though.  Very disappointed in this product n.</li>
    <li> the steam area did not work</li>
    <li> I bought a Maxiglide many years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. I have very course thick hair and just blow drying it at the salon would take hours! And with the Maxiglide it took like 30-40 min!!!! With awesome results. The Sonic glide works about the same, but the width of it is smaller which is the only thing I didn&#x27;t like. It still works great though.</li>
    <li> Im pretty pissed off i spent $100 on a product that doesn&#x27;t work properly. My husband threw away the box that it came in so im stuck with it.  I got it in the mail and i was so excited because i&#x27;ve been wanting one so bad for a long time. Finally bought it and was higly disappointed to find out that the steam does not work (whole reason i bought it) i bought it brand new and got a used on. When i took it out the pakage you could tell it had been used cause water was still in the it. I should atleast get my money back for a product that doesnt work.</li>
    <li> Does the job but doesn&#x27;t get as hot as original. Still satisfied with purchase though.</li>
    <li> I had the original maxiglide, and after about 8 yrs of usage said bye to me. Ordered this one from amazon, and let me tell you is great, works wonderful, the fact that the cord on this one was improve is a super plus for people with long hair like me.</li>
    <li> So I am a DIEHARD Maxiglide user, it is the ONLY flat iron that works on my wavy, thick, curly unruly hair!!  I&#x27;d heard a lot of rumors about this product and when it was time for a new one I have to admit I was very nervous about buying one based on the reviews I had read.  Well, I got my new one in the mail and plugged it in,  it heated up real fast just like the old one and it does get very hot!  It feels different from the original Maxiglide in that it&#x27;s not as heavy but I have to say It does still work!  I have to turn it right up to 10 because I do have very thick curly hair but it does work great.  The only negative I&#x27;ve found so far is yes, the teeth do not close as well as the old Maxiglide but if you work with it it does go together and work right.&lt;br /&gt;I seriously rely on this product DAILY, and I have no idea what I will ever do if for whatever reason they become unavailable.  I feel like  buying 5 more &amp;#34;just in case!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t let the negative reviews scare me off, the one I got works good, I am very happy :)</li>
    <li> Got it on time so that&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;ve had this same brand and type of hair straightener for 6 years now and this is the first time it doesn&#x27;t work super great.  It still turns on and heats up and everything but something seems different.  Maybe that&#x27;s why they have taken them off the shelves everywhere and you can only order it now.</li>
    <li> I love the Maxiglide, I purchased it years ago watching an infomercial. It worked wonders, so when it finally broke you could only image my dispair. After searching for a replacement for few years I finally thought I found it on Amazon. I was so excited! At the time I paid $120, but for the Maxiglide it was worth it. Only problem, this was not the original Maxiglide I have known and loved for years. It didn&#x27;t heat up at all, didn&#x27;t straighten my hair, basically didn&#x27;t work. Come to find out it&#x27;s actually not the original, not sure why they stopped making it but this is the new version of the Maxiglide. I called the company and they were very sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me and allowed me to send it back for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for at least 5 years, maybe longer.  I loved it and it worked really well for my thick, very curly hair.  can&#x27;t imagine using a flat iron without teeth to straighten my hair.  And I loved the steam that comes out.  My hair was completely straight and really soft, which is the opposite of my natural hair!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, as described... Would recommend to others</li>
    <li> The flat iron just does not perform as advertized. The steam is very poor and unreliable. No where near as good as the Maxi Glide. Why can&#x27;t someone get this right?  This is the fourth type of steam flat iron I have tried. And I want termaline plates, something good for your hair.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed, this Sonicglide straightens your hair okay but it&#x27;s not as good as the regular Maxiglide I bought years ago.  The steam doesn&#x27;t work as well, therefore leaving my hair fuller and with some frizz.  I would never buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> I have used this producted yesrs ago and broke it.  This is the best flst iron I have ever used for  my none processed hair.</li>
    <li> Horribly disappointed with this straightener. I had one of the early original ones &amp; loved it. It would straighten my very naturally curly hair with one pass.  This new version is awful. The steam button is a joke. I had hot water running out of the holes, it hardly steamed at all.  The old version had teeth on upper and lower plates.  The new version only has teeth on the bottom.  The upper floating plate doesn&#x27;t align very well with the bottom either.  After 10 passes on the same strand of hair, all I got was a dry frizzy mess.  I even added some Argan oil to try to help things out.  After spending an hour trying to get this straightener to work, I gave up and went back to my natural curls.  I&#x27;ll try to pawn this off on someone else.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This Maxiglide Sonicglide is not a good as the original.  It is much smaller and does not get as hot as the original.  They should not have changed it.  I have been using the original since 2005, the original is the best.  They need to change it back.  If something works, why mess with it.</li>
    <li> Um, it came used with hair on it and a bunch of nasty crap.... Really???  Returning, and washing my hands 50x after touching that, eww!</li>
    <li> I received the product 4 days after I ordered it and I already knew it was going to be great because I had already owned the original product (which concked out on me years back (BBBOOO)! ). I can tell you that I tried another product (NOT &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; related) and I didn&#x27;t get the same results as I know I would with the Maxiglide. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR WORKING WITH A SELLER OF THIS GREAT PRODUCT!!!!....It has knocked my 1 hr straightening dilemma down to 20m and I don&#x27;t have to use a relaxing system on my hair anymore! :)</li>
    <li> I had one previously and I got to tell you this one absolutely sucks. The quality is so bad.</li>
    <li> Not sure what happened here. Been using Maxiglide for a few years and have been happy to have found a straightener that worked so well for me. But I went on vacation  and I accidentally left my original Maxiglide behind and was searching high and low for a replacement at a good price. I was happy to find this on amazon. But not everything new is the same. The steamer button didn&#x27;t work and it was not as effective as my original purchase. I searched online and discovered that the company either went out of business or discontinued the product. Unfortunately,  My husband had thrown away my packaging and I was not able to return it :O( pretty bummed about it as i&#x27;ve not found any replacement straightener that worked as great as my original Maxiglide did.</li>
    <li> I bought the original Maxi Glide about ten years ago - from one of those TV infomercials.&lt;br /&gt;It did exactly as it stated... the ceramic plates gave my shoulder length medium/coarse hair as super shine and made it incredibly straight.  I relax my hair and was able to stop doing that for three years because my Maxi-Glide did such a great job for me... saved tons of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only JUST dropped and broke mine, so I am searching for a new one. The newer models seem lighter and smaller -&lt;br /&gt;I can say of the original...it was about 2 inches wide and 4.5 inches long - great for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can never understand why people with long hair bother with those 1 inch models... I was able to do my whole head in less than 10 minutes...twice! Having to do so many more sections just seems like a time waster to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - and I am looking to buy another. Even the ones I have given as gifts have lasted a long time, and the recipients loved them!</li>
    <li> My husband broke my original maxi glide flat irons so I was not sure if i would get use to these. I loved them when I used them the first time.  But the second time I tried to use them the water reserve started leaking on me and burned me. I will give it another try and see if I can figure out what is wrong.  Other than that, the performance of the flat iron is great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this straightener.  I am a white person with curly hair that I HATE.  I have had the Maxiglide for about 10 years befeore it eventually died on me which pissed me off royally.  the difference between the one that died on me and this one, which concerned me, was my o,d one was about 4 inches whereas this was about 2 inches.  I thought that would be a problem but it wasn&#x27;t, in fact I like this smaller one better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one PLUS with this one as opposed to my older one is when I placed my older one down it wabled on the counter, whereas this one stayed in one place which is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so i was very pleased to see that after mine got broken, Amazon.com had it for sell. I love it! Adds shine &amp; body to my hair.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great for people that don&#x27;t have coarse hair. I try this flat iron and&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair. I have coarse curly hair but I have it straightened now&lt;br /&gt;Is relaxed. I personally believe that someone who doesn&#x27;t have coarse hair or curly&lt;br /&gt;will benefit from using it.&lt;br /&gt;  Another thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have different heat settings it doesn&#x27;t heat up to 300&lt;br /&gt;I think that it doesn&#x27;t heat up to even 200 degrees. It also makes a sound when pressed&lt;br /&gt;down. I returned this flat iron this week and got my money back. If you have coarse hair&lt;br /&gt; or curly hair I recommend buying the MAXIUS maxi glide hair straighter this iron is&lt;br /&gt;Maxiglide&#x27;s first model. Is way better than this flat iron it heats up to 350 I think and it has&lt;br /&gt;different degrees of heat. Good luck!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why some reviews claim that it doesn&#x27;t get hot.  It gets very hot for me and does what it&#x27;s supposed.  I love this item.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before buying and was reluctant to buy. I have used twice and (no..it is not like the original MaxiGlide) it is an ok 2nd best.  I think the reservoir for the water may be smaller (I have to fill it more often), and it has leaked now and then.  I also do not quite understand the \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; vibration option...fun to use when I got bored...&lt;br /&gt;The likes are it&#x27;s smaller and easier to manage, it has an on off switch with levels  of heating (the older model was just ON and HOT). The smaller size also allows you to use on shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say go for it...my hair is still as straight as ever and if I will definitely use it as often as I used my old faithful Maxiglide Sr.!</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product however, the heat level could be much higher.&lt;br /&gt;The comb on one side does make my hair lift instead of flatten as most flat irons do which I personally enjoy.  If it would have heated up higher, I would have given it a perfect 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Favorite Straightener! I have Thick Curly Spanish/African American Hair and this works perfectly on my hair and leaves it feeling soft. I also Add a couple drops of Argan Oil to my hair pre styling.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the original maxiglide. They work great and last a long time. This one I&#x27;m not that thrilled with. It&#x27;s not as good. Just doesn&#x27;t straighten as well and takes multiple times to get hair straight. Unlike the original that straightens in one glide.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Maxiglide since 2004!  This product is so great. It can leave your hair very straight or if you want some body or big curls (as I do), it can do that too without using a curling iron.  Another good thing about it is, it&#x27;s almost impossible to burn your head or hands since it has a protector of some kind and you can literally bring the iron to your roots or even pull on it with your hands from the base. Every time I straighten my hair, I always get positive compliments and when I do it with the body/curls, they can&#x27;t believe it was done from a straightener, they just can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t use a curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not your typical straightener, so it may be a bit bigger than most straighteners on the market today, but it really is worth the money. Again, I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 10 years and it still works like new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: No burns, straightens flat or gives nice body/big curls, steam button to lock in moisture (if you chose to use it, I do, it really makes a difference)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: cleaning.  Because of the design, it can be a little hard to clean if you don&#x27;t have the proper cleaning agent. I use a professional cleaner from the beauty supply store and it does the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. You will not regret it.</li>
    <li> The first maxiglide I purchased was great it didn&#x27;t have the problems this one has. This new one I just got is improperly aligned and and pulls and breaks your hair. I now want to return it. I have chosen to go back to flat irons. It is way overpriced and I am not surprised that it is no longer on the market. I am so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife didn&#x27;t like $100.00 down the drain, said it needed the things sticking up on the plate to help straighten her hair</li>
    <li> I owned the original maxiglide and found it to be a can&#x27;t live without product.  I had to replace it twice and now was ready for my third.  The Sonic Maxiglide DOES NOT STEAM WELL, no matter what you do.  It takes longer to use because of the time spent trying to get it to steam.  I will keep the product and deal with the issue because it still does straighten fairly well.  A little dissapointed and hoping the company goes back to their old school product and keeps it out there for those of those that love the original version</li>
    <li> I just finished reading about 15 reviews after I purchased, tried and completed my return request with my Maxiglide product seller.  I wish I read these reviews before my purchase.  I have used the Maximus products for over 8 years and love them.  This unit is no where near the quality of the former units.  I&#x27;ve had to purchase replacement units every 3 years or so, since the heat dries out the plastic over the years and the steamburst function eventually fails.&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT purchase this product if your looking for a replacement unit for a former Maxiums unit.  You will not be satisfied with the performance of this unit.  As others have stated, the steam function does not work properly.  The button must be pressed constantly just to get a small amount of fluid to pass through the unit, and the water does not form steam.  Some hair may get damp in the straightening process, and will be frizzy when dry.  Also, I&#x27;ve always used this product on heat setting number 5.  With no steam, I needed to move the heat setting to 7 or 8 to achieve the temperature I needed on this new version.  Warning:  It does not get as hot as the former units.</li>
    <li> This is my second (after the first one died after 6 years of use).  The only problem I have with this one is that it has a bit of a smell while on (ozone or chemical?).  Perhaps it will go away with more use.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd maxiglide. They keep failing after awhile. But I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> After years of trying different products, I finally found the perfect one with this item. I have crazy curly, frizzy hair (so much so that when I first had it professionally straightened, it was a whole foot longer straightened than it was curly) and this is the only tool that straightens my hair from the root out with little effort. It&#x27;s simply amazing. I can straighten, smooth and even curl it with this tool. I actually never use the steam function but it works just as well for me without it. Don&#x27;t hesitate to spend the money on this product!!</li>
    <li> This product is good but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the old Maxi Glide MX-597. On the old model I would only have to turn the heat up to 4 and it straightened my hair in one pass. I have to turn this thing up to a 10  and it still takes a few passes to get the same results. About a year ago, the Maxius website started selling the MX-597 model again but this time it was marketed as being the model for thick, difficult hair. I ordered one and put the Sonicglide away in a drawer. I wish I ordered more than one because they are no longer selling the MX-597 on their site. When my MX-597 ends up dying I will start using the Sonicglide again but in the meantime I&#x27;m gonna try to stock up on the MX-597&#x27;s before they become extinct.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to see this item on Amazon.  I have non-relaxed, natural, thick hair that comes to the small of my back.  So for me, any Maxius Styling tool is an absolute life saver. (I had to resort to the Miniglide, when my last Styling Tool just stopped working mid hair. Imagine having half luscious bone straight hair, and then having the other half a lengthy afro...Not a good look.  The Miniglide does not get my ends as straight as the tools with the steamburst technology.) I missed out on the limited supply of the Maxiglide Express, sold on the maxiusbeauty.com website earlier this year. Hopefully they will become available again. Honestly, this is my 4th Maxius Steam iron.  I have had several versions of thIs tool, over the years...in several different sizes.  My previous irons just stopped working or had wiring issues. This one gets the job done. This model looks similar to the last model, but to me, it is much larger. I would prefer the slightly smaller version. I doesn&#x27;t seem to give off as much steam as my previous irons, so I have to go over ends several times.  Also, I have used the vibration button, but just turned it off, because I can&#x27;t seem to find a real use for it. The automatic shut off button is great. Overall, I am very happy with the iron, hopefully all the kinks have been worked out from the previous version, and this one stands the test of time.  Compared to the previous versions, this item is quite pricey, but I am willing to pay the price, as it is a much needed item.  Per the instruction sheet, this item has a 1 year warranty. States,  Maxius will repair or replace, just cut off and save the holographic Izon logo on the box. So I was about to register my item on the Maxius website, for warranty purposes, and there is no holographic area...just a regular picture.  All my other styling tools had the 3D if you will...picture.  Box says, Simply tip the Izon label up, down , left and right to reveal the hidden dots on each side. If you can seethe dots on each side of the 4 sides, it is authentic.  Not sure why, but my box has no dots or holographic Izon logo...Guess I will have to contact Maxius customer service directly regarding my warranty.</li>
    <li> Have a spare;  wouldn&#x27;t live without one (very curly, thick, coarse hair I have straightened twice a year).</li>
    <li> I have owned several Maxiglides in the past.  It was the only straightener I used for about 10 years. The original product was heavy, but did the job beautifully.  This new version is cheap and definitely not worth the money. The teeth don&#x27;t fit properly, and sonic glide sounds good but is useless.</li>
    <li> This absolutely sucks . Does not warm up enough because I have thick hair. This was a waste of money.</li>
</ol>
