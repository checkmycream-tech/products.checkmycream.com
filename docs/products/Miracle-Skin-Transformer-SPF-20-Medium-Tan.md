<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this initially because I was going to Ghana and knew how humid and hot it would be there. This worked amazingly well! It had good coverage and it didn&#x27;t smudge all over my face, I only used a primer below it, didn&#x27;t set it or anything. I goes on very smoothly and if you have light scars it will cover it. However recently I&#x27;ve had a bad outbreak of acne and this being a lighter coverage doesn&#x27;t hide everything so I use it as a primer until my breakout is cleared. I HIGHLY recommend this for those who need a light-medium coverage, it&#x27;s perfect for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me mention that Sephora (at least the one here) gladly gave each of my friends and I generous free samples of this product that lasted 2 weeks. I was able to sample before I purchased, so I already knew I liked it. If you have access to a Sephora, you may want to try to get a sample before paying $50ish for this. If you love it like I do --- it&#x27;s well worth it, but I am the only person among several of my friends who likes this at all. I will tell you what I like about it, and what they didn&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 40, and have pretty good skin. I do have signs of aging under my eyes that need a heavier concealer, but the rest of my skin is nice. Mostly normal, oily in the t-zone. I have some larger pores in my t-zone, but no acne or scarring. I normally wear very light to sheer foundation and even then I usually mix it with moisturizer so that I hardly have any coverage. I just like makeup to fill in pores, and to freshen me up, but I don&#x27;t like to feel it on or look unnatural. I am medium skinned, with a light tan... just some color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product... You barely feel it on your face. It is very similar to Clinique&#x27;s Instant Pore Perfector. When you rub it in -your pores disappear, and it is matte finished so you don&#x27;t need to apply a separate powder which means your face doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;caked\\&quot; after a few hours of wear. You don&#x27;t need to use a separate moisturizer to get it to blend in or go on smoothly. There is no oily feeling to this, and it wears very well. I look fresh for hours before I have to touch up at all. I just blot a couple of shiny spots with a tissue after 8+ hours of wear. With other foundations, I&#x27;m shiny in a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What my friends didn&#x27;t like... It feels so light because it IS very light. Even if you build up a little more coverage, you will not get the same results as a full coverage foundation if you are used to wearing one. It does not hide acne scarring, bad skin, bags under eyes, or any other type of moderate to severe skin flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away 1 star because I have read that it&#x27;s supposed to be \\&quot;buildable\\&quot; for more coverage, but that is misleading since it still isn&#x27;t very concealing when built up with a few applications. In fact, it because too velvety/slippery if you try to build it up with multiple applications in one spot. Also, their color chart is misleading. You should definitely order one shade darker than you think you need because this goes on VERY light. I bought Medium Tan, which you would think would be for someone \\&quot;with\\&quot; a tan --- but I only have some color. I tan in a bed once or twice per month, and use gradual tanner once per week. If I actually get a suntan this summer I&#x27;ll need a darker shade. If I hadn&#x27;t sampled it first, I would have ordered Medium and it would have been WAY too light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing, if your skin is fair to good, and you like light coverage that feels and looks natural --- this is probably for you. If you have a lot of scarring, pitting, discolorations, or heavy wrinkles --- you might not like this as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wishes!</li>
    <li> For this product just get the right color!!!! First aid detox eye roller was recommended on the Dr Oz show because it helps WRINKLES not dark circles because it has an ingredient in it on his \\&quot;SHORT CUTS\\&quot; episode last week the ingredient numbs the muscles to help it.  Other things to use in also People Watch Magazine on the DR oz show were a total of the above, MST Miracle Skin Transformer for cover up and dark circles, skin spf protection, covers redness for a foundation and moisturizes, the ZENO HOTSPOT for pimples and blemishes, and Touchback Hair Color Marker can save you money on greys at the hair dresser and is a fast morning fix when needed.</li>
    <li> I give this product  only one star because it dried my face so badly it was like having very badly chapped skin. I only used it 3 times and it took 2 weeks of intense moisturizing to get my skin back to normal. I have normal skin that is not prone to being sensitive.</li>
    <li> It last long time,I am 68 years,used every day,will buy it again soon.Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Convenience is key for this all in one product.  Excellent pore minimized, moisturizer and foundation.  Eager to see more shades.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I really love this product. It really does all that it claims it does. The only complaint I have is that it isn&#x27;t available in Canada. Hope they can do something about that.</li>
    <li> great service... love how it makes my skin feel and look~!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave the house without this on my skin! Love it, the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found in cosmetic.</li>
    <li> Not happy about this stuff..said it was full coverage and there is no coverage.... Cannot even tell I put it on.  Very disappointed</li>
    <li> I am a youthful 49 y/o with fantastic skin.  Most people think I am 35.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product and was really excited to try it.  I was extremely disappointed.  I tried three shades, none of them matched my skin - light, medium and medium tan.  It is greasy feeling and your makeup will either absorb eventually into your skin or rub off on anything that touches your face.  10 Thumbs down.  One of the worst skincare lines I have ever tried.  I use higher end skincare including Topix, Prescribed Solutions, Neocutis, Revale and they are so much better.  Because I have flawless skin, I am not trying to cover up much, but if you are, good luck, this product will not work for you.  It doesn&#x27;t build like they claim it does.  Also, gives you a shiny almost greasy appearance all day.  My skin is normal to dry not oily at all.  I think you will get the same flawless appearance using SmashBox Photo Finish primer with your normal skin care routine.  I honestly think drug store or department store skincare is better than this.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr Oz.  Glad I tried it, it&#x27;s great and so smooth with or without foundation. I got a very good price on Amazon and will order again.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin. Helps with wrinkles, skin tone &amp; no longer need to wear foundation. I get compliments on my skin now!</li>
    <li> It makes my skin all one color, no more spots!&lt;br /&gt;It is smooth and young looking.  Stays on in HOT weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Expiration date is coming up soon. I think this matters but am not sure.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products to come along ever. It&#x27;s lightweight, sheer, applies and blends easily, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or makeup-y. As my skin has gotten older (late 40s) I&#x27;ve found heavy foundations make me look older. This product absolutely rocks. Expensive - but worth it to me. It&#x27;s our FACE, after all...</li>
    <li> great product feels wonderful on your skin</li>
    <li> Luckily an Amazon dealer sent me a sample of this with a perfume order or I would never have discovered it. I&#x27;ve never liked or used foundation - skin-clogging, wrinkle-magnifying, plaster looking stuff on my face. As a result my skin has not had good sun protection, and as rosacea increased with age, it&#x27;s! always just looked that bit blotchy.  But this, this is a miracle no exaggeration.  It makes my skin look, and just as importantly feel wonderful. It looks like I&#x27;ve been airbrushed for a magazine cover, only in real life!  I use it every day and will never again be without this silky invisible miracle!  2015 FOLLOW UP:  What happened?? Now all tubes also say FACE on them and the color is way darker, the product heavier, and it&#x27;s become a standard unlovely made-up look. Ugh!!! Why did someone do this to a previously great product. Count me out.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I love everything about it.  The product does a great job of covering like a foundation but with sunscreen in it.  I use LaRoche Posay&#x27;s Mela D with Philosphy&#x27;s Booster C mixed together and applied under the Miracle Skin Transformer.  At 73, I do not have one brown spot anywhere on my face(never been to the Derm to remove anything from my face).  All are great products.  You should try this regimen, it will make a huge difference for your facial skin.  I get all three products from Amazon.  The prices are great!!</li>
    <li> Yep. It&#x27;s not even as good as Loreal&#x27;s BB Cream. Loreal goes on white and dries to your skin tone. It&#x27;s less than half the price and virtually no different. Loreal glides on. This stuff is just like foundation going on and is too drying. I hate paying department store prices for makeup that is really nothing more than drug store quality.</li>
    <li> I love the Miracle Skin Transformer! I got a sample at Sephora to try and I fell in love. The shade works great on my skin - I&#x27;m glad I could try it before I bought it. I love that it has SPF in it so I use it everyday. It glides on smooth and absorbs into this silky skin feeling. I was worried that the SPF would make it feel greasy on my face but it soaks right into your skin and leaves it fabulously smooth and even toned. If you need more coverage just apply a little more. Plus, a little goes a long way - you only need a tiny pea sized amount and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> Happy with product. Good coverage and texture. Happy with its performance so far. May replace my usual product with this one</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on this product and thought I would give it a try. I have sun spots on my face and I can’t find anything to cover them (unless I cake on tons of concealer). After most of the reviews I read stated that this would cover everything including sun/age spots, I gave it a whirl. What a waste of money. The directions say to put on layer after layer to achieve desired results. I went through half the bottle (which is very small by the way). My skin feels gross after applying it and I feel like I have a mask on. After about 3 hours I had to re-apply. Today I gave it one more try and put concealer on before I put the Transformer on. Still made no difference. I had to re-apply after a few hours. I have had this item one week and its already gone. I do not recommend this to anyone who is trying to cover flaws on their face.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin, so bought this foundation due to the reviews that it improved the appearance of skin and provided good coverage.  The consistency was silicone like, so settled into my pores accentuating them.  After the first application, it didn&#x27;t even look like I had make up on, so I applied another layer, which didn&#x27;t make a bit of a difference.  Also, the product must have gotten to near my eye because it burned, and made my eye blurry.  It was so uncomfortable, I ended up taking the make up off... I&#x27;ll be returning it for something that does what I need.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, and this was my 3rd tube. However, the consistency of the product is different than what I had bought in the past. I compared to some I still had left over in another tube and this one was not as dense and does not provide as good as coverage as the others I have had.  Not sure if it was just this tube?  It indicates an expiration date of Dec 2014 so it should still be good. dissapointed and will think twice before ordering off line again from an unknown place.</li>
    <li> It seems off from the sample I got, maybe not as concentrated...maybe the sample was off...idk, but I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I cannot even begin to say how much I like it. Its light and airy but evens out my skin beautifully. Not only that but makes my skin feel so soft and it actually improved the look without make up. I ordered med and it matched perfectly. Wonderful product. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this but I will have to return the shade was to dark for my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t mind using them again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Previously bought 1shade lighter and thought I could use more color.  For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to perform as well. Either the color difference or the fact it was an older batch.&lt;br /&gt;To their credit the original has been fantastic, love it.</li>
    <li> Makes skin smooth and flawless.</li>
    <li> Hard to like a product that causes breakouts, particularly at this pricepoint. :(  The feel and look was good, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, gives great coverage without looking too made up. You can apply a bronzer and you&#x27;re ready to go. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of this type of product from other lines but this Miracle Skin in both the Medium and the Medium Tan is The BEST.  I first apply a nice moisturizer to my face and immediately apply this product using the tips of my fingers.  This allows for minimum coverage and it doesn&#x27;t feel goopy on my skin.  I then apply the Medium color under my eyes and it minimizes any discoloration there.  I don&#x27;t know how this would work on those with skin problem issues as I don&#x27;t know if the coverage would be enough, but I plan on always having a tube of this in my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> This is more than a tinted moisturizer or sunscreen! It applies evenly and smoothly and leaves my skin looking moisturized but not shiny.  I have used it prior to playing tennis and going to the beach, and the SPF works wonderfully. I have it in two different shades: one for summer and one for winter.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  Colors are very light.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at Sephora.  I was looking for a BB cream and the gal highly recommended this brand.  I&#x27;ve tried lots (and I mean lots) of BB creams and this one finally did it for me!  It&#x27;s not creamy feeling like most BB creams.  It goes on velvety and blends in well over the morning face regimen with sunscreen and lotions.  I have a fair complexion so when the Sephora clerk suggested Medium Tan for the color, I was really hesitant.  The color blends in lighter than what you&#x27;d believe the color to be. (I&#x27;ve read other reviews that stated similar affects.)  So, the clerk was correct in picking out that color for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product on line because neither Sephora or Ulta carries it at their stores.  Sephora used to but now only sells it on-line.  Ulta has \\&quot;specific\\&quot; stores that carry it but no one in the stores seem to know what store carries it.  I purchased this cheaper than either store could offer AND I got free shipping.  So, I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
    <li> I had originally purchased Miracle Skin Transformer at Costco, and they only carried it in Medium, which was too light for my skin tone, but I still liked the concept.  I suspected that the Tan that I saw on other websites that offered limited colors would be too dark for me,  and probably better suited to Hispanic skin tones.  I am Italian-American, and the Medium Tan is the exact right shade for my Mediterranean skin. It literally disappears and you cannot even tell that I have it on!  Leaves my skin looking youthful, smooth and even-toned.  Plus I never worry about applying sunscreen because it&#x27;s right there in the product.  Most websites offer this product in limited colors, but if your skin is like mine, not light and not dark, Medium Tan is the color for you.  Plus I got free shipping and my item arrived in a timely fashion.  Doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
    <li> Bought this March 2014 &amp; have been using it daily since.  It has made an amazing difference in my facial skin.  Lines are less noticeable - skin is smooth &amp; soft - I swear I look younger.  I really wish I had taken a before picture!&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was using the Revlon powder makeup and I see now how dry it was making my face.  I am 61 and you just can&#x27;t risk drying products on such sensitive skin at our age.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use anything else from here on out.</li>
    <li> The WSJ reviewed this a few years ago, and since the first day I tried it way back then, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  Just the right amount of coverage, with 20 SPF, in colors that work for me summer and winter.  Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> Second order.  I love the way it goes on, light and smooth, even on a hot, humid summer day.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz a few years ago and thought why not try it.  I was skeptical but the thought of eliminating the moisturizing, priming and SPF application steps would be a time saver and that was appealing.  I was not disappointed!  This is a very nice foundation because you can control the coverage and it&#x27;s super moisturizing without being greasy.It goes on smoothly and feels very silky to the touch. It also blends into your skin very well while providing good, everyday coverage. I do use Lancome Absolute for special occasions or when I have some extra time to spend on my make up routine.  My daughter and I both use this product and find it to be our favorite foundation. I usually buy both the medium and medium tan which allows me to customize the color depending on the season.  It&#x27;s not cheap ( we&#x27;re not talking drugstore pricing!) but a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT CAME IN A TIMELY FASHION AND UNDAMAGED.  I REALLY LIKE THE PRODUCT AND IT WORKS WELL WITH MY SKIN TYPE...</li>
    <li> Dislike want alittle more coverage for blemishes&lt;br /&gt;Like: feels lite on my face, nice color, love the matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never want to use regular foundation it feels so unclean and heavy on my face.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product I knew that it tended to be lighter than expected, so I ordered a darker color. It also was lighter than expected, though I do have tanned skin. Please do not be afraid to order two shades darker than you expect! It has a nice powdery texture and goes on smoothly. It does not seem to cover &amp;#34;flawlessly&amp;#34; as I had hoped. Perhaps because the shade is a bit light it does not cover as well. Does give an even tone to the whole face.</li>
    <li> Medium Tan is not much different from Medium.  Product goes on nice and is light on skin and cover well.</li>
    <li> Product was surprising poor - It&#x27;s drying, not hydrating, and the sunscreen odor is a bit hard to take. A waste of my money.</li>
    <li> CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s outrageously sheer&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s not buildable (unless you wait for each layer to dry and then re-apply, but who has time for that?)&lt;br /&gt;3. I don&#x27;t see any &amp;#34;transforming&amp;#34; benefits for my skin&lt;br /&gt;4. it&#x27;s really only SPF 20 (for the little coverage it gives, I&#x27;d like a higher SPF)&lt;br /&gt;5. it&#x27;s way too pricey for what it really does&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s good as a primer (but still not enough SPF)</li>
    <li> Purchased Medium Dark and the color was just odd. It looked greasy after a couple hours. At the 48 dollar price, very disappointing, indeed. Compared to Philosophy Supernatural skin primer, Miracle Skin failed.</li>
    <li> Works great, needed to buy a darker shade. All in one product.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but I think it&#x27;s too expensive.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing and covers well.  But it&#x27;s not worth the price - I can get the same effect with other products for less.</li>
    <li> best product out there for a concealer and color and sets the face for the day.</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product does not do what it stays it does</li>
    <li> This is the BEST foundation I have ever worn. When ordering; order a darker color than you would normally wear and the color will be perfect for you. It is very creamy and light feeling on your face. Wears all day BEAUTIFULLY!  Easy on and easy off with your favorite cleansing lotion.  No clogged pores. GREAT!</li>
    <li> The cream is great. Perfect consistency. It glides over your skin, masking imperfections and leaves a velvety feel.  This is one of the best BB cream out there. My blotchiness is gone and pores just seem to disappear. I love the way it makes my skin feel so smooth. It does all this without feeling heavy or made up. It&#x27;s so light sometimes I forget I have it on!</li>
    <li> The perfect suncreen, moisturizer and light makeup base.  The texture is smooth and the coverage is just enough for those hot summer days when you just don&#x27;t want to wear heavy makeup.  I bought a shade darker that usual (medium tan) and it was not too dark. Happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Bought it last year in light and medium at Costco. They didn&#x27;t carry a darker color.  (Now they don&#x27;t carry it at all any longer in my Costco)  Neither color was good for summer.  Found the medium tan on line and I&#x27;m so happy with it. It goes on so smoothly and stays all day.  It&#x27;s the first thing I put on my face in the am after washing.</li>
    <li> This cream has a nice texture but it does not cover much. I received the med-tan since I have olive skin tone. I really don&#x27;t need anything with heavy coverage but this was a little to dry on my face (which even at my age leans toward the oily side in t zone wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> Update: Okay, after using this creme for a week. I have noticed some slight improvement to my skin. Whilst it does not reduce the more deep lines,it does seem to soften them. The medium tan color is too light for me so I will buy the dark tan next time.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin creams/moisturizer/sunprotection/color, all in one.  It makes my face look flawless.  I have tried others and this one just seems to be the best.  I am never without it. People ask me what I do to make my skin look so good.  I do take very good care of my skin, but this really enhances it. I love that it has sun screen because the sun is the number one cause of wrinkles in the face and neck.  Make sure you cover face and also neck and even beyond for an even, matte, flawless look.  It also comes in different shades for all skin tones.  In the summer I use Tan and it gives a healthy glow.  This is all you will need.  No foundation needed unless in the evening you want a little extra coverage.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It feels like I am wearing no make up at all. It goes on smooth and the color matches perfect.</li>
    <li> .................................I hate it&lt;br /&gt; made my skin look like white powdery patches when I took a picture ( I was so embarrased).. Looks good personal, though.. just not pictures</li>
    <li> I tried to give this a chance but I really don&#x27;t like the texture- it is very matte like and doesn&#x27;t go on smooth at all. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff is my favorite. I wish Sephora still carried it, but at least Amazon does. It&#x27;s great for your skin and just makes you look naturally beautiful. Sheer coverage, but not so sheer that it isn&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> arrived very quickly and as promised. I would order again</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great for traveling. Oginally bought it for a sailing trip. Had limited space. This  product is a moisturizer, sunscreen and light foundation all in one. Love how it feels! Have shared with friends and they love it!</li>
