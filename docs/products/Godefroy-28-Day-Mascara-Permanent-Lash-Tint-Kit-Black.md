### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Loved it.</li>
      <li>I like my lashes as they are length wise</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>This lash tint does a good job of coloring and it lasts about three weeks for me.</li>
      <li>I found this product to be good.</li>
      <li>Good value.</li>
      <li>and I liked it a lot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with practice.</li>
      <li>I would love to find a better one some day, if anyone has recommendations.</li>
      <li>I like it better that having to wear mascara.</li>
      <li>I switched to a disposable mascara applicator and that seemed to work much better.</li>
      <li>It carrys the tint and separates the lashes and gives better coverage.</li>
      <li>As a woman with lighter lashes, I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used with their applicator and much more like using throw away mascara wands to apply.</li>
      <li>I just lathered up with petroleum jelly around my eyes and that worked much better.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>so thats ok.</li>
      <li>dye will not penetrate if there is any oily residue (mascara, remover...) on your lashes, so wash lashes with a good baby shampoo first.</li>
      <li>This is a good product that does not sting or burn  is much cheaper than Roux lash tint.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t smell or irritate my eyes and was relatively easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Easy application, no irritation.</li>
      <li>I used it and it didn&#x27;t even leave a light dye on my eyelashes</li>
      <li>The color ends up light in some spots and darker in others.</li>
      <li>Not any different from the Sally&#x27;s version I have tried, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
      <li>I have light lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t have the effect I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of applying, it is super easy and I am done in 5 minutes start to finish.</li>
      <li>Also, works better if you curl your lashes first.</li>
      <li>Bought with eyebrow tint and did both on the same day with ease and great success.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super fabulous.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it would be very effective for coloring eyelashes that aren&#x27;t very light.</li>
      <li>The application wand doesn&#x27;t apply much product and the package of disposable wands I bought elsewhere cannot fit into the solution container.  </li>
      <li>Works well given the right tools.</li>
      <li>I have very light blonde lashes.</li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really seem to work</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
      <li>They have both lasted a whole month.</li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>Apply to freshly cleaned lashes (soap and water clean to remove all oils), follow directions and you will have dark lashes for about a month depending on your eye care routine (the harsher your soap, the faster the product will fade).</li>
      <li>I even bought the black, to make it stand out more.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, decent color (although lighter than I expected), but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Once you get the hang of this the whole process including set up and clean up should take no more than 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>I may try to premix then apply as one solution (although it clearly states not to mix beforehand)</li>
      <li>I apply twice a month to keep lashes dark and avoid &amp;#34;roots.&amp;#34; I have light blonde lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
      <li>Since the last time I bought it, they have changed a few of the applicators, but seem to be easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have only put it on once so far.</li>
      <li>, my blond eyelashes are barely any darker.</li>
      <li>The instructions says to first put on the black color then apply the activator.</li>

<li> Does NOT thicken lashes in any way, this in a dye and only adds long lasting color.</li>
<li> I left the formula on for a long time too...</li>
<li> ; it flat out didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
<li> Definitely, a little irritating to the eyes but the process is quick so you are able to remove the irritating chemicals within a couple minutes.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
<li> What a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Plus it didn&#x27;t seem to dry.</li>
<li> Very similar to a product used to use, Dark Eyes.</li>
<li> This 28 day mascara gives me dark enough eyelashes</li>
<li> However, the tiny, tiny, microscopic brush that comes with the  tint is way too hard to use.</li>
<li> First off, my eyelids became numb about 5 minutes following application.</li>
<li> Make sure to wash with SOAP &amp; WATER when finished so that no residue is left to stain your skin, the package only states to wash with water, you will be very disappointed if you don&#x27;t use the soap.</li>

<li> Not worth the effort.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works well given the right tools. You need to use a mascara or other type of brush to apply. Also, works better if you curl your lashes first. Definitely, a little irritating to the eyes but the process is quick so you are able to remove the irritating chemicals within a couple minutes.</li>
    <li> Very similar to a product used to use, Dark Eyes. Have been looking for this for years and have finally found it!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I have very blonde lashes and wanted something that I can use instead of mascara during the summer.  My daughter did it too and it took her two applications before noticing a difference.  The difference was very very subtle and it didn&#x27;t cover all lashes.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, decent color (although lighter than I expected), but it doesn&#x27;t last. I would say that I can see a difference in lash color for about a week. I left the formula on for a long time too...</li>
    <li> This lash tint does a good job of coloring and it lasts about three weeks for me. However, the tiny, tiny, microscopic brush that comes with the  tint is way too hard to use. I switched to a disposable mascara applicator and that seemed to work much better. It carrys the tint and separates the lashes and gives better coverage. This is a good product that does not sting or burn  is much cheaper than Roux lash tint. Also, the tube has a lot of applications in it. Good value. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The only eyelash dye I like. I like to use a cleaned mascara wand to apply each coat. Just like mascara. It&#x27;s super fabulous. I love this stuff. Lasts me about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> Works well. I usually have to pay for permanent liner, now I just use the kit. It tints lashes &amp; around the eye.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again. It burns really bad if you get it in your eye, which was expected so thats ok. But the pads they give you to protect under your eyes from staining is a joke. I just lathered up with petroleum jelly around my eyes and that worked much better. The instructions says to first put on the black color then apply the activator. It doesn&#x27;t really seem to work and I&#x27;ve tried multiple times. The color ends up light in some spots and darker in others. I may try to premix then apply as one solution (although it clearly states not to mix beforehand)</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this product. First off, my eyelids became numb about 5 minutes following application. Plus it didn&#x27;t seem to dry. Will not use again.</li>
    <li> I found this to be very messy, and difficult to apply. I have light lashes, and it doesn&#x27;t have the effect I was looking for. I even bought the black, to make it stand out more. It doesn&#x27;t last very long either.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT WORK! I used it and it didn&#x27;t even leave a light dye on my eyelashes; it flat out didn&#x27;t work at all. What a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Does NOT thicken lashes in any way, this in a dye and only adds long lasting color. I&#x27;ve used with their applicator and much more like using throw away mascara wands to apply. Once you get the hang of this the whole process including set up and clean up should take no more than 10 minutes. Make sure to wash with SOAP &amp; WATER when finished so that no residue is left to stain your skin, the package only states to wash with water, you will be very disappointed if you don&#x27;t use the soap. Stains do disappear after about 2 days.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last that long. I had a dye mark under my eye longer than the mascara lasted.</li>
    <li> works as expected for a mascara tint, not a huge impact, but some.  Not any different from the Sally&#x27;s version I have tried, so I&#x27;m happy with it.  I would love to find a better one some day, if anyone has recommendations.</li>
    <li> Bought with eyebrow tint and did both on the same day with ease and great success. They have both lasted a whole month.</li>
    <li> Not worth the effort.  The application wand doesn&#x27;t apply much product and the package of disposable wands I bought elsewhere cannot fit into the solution container.  End result, my blond eyelashes are barely any darker.</li>
    <li> Once you get the hang of applying, it is super easy and I am done in 5 minutes start to finish. Apply to freshly cleaned lashes (soap and water clean to remove all oils), follow directions and you will have dark lashes for about a month depending on your eye care routine (the harsher your soap, the faster the product will fade). I apply twice a month to keep lashes dark and avoid &amp;#34;roots.&amp;#34; I have light blonde lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is not mascara and won&#x27;t thicken your lashes, it just dyes them.&lt;br /&gt;The dye will not penetrate if there is any oily residue (mascara, remover...) on your lashes, so wash lashes with a good baby shampoo first.</li>
    <li> As a woman with lighter lashes, I love it. Easy application, no irritation.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be good. It didn&#x27;t smell or irritate my eyes and was relatively easy to apply. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get better with practice. I have only put it on once so far. I like it better that having to wear mascara.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Sometimes the result is darker than others.  Works well to darken my very blonde eyelashes.  I&#x27;m not sure it would be very effective for coloring eyelashes that aren&#x27;t very light.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t stick to my lashes at all, I threw it out</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I had to put that I had to apply once a day, because there wasn&#x27;t a once a month choice! Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this before and I liked it a lot. Since the last time I bought it, they have changed a few of the applicators, but seem to be easy to use. If you follow the directions, you won&#x27;t make a mess or stain your skin or other items in the way. I like my lashes as they are length wise, I do wish they were thicker and darker. This 28 day mascara gives me dark enough eyelashes so I don&#x27;t have to wear a lot of make up in the summer.</li>
    <li> I have very light blonde lashes. This definitely made a difference for them. I applied it with qtips and hardly got any in my eyes. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for several years</li>
    <li> I really like this product! It never burns and it is darker than when I go to the salon and get my lashes dyed. It lasts about the same as a salon (around 2 weeks). I will buy this again</li>
