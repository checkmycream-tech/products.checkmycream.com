      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>(i make my own lotions, face washes, etc..)</li>
      <li>when I recieved my order it came with a wonderfully printed, glossy 5x7 set of instructions, the glossy print was great as I could have them in the bathroom as I was applying &amp; reference back to them during the application.</li>
      <li>This is an incredible product, worth the price 10x over.</li>
      <li>Im always 28, fair skinned and just some fine lines.</li>
      <li>and the more you do the better you look. :-)</li>
      <li>The glycolic acid worked better from me than the salicylic and Lactic.</li>
      <li>Love Love Love this</li>
      <li>I have tried many of the peels on Amazon and this is the 1 for me.</li>
      <li>Love this product -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try to apply it again and put more on those areas.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fails claims of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t have purchased it , if I knew better.</li>
      <li>I am looking forward to more skin improvement.</li>
      <li>Now the salicylic acid peel took about 2/3 to peel which is better than this.</li>
      <li>The peel is ok.</li>
      <li>It is so worth trying !!</li>
      <li>This product it&#x27;s okay, but to strong for me.</li>
      <li>The free fan brush is ok but is not that good because it is nylon but can&#x27;t really complain because it was free.</li>
      <li>the acid is quite strong.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing with acid in free form like this, don&#x27;t buy them.  </li>
      <li>Overall its a great product</li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t go out in the sun right after either.</li>
      <li>Super strong stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never done a chemical peel before, so this product was reasonably priced and has a good concentration for first timers.</li>
      <li>Just used for the first time and already a scar I have had since childhood looks better.</li>
      <li>Take caution if you aren&#x27;t familiar with these products.</li>
      <li>This product is great, but I am new to peels so my expectations were a bit high.</li>
      <li>It takes time and you need to start off with a more intense peel</li>
      <li>but it works, it made my pock marks / pores smaller, lighten my complexion and made it look good</li>
      <li>This peel stings butt its mild.</li>
      <li>it was super.</li>
      <li>I was able to use my regular products of Vit A, alpha hydroxy, products both morning and light (wear sunblock)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>, really saw a difference after the first use, it doesn&#x27;t really burn but has more of an irritative feel, did not frost</li>
      <li>Its better to start off your regimen with a major peel like TCA 15%</li>
      <li>I used this glycolic peel as my first peel ever.</li>
      <li>I got my first peel about 2 months ago and like all things i try to learn to do it correctly at home</li>
      <li>I was pretty scared to do it...</li>
      <li>probably because I wasn&#x27;t as scared as the first time and realized I wasn&#x27;t going to melt my face off, so I feel like I wasn&#x27;t as scared to put it on my face.</li>
      <li>The second time I had even better results...</li>
      <li>Acne is gone and scars r faded &amp; the overall appearance is a million times better than before.</li>
      <li>2 parts Water, 1 part Baking Soda) and thats what made it really burn!</li>
      <li>I am excited to see my results after a few more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>first time, really just put it on for a minute thats it and have your baking soda mixture to neutralize it pre made.</li>
      <li>This has really made a difference.</li>
      <li>My light freckles/sun damage has been dramatically lightened, my pores are noticeably smaller and all around my skin is tighter and glowy.</li>
      <li>This is the real deal here.</li>
      <li>Has really helped, in just one use, lighten my sunspots.</li>
      <li>I really like this product</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my cheeks and my forehead.</li>
      <li>Its easier to use a lower % peel like this weekly, rather than a higher % and suffer more pain with less opportunitities to touch up.</li>
      <li>I lubed the face up for a few days with a serum, coconut oil, and high high spf sunblock if out in the sun. :-)</li>
      <li>Kind of scary to use the first time, but if you follow the enclosed instructions and build up from 1 minute to 10 over several weeks, you should be fine.</li>
      <li>Maybe it would be fine for other type of skin but not for mine.</li>
      <li>skin actually peeled with the first application.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve only just started using it, three times so far but noticed a difference after first use.</li>
      <li>Start in a very light coating and build up slowly on your minutes.  </li>
      <li>The combination of brush and bottle doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL - huge waste.</li>
      <li>and wow do they make a difference.</li>
      <li>once your tca peel has completely heeled.</li>
      <li>There r clear and concise directions and an application brush that comes with the peel.</li>
      <li>It worked perfectly on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have discoloration, acne and old scars and it has dramatically improved the condition of my skin.</li>
      <li>But if you have sensitive skin like me, you wouldn&#x27;t keep it on longer than 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>and I am very pleasantly surprised by my results already.</li>
      <li>WOW.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m only left with positive results.</li>
      <li>I alternate between the brush provided and a cottonball that is recommended on directions, followup with SPF moisturizer and apply mineral makeup and go about my normal life.</li>
      <li>you will always look fresh with less peeled up skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you are expecting major differences in your skin, your not going to get it with this product.</li>
      <li>I have used this product weekly for about 3 months and not only does my skin feel softer and smoother, it has helped clear my breakouts,  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually used it twice so far.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and I have low tolerance for the pain</li>
      <li>, it does burn pretty bad, I have only been able to leave it on for 4 minutes max, and there is a tiny bit of recovery time, patches of dry skin, even minimal &amp; temporary red marks (my skin looked waxy for a couple of days first)</li>

<li> Removing dead skin, making scars lighter in appearance, evening skin tone, making pores smaller, and causing an overall glow to your skin - these are just a few of the benefits.</li>
<li> I mean it took FOREVER to actually peel.</li>
<li> It works extremely well!</li>
<li> My boyfriend and I have been doing these acid peels for a few months now</li>
<li> This product was So pointless , I suggest not to buy it.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is finally clearing up after all these years I wish I tried it sooner.Great product just make sure to follow directions closely.</li>
    <li> Super strong stuff. Take caution if you aren&#x27;t familiar with these products. I was spending hundreds of dollars on peels from a medical spa and this works just as well. The glycolic acid worked better from me than the salicylic and Lactic. would buy again.</li>
    <li> This peel stings butt its mild. Definetely a good starter peel. I will move up the percentage as my skin gets used to this</li>
    <li> I have only used this peel twice and I am very pleasantly surprised by my results already. I have discoloration, acne and old scars and it has dramatically improved the condition of my skin. Acne is gone and scars r faded &amp; the overall appearance is a million times better than before. I have used every cream, mask, wash, microderm abrasion kit, all  without any results. This is a steal at $11. I am excited to see my results after a few more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it does burn pretty bad, I have only been able to leave it on for 4 minutes max, and there is a tiny bit of recovery time, patches of dry skin, even minimal &amp; temporary red marks (my skin looked waxy for a couple of days first) but after a few normal washes of the face and I&#x27;m only left with positive results. There r clear and concise directions and an application brush that comes with the peel. I alternate between the brush provided and a cottonball that is recommended on directions, followup with SPF moisturizer and apply mineral makeup and go about my normal life. I am looking forward to more skin improvement. Very very happy I bought this peel.</li>
    <li> I have used this twice now and am receiving good results. The free fan brush is ok but is not that good because it is nylon but can&#x27;t really complain because it was free.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing with acid in free form like this, don&#x27;t buy them.  I am used to doing 20% Glycolic Acid peels at home, so I thought I would try 30%.  WOW.  This stuff is very potent!  I had the baking soda/water concoction on my face within 90 seconds.  Whew!  It works well, however, don&#x27;t over-do it.  Make sure you don&#x27;t go out in the sun right after either.</li>
    <li> This is the best 30% Glycolic peel I have tried and for the price It is so worth trying !!&lt;br /&gt;My skin actually peeled with the first application.I have tried many of the peels on Amazon and this is the 1 for me.</li>
    <li> This product is great, but I am new to peels so my expectations were a bit high. Its better to start off your regimen with a major peel like TCA 15% then you do upkeep peels with this prouduct once your tca peel has completely heeled. It stings a bit and it takes some getting use to. My skin is sensitive and I have low tolerance for the pain so I can only keep it on for 4 mins tops.&lt;br /&gt;1. I did&#x27;nt experience any type of peeling&lt;br /&gt;2. I was able to use my regular products of Vit A, alpha hydroxy, products both morning and light (wear sunblock)&lt;br /&gt;3. Its easier to use a lower % peel like this weekly, rather than a higher % and suffer more pain with less opportunitities to touch up. you will always look fresh with less peeled up skin.&lt;br /&gt;4. If you are expecting major differences in your skin, your not going to get it with this product. My skin was softer and I glowed a bit to. It takes time and you need to start off with a more intense peel first.&lt;br /&gt;5. Overall its a great product</li>
    <li> Just used for the first time and already a scar I have had since childhood looks better. Pores are smaller.</li>
    <li> The peel is ok. I mean it took FOREVER to actually peel. Gave my face an ugly scab meanwhile I still had to go to work and out in public. Now the salicylic acid peel took about 2/3 to peel which is better than this.</li>
    <li> This is a great stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;My friends ask me what i do with my skin and I recommend this product to them and they love it too!! Love, love love!!!</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product, worth the price 10x over. It worked perfectly on my sensitive skin. This is the real deal here. I noticed some reviews complained about the lack of instructions, when I recieved my order it came with a wonderfully printed, glossy 5x7 set of instructions, the glossy print was great as I could have them in the bathroom as I was applying &amp; reference back to them during the application. I would &amp; will buy this again &amp; again!</li>
    <li> I have used this product weekly for about 3 months and not only does my skin feel softer and smoother, it has helped clear my breakouts,  I am 46 and have oily skin and have had breakouts my entire life.  This has really made a difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product - I&#x27;ve used it once a week for the past 3 weeks, and it leaves my skin soft and just slightly pink for a couple hours - not raw pink, just like I&#x27;ve been working out. Kind of scary to use the first time, but if you follow the enclosed instructions and build up from 1 minute to 10 over several weeks, you should be fine. The combination of brush and bottle doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL - huge waste. Just apply it to a cotton pad instead.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. I&#x27;ve been using weekly for 6 weeks and the results do not disappoint. Technicall, I&#x27;ve only peeled once with this, but just because you may not peel doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working. My light freckles/sun damage has been dramatically lightened, my pores are noticeably smaller and all around my skin is tighter and glowy. You *need* to use this for several weeks in order to get the results, so stick with it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I loved how inexpensive this was. No spa or salon needed. Just follow directions.  I lubed the face up for a few days with a serum, coconut oil, and high high spf sunblock if out in the sun. :-) it was super.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never done a chemical peel before, so this product was reasonably priced and has a good concentration for first timers. I waited till after all my breakouts had gone away and then I applied with a cotton pad. It comes with a brush, however, the brush clumps together upon getting moist. I kept it on for 2 and a half minutes (you&#x27;re not supposed to keep it on for longer if you are new to chemical peels) and then I put on the neutralizing solution (Homemade: 2 parts Water, 1 part Baking Soda) and thats what made it really burn! After washing it all off, I moisturized with a tea tree oil + sun screen concoction. I really like this product, It worked well on my nose and my chin however- It didn&#x27;t really do anything for my cheeks and my forehead. I&#x27;m going to try to apply it again and put more on those areas.</li>
    <li> I used this glycolic peel as my first peel ever. It worked great. I was pretty scared to do it...It&#x27;s not a miracle worker or anything but it exfoliated my skin really nicely and gave me a great glow. I&#x27;ve actually used it twice so far. The second time I had even better results...probably because I wasn&#x27;t as scared as the first time and realized I wasn&#x27;t going to melt my face off, so I feel like I wasn&#x27;t as scared to put it on my face. I did them 2 weeks apart, which I feel is perfect. So yea, it works great...just don&#x27;t expect to look like you got injected with Botox after you use it and look absolutely flawless and wrinkle free...but it will give you a very nice glow and and the more you do the better you look. :-)</li>
    <li> This product was So pointless , I suggest not to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;Fails claims of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t have purchased it , if I knew better.</li>
    <li> Wow. Boy does this work. I got my first peel about 2 months ago and like all things i try to learn to do it correctly at home (i make my own lotions, face washes, etc..) This is strong!!! first time, really just put it on for a minute thats it and have your baking soda mixture to neutralize it pre made. Has really helped, in just one use, lighten my sunspots. Im always 28, fair skinned and just some fine lines. I always wear sunscreen which you MUST do after wearing this!</li>
    <li> moles, acne, sun damage..tightens skin, pulls gunk out of pores, lightens, can remove big raised moles in a gradual manner when left on over night. can burn like  mo fo. be CONSERVATIVE ON ENTIRE FACE.FOLLOW DIRECTIONS AND BUY SOME BAKING SODA..HAVE ON HAND</li>
    <li> Please only use this if you know what you are doing though...the acid is quite strong.  Start in a very light coating and build up slowly on your minutes.  I would suggest using no more than once a week.  It works extremely well!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love this, really saw a difference after the first use, it doesn&#x27;t really burn but has more of an irritative feel, did not frost but it works, it made my pock marks / pores smaller, lighten my complexion and made it look good and I&#x27;ve only just started using it, three times so far but noticed a difference after first use.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I have been doing these acid peels for a few months now and wow do they make a difference. Removing dead skin, making scars lighter in appearance, evening skin tone, making pores smaller, and causing an overall glow to your skin - these are just a few of the benefits. I raved about this on my facebook page and now I have friends using it. I use this now about once a month. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product it&#x27;s okay, but to strong for me. Maybe it would be fine for other type of skin but not for mine.</li>
    <li> It works in tightening up and renewing the skin.  Ive had age spots and sun spots suface the face and exfoliate.  But if you have sensitive skin like me, you wouldn&#x27;t keep it on longer than 5 minutes.</li>
