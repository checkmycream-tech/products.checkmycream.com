### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This tinted version blends into our tan skin and works perfect for us.</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>This is still the best acne cover up and remedy that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>I too have experienced this.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>but I order from here all the time when needed and a great price.</li>
      <li>AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT.</li>
      <li>Glad to find it again!!</li>
      <li>:o)</li>
      <li>Benzyl Peroxide 10% does a good job diminishing the acne while killing bacteria and the inactive ingredients appear to absorb the oil.</li>
      <li>It feels good when it goes on</li>
      <li>Not as good as the Oxy cover up product, but since that has been discontinued what choice do you have.</li>
      <li>It is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I have tried this product before,  nice skin color, it cover the area while is working, usualy use it at night when go to bed.</li>
      <li>IT DOES THE JOB EFFECTIVELY.</li>
      <li>This goes on over my moisturizer and right under my makeup for great coverage.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Basically in summary, the Clearasil tinted acne creams are great, but make sure you get the right one.  </li>
      <li>I have to apply a very light layer</li>
      <li>Excellent for break outs in skin, camouflages like conceal, only better.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This has been my favorite acne product for years.  </li>
      <li>and then everyone focuses on your zit even more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it here.  </li>
      <li>but I was sure mistaken.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clearasil tinted acne cream for about 4 years now and it works infinitely better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - prescription medications, over the counter face washes, cleansing pads, etc.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure Proactive is a fine product</li>
      <li>This is a tried and true product that I love.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the transaction, reasonably quick delivery, and the product.</li>
      <li>It truly has helped me clear my face and become more confident!</li>
      <li>The tube does have a disclaimer which states \\&quot;May bleach clothing\\&quot;,however, it should say it will literally bleach ANY material to light burnt orange.</li>
      <li>&quot; version&#x27;s tint is too light a shade; doesn&#x27;t blend well to skin tone.</li>
      <li>Yes,it works great and amazon is the only place i can find it anymore,thank you</li>
      <li>told them to buy some good old Clearasil like I used 40 years ago.</li>
      <li>Be aware, take appropriate precautions and enjoy this product.</li>
      <li>Love love love this product been using this since I was a teen</li>
      <li>I have tried most of the other Clearasil creams to control acne and this one is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
      <li>Only reason why I gave it any stars is because the benzyl peroxide did a good job drying out the zits.</li>
      <li>No bad odor,</li>
      <li>It gives me a nice smooth complexion and fights acne at the same time.  </li>
      <li>love showing the young ones that something from my youth is still relevant.</li>
      <li>I would not suggest putting it on if your a male in the morning because the tint kind of looks like makeup.</li>
      <li>About a year ago my 15 year old granddaughter and grandson were breaking out like most teenagers.</li>
      <li>This product gets the job done, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to accidentally use too much.</li>
      <li>The other product is much more gentle, clears up my pimples better, as well as hides blemishes</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just an odd color and doesn&#x27;t blend into a good skin color.</li>
      <li>Very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Now that I&#x27;m better informed, I simply avoid getting it on my clothes.</li>
      <li>Well I get a text awhile back begging for some more.</li>
      <li>Glad I found this product works just as well as my old discontinued \\&quot;Cover Girl fresh look clear up\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>You may find yourself recovering certain areas</li>
      <li>I buy this to use as a &amp;#34;cover-up&amp;#34; but I use it on my whole face (not just on acne).  </li>
      <li>but it hasn&#x27;t really reduced the breakouts.  </li>
      <li>and it really dries out the acne and clears up your face.</li>
      <li>While somewhat hesitant to purchase this newer version of the original product, the reddish tint for my skin type is actually a plus.</li>
      <li>Very glad it is still available...at least by mail-order.</li>
      <li>It really clears up blemishes for me in a day or so and helps prevent new ones.  </li>
      <li>So, if you want to treat your red pimple on ur shoulder... do not wear white t-shirt after this :)</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried either, I&#x27;d try to the Resoricnol 2%, Sulfur 8% formulation initially and if you&#x27;ve tried this 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and been dissatisfied, go for the other formulation before giving up, as the other one really is a great product.</li>
      <li>Asking the moms what they were using one was on Proactive and the other on some cheap OTC off brand.</li>
      <li>I had to order it from Amazon because it is hard to find in stores and will continue to do so because I love it that much.</li>
      <li>it says very clearly that its tinted.</li>
      <li>I no longer use it when I&#x27;ll be outside in hot humid climates.</li>
      <li>for some razor burn and minor pimples or red areas, this product is just fine.</li>
      <li>This is the only tint available and I have darker olive skin, but it&#x27;s too dark and a reddish dark so wouldn&#x27;t match most skin tones.</li>
      <li>Hard to find locally, so glad it is stocked by Amazon.</li>
      <li>The tint helps to hide the redness that acne can cause and the consistency stays put unlike the clear gels.  </li>
      <li>and I am now in my late 30&#x27;s and still love it.  </li>
      <li>Clearasil is an old stand-by that can&#x27;t be replaced by newer products.  </li>
      <li>Will let you know when they are completely gone.  </li>
      <li>old kids are using it now.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t bought this product in a couple of years (was still using an old tube) but thought I should update.</li>
      <li>I also used it on my face in the last couple of days to try and get rid of this pimple that hasn&#x27;t disappeared since I broke out tremendously the last time I used the Olay daily moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It says &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;flesh colored&amp;#34;, what it really means is RED, like a gross rusty red.</li>
      <li>this keeps my skin clear and doesnt over dry my face even when I use it daily.</li>
      <li>it was just huge red irritated spots on my face which looked worse than the zits-</li>

<li> This is one of the very few sellers that has the clearasil without the gross smelling sulfur.</li>
<li> /&gt;Product received has active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Product pictured has active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The active ingredient in this product is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.  </li>
<li> The active ingredients in the one that I&#x27;ve been using for 4+ years are Resorcinol 2% and Sulfur 8%.  </li>
<li> When I attempted to return for a refund the seller&#x27;s policy was complex and such a hassle that I just decided to eat the cost.</li>
<li> Way to dark for my skin tone, but I like the concept.</li>
<li> Not worth the bother to return it.</li>
<li> The product was coming off with sweat, dripping down onto my dark colored t-shirts, leaving them with bleached areas around the front neckline.</li>
<li> A little tube goes a looooong way.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
<li> in the tube the color is a little &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; but once you get it put on your skin it blends well and can&#x27;t even see it.</li>
<li> (I have a very average medium skin tone)</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s less visible and not MORE, look elsewhere.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really pale though.</li>
<li> I have bad Acne breakouts from time to time and this stuff really works.</li>
<li> I put it on the spot before bed and usually find it gone or almost gone in the morning.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excelent delivered and condition!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clearasil tinted acne cream for about 4 years now and it works infinitely better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried - prescription medications, over the counter face washes, cleansing pads, etc.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  That being said, there are two different Clearasil products marketed under &#x27;tinted acne treatment cream&#x27;.  The active ingredients in the one that I&#x27;ve been using for 4+ years are Resorcinol 2% and Sulfur 8%.  The active ingredient in this product is 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.  I bought this cream on accident and after using it for 2 days, my face felt like it was on fire.  My face became extremely irritated and red and felt as though I was windburned all over.  The other product is much more gentle, clears up my pimples better, as well as hides blemishes better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically in summary, the Clearasil tinted acne creams are great, but make sure you get the right one.  If you haven&#x27;t tried either, I&#x27;d try to the Resoricnol 2%, Sulfur 8% formulation initially and if you&#x27;ve tried this 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and been dissatisfied, go for the other formulation before giving up, as the other one really is a great product.</li>
    <li> this keeps my skin clear and doesnt over dry my face even when I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I ordered the benzoyl peroxide version, but was shipped the sulfur version, which smells terrible.  When I attempted to return for a refund the seller&#x27;s policy was complex and such a hassle that I just decided to eat the cost.</li>
    <li> Glad I found this product works just as well as my old discontinued \\&quot;Cover Girl fresh look clear up\\&quot;. Very gentle on the skin. would recommend.</li>
    <li> We have been trying to find this product for months as not available in NZ anymore - thanks for prompt postage</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the other Clearasil creams to control acne and this one is by far the best.  I put it on the spot before bed and usually find it gone or almost gone in the morning.  The tint helps to hide the redness that acne can cause and the consistency stays put unlike the clear gels.  This goes on over my moisturizer and right under my makeup for great coverage.  It&#x27;s very hard to find, so I get it when I can.</li>
    <li> Not sure why, but this product seems to have been dropped by local retailers; possibly due to complaints regarding bleaching of clothing. I too have experienced this. It was a mystery until I read these reviews. Now that I&#x27;m better informed, I simply avoid getting it on my clothes. I no longer use it when I&#x27;ll be outside in hot humid climates. The product was coming off with sweat, dripping down onto my dark colored t-shirts, leaving them with bleached areas around the front neckline. With this issue understood and precautions taken, there is nothing else on retailer shelves that performs as well for me. The \\&quot;Adult\\&quot; version&#x27;s tint is too light a shade; doesn&#x27;t blend well to skin tone. Be aware, take appropriate precautions and enjoy this product. I&#x27;m satisfied with the transaction, reasonably quick delivery, and the product. Very glad it is still available...at least by mail-order.</li>
    <li> Thought the tinting was going to be like the Clearasil Ultra product but I was sure mistaken. I&#x27;m an asian with a dark tan from the summer and the tinting is even darker and redder than me! I can&#x27;t think of ANY skin complexion where this tinting would match. If you want to look like you have polka dots all over your face, go for this. If you want to cover up your acne so it&#x27;s less visible and not MORE, look elsewhere. Horrible.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was a teen and I am now in my late 30&#x27;s and still love it.  It really clears up blemishes for me in a day or so and helps prevent new ones.  This is a tried and true product that I love.  I had to order it from Amazon because it is hard to find in stores and will continue to do so because I love it that much.</li>
    <li> Yes,it works great and amazon is the only place i can find it anymore,thank you</li>
    <li> This is not to be found in local stores; Amazon has it. While somewhat hesitant to purchase this newer version of the original product, the reddish tint for my skin type is actually a plus. Same strength, same consistency, but the color has changed.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS AS A MAKE-UP BASE, THE TINTED ONE,  KEEPS MY FACE NON OILY, AS IT KEEPS BLEMISHES AWAY,</li>
    <li> I buy this to use as a &amp;#34;cover-up&amp;#34; but I use it on my whole face (not just on acne).  It gives me a nice smooth complexion and fights acne at the same time.  What more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have to apply a very light layer so I don&#x27;t look ridiculous. I&#x27;m really pale though. However, it seems to be getting rid of the acne. My face is peeling but the acne is disappearing. Eh, if its not one thing its another.</li>
    <li> This is the only tint available and I have darker olive skin, but it&#x27;s too dark and a reddish dark so wouldn&#x27;t match most skin tones.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite acne product for years.  It truly has helped me clear my face and become more confident!</li>
    <li> Product pictured has active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients: Resorcinol (2%) (Acne Medication), Sulfur (8%) (Acne Medication)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received has active ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients:  Benzoyl Peroxide 10%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally different product in a package that looks the same.  AVOID</li>
    <li> This is still the best acne cover up and remedy that I&#x27;ve used. Takes the shine away while treating the problem. I will always use and recommend this stuff. My 12 and 14 yr. old kids are using it now.</li>
    <li> I like this acne cream, because it tinted and cover my imperfections. However, I don&#x27;t like the fact that changes the color of my sheets and pillow cases, even washing my face before going to bed.</li>
    <li> Ummm what is the point of tinting a product if it is literally red? I have no idea who this tint could even potentially match. I put this on and even covered it with powder and after my powder faded it was just huge red irritated spots on my face which looked worse than the zits- definitely don&#x27;t recommend. Only reason why I gave it any stars is because the benzyl peroxide did a good job drying out the zits.</li>
    <li> Clearasil Tinted cream will bleach anything it come in contact with. No exaggeration. The tube does have a disclaimer which states \\&quot;May bleach clothing\\&quot;,however, it should say it will literally bleach ANY material to light burnt orange. I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s a color.  If used as directed(i.e. on your face) &amp; your face happens to touch your shirt, or your towel, or shower curtain, sofa, suede leather, dog or cat, etc...It is guaranteed to bleach said item within 15 min. I used it a few years back &amp; made the mistake of buying it again. This really is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
    <li> I ordered this because my local drugstore carries the version without benzoyl peroxide. The tint is definitely different than how it was 2-3 years ago. It&#x27;s just an odd color and doesn&#x27;t blend into a good skin color.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter says that her bumps are drying up since using this product.  We will continue with it.  Will let you know when they are completely gone.  It covers while it&#x27;s healing.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the Oxy cover up product, but since that has been discontinued what choice do you have. This product gets the job done, but it&#x27;s pretty easy to accidentally use too much. You may find yourself recovering certain areas so it&#x27;s not so obvious that you are using cover up....especially for guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used for some razor burn and minor pimples or red areas, this product is just fine. No bad odor, but I do think it will bleach your clothes just like the Oxy version.</li>
    <li> I put it on in small amounts, and by the end of the day my face was red from it. I don&#x27;t reccomend it.</li>
    <li> This item seems to be off the counters in stores. I&#x27;m so glad I found it here.  It&#x27;s a great product. I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product before,  nice skin color, it cover the area while is working, usualy use it at night when go to bed.</li>
    <li> tined?:( I guess it works, but.... I couldn&#x27;t imagine it was TINED like this )) So, if you want to treat your red pimple on ur shoulder... do not wear white t-shirt after this :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the very few sellers that has the clearasil without the gross smelling sulfur.</li>
    <li> They changed the tint to an orange/red color from the last time I bought it. Not worth the bother to return it. Went into the trash.</li>
    <li> This South Florida Family loves the tinted version as we have a tan. In contrast, the vanishing formula that they also make looks like white streaks on our faces which is not acceptable to any of us. This tinted version blends into our tan skin and works perfect for us. Love it. Benzyl Peroxide 10% does a good job diminishing the acne while killing bacteria and the inactive ingredients appear to absorb the oil.</li>
    <li> I have this product all over my house.  One in my dressing room. One in my den. One in my washroom. One in my kitchen.  It is amazing.  If you sense a small or big pimple coming, just put it on before you go to bed or leave the house and it will be gone with hours.  It kills and destorys and it doesn&#x27;t come back.  Sometimes, I get cold sores. I just put alittle on and it is gone wihtin hours.  I use the tinted one so it blends in with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Glad to find it again!!</li>
    <li> i ordered this at the suggestion of Men&#x27;s Health magazine&#x27;s article on the web about how to deal with back acne.  I&#x27;ve been battling it the last few months after getting fed up with the breakouts I was getting on my back following my hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it the last couple of weeks.  It feels good when it goes on but it hasn&#x27;t really reduced the breakouts.  I also used it on my face in the last couple of days to try and get rid of this pimple that hasn&#x27;t disappeared since I broke out tremendously the last time I used the Olay daily moisturizer.  It didn&#x27;t but it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve been through two tubes and it didn&#x27;t help.  I forgot to cancel my subscription so I have an extra tube.  If, somehow, it helps I&#x27;ll re-update.</li>
    <li> I have bad Acne breakouts from time to time and this stuff really works. I would not suggest putting it on if your a male in the morning because the tint kind of looks like makeup. Apply at night before bed and it really dries out the acne and clears up your face. This is a product that actually works.</li>
    <li> About a year ago my 15 year old granddaughter and grandson were breaking out like most teenagers. Asking the moms what they were using one was on Proactive and the other on some cheap OTC off brand. I&#x27;m sure Proactive is a fine product but if they don&#x27;t follow the regiment it can&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;I told them to buy some good old Clearasil like I used 40 years ago. The mom&#x27;s informed me they couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores. So ordered 2 tubes and gave one each to the grands. With the instructions to carry it with them and use it through out the day. Well I get a text awhile back begging for some more. A little tube goes a looooong way.&lt;br /&gt;Once the zits are gone use slows down.&lt;br /&gt;I love showing the young ones that something from my youth is still relevant. Who would have guessed it would be pimple cream ? :o)</li>
    <li> Love love love this product been using this since I was a teen n now iam in my 30&#x27;s enough said 😄😄😄😄</li>
    <li> IT DOES THE JOB EFFECTIVELY. CLEARASIL HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER AND IT STILL WORKS GREAT.</li>
    <li> Way to dark for my skin tone, but I like the concept.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t  know what all the complaints are about. it says very clearly that its tinted. in the tube the color is a little &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; but once you get it put on your skin it blends well and can&#x27;t even see it. It beats putting on zit cream that turns white, then it just looks like your skin is peeling and then everyone focuses on your zit even more. it about time industry made products in ranges of colors rather than just &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this product in a couple of years (was still using an old tube) but thought I should update. The new product is a terrible reddish dark color! I try to think whose complexion it would work on and can&#x27;t think of anyone! (I have a very average medium skin tone) I definitely can&#x27;t wear this in public which defeats the purpose of the tint. Very disappointing...</li>
    <li> I like product.  Very difficult to find in local stores anymore.  Don&#x27;t know why, but I order from here all the time when needed and a great price.</li>
    <li> Quality product; timely delivery; I recommend.</li>
    <li> Clearasil is an old stand-by that can&#x27;t be replaced by newer products.  Excellent for break outs in skin, camouflages like conceal, only better.  Hard to find locally, so glad it is stocked by Amazon.</li>
    <li> It says &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;flesh colored&amp;#34;, what it really means is RED, like a gross rusty red. Not the color you see on pictured on the box. I got a refund and won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
