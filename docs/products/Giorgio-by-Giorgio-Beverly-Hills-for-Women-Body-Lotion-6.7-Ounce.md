      <li>They all are different but have a rich timeless fragrance.  </li>
      <li>What a steal this is for an upscale fragrance that is classic.</li>
      <li>The product was open, only has a pice of tape on the top, I don&#x27;t know have been done to it ?</li>
      <li>I would like to order another one just to see if it&#x27;s the right stuff, but then I&#x27;d have to pay to ship it back then pay shipping again.</li>
      <li>My son says I need to get a new fragrance....</li>
      <li>I was ready to see the rich thick white cream come out of the tube, but instead there was brownish-tan runny liquid that smelled like sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The Body Lotion is so old - no smell and instead of it being white cream that you need to press on the tube to get lotion out,</li>
      <li>My Mum loves this product and it is impossible to get hold of, great to get hold of some finally.</li>

    <li> My son says I need to get a new fragrance....but I just can&#x27;t leave Giorgio! And I am so very glad that it is available through Amazon. Now if I could only find the dusting powder I&#x27;d be a very happy camper!</li>
    <li> A creamy lotion with a great scent that lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;A &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; scent of a more expensive perfume&lt;br /&gt;Just use a few dabs and rub into your arms, legs, neck, shoulders ...makes you feel good all over!</li>
    <li> Love Giorgio products.  They are very hard to find.  I was very pleased to find them available.  People tell me how much they love the scent when I wear it. Thanks for making it available.</li>
    <li> I always liked Giorgio and was happy to find this product.  I have been very pleased with my purchase and give a four star rating.</li>
    <li> I have been using Giorgio by Beverly Hills ever since it came on the Market. I don&#x27;t us anything else. I love it. I get a lot of complements, People say, somebody smells good. I answer, it must be me. I don&#x27;t use the lotion very much, but its just as good. I use Mary Kay lotion mostly.</li>
    <li> My Mum loves this product and it is impossible to get hold of, great to get hold of some finally.</li>
    <li> Kind of dissappointing. Not what it used to be.  I wonder why they stop making the good stuff.  Used to love the powder, cream. bath gel and perfume to layer.</li>
    <li> Always one of my very fav&#x27;s!!!  I always get compliments when I wear this and will wear it forever! Thanks</li>
    <li> This 6.8 ounce seems to be old, runny and slightly pink instead of white the way it should be.  Their stock needs to be examined.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I just put a little here and there, mostly on my wrists because I can enjoy it too.  A little goes a long way.  Prefer this to the spray because I can control the strength of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you like Oscar De La Renta  parfume, Chanel 5 or Allure, you probably should give Giorgio a try.  They all are different but have a rich timeless fragrance.  Very happy I can find this scent once again, it was one of the favs and it is reasonably priced.  Oscar is over $100 for a .25 oz.!  What a steal this is for an upscale fragrance that is classic.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mother and she loves it. Just like what you would get at the stores. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the product&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it was the real thing</li>
    <li> Oh boy to I smell good!!! This is the best lotion in the world. I will buy more all the time.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other customers who found this lotion to be unsatisfactory. I was ready to see the rich thick white cream come out of the tube, but instead there was brownish-tan runny liquid that smelled like sunscreen. I am definitely dissatisfied. I wonder if I just got one from a bad batch or if Giorgia has changed the formula. I would like to order another one just to see if it&#x27;s the right stuff, but then I&#x27;d have to pay to ship it back then pay shipping again. It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> The Body Lotion is so old - no smell and instead of it being white cream that you need to press on the tube to get lotion out, when I opened this, this pink stuff kept falling out of the tube.</li>
    <li> I ordered three lotions,,  They are not the thick, white ones you buy in the store. These are pinkish and runny,, not the Giorgio fragrance.</li>
    <li> I just love the lotion,i bought it for my Mother who is 93,has a beautiful fragrance.I would buy it again</li>
    <li> The product was open, only has a pice of tape on the top, I don&#x27;t know have been done to it ?</li>
    <li> My sister likes his lotion so it was sent out for Christmas gifts. Was delivered on time so I&#x27;m a happy camper</li>
