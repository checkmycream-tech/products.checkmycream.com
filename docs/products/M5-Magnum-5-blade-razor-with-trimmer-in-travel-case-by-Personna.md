      <li>These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>and at an excellent angle.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read Gillette folks plead with their razer users to switch blades once a week at a minimum for the best shave.</li>
      <li>This razor is awesome!</li>
      <li>One of the best razors I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>i am very impressed</li>
      <li>Excellent as promised and advertised!</li>
      <li>They are the best.</li>
      <li>The best razor I&#x27;ve owned in years and not made in China!</li>
      <li>This brand seems to leave a ragged 1/32 inch stubble all over your face at the best.</li>
      <li>so I need a good quality razor and the Hydro 5 was the best for me.  </li>
      <li>It shaves beautifully and close.  </li>
      <li>It is great that it has 5 blades</li>
      <li>I thought because of the price it was a win win situation</li>
      <li>The case is nicer, in my opinion, and the blade quality is great.  </li>
      <li>The M5 does the job, at a great price, with</li>
      <li>Great case comes with it.</li>
      <li>I bought this because it was made in the USA but was happy to find out you get a great shave with it</li>
      <li>So for the price it is a great deal.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great razor.  </li>
      <li>it works great for me.</li>
      <li>Great seller.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Walgreens version on sale with coupons, great shave</li>
      <li>I got my magnum and used it it is great</li>
      <li>ripped off from buying the &#x27;latest and greatest&#x27; from the likes of Gillette and others, this is a great option.  </li>
      <li>Schick Titanium was better and Gillette Mach3 still is the best razor I have found.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always in search of a good and affordable shave.</li>
      <li>just give me the good blades</li>
      <li>Despite having five blades, it does not do a good job shaving.</li>
      <li>Blades are not as good as Gillette, but close.</li>
      <li>I picked up some of these razors from Costco, and have been delighted.  </li>
      <li>Good quality.</li>
      <li>Magnum M5 is every bit as good as the Gillette products.</li>
      <li>By comparison, Fusion&#x27;s trimmer blade is designed perfectly and feels every bit as comfortable as the blades on the front of the razor.  </li>
      <li>Found this one day at Wal-Mart, and loved them from day one.</li>
      <li>I would not say the M5 is this good if I did not like it.</li>
      <li>anybody know of a good twice-a-week razor that&#x27;s cheaper than the Fusion?  </li>
      <li>Good shave but not as close as Mach 5.</li>
      <li>I find the shave to be just as good as the Fusion.</li>
      <li>this shaver works good</li>
      <li>The shave this blade gives is about 95% as good as the shave I got with the powered Fusion shaver; however, it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost, and the lubricant strip lasts longer</li>
      <li>In 1965, Gillette ( G ) came out with the Techmatic, a throw-away steel-band system, good for about 25 shaves.</li>
      <li>The handle has good weight andthe angles at which you can maneuver</li>
      <li>By no means its suppose to be as good as a gillete.</li>
      <li>I started using this razor because I found it at Walmart and it was a good price.</li>
      <li>and I have yet to find a razor do as good as a job as the M5 Magnum.</li>
      <li>Seriously, great great great deal, and the marginal cost per shave is much lower than with another \\&quot;branded\\&quot; product.</li>
      <li>Contrary to popular belief, you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with a good blade.  </li>
      <li>Your skin will be glad you did!</li>
      <li>I love this razor!  </li>
      <li>Real comfortable close shave.</li>
      <li>If anyone is looking to buy a cheap razor that functions great</li>
      <li>So to recap,  nice handle design, great shave and cheap blades.</li>
      <li>The case is nice, too.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s make a razor that looks kind of like the Fusion.&#x27; &#x27;</li>
      <li>As good as any razor from Gillette, at a much better price (don&#x27;t need to support all the advertising and distribution channels).</li>
      <li>Both times were my own fault as I should have replaced the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>nice handle too.</li>
      <li>The blades, I understand, are top quality and Made in the USA; this is perhaps why the shave is so fantastic; great quality blades.   </li>
      <li>i found this razor in Rite aid and loved it so much that im writing a review on here lol.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now very happy with this razor and just hope that the quality of the blades I get when I run out are as good as my current blades.</li>
      <li>THE M5 MAGNUM 5 BLADE RAZOR WITH TRIMMER is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why you get a close near perfect</li>
      <li>With the cost of the bigger makers of razor blades going up, it is refreshing that you can still get a good 5-blade razor for an excellent price.</li>
      <li>Great razor, smooth, close, comfortable shave.  </li>
      <li>Overall a very nice shave and was great for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>it are very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Personna needs to address this issue so that there is some resistance when the razor is used which may have it work better.  </li>
      <li>Better and cheaper</li>
      <li>even more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>- is the M5- Magnum actually better than G&#x27;s Fusion.</li>
      <li>Personna sold replacement cartridges  that fit into G razor handle for over 30 years!</li>
      <li>Well these are priced more rationally.</li>
      <li>This razor is still a better deal than the competition out there.</li>
      <li>This product is great and its a fraction of the price of any of the very over priced Gillette products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of Gillette and Schick products and even the two blade offerings from these firms did a better job than the Magnum.</li>
      <li>I am mostly pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Headblade is great,  but it needs a partner to get the delicate areas, this works great!  </li>
      <li>The price was great and the quality is on par with the Fusion Pro glide, refills are much cheaper.</li>
      <li>Better than Gillette, Electric, or anything else</li>
      <li>More blades &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Like many I bought these razors because of their comparative cheapness.</li>
      <li>Razor handle and case are equal to Gillette&#x27;s best.</li>
      <li>Just don&#x27;t buy too many replacement blades because you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
      <li>But you have to know its not suppose to be compared to any gillete or top brand razor.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this razor!</li>
      <li>Better price.</li>
      <li>I  want to say Thanks for delivering a great product including replacement blades at an affordable price.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As good as any razor from Gillette, at a much better price (don&#x27;t need to support all the advertising and distribution channels). Personna has been making quality razors for a long time. Very close/smooth shave and the razor case is perfect for a gym bag or other travel setup.</li>
    <li> Fast seller and good product.</li>
    <li> I have been through the mill when it comes to shaving. I&#x27;m always in search of a good and affordable shave. I came across this product online and in walmart and put off buying it since it wasn&#x27;t made by Schick or Gillette. the other day I decided to test it out after doing some research and reading reviews. Here&#x27;s what I found...    For the price, its hard to say no. The shave was comfortable and I didn&#x27;t bleed at all. nice handle too. Is it of the same quality of all those other expensive razors with 4 or 5 blades? no. But, its very close. I felt some pulling on the razor while shaving 3 day stubble, but not enough to cause redness or irritation. The only negative I saw was the trimmer blade on the back of the cartridge. I was not able to get as close as I wanted under my nose where it meets my lip with the 5 front blades, but was afraid to use the trimmer since it was a bit painful on edging the sideburns.     In the end, I will continue to shave with this razor for the next few weeks to see how long the blades last. if your unsure about it, its only 5.88 for the razor and 2 blades at walmart. Its a nice econmical experiment if ur frustrated with the ever-rising prices of Gillette and Schick.    Review part 2: 3 shaves and counting... I have shaved 3 times with the magnum and notice no difference in sharpness of the blades. The trick with this razor is to apply a bit of pressure while shaving. This eliminated the pulling and tugging of the whiskers. Still no irritation. Never tried the trimmer blade again, but do u really need it? uhh no. If u cant find these at walmart, go to the personna website, u can get the cartridges for 5.98 and free shipping.    Review part 3: After using this razor for several weeks now, I decided to shave in 2 passes rather than 1. I only did 1 pass until my face got used to the blades. You will not get the full effect of this razor unless you shave in 2 passes, like any other razor. The second pass really cleaned up some of the rough spots that the razor could catch on the first time around. i never shave against the grain, and the second pass really gave me a much smoother shave with the grain in the end. Still cant beat the price or the quality.</li>
    <li> I purchased the M5 Magnum 5 package at Costco because the price was unbelievably low, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the shave quality would be compare to the Hydro 5 blade razor. The M5 doesn&#x27;t even come close to being good as the Hydro 5, the blades were not sharp at all, it was a painful dragging while shaving, felt like a scraping action, it also felt like the razor were pulling my whiskers out of my face. I switched back to the Hydro 5 razor which is way much more comfortable and a performed a way better shave. I have a sensitive skin with a tough beard so I need a good quality razor and the Hydro 5 was the best for me.  The Magnum 5 does have a nice handle, it includes the travel case along with the package but the quality of the shave was just horrible!</li>
    <li> My current Pace 6 bladed razor which I buy for a song online at their website busted.  I picked on of these at CVS thinking it might be a good alternative; not so much.  I don&#x27;t find the cutting to be very effective for my neck area, and the thickness of the blades irritate much of my skin much more so then the Pace 6 bladed razor.   For what it&#x27;s worth  my all time favorite is the Gillette Proglide POWER.  Horrifically expensive but something about that power comb on that unit is like a magic beard/stubble eraser for my mug.</li>
    <li> I refuse to purchase Gillette razors on general principal, as I think they are wildly overpriced.  I picked up some of these razors from Costco, and have been delighted.  Not only are they 1/3 the price, but they perform as good or better and in my opinion LAST LONGER than Gillette&#x27;s.  (I suspect Gillettes are designed to only last 5-10 shaves per razor, but that may be just my suspicions.)  This razor is a slam-dunk example of competition in the market.  Better and cheaper - support these guys and buy their razors!</li>
    <li> I bought these from Costco. They were more than half the price of the competitors and I couldn&#x27;t resist the opportunity to save some money. Unfortunately, this razor is not worth using at any price, for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer is absolutely useless. It does nothing. So shaving the areas near my side burns were a problem.&lt;br /&gt;2. The razor does not cut hair in tight spaces. For example, no matter how hard I tried, I could not properly shave the hair under my nose. I am not sure what in the razor does not allow me to reach into such spaces, but it was a constant point of frustration.&lt;br /&gt;3. The quality of the shave is not very good. Despite having five blades, it does not do a good job shaving. It would miss spots and I would constantly get cuts - even with brand new blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used lots of Gillette and Schick products and even the two blade offerings from these firms did a better job than the Magnum. In fact, my new money-saving strategy is to just buy those products instead!</li>
    <li> Used the first cartridge for an entire month. Could have used it longer, but at this price why bother.     Pivoting mechanism is excellent. Razor glides over your face quickly and effortlessly. And delivers a very close shave.    Only razor besides Gillette&#x27;s top of the line stuff I&#x27;ve ever used that&#x27;s never cut or nick me. And at 48 with a healthy amount of facial hair growth I&#x27;ve used most.    Razor handle and case are equal to Gillette&#x27;s best. The cartridges are similar in performance for 1/3 the price.</li>
    <li> First note, I get these branded for the Duane Reade stores in NYC. It&#x27;s the same product, just different packaging.     I have to say that for the price this razor can&#x27;t be beat. I find the shave to be just as good as the Fusion. My tough beard gives me problems with most other razors, but with 5 blades I can shave regularly and not cut my face to shreds. I combine this with Nivea shave gel (sensitive skin) and I get a perfectly smooth shave, every time.     Only two issues. The blades get dull just a little bit faster than the Fusion, but not to the point where it negates the savings. The other issue is the trimmer blade doesnt seem to be as sharp as the main blades and I find myself needing multiple strokes to take care of those stubborn sub-nostril whiskers.</li>
    <li> I started using this razor because I found it at Walmart and it was a good price. I use it to shave my entire head and face and I have yet to find a razor do as good as a job as the M5 Magnum. I have tried them all because Walmart stopped selling the M5. I have recently found them online and could not be happier.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have offered up a review, but feel compelled to because this product is simply bad.  The blades were dull out of box.  Shaving was a painful experience.  Gave up and went back to the Tri Flex.  These blades were sharper after three months than the M5 new.</li>
    <li> This is a complete knock-off of the Gillette Fusion: 5 blades on the front and 1 trimmer blade on the back.  I have read other reviews by people complaining that they couldn&#x27;t get a really close shave with either blade.  That&#x27;s to be expected.  Increasing the number of blades reduces the gap between the blades.  That means when you press down with the blade on your face your flesh/skin don&#x27;t get pushed down as far between the blades.  More blades &#x3D; less irritation &#x3D; not as close a shave.  That&#x27;s why the Gillette Sensor and Mach 3 are still on the market (they are marketed to people who want the closer shave, not just to people who want to pay less money).    I buy all my razors at Costco because they have the lowest prices you&#x27;ll ever find.  Especially if you come across a coupon in their regular coupon books.  I have always been a Gillette guy becuase my skin is so sensitive.  So much so that I typically shave down, then relather before shaving sideways (never shave upward).  Gillette always gave me the most comfortable shave, and I always upgraded to their latest and greates products as they became available.    Given the price and the similarity in blade design between the M5 and Fusion blades, I decided it was worth a shot (at Costco it comes out to about 1/2 the price of the Fusion if you are lucky enough to come across a coupon -- if not, it&#x27;s still significantly cheaper, and much more so than at Walmart).  I have to admit that the first shave was awkward and almost felt like a cheese grater across my face.  I was very worried.  To my surprise, however, I came out of it fine and the end result was extremely similar to a Fusion shave -- both in terms of closeness and irritation.  Using Shave Secret shaving oil, that means zero irritation when shaving in the shower.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel as smooth or like as much of a \\&quot;glide\\&quot; across your face.  By the second shave, the blade has dulled enough to where it feels basically the same.  The handle has good weight andthe angles at which you can maneuver it are very comfortable.  I can get about the same number of shaves out of M5 and Fusion per blade (in my case about a dozen shaves if under a hot shower, or about 5 shaves if shaving over the sink).  I am 36 years old and have thick black facial hair.    I am mostly pleased with this product.  It does what it should at a significantly lower price than the Fusion.  I have three basic issues with it:    1.  It is not easy to travel with - the case is a bit bulky for a road warrior who needs to maximize efficiency out of a single carry-on  2.  The trimmer blade on the back is very poorly designed.  It cuts relentlessly if your holding angle is off by just a few degrees.  By comparison, Fusion&#x27;s trimmer blade is designed perfectly and feels every bit as comfortable as the blades on the front of the razor.  The M5 seems to have it there simply for the \\&quot;me too\\&quot; effect without much engineering behind it.  I initially tried to trim sideburns and near the edges of my nose with it.  Big mistake.  Best not to use the trimmer blade at all.  3.  The lubricant strip on the front of the blade works well to lubricate.  But of the 20 or so blades I&#x27;ve gone through so far, 3 of them have fallen off after repeated shaves with the same blade (6-8 shaves and they fell off, meaning I had to toss the blades even though they were still sharp).    Overall, I would recommend this blade to anybody with very sensitive skin who likes to shave with a blade but wants to do it within a reasonable budget.  Fusion is the preference, but this blade is good enough and comfortable enough to use at the price point.  Just don&#x27;t use the trimmer blade on the back side - you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
    <li> I picked this up at CostCo because it was so much cheaper than the Mach 3 that I had been using. I&#x27;m glad I did, but I wasn&#x27;t at first. The blades that are included in the package that holds the handle were very poor quality. Gave me a clean shave for just 3 or 4 uses before it started snagging and pulling. It became painful to shave.I figured I&#x27;d been suckered so I just planned to use up the remaining blades and throw it away. However, when I started using the additional blades that were included in separate plastic holders, the quality of the shave improved dramatically. Suddenly the shave was much smoother and the blades lasted as long as anything from Schick or Gilette. It&#x27;s as though the blades included in the handle case were manufactured by a different company than the other blades. I&#x27;m now very happy with this razor and just hope that the quality of the blades I get when I run out are as good as my current blades.</li>
    <li> I bought both the Gillette Fusion and the M5 Magnum at the same time so I could compare directly, having been on the lookout for good alternatives to inflated razor prices. I was previously a Mach 3 user, and a Gillette customer for the previous 5 years at least. Tried the M5 and Fusion out alternately, about a week on one and a week on the other. Mind you, a week for me generally equals maybe 2 shaving sessions, since I tend to be lazy and just do it when my face starts itching from a buildup of long hairs. So I was testing on an average of 3 days&#x27; growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the uninitiated, the Fusion is Gillette&#x27;s offering in the 5-blade replaceable-head shaving market. The M5 Magnum is also a 5-blade replaceable-head shaver, though manufactured by Personna, an unadvertised manufacturer, and is sold across the USA (don&#x27;t know about other countries) as either a generic or house brand. That means that some retail chains actually put their name on the razor packaging -- mine was branded \\&quot;Tru-Care Pharmacy\\&quot; in small type under the M5 Magnum logo on the package, though otherwise the packaging and razor had no other indication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, upon testing, I noticed no difference whatsoever between the two shavers. That&#x27;s right, the M5 performed exactly as well as the Fusion with its 4x priced blades. The shave was just as smooth and just as effective, and the blades last about the same amount of time (although I don&#x27;t use the trimmer blade on either unit, so I can&#x27;t comment on those). The handle also looks nice, feels just as slick, weighty, and ergonomically-shaped, and the handle and blade angle is very comfortable, just as much as the Fusion. Neither the M5 cartridges themselves nor the handle feels cheap or flimsy in comparison to the Fusion (in fact the M5 handle actually feels a bit more solid) and the mechanism for affixing cartridge to handle and ejecting them works exactly as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These results really shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone. At first it seems like such a drastic price difference must mean the cheaper brand has to be cutting corners in quality or something. But if you think about it, big-brand razors sell the old two-blade cartridges at costs more in line with this (see Sensor Excel refills, especially online bulk pricing). How much more material and labor goes into manufacturing a 5-blade cartridge as opposed to a 2-blade? I can&#x27;t claim to know firsthand, but I can&#x27;t imagine that aligning 5 blades in plastic is all that different from doing it with 2 blades, as to warrant the kind of cost increases we see from advertised brand names. The M5 is simply charging us for the actual increased cost of production, rather than inflating it as much as they can get away with, like the big brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, let&#x27;s face it, we all like to see the same pretty markings we recognize from TV and billboards sitting in our own homes. There are certain products for which I&#x27;m willing to knowingly pay more for that luxury; but when it comes to razors, the markups are so incredibly audacious, it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;Please, lord, give me the option to buy an ugly, functional alternative! I&#x27;ll do anything!\\&quot; (not that the M5 is ugly at all, it&#x27;s actually quite nice looking: chrome with black and orange rubber grips). Let someone else foot the bill for Gillette&#x27;s massive advertising campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It almost seems too good to be true, but really it&#x27;s just fair pricing. I&#x27;m sure many people will still fall victim to the assumption that there simply MUST be something inferior about an unrecognized brand that carries such a low price. But since my initial test, I completely switched to the M5 (about a year ago, you can imagine the savings), and I don&#x27;t miss the Gillette products I was using for 5 years prior, not even a little. There&#x27;s just no difference.difference must mean the cheaper brand has to be cutting corners in quality or something.

    <li> Purchased this razor at Wally Mart over two months ago, it delivers a very close and comfortable shave.  In two months of usage, I have never experienced a cut.  I shave two or three times a week, depending on my schedule, and I&#x27;m still using the original cartridge that came loaded in the razor; so the blades last a long time. In my opinon the M5 is a much better choice than the Fusion, the shave quality is the same, but the difference in price is significant.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor and cartridge at CostCo because they were so much cheaper than the Gilette Fusion I&#x27;d been using. In this case it really is true that you get what you pay for. I shave my head and my face - first my head in the shower and then my face at the sink. I started out with this on my head. I could not get the razor to lie flat against my skin. The spring on the razor head is so wobbly and flimsy that it doesn&#x27;t provide any traction at all. I had to take very tiny little strokes and really DIG IN to make the razor do anything at all. This took about five times longer than usual. At the sink I lathered up and started shaving. Exact same thing. Absolutely no angle at which I could get good traction. It worked better shaving up than shaving down, but shaving up is much more irritating to the skin. I had to do lots of repeated little strokes, and again I had to dig in really hard to get it close enough to the skin to do anything at all. (Again the stupidly designed spring head thing). I cut my head several times, and cut my face several times as well. My whole head and face feels like I rolled around on a belt sander for half an hour. There are patches behind my ears that I could not get the razor to touch no matter what angle I took. I have the suspicion they designed this completely by look, without doing any single testing on actual skin. &#x27;Let&#x27;s make a razor that looks kind of like the Fusion.&#x27; &#x27;Here, this looks similar.&#x27; &#x27;Get it into production today.&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t we want to test it out first?&#x27; &#x27;Don&#x27;t be an idiot! Get this into production and out onto shelves within a month!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible shave. Cuts and scrapes. Entire areas of unshaved skin. This razor is the worst razor I have ever used in my entire life. Good thing CostCo has such a great return policy. I will never buy this or any product by &#x27;Personna&#x27; ever again.</li>
    <li> So i used to use Intuition because its pretty and girlie and i love the jewel song they would play in their commercials but it cut me too much and i wanted something different and guy&#x27;s razors are always better they give a closer shave and your legs will be smooth for days! i found this razor in Rite aid and loved it so much that im writing a review on here lol. the price was so worth it i paid about 6.78 (thats cali tax right there!) the case is beautiful the razor is to die for and gave me the nicest shave ive ever had almost the same result as waxing! cant go wrong with this razor!!!!</li>
    <li> I picked this up at Walgreens and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews and searching for an alternative to the mega-high-priced razors that require a credit check and mortgage application to purchase. I really wanted to like this razor because of the price but it comes up very short in comparison to the big names. Even on the first shave with a new blade it feels like it is plucking out my hair and is not close at all. After the first shave it gets progressively worse and my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow starts showing up at lunch time. Someone mentioned in another review that this might not hold true for the refill packs (which I find amazing if true) but I am not willing to test it out. The trimmer, for getting to the hard to reach areas under your nose is practically (95%) useless. I either can&#x27;t get it to cut anything or I draw blood.     I&#x27;m going to give one of the German safety razors a try even though it is a hefty investment...about the same price as a refill pack of 8 razors for a Schick. I&#x27;m willing to take the extra time to get a close shave and the cost for double edge razors is paltry.</li>
    <li> I am adequately pleased with the product.  Having had the Gilette Fusion, that was a hard act to follow.  So far I have found that the M5 has a close shave with few nicks.</li>
    <li> The trimming blade on the back of the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as the gillette razors</li>
    <li> I get these From Meijer in Michigan, they are sold as the house brand.  They work pretty good but I noticed that they seemed to give me razor burn at first.  I found that what was happening is that the blades were getting clogged with hiar and soap and pressing the middle of the center blade out, causing me to shave with just that part of the lifted blade.  I now make sure to clean them frequently and if it gets to bad press my finger across the blades (opposite of cutting direction, of course) to make sure they all stay aligned.  With a brush and some [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Shave Cream]] they leave my face and head baby butt smooth!</li>
    <li> This is affordable 5 blade alternative for those that don&#x27;t want to pay exorbitant prices to Gillette for Fusion. I will echo the positive reviews and just add 2 things worth knowing:&lt;br /&gt;-Personna, the manufacturer of this razor, has been around for decades. Why they don&#x27;t advertise more aggressively I do not know, but they are an established US concern that has been around a long time.&lt;br /&gt;- The blade does not have a lubricating strip, and for those of us that prefer fewer frills, that is preferable. The Schick Hydro is less expensive than Gillette as well but the thing leaves behind too much goo- just give me the good blades and I&#x27;ll take care of my face after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are ways of making the blades last longer as well, either by making a small investment in a Blade Buddy or similar product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my dad cause he needed new razors &amp; he is really happy with this product &amp; he went &amp; got more refills too</li>
    <li> This razor shaves well when the blade is brand new, but some design flaws in the blade head make it difficult to use multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic backing behind the blades does not allow water to flow through, so it is impossible to clean out residue and whiskers.  Additionally, tapping the razor on the sink to clear out the blades is not an option, because the attachment of the blade head to the rest of the cartridge is via a few small plastic tabs that have broken on me multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess an advantage for this razor is that the replacement blades are pretty cheap, so you can buy a shelf-full.  But you are going to go through them faster than you will for other brands.  So, overall it&#x27;s probably a wash.</li>
    <li> I purchased the M5 package a little over a week ago expecting shave quality comparable to the Fusion 5 blade razor.  The M5 doesn&#x27;t even come close - the blades are either unsharp or unevenly mounted in the cartridge, because the sensation is a painful dragging, scraping action, like the blades are not so much cutting the whiskers cleanly as pulling them out of your face.  Tried another cartridge just to make sure that I didn&#x27;t get the one bad one in the package - no difference; the second one was every bit as bad as the first.  I switched back to the cheapo dual blade disposal Gillette razors that Costco sells in packages of 50 - much more comfortable and a better shave.    I don&#x27;t have terribly sensitive skin or an unusually tough beard and I&#x27;ve been shaving every day for forty years, so I have a little experience.  The M5 has a nice handle and nice packaging, but the quality of the shave really sucks.</li>
    <li> The M5 magnum according to my husband is an excellent  razor.  He use to buy it from Costco but for the last two or three years they no longer sell it.  He could not find it anywhere in Hawaii.  The reason we returned two of the three orders we made was that he thought he was buying the disposable magnum razors which were the ones sold in Hawaii and you sent us the non disposable razor with the cartridge.  He did not know they made them like that.  Therefore he did not need three but now he should be able buy the cartridges from you.</li>
    <li> Saw these at wally and checked out the reviews here first. I was confused because there were only about 6 and they were a complete split of love and hate with none in between. For the price I decided to take the plunge and try it myself hoping to side on the love side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;ve been using gillete fusion manual for some time now but the price kills me despite having a blade last me all month. I use to use safety razors when I was younger that I got from my dad and Im in my late 30&#x27;s. Before my fusion I had the mach 4 or whatever it was. I shave about 3-4 times a week with moderate coarse beard. I tried a braun electric for a while there but it just takes way too long to get a close shave esp given that I dont shave everyday. (maybe that&#x27;s why)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M5 Review:&lt;br /&gt;I had a 7 day beard that I grew out first and tested the razor. It cut through with full long good strides and no snags. Impressive. The shave was fast and easy as a result. I definitely felt raw though and Ive never had \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; from shaves. Two days later I tried again. Same story, clean good strides. However, again my face felt extremely raw (think sunburn). The trimmer blade seemed decently sharp but I never use this feature on any of them so cant really comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fusion Comparison:&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the fusion I say its cuts better but is a lot less forgiving. I would have never been able to shave a 7 day old beard with my fusion. It always almost instantly snags the second I try to run the blade on even a 3 day beard. When I go quite a few days without a shave I dread using the gillette and often trim it with my electric. Otherwise it&#x27;s way to difficult as I can only make very minuscule swipes because otherwise it snags which is painful and aggravating. So the M5 is definitely sharp, but its not forgiving and will practically scrape your face off. This is why I think the reviews are so widely split and why some say the blade is razor sharp and others differ. It is extremely sharp and extremely unforgiving. It&#x27;s the later that I think may be giving others the impression that it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: I returned it to wally today for a full refund as the aftermath was too uncomfortable to me. But I am not going to be using Gillette any longer either.I noticed someone mentioned the hydro5 from shick and they have a sale at publix so I&#x27;m going to pick it up tonight.tremely unforgiving. It&#x27;s the later that I think may be giving others the impression that it&#x27;s not.       Final verdict: I returned it to wally today for a full refund as the aftermath was too uncomfortable to me. But I am not going to be using Gillette any longer either.I noticed someone mentioned the hydro5 from shick and they have a sale at publix so I&#x27;m going to pick it up tonight.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the great shave I got with the M5 Magnum. I bought the shaver due to not wanting to spend the price on the \\&quot;Other&#x27;s\\&quot; new replacement blades. I  want to say Thanks for delivering a great product including replacement blades at an affordable price. The M5 was a pleasant find and will have this customer for a long time. The Guardian trimmer is great as well for getting to those tight spots like under the nose. Simply a well thought out product. No nicks either. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought this item at costco, deciding that the $18 price tag was less than 1/2 of my mach 3 carts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I don&#x27;t use shave cream, or lather or anything.  I take a hot shower, then shave.  I do not have anything close to sensitive skin, but I do have a thick beard and I tend to clog all other razors but the mach 3 (which is why I have used that razor for the last 10 years.  Anyway, got out of the shower as usual, filled the sink with hot water and started the shave.  It was a great shave, little to no snagging with a 3 day growth and was a nice close shave for me.  Found it difficult to shave around my gotee due to being new with the razor and not knowing how to position it to shave with precision.  Overall a very nice shave and was great for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree that the trimmer blade is useless, it didn&#x27;t even touch the sideburns when I tried it for a touchup.</li>
    <li> I get as good and comfortable a shave as the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this razor! You will too. But you have to know its not suppose to be compared to any gillete or top brand razor. This razor blade refills cost me 5$ compared to the 25$ for my gillete fusion. By no means its suppose to be as good as a gillete. I enjoy using it. Its a little rough but its a steal for the price.</li>
    <li> Well I bought this after reading the reviews. Not sure what some of you are shaving but this is only good for maybe teenagers. Very dull blades just because it has five blades doesn&#x27;t mean it is worth anything. I always said you get what you pay for so I will stick to my expensive blades. D</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of disposable razors, and this is the most painful and uncomfortable razor I have ever tried. I thought because of the price it was a win win situation but it is so unpleasant to use that I gave it away after one use. Definitely not recommended.</li>
    <li> A smooth shave with little agitation.</li>
    <li> I used to be a Gillette Mach 3/Fusion guy, but got tired of being ripped-off by the refill blades&#x27; insane cost.  So I tried the Magnum M5 and it is not good. I got a lot of nicks and irritation with this razor (but I do have sensitive skin). The handle is way too heavy, making for an awkward stroke.  I tried cheap 4 blade dollar store disposables and had better results than the M5. Of course, your mileage may vary. I would probably have never have bought the M5 had I not read favorable reviews of it first, so it must be fine for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for my money, the hands-down best cartridge system is the [[ASIN:B0079Q3WZI 6 Blade Razor System with Trimmer for Men (Dorco Pace)(SXA5000)]].  Not only does it give a superior shave compared to the M5, it&#x27;s also better than the Fusion and it costs less than the M5!  The blade refills are also cheaper.  I shave my head as well as my face, so that&#x27;s a lot of real estate to cover and the Pace&#x27;s flow-through technology means the blades rinse clean every time, even after shaving off 3-4 day&#x27;s heavy growth. These blades will last you 2-3 times longer than any others on the market (including the M5&#x27;s), saving you even more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote a detailed 5 star review of the Pace, so click on the product link above to check out why I think it&#x27;s the best and cheapest razor system right now.  Your skin will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I have a thick facial hair that can be a pain to shave.  I tried this Blade 5 razor and the blades seemed sharp, but thick hairs clogged the blades constantly and would not clear.  Basically, I would have to rinse the blade after every centimeter of shaving which is ridiculously time consuming. And the flimsy blade cartridge breaks easily when tapping against the sink to clear the clogged hair.  I could only get 5 shaves out of the two cartridges combined.  Schick Titanium was better and Gillette Mach3 still is the best razor I have found.</li>
    <li> Affordable if you can find cartridges. Good shave but not as close as Mach 5. Also seem to cut myself easier with it. Will update on longevit of blades. Read other reviews that said prone rust, which dulls blade, quicker because of lower quality steel. We&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> The M5 may work just fine if you shave every day, but this razor can&#x27;t handle a few days worth of stubble.  I attribute this to the fact that, unlike the more expensive Fusion, the M5 can&#x27;t be thoroughly rinsed of debris.  Shaving stubble gets caught between the blades and there&#x27;s nothing you can do.  When comparing the M5 with the Fusion side by side, you can see why.  The Fusion has more space between the blades and you can actually see through the blades to the other side.  By contrast, there is very little \\&quot;ventilation\\&quot; with the M5; it&#x27;s almost impossible to rinse the debris away because water is not allowed to flow through the spaces between the razor blades.  So when the blade becomes clogged, the debris ends up on your face instead of being washed down the sink.  It was so bad I had to jump in the shower.  Another big disappointment is that the trimmer blade simply does not work - that&#x27;s a key feature that sold me on the Fusion, and since it doesn&#x27;t work on the M5, I have no reason to buy another one - no matter how much money I save.  By all means give it a try if you&#x27;re tired of being ripped off by Gillette.  Just don&#x27;t buy too many replacement blades because you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Does anybody know of a good twice-a-week razor that&#x27;s cheaper than the Fusion?  Please help.</li>
    <li> As a man whose super power is growing massive amounts of hair both in normal and not so normal places, and someone who shaves his head I cannot recommend this razor enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for over 5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is like sandpaper, yet this blade cuts through it like it is nothing and leaves a smooth comfortable skin behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One blade a week gets me through shaving my head, my face, those other places (and there are many), and my neck twice a week (both front and back).  Sometimes my wife uses the blade as well, and even during those weeks I don&#x27;t notice a difference.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine how long a single blade would  last a normal man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the quality for dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use with a steamy shower, Barbasol shaving cream, and a shower mirror for best results.</li>
    <li> gives a clean shave but for my hair texture, it takes a bit longer than with other blades i used before, i like it because it shaves the contours of my without me having a cut</li>
    <li> Like many I bought these razors because of their comparative cheapness. Now 20 minutes later I have a bandaged hand, a face covered in blood and patchy stubble... Also my bathroom looks like the set of a slasher movie!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor I first picked out fell apart in the box. Whilst trying to re attach the fiddly head the rubber razor-cover flipped off badly cutting my index finger. Who makes a razor cover out of flimsy rubber?! So after much swearing and scrambling for bandaids I actually started shaving. To be honest a broken bottle would have done a better job. I had to use one of my old Gillette razors to finish the job and was covered in cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just spend the extra bucks...</li>
    <li> One of the best shaves I&#x27;ve had in a long, long time. Much faster than my old razor; my face is amazingly smooth, with no nicks at all.   The blades, I understand, are top quality and Made in the USA; this is perhaps why the shave is so fantastic; great quality blades.   I highly recommend this razor. Better than Gillette, Electric, or anything else I&#x27;ve ever used really. It even beats the Fusion!   5-Star, American-Made, Top-Quality Product at such a low price?  This razor must truly be a God-Send.</li>
    <li> Bought these blades in dollar store as I was on vacation and my fusion blades had become dull. I did not want to spend another 20 bucks for what I felt was going to be a couple shaves. Paid 5 bucks for razor and two cartridges.  I was hoping for a decent shave and not expecting much more.  However to my surprise the shave from the magnum 5 was pretty close to the fusion.  The only drawback as has mentioned by other reviewers is that the trimmer is not very good no where Near as good as the fusion. I went back to the dollar store and bought another cartridge pack of 4 blades for 5 bucks,have been shaving with the magnum now for a couple of months I shave every other day,am happy with shave use the fusion for trimming.</li>
    <li> The price was great and the quality is on par with the Fusion Pro glide, refills are much cheaper. Great buy!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a razor... It is what it is...</li>
    <li> I do recommend this product, but it is not really a superior shaving solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for trying this product is that the refills are less expensive than the 3-blade refills from a big-name brand. Yes, it is cheaper and therefore is better.&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, the shave I get is not any closer than the 3-blade I was using. Yes, it is more comfortable gliding across my face, but not closer. Plus, I am just as likely to cut myself as a 3-blade. In fact, the wider size makes maneuvering the small places on my face even more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the supply of the refills are kinda flaky, I suggest you get the disposable version if you can find them.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver it works great for me. I would recommend trying it. I travel for work and it&#x27;s pretty handi</li>
    <li> There are three slots for additional blades in the back of the travel case. These were empty. I would have preferred they had extra blades and I would have paid the extra few bucks.</li>
    <li> I always avoided buying the Gillette fusion for a long time because of the blade prices.  I was using 2 and three blades,  but I must say this Razor changed my mind.  It shaves smoothly and I do not nick myself. I use this on my face and to cleanup the hair my headblade misses.  Headblade is great,  but it needs a partner to get the delicate areas, this works great!  I would not do a full head shave with it,  not because it is not capable, but because I am just a creature of habit. So to recap,  nice handle design, great shave and cheap blades. I really like the 5 blade shave and don&#x27;t want to give it up.  I hope this Razor is made forever and stays affordable.</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. They work great and last a long, long time. I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was made in the USA but was happy to find out you get a great shave with it and none of the nicks I got with my old blades. The handle is fancy and is easy to hold.  The case is nice, too.  If you were thinking of buying Made in the USA products, start with this one.  It&#x27;s a real improvement!</li>
    <li> This thing was made in the USA and is as good if not better then any razor I&#x27;ve used. Great case comes with it.Real comfortable close shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor system at Wal-Mart for 5.88, comes with a $3.00 off coupon for the first 4 cartridge refill (also 5.88). Quality is just as good as the more expensive alternative, as I have compared them back to back. The extra single blade edge trimmer is great, too.    Only downside is that the refills are hard to find, almost exclusively at Wal-Mart.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Gillette Fusion blades and came across these.  I thought, hey generic is just as good as name brands right?  5 blades is 5 blades...right?  Not in this case.  I can shave for almost a month, using only hot water, and one Fusion blade (and I have a coarse beard).  I get about three shaves, using shaving gel, before these blades are done.  They are just not sharp.  Contrary to popular belief, you don&#x27;t need shaving cream with a good blade.  However, the M5 you do.  To be somewhat fair, they do work decently when used with cream/gel for the 1st three shaves, but be prepared for cuts after that though.      Also, the blades on the M5 do not rinse clean. The hairs get stuck in between the tiny blades and no amount of water or banging will get them out.  I&#x27;d imagine this also reduces effectiveness.     Yes, the Fusion blades are expensive and over priced, but I&#x27;d imaging you&#x27;ll be paying the same amount in the long run with these blades.  They say you get what you pay for...in this case it&#x27;s absolutely true.</li>
    <li> This product is great and its a fraction of the price of any of the very over priced Gillette products.  I shave daily and frankly I&#x27;m tired of getting the shaft from Gillette.  I walked into Costco the other day and saw on an M5 with 20 refills for $18.00 vs. no Fusion Razor and 16 refills for $41.00.  So, if this razor performs well, why would I even consider a Fusion?</li>
    <li> With the cost of the bigger makers of razor blades going up, it is refreshing that you can still get a good 5-blade razor for an excellent price.</li>
    <li> Since the first one of the M5 Magnum razors I purchased at Costco 5 or so years ago, I haven&#x27;t used any other.  None of the stores in my area carry this razor or its replacement blades so I have to order it online.  I only bother shaving about 3 times a week and one blade cartridge lasts me 3 or 4 weeks so it is the most cost effective razor I have used besides Grandpa&#x27;s old straight razor.</li>
    <li> Unquestionably and without doubt, the ASR - Personna M5- Magnum is the best value in&lt;br /&gt;wet-shaving in today&#x27;s rip-off market. The M5 does the job, at a great price, with&lt;br /&gt;cartridges that provide between 20 to 30 shaves for an average facial hair. Some people get over 50 shaves and use the cartridge for over 2 months! How about that for Value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But how does ASR - Personna get away with it? How do they sell a near knock-off of&lt;br /&gt;Gillette&#x27;s Fusion for 1/2 the price? And who the heck is ASR - Personna?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well-- for starters -- ASR ( the parent of Personna -- American Safety Razor ) has done this trick for over 50 years. In 1965, Gillette ( G ) came out with the Techmatic, a throw-away steel-band system, good for about 25 shaves. ASR cameout with a clone and continued to sell it well after G stopped selling Techmatic in the late &#x27;70s. In 1971, G hit the market with the first twin blade - the G Trac II. Personna sold replacement cartridges  that fit into G razor handle for over 30 years! Many of the knock-off Sensor cartridges found at drug stores are made by ASR and easly fit onto G&#x27;s Sensor and Sensor Excell razor handles.  G is the market leader and ASR - Personna is the copy-cat company, that sells clones of G&#x27;s products usually at 1/2 the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - is the M5- Magnum actually better than G&#x27;s Fusion. I say yes -- and here&#x27;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G uses this mickey-mouse flexible loaded blade system, which provide a spring action to each blade. G uses this on Sensor, Mach 3, Fusion and all female VENUS systems. G calls this a BLADE SUSPENSION SYSTEM, that allows each blade to independently move and flex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get hold of an old Fusion cartridge. Take a tweezer, a small prying tool, and nose pliers, and carefully examine how the mechanics works. Here&#x27;s how to do it carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the pliers, hold the cartridge facing down, and with the prying tool, peel away the left side crimping connector. That holds in the 5 blades. With a tweezer -- and do it slowly -- pull away the plastic retaining clip and yank out one blade, preferably blade 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll see a metal blade machined to turn a 90 degree angle. One side is thin and sharp, and the portion at 90degree turn is the bracing lever, which fits into the plastic cavity with about 1-4 millimeter play. G places 2 small plastic levers under each blade turn, and that&#x27;s how G get&#x27;s the spring action. G claims this spring action adjusts to your facial contours. That&#x27;s in addition to the pivoting head of the cartridge on the handle. G does that by using a spring-action system built into the razor handle itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ASR - Personna and the M5 eliminates all that garbage. The M5 has 5 sharp blades&lt;br /&gt;with no spring action at all ( as does SCHICK - the 4 blade Quatro ). The M5 cartridge head pivots from two plastic levers under the head but not on the handle as does G&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- with G you get pivoting cartridges from spring-actions in the handles and then&lt;br /&gt;you get flexible blades in the cartridges itself due to the plastic lever under each&lt;br /&gt;blade. This is G&#x27;s patented technology since 1993 with Sensor and then MACH 3 and&lt;br /&gt;with all female Venus and of course Fusion. If you don&#x27;t trust me, then take apart&lt;br /&gt;G&#x27;s cartridges -- MACH 3 - Sensor - Fusion - Venus --and you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do you need all that crap? I say NO!!!  The M5 only has a pivoting head due to a&lt;br /&gt;couple of small plastic levers and all blades are rigid -- NOT FLEXIBLE as in G&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead -- touch a M5 cartridge blades. They are all fixed and rigid and very tight,&lt;br /&gt;sharp and at an excellent angle. That&#x27;s why you get a close near perfect shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now -- touch a G Fusion blades. The blades will bounce and flex about 2millimeters. That&#x27;s what G&#x27;s engineers call flexible adjusting blades and I call all that garbage. Again, G&#x27;s formal name is a BLADE SUSPENSION SYSTEM, which is patented and trademarked by G.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now -- some of ASR - Personna&#x27;s newer 5 blade cartridges have been redesigned and have some flexing in each blade, again due to plastic levers under each blade, like G. However, the M-5 disposable and all older cartridges are rigid and non-flexible blade systems. By the way, both ASR &amp; Schick are both owned by the ENERGIZER battery group, and the newer M-5 you see at COSTCO is like Schick&#x27;s Hydro5 -- both of which I do not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- now you have it. By the way, I am an educated, technically trained 50+ year old&lt;br /&gt;with about nearly 40 years of shaving. I would not say the M5 is this good if I did not like it. It is the best value in shaving period in today&#x27;s rip-off shaving market!!!</li>
    <li> Alright, I was looking for a bargain razor to be delivered. I&#x27;ve never heard of the company but this razor feels more than a bargain, it is a solid build. It&#x27;s not perfect but well with the money.</li>
    <li> Bought this about 2 weeks ago &amp; on my 2nd blade. Overall I have grown used to its quirks, but here goes:    Cons: It defintely pulls a bit, even when shaving every day. It pulls a bit MORE (maybe more than a bit sometimes) when I do not shave for a few days. Overall, it is more &#x27;scrapey&#x27; than my Gillette Mach 3. Seems to need a clean &#x27;swipe&#x27; (a properly placed stroke) to be most effective, which took me a day or two to get used too. Case is kind of huge - I&#x27;d ditch it if I was to travel, but it is fine for home.    Pros: Once I got the gist of how to shave the tougher areas around my chin, &amp; since I shave almost every day, I kind of fell for this much cheaper razer. Being kind of  cheap at heart, I ALWAYS rode my Mach3 to the bitter end due to the cost of the blade replacement. I&#x27;ve read Gillette folks plead with their razer users to switch blades once a week at a minimum for the best shave. What I am driving at is that for me I always wind up with a terrible shave with the Mach3 due to blade cost at the end, &amp; even though I think it is a slightly inferior shave than I am used to, once I manned up to a bit more pulling I was really happy with the overall shave. Plus, here&#x27;s the kicker: since the blades are much cheaper, I will switch them once a week &amp; therefore receive a more consistent shave overall with this product than the Mach3.    Hope this helps - I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes over the next few months esp. if I fall into old habits &amp; try to shave with the blade too long - maybe if you all live near me you&#x27;ll HEAR the blade rasp across my steel wool in the AM, LOL.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been great so far but only time will tell. Why do I need ten more words for this post to submit?  Update 12-26-15: I really like the razor however one thing it has trouble with is getting under the nose. I bought some cheap twin blade disposables for that problem.</li>
    <li> Terrible shave. Feels like it is pulling the hair out of my face.</li>
    <li> Best razor o the market</li>
    <li> I order this product for the 4 replacement blade and it only came with 1&lt;br /&gt;it was not what I expected at all.</li>
    <li> I got these at Costco and misplace the razor handle on a trip. Still the best razor and blades that money can buy, hands down. Oh, and they&#x27;re cheaper than Gillette.</li>
    <li> I was tired of paying the price for the Mach 3 refills, so I decided to try this cheaper alternative.  The only positive to this razor is the price.  It causes major razor burn.  I have sensitive skin, so it was really bad for me.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this kind of burn on any other razor.  Its too wide to get right under you nose unless you do some major nose rearranging.  Even then you cant get a clean shave there, or if you do you come away with a nasty cut.  The closeness of the shave is the worst. After 4 or 5 shaves you may as well get out a kitchen knife, because there&#x27;s a good chance the knife will be much sharper.  I usually don&#x27;t bother with reviews, but i&#x27;m picky about my shaves, and this razor was a huge waste.  Don&#x27;t want anyone to make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> If you want a terrible shave with massive razor burn and nicks and cuts you can get this product.  It is great that it has 5 blades but the razor will not lay on your face.  I had to push the back with my finger and that just caused problems.  Personna needs to address this issue so that there is some resistance when the razor is used which may have it work better.  I will be returning mine to Costco and will wait and see if the feedback makes for any changes.</li>
    <li> My hubbie is in love with his new razor. I recommend this for all the fellows. Close shave with no tugging are the exact words my man said.</li>
    <li> Good quality. Blades are not as good as Gillette, but close. So for the price it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent as promised and advertised! Thank you very much!!</li>
    <li> Thought I wasnt going to find them. They are the best.</li>
    <li> Fraction of the cost of Gillette and other famous brands, just as good though. Well made and cuts close. I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine now for 3 months, I shave my head &amp; face with mine daily and have yet to cut my head. The best razor I&#x27;ve owned in years and not made in China! I&#x27;ve had the same blade on it since I got it and it is just now getting to the point of replacing it. (the life of the blade is to wash it, Thoroughly DRY it &amp; then store it where it won&#x27;t get moisture)</li>
    <li> Great razor, smooth, close, comfortable shave.  I ordered and received, eventually, 24 spare cartridges.  I wanted/needed another razor handle because I use Edge shave gel (sensitive skin), which over time (eight to ten cartridges) leaves a deposit/film on the razor handle&#x27;s cartridge locking mechanism.  This soapy deposit, makes it difficult to lock the cartridge in place.  I do not believe that this is a defect in the razor, but rather a by-product of using Edge shaving gel.  Thus for every 24 cartridges you will need three (3) handles - if you use Edge shaving gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying 50 dollars for the Gillette razors/refills &amp; thought I&#x27;d try these since they were practically 1/2 price of Gillette&#x27;s. What a mistake &amp; waste of money this brand is... I&#x27;ve used Gillette cartridges for 6 months that were light years sharper than these. This brand seems to leave a ragged 1/32 inch stubble all over your face at the best. Terrible, terrible, terrible!</li>
    <li> I bought a package of these razors at Costco when they were introduced, and offered at a special promotion price.  If the razor works, it works well.  It shaves beautifully and close.  The problem is, the attachment between the blade and the handle is appallingly poorly designed.  It&#x27;s hinged with two small, delicate tabs on the side that hold the blade in place on the tab that attaches to the handle.  These tabs break if you just look at them cross eyed.  About 50% of the blades had this defect.  If I dropped the razor on the floor, if it was packed in a travel kit and got jostled a bit, if anything out of the ordinary happened, one of the tabs would break, and render the blade useless because you could no longer attach it to the handle.  This product is very poorly designed.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.  Add to which it&#x27;s the highest priced straight razor I&#x27;ve ever seen.  Not recommended for anything.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Magnum M5 razor from Costco when I finally was pushed over the edge by the \\&quot;price-creep\\&quot; of so-called disposable razors from Gillette. The Mach II.. then III.. then Fusion.. just the cartridges are well over $3 each now, even from discounters. This has gone into ridiculous territory. When a 12-pack of refills costs as much as a rechargeable electric razor, it&#x27;s time cry foul and look for alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Magnum M5 is every bit as good as the Gillette products. Even my wife loves them! Trust me when I say that means they are indistinguishable from the \\&quot;real thing.\\&quot; She hates generic stuff. And anecdotally, I feel like they even last a bit longer. I haven&#x27;t actually taken notes, but I get well over two weeks out of a Magnum blade. And then, of course there&#x27;s the fact that these are less than 1/3 the price of the name brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try these. If you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;ve only spent the cost of about 2 Gillette refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unfortunate that Costco no longer sells them. They disappeared from their shelves sometime in Spring 2012. Or maybe it was longer ago- it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve had to buy refills very often since they last so long. But I found myself looking on Amazon when I could no longer find them at Costco. I&#x27;m glad they can still be obtained online since it&#x27;s kind of hard to go back to being gouged when there&#x27;s a great, far-cheaper alternative.</li>
    <li> I used Mach 3 for years. Got tired of paying through the nose for replacement blades. Found this one day at Wal-Mart, and loved them from day one. Wally world stopped selling them, but I found them here. They don&#x27;t last quite as long as a Mach 3 blade does, but they&#x27;re so much cheaper that I don&#x27;t care. There&#x27;s also a single trimming blade on the rear of the head that Mach 3 doesn&#x27;t have. Suck it Gillette!</li>
    <li> These are just average quality blades. Plus, thete was only one extrs blade included, with the slots for the four other extra blades empty.</li>
    <li> this shaver works good i am very impressed it alot cheaper then gilettes bs razors  and alot cheaper to use</li>
    <li> One of the best razors I have ever owned. Only downside is you have to order the actual blades from Walmart, or anywhere that sells them online. But I bought a 3 packs and they have lasted me an incredibly long time! The blades feel smooth and you get a very clean shave. If anyone is looking to buy a cheap razor that functions great this is it! I just love this razor and I have owned quite a few, but this is one that I intend to keep.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  These are my razor blades from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews about nicks and razor burn... Don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;re shaving, but this is a fantastic razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No cuts, no burn, nothing, just smooooooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m switching to DE Safety, but this is my backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rubbing my face because it&#x27;s so smooth still..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great razor.  The case is nicer, in my opinion, and the blade quality is great.  I go full wet shave minus the razor itself, so maybe that&#x27;s why I had such an enjoyable experience.  I would consider getting a brush and going through all the motions if you&#x27;re planning on shaving at all.  Don&#x27;t know if the canned crap they sell as shaving cream is what made it bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blades are made in the states, so you&#x27;re supporting Americans, and on top of that, replacements cost.... *drum roll* 50 cents a cartridge?  THAT&#x27;S A STEAL.  10 blades of anothe razor would easily cost 20$, and that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky.  Seriously, great great great deal, and the marginal cost per shave is much lower than with another \\&quot;branded\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> I love this razor!  It works great on the face and lasts a long time.  The big names charge an unbelievable amount for their razors, these do the same thing.</li>
    <li> this gives a great shave while cheaper than those expensive razors that cost $40+. only problem is you dont see this razor in any drugstore or dept.store only at amazon.</li>
    <li> This razor is still a better deal than the competition out there. I get a better shave for less money than the other name brands. My only complaint would be that I have found the same razor in the local supermarket on sale for a better price than the one offered on the internet; I will be watching the prices carefully the next time I purchase.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Will buy again from them. Fixed at a Great Price. Thanks</li>
    <li> ENERGIZER BRAND WHICH MAKES SCHICK MAKES THIS BRAND.  I purchased the Walgreens version on sale with coupons, great shave I liked it so much I purchased two more. One for my carry on bag and one for my dad, my mom is always complaining about the price of replacement cartridges.  Well these are priced more rationally. I compared this to the new flex ball pro-life by gillette.  Well provide did give abit closer shave but not by much.  And the price comparison between them the M5 beats the Flex ball hands down.</li>
    <li> It has only one blade inside, but my understanding is that it will have all 4 blades. I wish I get the new one with all blades in it.</li>
    <li> My husband prefers this razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my son and he loves it.  It shaves his skin and leaves no cuts or abrasions.  I&#x27;ve used this product myself for years.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> no negative comment all positive comment  it is as advertise  five blades in one razor  sometimes its too wide with five blades</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s really hard to give this anything less than two stars considering the price. Having said that, the quality simply isn&#x27;t there. I got nicks and cuts I never get with the Gillete&#x27;s of the world. While the price is considerably less it simply wasn&#x27;t worth the savings for me.</li>
    <li> Great razor! Great price!! Actuall it&#x27;s the second M5 i&#x27;ve owned. The first one broke after a few years of use when it hit the floor for the umteenth time.</li>
    <li> I am open to any generic brand that can save dollars but still qualify itself with QUALITY.  Magnum was a &#x27;blank&#x27;.  This has to be the worst razor in the arena of sharpness I have ever used and I have used everything from quality brands to throw away brands.  This doesn&#x27;t even qualify as a throw away brand because it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;cut it\\&quot;  SERIOUSLY. I have a medium to heavy beard but in downward/upward stroke cutting, it cannot compare to the FUSION.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll pay the extra dollars and get more shave from a Fusion blade than I will from the Magnum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Magnum, you backfired on this one.</li>
    <li> I got my magnum and used it it is great it gets close and don&#x27;t have to shave as often</li>
    <li> What doctor ordered! very convinient - I have the head as well as face, would buy it again - highly recommended - best quality for the price</li>
    <li> The shave this blade gives is about 95% as good as the shave I got with the powered Fusion shaver; however, it&#x27;s 1/3 the cost, and the lubricant strip lasts longer (the blades themselves last about the same amount of time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re tired of feeling ripped off from buying the &#x27;latest and greatest&#x27; from the likes of Gillette and others, this is a great option.  I also really like how this shaver can easily shave against the grain, without nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> THE M5 MAGNUM 5 BLADE RAZOR WITH TRIMMER is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve come across. I am over 50 and have been shaving my head bald every day for the past 8 years. I&#x27;ve used so many different razors, including electric razors (which I haven&#x27;t come close to one yet that gives a closer shave than the M5) until I discovered this razor about a year ago. Countless times I&#x27;ve nicked myself and I&#x27;m happy to say that using this razor, I&#x27;ve nicked myself only twice. Both times were my own fault as I should have replaced the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the other thing, I can get two weeks, head and face shaving out of one razor blade. It&#x27;s really remarkable especially for the price. I highly recommend it to those who shave their heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This however is my only my opinion. Our skin is all different but for me, I finally found the product that works.</li>
    <li> Originally purchase because it&#x27;s the only razor company I could find that did not use animal testing.  Turns out to be a great value as well!  Shave is comparable to that of other more expensive razors.</li>
    <li> Price was good, not a big fan of the 5 blade razors but was looking for an alternative to the $30-$45 replacement cartridge packs. As a face and head shaver I found that after 2 shaves the blades dulled and I nicked my head more, as well as bad razor burn which caused my scalp to peel. I have since gone back to a 3 blade razor.</li>
    <li> This razor is awesome! I get better shaves with this over any other branded razor.......and I tried them all.</li>
    <li> Understandably, this is quite cheap when compared to Gillettes. However, as several reviewers have mentioned, this hardly ever gives a smooth shave. Even when I use a razor fresh from the box on my 4 day old beard, it gives such a pathetic shave. Each stroke is quite harsh on the skin and doesn&#x27;t really give you a great feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the feeling I get with Gillette after 5/6 shaves. For reference, I use a Gillette Fusion razor/blades and I am pretty sure I am going back to that once I am done exhausting this pack, which should be quite soon keeping in mind the rate at which it burns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the trimmer on this absolutely useless. Unless you want to scratch yourself, it&#x27;s of no practical use to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have a very heavy beard. Gillette was my choice especially when they came out with the vibrating handle. But the M5 is giving me the same shave. Better price. AND LASTS LONGER!!! for the amount of shaves it gives on one set of blades. I am very impressed with this product and will continue to use it. I will give it a 5 STAR when they develop a vibrating handle.</li>
