      <li>This is a pretty nice size bottle and it really doesn&#x27;t take much for it to work.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is effective, but not harsh on my nails like using the pure alcohol.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
    <li> a must have  great price.</li>
    <li> I think this product is great, but after doing gel nails for a while, I&#x27;ve realized rubbing alcohol works just as well.</li>
    <li> This works so well with gel nails! It cleans really well and doesnt damage the shine!!!! Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure that I needed this product to finish off the gel polish but I have found that I love it.</li>
    <li> I had a UV lamp, and then purchased the products (base, color, top).  I thought I was ready to go.  Everything was tacky and seemed like it had not \\&quot;dried\\&quot; (cured).  I had no idea that you MUST have what they call a cleanser, to get the tacky finish gone and see the wonderful shine.</li>
    <li> 99% Isopropyl Alcohol is 4X cheaper &amp; works just as well ... less concentrated alcohol &#x3D; less shiny finish</li>
    <li> This cleanser gives your nails such a healthy shine and it enhances your nail polish color.  Works great and I love the Gelish Harmony products.</li>
    <li> Totally got the wrong cleanser and tried it and did not even work on my nails. So i would not recommend this for those that have different gel paints or powders.</li>
    <li> I received this and was happy I got something in the mail, but after getting it, I realized I only needed a bottle of cheap alcohol 70-90%.  Packaging is nice and I&#x27;ll just use the bottle and refill with over the counter alcohol.</li>
    <li> It has a pleasant scent, not very alcohol-y like other gel nail cleansers. I will continue to use this product even when using other brands of UV gel products.</li>
    <li> my skin turned white when touching it. it looks horrible. i&#x27;ve never seen any other cleanser have the same problem.</li>
    <li> works great, cute bottle, good size also that it doesn&#x27;t take up the space</li>
    <li> Gelish cleanser is made to use in two phases of Gelish soak off gel nail polish application.&lt;br /&gt;First it is used to clean the nail as a prep to ensure the nail is free from oil and disinfected.&lt;br /&gt;Second time in the application process that you use it is to remove the tacky dispersion layer of&lt;br /&gt; the Gelish polish Top It Off top coat at the end of the manicure. It is applied via a lint free&lt;br /&gt;wipe (I use paper towels) and the nail scrubbed clean of the sticky residue after UV treatment to&lt;br /&gt; expose the clean, dry, and strong nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is mostly Isopropyl Alcohol (rubbing alcohol)and some added skin conditioning additives. It is&lt;br /&gt;not absolutely necessary to use this cleanser at home as common 70%-100% isopropyl alcohol that you&lt;br /&gt;might already have in your medicine cabinet will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is of course extremely flamable and should be kept out of the reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gelish system is extremely user friendly and many DIY nail enthusiasts enjoy it&#x27;s ease of application&lt;br /&gt;and value as the Gelish polishes usually cost less and have more polish in the bottles than other brands.</li>
    <li> This is steps 1 and 6 of the Harmony Gelish process. I do it at home for almost free with products like this available on Amazon! Saves me a fortune. This has almost no scent, which is good, and is not drying like alcohol.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave nails sticky...does the trick! Good price too! This isd a lot cheaper than other brand I first bought and works the same.</li>
    <li> As described. Works well.</li>
    <li> I love everything Gelish! I will definitely buy this product again...I chose this product because this is what I was shown when I first started manicures.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to cure my nails between layers of my gel manicure. It helps to remove the tackiness (stickiness) that can occur. However, I found that using simple rubbing alcohol is better, and MUCH cheaper. Hit up your local pharmacy and save yourself some money!</li>
    <li> Love this line of products.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice size bottle and it really doesn&#x27;t take much for it to work. It works best for gelish polish.</li>
    <li> fast shipping and great product</li>
    <li> I ran out of the Red Carpet Manicure &amp;#34;Purify&amp;#34; and purchased this only because seller had free shipping.  Bottle was big, price was good, and outcome was perfect.  Will probably buy the BIG, BIG refill bottle in the future to save even more money.  I know others say rubbing alcohol is the same, but I don&#x27;t feel like this dries out your nails and cuticles as much as RA.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this little bottle. buy 100% acatone remover instead add to a small bowl then microwave water in a larger bowl then set the acatone bowl into the hot water bowl and have customer put nails in acatone. Much Cheaper.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is fine, but using rubbing alcohol on a no-lint cotton pad is the same effect. I work in a nail salon, and that&#x27;s how we do it.</li>
    <li> works better than alcohol</li>
    <li> This is a good price for the real stuff. I have since learned it is the same thing as rubbing alcohol, so next time I will just go to the $1 store and get alcohol for cheaper.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second bottle. Will use it till I use gelisch polish. Highly recommended for those who use Harmony polish at home</li>
    <li> This is nothing but pure alcohol; it smells just like rubbing alcohol.  I paid $7.00 for pure alcohol. All you need to do is add some light blue coloring to rubbing alcohol.  I was think that maybe this was not not alcohol like the other reviews said, but it is pure alcohol.  Never again.</li>
    <li> Previous to purchasing this, I was just using regular drugstore purchased alcohol per online recommendations. The shiny finish in my nails looked patchy and a little dull in some areas when I did the final wipe down. I thought I would just try one bottle to see if it would make a difference.  I have used it on 3 polish changes and I no longer have any dull spots. I don&#x27;t know why, given the ingredients, there&#x27;s a difference, but there definitely is with my nails. I won&#x27;t be going back to the plain alcohol finish again.</li>
    <li> This product works well and has great packaging but it simply is a very expensive isopropyl alcohol.  It can be very difficult to find 100% isopropyl alcohol in the store but the 70% is much easier to find and the best part is you can pick up for under $1.Nonetheless, this product does exactly what you need it to do (Remove Tacky Layer off your Gel Nails).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle in about 2 years. This stuff is perfect for cleaning the final layer and taking off the tacky stuff. Leaves my manicure nice and shiny for weeks!</li>
    <li> If you have a shellac lamp and use the shellac get, you need this product. I tried my nails without it and they peeled off within a few days. This helps clean your nails to get them ready for the shellac.</li>
    <li> first off my bottle showed up and it had leaked everywhere. About 1/4 of the bottle was gone. I didn&#x27;t contact the seller because I didn&#x27;t even feel like dealing with it. I use it, and I don&#x27;t see the point. You can just use rubbing alcohol instead. I am not sure what the point of this is. Maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the Gelish products but got this to start my gel kit - it works, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully for gel nails application. Much less expensive and still high quality.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and described.</li>
    <li> Not necessary.  Use rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> I have tried this and really do love it. I ran out and used an alcohol pad in a pinch and it worked great to dehydrate the nail and also to cleanse the tacky. Alcohol works the same and is cheaper but I&#x27;ll still continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> All you need is alcohol but this is a little better.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! This cleanser doesn&#x27;t work. I brought this when I got all my Gelish products and cause I read that it works better than the alcohol, makes the gel shinier. Well no it doesn&#x27;t and it didn&#x27;t even remove the tacky residue, no wonder so many LED lamps and gel polishes are getting bad reviews if ladies are using this Gelish cleanser. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work, after about a minute or more of rubbing my nails to get the tacky residue off I gave up and grabbed my alcohol, wiped them all down in less than a minute to a beautiful shin and dry!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money ladies just use your alcohol!!!</li>
    <li> Half the bottle had leaked by the time I received it!</li>
    <li> Love the gelish product line</li>
    <li> This product always gives me a clean slate to work with every time.</li>
    <li> Products come on time. This is a very good product. You really need to wipe down your nails when doing gel nails at home. If you get in any lint at all it gets cured into your polish and it doesn&#x27;t look good. Use it with the no lint pads, it works very well.</li>
    <li> I really like this Harmony Gelish Gel Cleanser. It is the best cleanser for Zgel nails. This was an excellent price and a very large bottle. Arrived in 5 days. I think it was back ordered.</li>
    <li> Love the way it feel on my nails most have at all times and most of all make my nails look so great this was the second thing to get just look and order it is something to get!</li>
    <li> I love it. I got a big bottle for low price.. came fast and seal and packaged well.</li>
    <li> love it...it work perfectly</li>
    <li> Gelish Gel Cleanser. Works very well as expected. No strong odor; pleasant scent. EZ to open large cap, smaller hole opening to pour product is very nice; in case it tips over, you won&#x27;t lose all the liquid. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Good product cheaper than Sally</li>
    <li> just got it , looking forward to using it</li>
    <li> Having purchased a starter kit for the Gelish product line--and love the Gelish polish and it&#x27;s staying power...I have realized that both the nail cleanse and the gel soak off formula are basically forms of acetone. I just use nail polish remover for both of those (highly over priced) products.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is effective, but not harsh on my nails like using the pure alcohol.  It also helps clean up the polish &amp;#34;mistakes&amp;#34; around the edges of my nails without damaging my manicure.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and an essential step in a long lasting manacure at home .I will be buying again</li>
    <li> This is the product to get instead of hunting down 99% alcohol. It does make the top coat shiny.  The directions are so small on the bottle you can&#x27;t read them but if you just give a squirt on a cotton ball or the like, you&#x27;re fine. Just rub it over your nails when completely done (dry top coat 3 mins) and the shine will come through!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not perfect. Sometimes it cleans gel color too but not bad. I still like it.</li>
    <li> This product is great and does everything it says it should BUT the ingredient is Isopropyl...AKA..Rubbing Alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t realize this before I bought it, but I decided to try the rubbing alcohol to see if maybe there was something different about this product..and it did the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is designed to 1) Remove the tacky layer 2) Give a shiny finish 3) Evaporate quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both do the same thing effectively. Its a good product and i would give it 5 stars, but I can&#x27;t since its just Rubbing Alcohol and you can buy that at the $1 store!</li>
    <li> All of the Gelish products I&#x27;ve ordered on amazon are what they say they are. They work exactly the same as any product you would buy in sally&#x27;s or any other warehouse type store.</li>
    <li> I just started doing my own nails with the Harmony Gelish products and this is a perfect cleanser for what I need it for. Does the job! Arrived on time, it leaked a little bit with shipping but not too bad.</li>
    <li> for my wife this works very well in cleaning off her nails.</li>
    <li> Thought I would definitely need this as part of my nail arsenal for gels. It&#x27;s ok, not great. I use acetone for same thing. Nice size bottle though.</li>
    <li> This Cleanser works great for cleaning nails before application and taking off the tacky residue at the end. The Gelish system works like a dream for me!</li>
    <li> This is the part that brings it all together if you have a UV-light and Gelish products.  It was the last thing I bought and made the whole thing worthwhile!</li>
    <li> I like this product, sure, but I truly wish they had a better way to ship this out to ya. Each time I have ordered this it arrives slightly empty because it&#x27;s spilled in transit.</li>
    <li> This is great for  removing the sticky residue after applying gelish polish.  Will definitely keep buying and this seller is great.</li>
    <li> Love this entire line.  This is an excellent product for UV gel polish.  There is a large variety of colors.</li>
    <li> This stuff works perfect. I read on other reviews of the gelish nail polish that it was sticky afterwards and not harden and one person said its because you have to use this and sure enough once i was done drying the top coat it still seemed wet and i felt nervous to do this step thinking it would take off the nail polish but not at all it just takes off the sticky stuff that is on the nail for some reason. Works great and should last for a long time since you don&#x27;t need much for each hand.</li>
    <li> This was a repeat purchase. Best product I&#x27;ve found for DIY nails.</li>
    <li> This gel cleanser works as the seller described.  It&#x27;s use is easy and effective.  I used it with other products of the same brand.</li>
    <li> I use the CND Shellac base, and this cleanser.  Works great!  I wasn&#x27;t sure, since I tried the Gelish polish and I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it.  But the cleanser is fine.</li>
    <li> It does its job and that is all you can ask for in a product like this. I hear everyone say rubbing alcohol is cheaper and does the exact same thing. Whether that is true or not I cannot say. I just prefer using the products that were SPECIFICALLY designed to go with the system I am using it with.</li>
    <li> Great size for home use and at a reasonable price. I will definitely reorder this item when needed. I received my order quickly.</li>
    <li> everything is good, but there are some problem on the packing. When i got the item, there are some liquid cover the surface of the bottle.</li>
    <li> Works very well!!  It takes off regular polish immediately and the gelish has to soak off for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> It works great, but 90% alcohol you get from a drug store works just as great.  It&#x27;s so great to be able to do your own nail.  I have been doing my own and friends&#x27; for the last few months.</li>
    <li> I bought Sensationails and their removal product very expensive.  Thought it was worth a try.  Works just fine.  Have only tried it one time so far but so far so good.</li>
    <li> LEAKING................STILL ....;(&lt;br /&gt;WHY IT DOESN&#x27;T HAVE STICKER ON IT?&lt;br /&gt;IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK LIKE NEW ONE.&lt;br /&gt;SAME HAPPEN TO ARTIFICIAL REMOVER.&lt;br /&gt;SAD...</li>
    <li> I ordered this to work with the Haute gel nail polishes.  It work well, clean off the sticky residue and leave the gel nail polish clean and shiny.  I find it work better using a paper towel instead of a cotton ball, no annoying fibers left behind!  Great product and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> the bottle leaks and doesn&#x27;t seal properly,  otherwise works great</li>
    <li> love this cleanser ... totally worth the price... It was shipped very quick..it was just as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> I have been doing my nails for a number of years and this is a good product and does what it says, but, to be perfectly honest, I have recently stopped using this product and just use 91% rubbing alcohol to clean my nails instead.  It works just as well and is much less expensive in my opinion.  No disrespect for this product at all as it works well also.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and is sold at a good price. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beyond amazing! I love using it. It&#x27;s a good size for it only being this cheap. It smells fantastic! Best gel cleanser ever!</li>
    <li> Does what it should do. Shine could be more but with the right gel you dont really need that.</li>
    <li> I like the resalt after clean my nails after</li>
    <li> Love this, but the 99% alcohol is just as good!</li>
    <li> good, they said alcohol is good but I like this better.</li>
    <li> Works good. Make sure you don&#x27;t lay it on its side, it will leak out.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to.  Cleans the nail prior to applying the gel and removes the tackiness from the nail after gel manicure is complete.</li>
