      <li>I generally love Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products, but this???</li>

      <li>This one is more moisturizing than the Tui.  </li>
      <li>It does not work on 4c hair and the company should have stressed that it makes 4c hair drier and more brittle.</li>
      <li>I loved it.. if you&#x27;re looking for a MOISTURIZING deep conditioner then this is pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>I can always count on it to leave my hair healthy and easy to style.</li>
      <li>A positive is It smells good.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has curly wavy hair and wants a good leave in.  </li>
      <li>It has a lot of slip for detangling, makes my hair super soft, and smells great.</li>
      <li>This is a great deep conditioner.</li>

      <li>This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  </li>
      <li>This is a nice product that delivers, although it didn&#x27;t quite deliver as much as I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Loved it, in the process of going natural.  </li>
      <li>it really helps make my hair VERY SMOOTH</li>
      <li>I have very high porosity on the top of my head..</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer and detangler.works wonders in thick  curly hair preventing  frizz.</li>
      <li>After I turned 40, I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t seem to be in as good of shape as it was when I was younger.</li>
      <li>and it absolutely makes the ends softer and more manageable after my hair dries.</li>
      <li>Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils.</li>
      <li>Its best used with other natural or organic conditioners.</li>
      <li>It compares pretty good next to her Monoi hair mask</li>
      <li>and this one is my favorite so far!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the product did not work on its own as a deep conditioner for me.</li>
      <li>I apply this product to the braids or freshly combed hair.  </li>
      <li>Wow, I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>But I will continue to use it as a special treatment on top of my regular products.</li>
      <li>my brother is right.  </li>
      <li>You apply it on clean, wet hair, letit soak and work its magic for 5-7 minutes, and then wash it out.  </li>
      <li>I could tell a difference as soon as I applied it the first time.</li>
      <li>This smoothie does EXACTLY what it says.  </li>
      <li>it made my hair soft and smooth</li>
      <li>my hair was pretty damaged.  </li>
      <li>, I remember when I first started using it my hair stylist was in shock.</li>
      <li>OR if I will be putting my hair in a braid and want some good heavy moisture.  </li>
      <li>I started using it because my regular products (Wen) work great for my hair, but leaves my ends dry.</li>
      <li>I love the creamy texture, rich smell, and instant results of this conditioner and will definitely be asking for another jar for Christmas.</li>
      <li>I will use more if I feel dry</li>
      <li>The nape of my neck is 3c large curls.  </li>
      <li>It is totally worth the price to get a product that 1) conditions to to a soft texture</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really need conditioner even after shampooing.</li>
      <li>This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
      <li>Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter.</li>
      <li>It really nourishes my hair and gives it the moisture that it needs.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the consistency</li>
      <li>I love the way some other products work</li>
      <li>I actually use this as a leave in, I just use like a dime amount and its great and last a long time!  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair so soft and manageable; after the first use, it made my hair much easier to comb through and blow-dry out.  </li>
      <li>My hair was also so much softer and smoother after blow-drying than it normally is.  </li>
      <li>Great product when mixed with other deep conditioners.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the Black Vanilla Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Love it - Black Vanilla Smoothie Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a combination of getting older as well as the chemicals used to color my hair.</li>
      <li>This along with the black vinilla shampoo and hydrating conditioner left my hair feeling very soft and smelling really good.</li>
      <li>so I only use a little dime size along with my hair gel and it offers great soft curls.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this conditioner it is the best</li>
    <li> This product is just alright. I&#x27;m not sure that it has any significant benefits for my hair -- at least compared to other cheaper deep conditioner products. (I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair). A positive is It smells good. Its consistency is a little lighter than the Cholesterol deep hair conditioner. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t but it again.</li>
    <li> I have a natural 4a/b twa. This along with the black vinilla shampoo and hydrating conditioner left my hair feeling very soft and smelling really good. Great product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I am an African American woman with relaxed hair.  I use the smoothie along with the Black Vanilla Shampoo and the leave-in conditioner from this line.  It makes my hair so soft and manageable; after the first use, it made my hair much easier to comb through and blow-dry out.  My hair was also so much softer and smoother after blow-drying than it normally is.  I had less breakage, and my hair was moisturized when normally it is so dry after a wash.  The scent is also really nice!</li>
    <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural curly hair and I don&#x27;t think I could have done it without this conditioner. It has helped make my hair very soft and manageable.  It also helped reduce the breakage I was suffering.  I did notice it is much more effective when used with heat - I use a heat cap and condition for about 15 min - my hair was pretty damaged.  I use it along with the Black Vanilla shampoo.  I wish some of Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s other products shared the fragrance.  Jada&#x27;s duo smelled awful to me- especially the balm,  Maybe I had a bad batch. I&#x27;m still on the look out for finishing products to hold curl and add sheen but my conditioner is covered.  In comparison- The Tui smoothie is not as rich/heavy as this conditioner, also smells good but even sweeter.  I have not tried the Koret Amen yet, but my brother said it smelled like garlic bread to him. More like ocean waves to me. I&#x27;ll be sure to take a poll once I use it and place a review for it, I am waiting for a weekend just incase my brother is right.  I can just have Italian that night if he is, no one will know it&#x27;s my hair conditioner and not the garlic bread that smells so delish.</li>
    <li> I just started using Carol&#x27;s Daughter a month ago.  I have dreads and it makes them softer and lighter.    Love it - Black Vanilla Smoothie Conditioner.  I use it  once a week or every other week.  It  rinses out well and does not weigh my hair down and really makes my dreads  very soft to the touch.  Wow, I love this stuff. It   My hair feels so wonderful.      One issue:  It is way to expensive. I wish they could lower the prices.        I have the following products from her line.    Tui Jojob  &amp; Shea Butter  Rosemary Mind Shampoo  Black Vanilla Smoothie  Loc Butter  Rosemary Mint Conditioner  Lisa Hair Elixir.</li>
    <li> I loved it.. if you&#x27;re looking for a MOISTURIZING deep conditioner then this is pretty awesome. It SOFTENS/ Strengthens/ DE-tangles/ and moisturizes my 3c/4a hair. I have very high porosity on the top of my head.., the hair on the top of my head is drier/ brittle/ dull / weak/ prone to breakage.. and this is the only product that brought it back to life.. Being a product junkie.. I&#x27;ve tried numerous deep conditioners that claimed to &amp;#34;strengthen damaged/ brittle-thin hair&amp;#34;..then I find out that they&#x27;re all a load of bull. THIS however... brought back the &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; into my curls and I will definitely be purchasing again. Oh,, and a little goes a long way. Also.. I find the product to work EXTREMELY well when my hair is soaking wet. It activates the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; in the product and just gives better results. I hope this was helpful &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a deep conditioner for a while and this one is my favorite so far! It has a lot of slip for detangling, makes my hair super soft, and smells great. My hair used to my incredibly dry and this had definitely helped put some moisture back into my hair!</li>
    <li> I really love the Carol&#x27;s Daughter line.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it was for me b/c I thought it was for ethnic type hair, and would leave my hair to oily.  I am white with thick hair that tends to be on the dry and frizzy side.  Since using this product the overall condition of my hair has improved.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this product, but felt that it didnt add anything extra. In fact I had to use an additional conditioner as my hair is dry and  is stubborn to react to conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a great deep conditioner. I can always count on it to leave my hair healthy and easy to style. The smell is wonderful and I love the consistency. It really nourishes my hair and gives it the moisture that it needs. I use about once a week with a plastic cap on. I will never stop buying.</li>
    <li> Smells great but did not make my hair feel any different. I thought this stuff would be creamy but it&#x27;s doughy.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product that delivers, although it didn&#x27;t quite deliver as much as I thought it would. I did however, find that it&#x27;s vital after using a clarifying shampoo that does its job, but makes tangles nearly impossible to comb out without it. I will keep buying it for this purpose.</li>
    <li> Although this product was Smaller than I expected I do think that it is still a good product! Made my hair stronger</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my dry hair without a greasy or heavy feel.  Great for my two strand twists!  WONDERFUL FRAGRANCE!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!  I am mixed and my kids are too.  The girls in my house have a wide range of curl.  My girls wear their hair natural and my curls aren&#x27;t tight enough for a perm.  We all have benefited greatly from Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and this one is our fav.  It is totally worth the price to get a product that 1) conditions to to a soft texture (my hair is loosest of our curls and it isn&#x27;t greasy), 2) We don&#x27;t need a to use a handful of the product to get it to work.  We can do well with a half-dollar-size for a big-ol-head of hair! 3) It doesn&#x27;t make our head itch or flake.  I love the way some other products work but they usually end up making my head itch and give me dandruff...This is almost too good to be true. :)</li>
    <li> Loved it, in the process of going natural.  This is great!!!</li>
    <li> i love it  girls trust me you will love it made my hair soft and smooth i used it today and i am so satisfied with it. thank u carol</li>
    <li> I use this product as a leave in conditioner.  I wear wigs but my natural hair is in plaits.  I apply this product to the braids or freshly combed hair.  This products helps lock in the moisture of the other hair dressing products i use (hair honey/butter). This smells delectable but most of all it works.  Won&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I actually prefer it over the Tui conditioner.  This one is more moisturizing than the Tui.  I can feel the difference while applying the product to her hair.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the hair dry.  Does what it should do!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of different hair care products for the past several months.  Then I finally decided to give Carol&#x27;s Daughter a try.  I absolutely love the Black Vanilla Conditioner.  It does wonders for my hair.  But I was still looking for a deep conditioner.  I would buy other products (Mizani, ORS, etc.) online and in beauty stores, but they dried out my scalp, tangled and/or weighed my hair down heavily.  What a waste of money for products I don&#x27;t plan on using ever again.  I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t try this Black Vanilla Smoothie in the first place!  This smoothie does EXACTLY what it says.  After sitting under the dryer for 15 to 20 minutes, it detangles and makes my hair bouncy, shiny, and moisturized.  Since using this smoothie, I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on how healthy my hair has been looking.  So the search is finally over!  I will continue to use this as my one and only deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> my hair tangles and mattes like a cheap discount weave if I even sneeze the wrong way. This conditioner DETANGLES and is sooo nourishing and moisturizing, I remember when I first started using it my hair stylist was in shock. when I went for my bi-montly trim no split ends at all!  Im a product junkie so I have tried other products drugstore and departmentstore and NOTHING works for me like this product!! LOVE IT!!! and the smell is AMAZING I also used it with the matching leave in conditioner and phyto 9 leave in cream. Most people wont need that combo this alone should do wonders!</li>
    <li> Great product when mixed with other deep conditioners. I used it with As I Am hydration elevation. Its best used with other natural or organic conditioners. Still a wonderful product but sometimes the price may make you turn your head</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It has made my dry, frizzy hair so soft and shiny.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair now</li>
    <li> After I turned 40, I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t seem to be in as good of shape as it was when I was younger. I think it&#x27;s a combination of getting older as well as the chemicals used to color my hair. I&#x27;ve been having problems with dry, brittle ends and hair breakage. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different moisturizers and hair masks and this is the first one that I noticed a big difference. It worked really well on my hair (which is straight and on the thin side). The ends no longer looked brittle and it styled much better after using it. I like that Carol&#x27;s Daughter doesn&#x27;t use parabens and petroleum, plus it has a nice light scent. I used it in conjunction with Organix Moroccan Argan Oil [[ASIN:B007GLZI7G Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Penetrating Oil 1.7 oz. (Pack of 4)]], which I also think is a great product for finishing, shine and heat protection.</li>
    <li> I have 4 sections of different types of hair on my head....frustrating!!!!  The nape of my neck is 3c large curls.  Just above that 4a curls but not tight.  just above that 4c tight curls and in the front tight coils soft and really defined ?!?  This product worked on all of my hair but the 4c portion and left a white caked up residue ( applied to freshly washed hair).  I dont know if my hair didnt absorb it but did not like that look.  Its just not for my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so soft and moisturized this line of products. I have fragile, thin, so-called 4B/C hair that does not like SHEA butter or olive or COCONUT oil very much. I have been natural over 20 years and it has been very difficult for me to find the right products for my hair. I have been a product junkie for about four years and NOTHING seemed to work because natural hair products heavily use SHEA a basis. This product is light on shea (thank goodness).  Well, for the past several months I have used the following regimen: Aloe and water works well daily. Shampoo and deep condition with Carol Daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;Black Vanilla\\&quot; line once a week (co-washing dries my hair). Use a mix of grape seed and sweet almond oils. And, end with twisting the a bit (just a bit) of Avocado Butter. Trust, you do not want to use too much because avocado is an oily butter. Wear a satin scarf at night. So, in essence, I use the liquid, oil, and creme/butter (LOC or LOB) method. My hair is very fragile and dry out easily. This helps and it has helped me retain moisture as much as my hair can.</li>
    <li> This stuff made  my fine hair feel thicker and had more bounce, nice and smooth!  Would definitely buy it again.  It compares pretty good next to her Monoi hair mask</li>
    <li> I tried Carol&#x27;s Daughter for the first time yesterday evening and was very impressed by it. I mixed it with coconut oil and left it in my hair under a shower cap for about 45 to an hour. A peek under the cap showed me hair that was noticeably softer than when I just coconut oil alone. When I got in the shower to wash it out I could run my fingers fully through it. The slip was that good! I didn&#x27;t really need conditioner even after shampooing. Detangling my transitioning hair was a breeze and I was able to bantu knot my hair in less than ten minutes rather than struggling to get my strands through a comb like usual. I love the creamy texture, rich smell, and instant results of this conditioner and will definitely be asking for another jar for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I actually use this as a leave in, I just use like a dime amount and its great and last a long time!  I have curly/wavy hair 2b/2c under the naturally curly website.  If I put too much then my curls are weighted down so I only use a little dime size along with my hair gel and it offers great soft curls.  I will use more if I feel dry OR if I will be putting my hair in a braid and want some good heavy moisture.  There is a lady at work who has 3c/4a hair and she loves it as well as a leave in.  I would recommend it to anyone who has curly wavy hair and wants a good leave in.  Not to mention the ingredients are great and its a cruelty free brand!!</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to it&#x27;s so called reputation.  It does not work on 4c hair and the company should have stressed that it makes 4c hair drier and more brittle.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer and detangler.works wonders in thick  curly hair preventing  frizz. Adds shine and a little will go a long way.</li>
    <li> This product is best when added to a regular conditioner. I massage it into my ends when conditioning my hair with my regular conditioner and it absolutely makes the ends softer and more manageable after my hair dries. I started using it because my regular products (Wen) work great for my hair, but leaves my ends dry. I could tell a difference as soon as I applied it the first time. I would recommend this for anyone who has a conditioner they like but thinks they could use a little boost of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the product did not work on its own as a deep conditioner for me. I agree with the other reviewer that it left my hair feeling dry. Even when it was still in my hair, I could tell nothing good was happening. But I will continue to use it as a special treatment on top of my regular products. It makes them work so much better.</li>
    <li> I have never used a hair smoothie before, but after stopping by Target and reading the few harmful ingredients and benefits of this Carol&#x27;s Daughter product, I decided to give it a try.  This is the best moisturizer I have used yet.  You apply it on clean, wet hair, letit soak and work its magic for 5-7 minutes, and then wash it out.  It leaves my hair soft and feeling nourished.  The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, but simply delicious.  I definitely recommend Black Vanilla Hair Smoothie to anyone with dry, thin, brittle hair or just anyone who loves a great vanilla scent.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like the consistency and it doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would. I thought it would smell a lot sweeter.</li>
    <li> I generally love Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s products, but this??? I just dont know. My hair felt super dry after using it. I know deeply regret not getting the Khoret Amen Smoothie instead.</li>
    <li> it really helps make my hair VERY SMOOTH</li>
    <li> My hair is easier to comb and it smells great</li>
