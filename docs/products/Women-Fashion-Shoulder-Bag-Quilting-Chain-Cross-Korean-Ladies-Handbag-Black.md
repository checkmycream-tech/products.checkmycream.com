<li> It is suprisely soft an itdoes look just like the picture.</li>

<li> Didn&#x27;t have to wait a long time for delivery helped!</li>

<li> The only reason I did not rate 5 stars it is a little sticky.  </li>

<li> Oh,I was so wrong...</li>
<li> The bag came squished;the inner cardboard is wrinkly so the bag has a horrible shape.</li>
<li> It is also shaped unevenly,hence,it looked so weird when you zip it</li>
<li> I rated this product 3 stars because of it&#x27;s very poor quality.</li>
<li> I desperately wanted a Chanel WOC</li>
<li> The material looks like plastic, soo unrealistic, it looks like a toy!</li>
<li> Crap quality.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I sent this back; the seller was nice enough to reimburse me in full without having to return the item.  The one I received was sown together crooked, clasp barely closed, when it did, the purse became misshaped.</li>
    <li> This is just as it is described in the picture and is good quality especially for the price. I would defiantly buy again.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, but nothing to get overly excited about.</li>
    <li> Its ok not a fancy looking. You get what you pay for but its still nice for everyday use! :)</li>
    <li> Its really nice and durable i would make business with them again</li>
    <li> Very stylish, has many compartments, perfect size.  I&#x27;m very finicky about my purses and this was one of a kind perfect for me.  Only issue I have is with the chain portion which can get stuck from time to time but not that big of an issue/problem</li>
    <li> First of all the description does not say if the hardware is gold tone or silver. Well it&#x27;s silver tone... I read the reviews before purchasing this bag, and surprisingly they were good. I can&#x27;t stand returning items so I will just give it to goodwill. I would be too embarrassed to give it to anyone that I know.</li>
    <li> I rated this product 3 stars because of it&#x27;s very poor quality. The faux leather is made of polyester-like textured cloth and the frame of the bag is made of cartoon. It is also shaped unevenly,hence,it looked so weird when you zip it and  close the flap cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a similar bag in amazon but from a different seller and i was so happy with it. That&#x27;s why I ordered this, thinking it will be the same quality. Oh,I was so wrong...&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend this even to my enemies.</li>
    <li> Just pure ugly when I opened the package. Didn&#x27;t even bother to return it. Its no chanel but hey it&#x27;s a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came it was all smashed up. Like somebody just shoved it in with their foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t even get it in it original shape shown in the picture. Just smashed and seemed off proportionate.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping- came on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just go off on a limb on here. If your willing to risk that portion of money go ahead. Win or Lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost on this purchase from amazon but obviously for other buyers they hit off. Judging by their reviews. Good luck. :-)</li>
    <li> I normally carry a very large handbag with a similar look.  I think I finally got tired of carrying such a heavy bag everytime I went out the door and opted for this little bag to lighten the load.  It seems the bigger the purse, the more I cram into it.  This handbag is well worth the low price and I would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive, attractive smaller handbag.  It has more than enough room to carry essentials.

    <li> Nice bag but came slightly damaged (Bent cardboard).  Was a gift not sure if it was returned.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant to write this review because I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to give it 4 or 5 stars. I obviously decicded on 5! I desperately wanted a Chanel WOC but hey, who can afford a $2500 clutch lol. This purse has a similar style, but it&#x27;s no Chanel and does have some minor imperfections but for $14 its very cute and deserves a 5 star :) Would recommend</li>
    <li> It looks ok and works just fine for the price,its comfy and, I like it, its cool. Shipping time was excellent.</li>
    <li> Could have been made better</li>
    <li> Just now got my bag in the mail, and i LOVE IT! It is suprisely soft an itdoes look just like the picture. Im very big about things looking like the picture @ least. It is above what i expected. Very heavy straps. It is too short to do crose body but every thing else is beautiful for the price u cant beat it an i bought the one day shipping and got it in one day. So u get 5 stars from me. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Crap quality. Very cheap looking not at all worth anything. The material is sticky and looks totally tacky. the buckle is not placed properly. Overall A BAD BAG.&lt;br /&gt;And the seller doesn&#x27;t provide with return label. So DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I wouldnt even give it 1 star.</li>
    <li> First of all, the metal buckle is rusted! It looks as though it&#x27;s been overused!! The material looks like plastic, soo unrealistic, it looks like a toy! The bag came squished;the inner cardboard is wrinkly so the bag has a horrible shape. It&#x27;s nothing like what is advertised, so I&#x27;m returning it and demanding my money back. It is cheap, yes, but $17 bags have waay better quality than this. I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> nice for the  ladies my wife is okey with it</li>
    <li> This purse is well made and is still lasting me!!  I will definitely buy from again!!  Has a beautiful look and feel and I get compliments all the time!!</li>
