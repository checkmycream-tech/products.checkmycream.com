      <li>It came in nicely wrapped and they even added extra padding in the box</li>
      <li>I use this product for my clients, and I must say, the dehydrant offers a better bonding when working with acrylics.</li>

      <li>The bottle is glass, and it&#x27;s pretty big!</li>
      <li>the product came earlier than expected and it works very well for me, and it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful odor like i thought it would have.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t offensive, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is incredibly sensitive.)</li>
      <li>Works great, wide base bottle doesn&#x27;t tip easily.</li>
