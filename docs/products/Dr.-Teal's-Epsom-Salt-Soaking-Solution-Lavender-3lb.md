<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> pleased with delivery timing and product quality, no issues at all.</li>
    <li> I love using Dr. Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution...I relaxes me after a long day standing at work...the only downside is the scent is very strong! I received this product free in exchange for my review!</li>
    <li> I soak in my bath every day with this soaking solution. It relaxes me .</li>
    <li> They always get here quick and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> If you want to relax in a hot bath, this stuff is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Soak in a tub or make a scrub and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Walgreen&#x27;s 5.00-6.00 a bag,sometimes it is on sale....This is to much money...</li>
    <li> We have several athletes in our family and find that bath oaks in salts really help to alieve muscle aches. We also add hydrogen peroxide to aid in toxin withdrawal (dietary, lactic acid, etc.). Helps to throw in some baking soda, too, if you have hard or well water.&lt;br /&gt;I find the lavender scent to be really deliscious smelling. My boys haven&#x27;t complained about it &amp; the scent doesn&#x27;t linger on their skin (at least that I can tell). It does stay in the bathroom for a while but I love it.</li>
    <li> These bath salts are wonderful. I&#x27;m a shower person and only take baths when I&#x27;m super stressed or have body aches. The lavender is so calming and soothing that I find myself taking soaking baths more frequently.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I hundred per cent  recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the Epsom salt soaking solution.  The sleep and relaxation effects of lavender are an additional plus.  Can&#x27;t keep it on the shelves.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a dear friend and i was thrilled to find it here. It is wonderful on my sleepless night of pain and insomnia. I love it and it works!!</li>
    <li> This salt smells wonderful and the resealing bag makes for very convenient storage.</li>
    <li> My massage therapist suggested Epsom salt soaks for my frozen shoulder and it has helped so much. The re sealable bag is very convenient and it easily dissolves for a great pain relieving soak.</li>
    <li> Great item and smells terrific. This item is much cheaper if you buy it locally at a bed bath and beyond or someplace like that.  I needed it in a hurry to fill mason jars for baby shower gifts and bought a few other things to get free shipping. Anyway great item but expensive on here.</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. I bought two bags and gave one away for christmas and decided to keep one for myself. I must say I am glad I kept one for myself. I am definitely planning on repurchasing when I run out. I don&#x27;t use it for bath but instead I soak my feet in a bucket with some of the product and warm water. I plan on soaking my feet for 10 mins and end up staying 30 mins. It is very relaxing and soothes my feel well. I would recommend this to everyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. lavender is awesome ;)</li>
    <li> These bath salts are amazing. The scent is similar to lavender and rosemary? or some type of mint? I take regular baths and really enjoy relaxing in this</li>
    <li> Wow. Epsom salt AND lavender?! Talk about relaxing. This smelled strong (in a good way), allowing for a spa-like transformation to my bathroom. Light some candles and violá.  I do think it&#x27;s a bit expensive though. I&#x27;ve since purchased regular Dr. Teal Epsom salt and added in my own lavender essential oil.</li>
    <li> I received it in a timely manner and love the products.</li>
    <li> A product to live by. That little bit of luxury that makes it all worthwhile.Lavender to relax, epsom salts for your aches and pains.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely effective for sore and achy muscles. It help relaxes you and provides you a long, deep sleep. I now live by this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I use Dr Teal&#x27;s Epsom salts all the time. I love the fragrances they offer, and they are the best smelling Epsom salts I&#x27;ve come across. I like the lavender smell because it is relaxing, and I love the aromatherapy aspect of it. I have several chronic pain conditions so I take hot soaky Epsom salt baths often. It is a nice way to relax your body and muscles when you are sore, in pain, and just need a little escape. I also experience neuropathy, tingling in the body, especially at night, so when that happens I like to take a hot soaky Epsom salt bath. It seems to help most of the time. I agree with another reviewer in that ordering these online can be very expensive. I only ordered online because as a chronic pain sufferer, sometimes it&#x27;s hard for me to leave the house, so I love ordering on Amazon, which makes everything so easy. But if you are able to leave the house to go shopping, it may be preferable to buy these at a store in person to save money. Overall, I enjoy my Dr Teals Epsom salts, and I foresee using them for the long-haul. It&#x27;s a good product with wonderful scents. Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful.</li>
    <li> This is such a great relaxing way to end the day.... the smell is so relaxing!! I will buy it again...and again and again</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to try the Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt in Lavender, provided free by Smiley360.com.  I am on my feet with my daughter who is a toddler and I also teach dance at night.  Needless to say, there are days that I need a bit of TLC for my feet and mind.  The calming scent is wonderful before bed and the Epsom salts really help to rejuvenate my aching arches and feet.  I have tried store brand Epsom salts prior to trying Dr. Teals at no cost, and I definitely plan on purchasing this one after my sample has run out. I highly recommend this brand of Epsom Salts.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute rip off. This high prices online are shameful, I wanted to try these new scents but there is nothing special about this product- all it is EPSOM SALTS with a hint of a scent. Avoid purchasing and buy regular Epsom salts and scent with essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great.  i don&#x27;t find it in Mexico and I have sensitive foot nails, often swelling and hurting.  I put a spoon or two in hot water and put my feet inside.  About 20 minutes later or when the water is getting cold, I take them out.  My feet feel great, no more swelling, ready to walk again or go to bed.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Teal&#x27;s Epsom Salt Soaking Solution, Lavender soothe and sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased additional ones after trying it for family and friends.  There&lt;br /&gt;are different fragrances, but the lavender in my opinion is the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like it, the smell is really strong, though. I think next time I will buy an essential oil and use regular epsom salt. If you don&#x27;t mind a strong smell, then it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. The lavender scent isn&#x27;t too overwhelming like other products. It&#x27;s genuinely my favorite bath salt to use! I received this product for free, but I will definitely be purchasing it when I run out!</li>
    <li> Warning: THIS PRODUCT HAS A VERY STRONG SCENT!  It does not list the oil used, but I think it uses Lavendin rather than lavender.  If you are looking for gentle lavender this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  I love all of their scented salts, and use them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, be sure and price check.  The MSRP on this item is $5.99 and it is available locally for under $5.00/bag.  Shipping makes ordering bath salts online cost prohibitive, but other sites that offer free shipping with minimum purchase (such as Walmart) have Dr. Teals at or below MSRP.  The price on Amazon varies wildly since it is sold through so many marketplace sellers, but generally the prices are pretty high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bath salts can be so expensive, even at double MSRP this one is pretty reasonable but Epsom salts are cheap, and this is really just Epsom salt and fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t have expensive essential oils or moisturizers.  As an alternative, you can buy Epsom salt in bulk (any drug store, around $1/lb) and add lavender essential oil directly to your bath water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epsom salt is a fabulous treatment for muscle spasm.  Magnesium increases blood flow and blocks calcium channel signals.  As a chronic pain sufferer, it is part of my regular pain control regimen.</li>
    <li> Love the products, but the bags aren&#x27;t as large as i expected.</li>
    <li> When Smiley360 recently gave me the chance to try Dr.Teal&#x27;s Lavender Epsom Salt Soaking Solution for free in exchange for my review, I was interested as I have heard many good things about Epsom salt yet never gotten around to trying it. I was a little put off at first as lavender isn&#x27;t exactly one of my favorite smells, but I was pleasantly surprised by the crisp, refreshing smell once I opened the bag. It smells really clean and not the potpourri lavender scent i was expecting! I&#x27;m on my feet ALL DAY so i get terrible pains, when I finally forced myself to take a break to let them soak I felt relief right away! It almost felt like it eased the pressure immediately I had been feeling! I also am really excited to try it as a facial exfoliant and to help ease the sting of any sunburns I get, two cool facts I didn&#x27;t know! Id definitely recommend giving this product a shot, its such a valuable resource with so many different uses!</li>
    <li> Im in love with this stuff!  Smells great and is so relaxing to take a bath with.</li>
    <li> My favorite calming, soothing before bed soak!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Enjoy</li>
    <li> Great product. Will buy again.:-))</li>

I only ordered online because as a chronic pain sufferer, sometimes it&#x27;s hard for me to leave the house, so I love ordering on Amazon, which makes everything so easy. But if you look around the Amazon site you can find it at the regular store prices.  Overall, I enjoy my Dr Teals Epsom salts, and I foresee using them for the long-haul. It&#x27;s a good product with wonderful scents.</li>
    <li> I was sent Dr. Teals Epson Salt Soaking Solution free from Smiley360 as one of my missions.  In exchange for sending me the product for free I am to give my honest opinion and share that opinion with others.  I used my Dr. Teal&#x27;s the very night that I received it in the mail.  I was hurting and just feeling yucky.  I ran a very warm bath and poured in my Dr. Teals.  I scent is wonderful and so relaxing.  I sat in the bath for close to half an hour.  When I got out I was so relaxed, my skin was so soft and I felt so much better than when I got in.  And I slept better that night than I have in a long time.  I love my Dr. Teal&#x27;s now and will not let myself run out.  I have even given a couple bags as gifts since getting my trial.  And I plan to give a few more for Christmas.  I am thinking it would be great to give my children&#x27;s teachers along with a little something else. Thanks Smiley360 and Dr. Teal&#x27;s...I am a very happy consumer.</li>
