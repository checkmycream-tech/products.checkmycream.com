      <li>Love this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does not work as well and does not foam up the way the original formula did!</li>
      <li>I buy this for my mom, and she has always been thrilled with the product and says that it is one product that does exactly what it claims!</li>

      <li>It is an ok product but it comes out of the can and almost evaporates into a sticky liquid right away.</li>
      <li>Not at all like the original Flocker.  </li>
      <li>It is worth it!</li>
      <li>I KEEP IT ON HAND FOR QUICK FIXES.</li>
      <li>I have tried many many products claiming to plump thinner/fine hair and this is one line that actually does it.</li>
      <li>Really volumizes your hair and makes it easy to style-great product.</li>
      <li>not as good as expected..</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it is supposed.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, very thinning hair with a tiny bit of curl.  </li>
      <li>This was the first time I have tried this product, and it did not work for my hair which is long, straight, and fine.</li>
      <li>I USE IT FOR A FAST HAIR STYLE.</li>
      <li>I found that this product was very drying to my hair.</li>
      <li>It had some body to it when you added it to your hair and made your hair very manageable and piece y.</li>
      <li>I purchased several cans of this product a couple of years ago and it was fantastic.  </li>
      <li>This new one, that I just received, is very watery, no matter how much you shake it and just makes your hair more wet than anything.  </li>
      <li>I had to throw the whole new bottle away!</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product to style hair.</li>
      <li>I have really, fine hair, especially at the back of my head...</li>
      <li>GIVES ME A GOOD AMOUNT OF VOLUME TO MY THIN SOFT HAIR.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair looks fuller and soft.</li>
      <li>Was surprised this was shipped in bubble envelope considering contents are pressurized.</li>
      <li>it gives you second day hair styling ability, really plumps up the volume of your hair.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Always keeps my hair full and keeps the style in ; whether used dry or wet.&lt;br /&gt;Greatest part is that it can be used on dry hair and it works.</li>
      <li>I thought this was something new but the same stuff with a diffrent package I used years ago.</li>
      <li>I let two other people use it &amp; it did absolutely nothing for them either.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine, and frizy, adding the flocker either wet or dry left it limp and lifeless.  </li>

    <li> Have been using this product for over five years now...it never disappoints.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky...it just helps hold a style longer.  You can even re-wet and blow it and it will work every time.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> it gives you second day hair styling ability, really plumps up the volume of your hair. Works like a hair spray, just spray it in and fluff. I use it on dry hair, never tried it on wet hair.</li>

    <li> LOVE all of Nick Chavez Beverly Hills Flocker!  Product works well with my short haircut.  Recommend the root lifter also.</li>
    <li> Did not work right....was defective...but got money refunded so was glad for that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Was surprised this was shipped in bubble envelope considering contents are pressurized. The can had few dents in it so it looked like it came from damaged discount outet. It was christmas gift so didn&#x27;t like how it appeared. Not sure would purchase from same seller. It should have been shipped in box, have ordered item in past from different seller and was in a box.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I love it.  It makes my hair looks fuller and soft.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why the formula changed, but it&#x27;s not the same. I have three cans that are gathering dust</li>
    <li> No it didn&#x27;t work for me. They make it look easy on TV but it surely didn&#x27;t do  the job.It was expensive to not work for me. It may work for you.</li>
    <li> GIVES ME A GOOD AMOUNT OF VOLUME TO MY THIN SOFT HAIR. I USE IT FOR A FAST HAIR STYLE. I JUST RUB AND SQUEEZEIT INTO MY HAIR AND SCALP AND I ARRANGE ME A NEAT HAIRDO. I KEEP IT ON HAND FOR QUICK FIXES.</li>
    <li> I have tried many many products claiming to plump thinner/fine hair and this is one line that actually does it. while not perfection, it does make a huge difference. My hairdresser even commented on my hair seems thicker. I use the shampoo and conditioner as well. the combination is great for me. Try Nick&#x27;s products and see what a difference it will make.&lt;br /&gt;Caveat - Not being the \\&quot;hair diva\\&quot; many women are, my styling abilities are limited - this product helps my \\&quot;do\\&quot; look so much better and fluffier!  it works for me.</li>
    <li> Great Product!  It was just  as described.  Loved the price they offered!  Would highly recommend this product to style hair.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Nick Chavez&#x27;s Flocker to me.  It works great on her curly hair.  My hair is fine, and frizy, adding the flocker either wet or dry left it limp and lifeless.  A good product for some, but not for all.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!  One of the best hair products out there for volumizing.  I never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mom, and she has always been thrilled with the product and says that it is one product that does exactly what it claims! Based on her being pleased I would recommend it and will keep buying it!</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!!! great for thinner hair- keeps its shape. Will never buy another!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It makes my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does exactly what it is supposed. If you want volume to your hair, this is the product for you! So happy with this product. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  If my hair is unruly,  I just spray some on my hands and presto hair behaves and looks much better.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the product works as claimed. I used it and just didn&#x27;t get the results I expected.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I found that this product was very drying to my hair. Perhaps the jar vers;ion would be better for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased several cans of this product a couple of years ago and it was fantastic.  It had some body to it when you added it to your hair and made your hair very manageable and piece y. This new one, that I just received, is very watery, no matter how much you shake it and just makes your hair more wet than anything.  The design on the can changed and so did the product. Not at all like the original Flocker.  Please make the original formula again, I have used it and loved it for years...now I am not sure what product I will use in the future.</li>
    <li> Not sure where this came from, it was a terrible product. Dispensed like water into my palm, couldn&#x27;t even use. Couldn&#x27;t send it back so it was a wasted purchase.</li>
    <li> I thought this was something new but the same stuff with a diffrent package I used years ago.Made my hair very dry.</li>
    <li> Big letdown!!! All it did to my hair was make it wet!! I let two other people use it &amp; it did absolutely nothing for them either. I want my money back!</li>
    <li> I recently went to Florida and mistakenly put my Flocker in my carry on and they confiscated it!!! I had to throw the whole new bottle away! So now I am re ordering!  It holds my hair in place and is not greasy or oily.  I have a short hair cut and it works great to keep it looking stylish.</li>
    <li> It is an ok product but it comes out of the can and almost evaporates into a sticky liquid right away.</li>
