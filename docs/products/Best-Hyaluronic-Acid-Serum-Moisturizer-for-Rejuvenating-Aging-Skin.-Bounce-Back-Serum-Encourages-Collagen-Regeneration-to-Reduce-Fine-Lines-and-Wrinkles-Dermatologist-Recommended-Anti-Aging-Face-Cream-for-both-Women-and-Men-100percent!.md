      <li>so much more all in an effort to see results.</li>
      <li>I use serums on top of acne preventative, then night cream or day moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
      <li>would order more</li>
      <li>And I like you can remove the top when you get to the end (when the pump doesn&#x27;t put out the product)</li>
      <li>and I am trying to keep from having my aging lines be so prominent.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it is a serum.  </li>
      <li>I also have allergies to most all scents.  </li>
      <li>This is very light weight and absorbs into your skin easily with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
      <li>If feels very clean and light , but definitely one of the best anti-aging / rejuvenating serum I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

      <li>but you can feel the difference when you use it the first time.</li>
      <li>I was a little worried about buying this without being able to see it and smell it first, but I worried for nothing!!</li>
      <li>I then received a phone call from the company trying to persuade me to leave positive reviews even after I explained my reaction.  </li>
      <li>This product is really smooth and it lasts for many days though the quantity is small.</li>
      <li>i am prone to breaking out, and this serum really hydrates my face.</li>

      <li>This product has really lived up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for helping relieve some of my stress.</li>
      <li>I then received a call from the owner of the company and she was very upset about my experience.</li>

      <li>This product did tighten my skin, and there was a plumping and overall positive effect after using for awhile.</li>
      <li>Really helps with dry very skin.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft yet firmer.</li>

      <li>I learned my lesson and in the future will be extra cautious when buying a new product.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s not available right now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the way it tightens my skin.  I use morning and evening</li>
    <li> Cannot use this product. Burned my face.</li>
    <li> I was surprised and pleased.Really helps with dry very skin. Even in Florida, indoor air is very dry.This winter has been awful!</li>
    <li> I purchased all 4 products in this line and after using this and my acne medication I had a horrible reaction on my face.  I then received a phone call from the company trying to persuade me to leave positive reviews even after I explained my reaction.  I was very upset and left a horrible review. I then received a call from the owner of the company and she was very upset about my experience. She has worked and has since worked with me to find the problem and other options on products that will work for me.&lt;br /&gt; I have found out that my reaction was to a formulation change in my acne medication.  I am so impressed that there is company that cares so much about customers and is willing to go above and beyond what they have to. I have been using the product now for 2 weeks and have started to see results.  Ingredients are higher quality and natural and the products work well together, great skin care line and I am impressed. I have used many higher end skin care items before and these have far exceeded at a lower price.</li>
    <li> This product has really lived up to my expectations. I have seen a big difference in the quality of my skin . My friends have asked me if I am back from vacation because I look very &amp;#34; fresh&amp;#34;. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and from now on.</li>
    <li> Product did not do what they said it would do!! I used it faithfully  as directed. Complete waste of money!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Resilient Beauty serum for about three weeks now and am very satisfied with the results. My skin feels smoother and firmer already.</li>
    <li> I feel like it is helping and I love that it is a serum.  After I apply it I can feel my face tightening.</li>
    <li> This product is really smooth and it lasts for many days though the quantity is small. I have been using this for only a few weeks and I am noticing less sagging. I like the way my skin is now. I apply a very small quantity of the cream and then I follow it up with the moisturizer. This gives an added softness to my skin and I am happy as the wrinkles are fading away.</li>
    <li> I was negligent with my skincare the past year, and developed deep furrows between my eyebrows. i am prone to breaking out, and this serum really hydrates my face. I use it during the day under sunscreen and light makeup. After 3 days, I noticed my furrows were getting shallower. It&#x27;s 2 weeks now, and the difference is noticeable. My skin feels wonderful. I don&#x27;t worry about skin breakout, and a little goes a long way. I let it dry on my skin before I apply make up and sunscreen. A friend who rarely compliments me, asked me what I was doing to make my face look better and said I look 10 years younger, especially around the eyes. Great stuff. would order more but it&#x27;s not available right now.</li>
    <li> I wear this product daily but have not seen what it does. It is very gummy and hard to say what it does t the skin. Still waiting for final review.</li>
    <li> Product does not work. Leaves skin dried out and looking worse.&lt;br /&gt;I usually do not write reviews, but this product&lt;br /&gt;is just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with this serum!  If feels very clean and light , but definitely one of the best anti-aging / rejuvenating serum I&#x27;ve ever used! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Been using this over a month and I do not see any changes and I definitely will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend that you buy this.  I am so happy with this.  I have only been using it for two weeks now but you can feel the difference when you use it the first time. It makes my skin feel so soft yet firmer. I have been using it on my chin and neck also. I am 52 and I am trying to keep from having my aging lines be so prominent.  I have always used Oil of Olay products but the Resilient Beauty leaves my skin feeling less greasy and less prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and have difficulty using most products.  I also have allergies to most all scents.  So almost everything for me needs to be unscented. I was a little worried about buying this without being able to see it and smell it first, but I worried for nothing!! This product has the most beautiful fresh scent and it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin or other allergies.  My husband keeps telling me I smell so good all the time now and it&#x27;s the Resilient Beauty that he is smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more when this runs out and after I have used it a little longer I will write a new review letting ya&#x27;ll know how much I still love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a week I have not seen any result and the present time.  It is moisturizer but I don&#x27;tfeel it Make your face stiff when you put it on There should be larger print direction in the packaging on on the vial  You need a magnifing glass to see the writing on the tube</li>
    <li> I have dozen of facial cream, anti aging products, and so much more all in an effort to see results. I rarely write reviews, but I felt this product was worth mentioning. It actually works!! I look like a baby face with this stuff. It is amazing how quickly I saw results too. Thank you so much for helping relieve some of my stress.</li>
    <li> Notice a huge improvement in my skin</li>
    <li> I was disappointed and this product is definitely not worth the money spent.  I learned my lesson and in the future will be extra cautious when buying a new product.  It comes out like water and not the usual feeling of a quality serum.</li>
    <li> This product did tighten my skin, and there was a plumping and overall positive effect after using for awhile.</li>
    <li> Finally a serum that doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I use serums on top of acne preventative, then night cream or day moisturizer on top of it.  Had a hard time finding one that didn&#x27;t cause break- outs (and I&#x27;m no teenager).  This one is great.  And I like you can remove the top when you get to the end (when the pump doesn&#x27;t put out the product) so you can get all of the serum out of the bottle.  This is very light weight and absorbs into your skin easily with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
