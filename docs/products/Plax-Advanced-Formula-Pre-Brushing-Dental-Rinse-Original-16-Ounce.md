      <li>It is the original flavor, unopened, and ready for use.  </li>
      <li>well this is just hard core proof that it doesnt do anything but damage your gums    use baking soda and salt water as a pre brush rinse more effective</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this product after so many tries with other vendors.  </li>
      <li>Been using it consistently for like 2 weeks.</li>

      <li>plaque fast</li>
      <li>ALL the tartar was COMPLETELY gone!!!  </li>
      <li>But glad other people are seeing results.</li>
      <li>my tartar was like concrete, there was NO scraping it off.  </li>
      <li>My daughter dislikes the flavor so much I can&#x27;t get it anywhere near here.</li>
      <li>This did really help my plaque to clear out.</li>
      <li>Since their prices were much lower than Plax even though the ingredients were exactly the same, I believe that lowered sales for Plax.</li>
      <li>The taste is fine just like any other mouthwash.</li>
      <li>Long live PLAX!!!!</li>
      <li>It is fine except that I would rather have a bigger one, but you don&#x27;t seem to have that bigger one in your store.</li>
      <li>For some reason, this product, in Cinnamon, has either been discontinued and the other flavor available doesn&#x27;t suit me.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find original flavor PLAX at local stores and this is the only way I can get it.</li>
      <li>There are other flavors, but I prefer the original.</li>
      <li>only hope that the private label versions have sold well enough so that those products will continue to be available for us when Plax completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>he Soft Mint is $9.32.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it took</li>
      <li>I was told by local merchants that they don&#x27;t carry the original (red) PLAX because of supposed allergic reactions in some people from the red dye.</li>
      <li>The original I paid 25.00 dollars for that small bottle which ws a ripoff.  </li>
      <li>I will re re-ordering soon, and hope to have the same luck before it&#x27;s gone completely.  </li>
      <li>it is honestly just expensive mouth wash.</li>

<li> Just so you know, Johnson &amp; Johnson stopped manufacturing this product in BOTH flavors a long time ago.</li>
<li> It got to the point where I tried keeping the bottle in a ziploc bag and even despite that it was routinely leaving red marks on bathroom counters, sinks, and anything in its sight.</li>
<li> I have used the red Plax for a couple of decades, and don&#x27;t like to start or end my day with any other mouth wash.</li>

<li> I ordere this product for myself due to the fact I cannot buy this flavor locally.  </li>

<li> My son teeth was all black and stuck something between his teeth.</li>
<li> It slowly cleans the teeth and when you go to the dentisit it reduces the time spent there during a cleaning.  </li>
<li> I used to buy half a dozen bottles when I went &amp;#34;back home&amp;#34; up north!  </li>
<li> My teeth felt like they had a film on them even though I was brushing as usual and using the \\&quot;green flavored\\&quot; mouthwash.  </li>
<li> and i could see very little difference in the reduction of tartar    as plaque hardens it turns into tartar once you remove</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Why is the price for the original Plax, 16oz size $18.99, and the price of the 16oz size int he Soft Mint is $9.32. Just wondering why the prices are so different for the same size. Both sizes are overpriced.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years. It helps keep the plaque down for me. This is not a mouthwash.</li>
    <li> i am done with 2 bottles already and i could see very little difference in the reduction of tartar    as plaque hardens it turns into tartar once you remove the surrounding plaque tartar becomes loose and simply falls off    yes well this is just hard core proof that it doesnt do anything but damage your gums    use baking soda and salt water as a pre brush rinse more effective</li>
    <li> This mouth wash works wonders! I just love it.</li>
    <li> Very good. I can&#x27;t find original flavor PLAX at local stores and this is the only way I can get it. I was told by local merchants that they don&#x27;t carry the original (red) PLAX because of supposed allergic reactions in some people from the red dye. It never bothered me in over 20 years of daily use. I hope they continue making the original flavor PLAX.</li>
    <li> Not seeing any results. Been using it consistently for like 2 weeks. It also tastes as if it were watered down? Like only half the bottle was Plax and the other half being added water. I don&#x27;t even taste a cinnamon flavor. But glad other people are seeing results. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> It has been the most effective mouth wash helping to keep plaque at a minimum.  I have using it for years!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great rinse. The original I paid 25.00 dollars for that small bottle which ws a ripoff.  The mint is just as good and it ws cheaper and the bottle ws much larger.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, it works great.  It slowly cleans the teeth and when you go to the dentisit it reduces the time spent there during a cleaning.  It doesn&#x27;t take the place of the dentist but it sure helps between visits.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m buying it for the second time. Tried expensive whitening mouthwashes - only makes my teeth hurt and sensitive. Plax works great. With time it erases the black stripe on my teeth. It absolutely works. Perhaps not for all, but for me YES!</li>
    <li> I ordered this out of desperation quite frankly.  I have not been to the dentist in 8 years since we o not have dental insurance and my kids take priority over me going on schedule every six months.  As a result I had built up bad tartar on the back of my four lower front teeth.  I saw some YouTube video where a girl swore by this stuff.  So I gave it a shot.  Now, just so you know...my tartar was like concrete, there was NO scraping it off.  I started using this twice a day along with EcoDent tooth powder instead of toothpaste.  Within to weeks ALL the tartar was COMPLETELY gone!!!  Unreal!  My mouth has never felt so clean.  I do floss morning and night with those Glide flosses as well.  So I am ordering more of this stuff.  I would have been embarrassed to go o the dentist before, now I will be proud!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product, it works really well in removing plaque...definitely recommend buying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;removes plaque fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;removes plaque fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;removes plaque fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Plax ever since it came out and I just love it! My teeth feel really clean &amp; I don&#x27;t have to brush so hard and risk damaging the enamel or gums. There are other flavors, but I prefer the original. I use Plax before I brush and Listerine after and haven&#x27;t had a cavity in over 7 years (it&#x27;s been so long, that I don&#x27;t remember!).</li>
    <li> It is puzzling that local stores have not carried this for years. Thank goodness for online suppliers. I have used the red Plax for a couple of decades, and don&#x27;t like to start or end my day with any other mouth wash. I always brush my teeth afterward, so I am not relying on the mouth wash alone to keep my teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a great prewash mouthwash.  It really does work well at reducing or eliminating plaque build up.  It is also great tasting.  I have used this for years.  Amazon is about the only place I can find it still.  It is getting harder and harder.  This is a shame because it is such a good product.</li>
    <li> Could not find this product anywhere but here.  It is the original flavor, unopened, and ready for use.  Great.</li>
    <li> I used to buy half a dozen bottles when I went &amp;#34;back home&amp;#34; up north!  Then I would run out and found I could order it on Amazon but not sure about that now.  My dentist ask me to use it and it works wonders.  I always get an A when I got get my teeth cleaned.</li>
    <li> Too sad it is discontinued in stores. This did really help my plaque to clear out. My dentist was amazed. Will always buy it again. Long live PLAX!!!!</li>
    <li> this is no fault of its own, but for those of you purchasing this to remove calculus don&#x27;t bother. it won&#x27;t work. it is honestly just expensive mouth wash. just get over your fears, go to the dentist and get the stuff removed.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Just brush your teeth with baking soda and hydrogen peroxide while using this</li>
    <li> YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING.....I thought that this was more than one bottle, more like 4 bottles like the last time I ordered it.  $25 for ONE BOTTLE is robbery and I will be sending it back for a refund!!!!</li>
    <li> I have some plaque that I am not so proud off, so I heard about this product on youtube and decided to give it a try. The taste is fine just like any other mouthwash. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it took but one day I was flossing my teeth and a small chunk of plaque came off YAY!!! I was so happy to see that result unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been using plax very regularly as I should (I use Biotene now) but I am 100% positive that if I had kept using it since I purchased it, I would be plaque free by now! I was gonna give it four stars because it took a while for me to see results however I will give it 5 stars because you just can&#x27;t expect quick results...patience is virtue :)</li>
    <li> Waste of money, unfortunately!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using cinnamon flavored Plax since it came out, many years ago.  Now, Amazon is the only place I can find it.  I really noticed how much it works for me when I was in the hospital and wasn&#x27;t able to use it.  My teeth felt like they had a film on them even though I was brushing as usual and using the \\&quot;green flavored\\&quot; mouthwash.  Flossing, too (of course).  I was so happy to get back to using Plax again.  I really like the cinnamon flavor... it&#x27;s so refreshing!!</li>
    <li> I ordere this product for myself due to the fact I cannot buy this flavor locally.  It seems silly to have to order it but it is the flavor I like so this is my only choice.</li>
    <li> My daughter dislikes the flavor so much I can&#x27;t get it anywhere near here. It would be great if it were more mild and had a better flavor.</li>
    <li> Works well.  The newere version sucks in terms of taste.  Companies should learn not to fix what isn&#x27;t broken, but i doubt that that will happen!</li>
    <li> I have been searching everywhere for the original formula. Was glad I found it here. The price is a little to high tho :(</li>
    <li> I also got something to wash out my mouth with--Plax Dental Rinse. It is fine except that I would rather have a bigger one, but you don&#x27;t seem to have that bigger one in your store.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, like it and am grateful to be able to get it through Amazon as I can no longer buy it in NYC retail stores.</li>
    <li> need something strong to keep the gums clean works good recommend for 50 plus as it really helps so you dont loose your teeth</li>
    <li> Just so you know, Johnson &amp; Johnson stopped manufacturing this product in BOTH flavors a long time ago. I called the company to confirm. They no longer have any stock. That&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t find it locally. What we are purchasing here on Amazon is the last of the stock that independent sellers have in their warehouses and that&#x27;s the last of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They said they stopped production because the product didn&#x27;t sell. I believe there were two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Some of the reviewers here on Amazon shared dental studies that supposedly \\&quot;proved\\&quot; the dental rinse had no benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Many supermarkets and drugstores have sold their own private label versions of this product. Since their prices were much lower than Plax even though the ingredients were exactly the same, I believe that lowered sales for Plax. I was just as happy with the private label versions myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I believe it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, despite those studies/reports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only hope that the private label versions have sold well enough so that those products will continue to be available for us when Plax completely disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I can tell how this is an effective mouthwash/plaque fighting rise, however I would not recommend it. It contains a serious red dye of which a) I feel uncomfortable exposing myself to and b) is so potent it stains EVERYTHING. It got to the point where I tried keeping the bottle in a ziploc bag and even despite that it was routinely leaving red marks on bathroom counters, sinks, and anything in its sight. I discarded the bottle halfway through and am going to pursue a different mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Seems to really whiten teeth.</li>
    <li> I like this product, it works 100%. The red color is the best, and it is the original. My son teeth was all black and stuck something between his teeth. We went to the dentist 3 times, they couldn&#x27;t clean his teeth. But with this product, his teeth is amazing, sometimes I can&#x27;t believe it that $10.99  product works more than a couples of hundred dollars. This really works for all my family. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth. I love it. I will spend many years before going to the dentist. I don&#x27;t give a feedback but  this product I will be guilty if I don&#x27;t tell the truth. I hope they will keep on the market</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product after so many tries with other vendors.  It was shipped quickly and packed well and I am thrilled.  For some reason, this product, in Cinnamon, has either been discontinued and the other flavor available doesn&#x27;t suit me.  I will re re-ordering soon, and hope to have the same luck before it&#x27;s gone completely.  THANKS&#x27;THANKS&#x27;THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It really really works! Enough said. I used it 3 times a day and I did see results after 1 week.</li>
