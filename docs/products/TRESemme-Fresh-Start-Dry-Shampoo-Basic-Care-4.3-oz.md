      <li>Not irritating.</li>
      <li>I think not using too much product helps, too.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind it too much</li>

      <li>My hair looked clean, but I felt gross.</li>

      <li>This is my first dry shampoo experience, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect of a &amp;#34;good one&amp;#34; but here it goes...</li>

      <li>It was a weird dichotomy, and I couldn’t decide if I liked the product or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to go an extra day with out washing my hair, but it just felt heavy and not really clean....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos (busy life, no time for a shower).</li>
      <li>Does absolutely nothing to make my hair look less greasy.</li>

    <li> I had a few minutes to make myself presentable (with needing a head wash) for a visit. I followed the label directions on my volumizing dry shampoo and was very pleased. The stringy hair was gone and replaced with cleaner looking hair with volume. There was a fullness that was not there before. This is a temporary fix. It does not remove the need for shampooing, but it is a life saver in a tight situation.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a bad hair day!</li>
    <li> I love this dry shampoo! Even though it is more expensive that other ones out there, this is the only dry one that I have purchased that doesn&#x27;t feel like I sprayed my hair with hairspray!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it promises what no white residue</li>
    <li> We have been using this product in our house for years, and I am glad to find it on Amazon.com.  I like that it has clay as the main ingredient for drying the oil and the citrus smell is pleasant.  It does not have a chemical smell to me.  It is amazing how clean the hair appears and manageable.  We use it in between shampoos.  It does seem to add volume to my hair.  My daughter loves it, and she is a tween.  You simply spray it on your scalp in short bursts and then comb it through.  It does not work well if you just spray it on like you would a hairspray.  But, spray it near your temples and down your part, comb through and you can stretch the wash time in between shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have tried over 10 types of dry shampoo. This is my favorite. I love the smell and The extra hair volume that other brands can&#x27;t accomplish! I even use it on clean hair for an extra boost!</li>
    <li> Hair type: fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looooove this stuff. It always makes my hair look fresh and provides body. It never leaves any residue which is super nice with my thin hair. It gets rid of any oil that accumulates at my roots.</li>
    <li> Leaves my dark hair looking super white, even after combing/brushing/massaging in. Does absolutely nothing to make my hair look less greasy. It just covers my hair in powder.</li>
    <li> Great for adding volume to clean, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Just average. I&#x27;ve tried tons of dry shampoos (busy life, no time for a shower). I have blonde hair. This works okay - but beware the chemical smell it leaves behind. I see no difference between this and using baby powder. Baby powder is cheaper, safer, and smells better. Plus its much easier to brush out baby powder.</li>
    <li> Works great. Can&#x27;t see it. Not irritating.</li>
    <li> Great product for fast days.</li>
    <li> Smells like hairspray, like the old fashioned medicine smell kind that Motley Crue used in the 80&#x27;s (I&#x27;m speculating here, I wasn&#x27;t a groupie), and doesn&#x27;t work as well as other brands. Disappointed, would not buy again or recommend.</li>
    <li> This dry shampoo is just OK....I tried another brand that was alot more expensive and was AMAZED at how well it worked...so I figured I&#x27;d try a couple of the less expensive brands to see if they did the same kind of job...and unfortunately this one doesn&#x27;t work as well.  My hair felt heavy and coated vs refreshed....I really couldn&#x27;t do any kind of &amp;#34;Styling&amp;#34; with this in my hair...so I just put it in a ponytail...I was able to go an extra day with out washing my hair, but it just felt heavy and not really clean....</li>
    <li> I like this dry shampoo. I started buying this after Suave discontinued my favorite one. This is a close second. It does leave a white residue on my dark hair, but I&#x27;ve found that spraying it on my roots right before bed works best. It soaks up the oil before my hair ever gets &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, and the residue has time to work its way out of my hair before morning. The smell is okay, too.</li>
    <li> I have tried SO many of the grocery store brand aerosol dry shampoos. This is the one I keep going back to. I love it. I have thin, fine, oily, blonde hair. By 5 pm, my hair is clearly greasy. A few sprays of this and it&#x27;s back to looking presentable. Also adds good volume. I will always have this stuff in my stock of hair products!</li>
    <li> The TRESemm&amp;eacute; Fresh Start is a very interesting dry shampoo. Usually I find that a dry shampoo either zaps oil or adds texture, but the Fresh Start did a little bit of both. While my oil did disappear quite a bit, this product left behind a lot of residue and left my hair feeling really gunky. My hair looked clean, but I felt gross. It was a weird dichotomy, and I couldn’t decide if I liked the product or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I used Fresh Start, the more I disliked it. I found the product difficult to wash out in the shower, and it tended to flake as well. If you have thick hair, this product would probably work better for you, but my thin hair felt weighed down. Despite the great price point, I don’t think I’ll be purchasing this dry shampoo again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a first time dry shampoo user.  I was hesitant to use on my light brown / reddish hair that is almost down to my waist.  I am very pleased with how well this product works!  I have had no issues with white residue and I enjoy the smell.  I do not use this product all the time, just when I need to freshen up a hair style or when I feel a hot summer day has taken it&#x27;s toll on my hair.  Highly recommended and very pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my first dry shampoo experience, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect of a &amp;#34;good one&amp;#34; but here it goes...&lt;br /&gt;It does reduce the greasy feeling of my second day hair and keeps it looking presentable all day. It does not give my hair much volume though.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any &amp;#34;white strip&amp;#34;  on my hair and I have dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell might be somewhat too strong for someone. I don&#x27;t mind it too much but you can definitely smell it throughout the day! The fist time I used it my bf was in the shower (I got it in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait for him to finish showering to try it out), as I was spraying the stuff, he started shouting &amp;#34;stop, stop it! What is it? I feel like in a salon!&amp;#34; Hahaha, he is very sensitive to scent though.</li>
    <li> I spent ten years as a licensed cosmetologist before a career change.  This product is terrible for everyday use.  I&#x27;m currently a natural brunette.  This product left white streaks in my hair when I sprayed the product five to six inches from my scalp.  It states on the bottle it has \\&quot;Mineral Clay\\&quot; in this spray.  That clay is clearly depositing on my hair much like the white lines on a football or soccer field.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because the volumizing aspect of the product actually works.  If you are in a theatrical production and need to age yourself 30 years or are dressing up for Halloween and need to put chunky white streaks in your hair then this product might before for you.</li>
    <li> It worked well at first but after a few uses all it was already gone. I rarely used it. I liked how it made my hair smell nice. If it lasted longer thab would of gave a better rate.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff four times a week because if I washed my hair daily, my scalp would never stop flaking and itching. I find it works better than some of the upscale brands. I put it on before I go to bed, and my hair looks flawless in the morning.</li>
    <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it worked very well but I actually grew to like this one. I think it does a good job to revive hair and absorb the oil. I have been trying to wash my hair once or twice a week for about 4 years now.....these days I use  the mix of baking soda water instead of shampoo and it makes a huge difference how long my hair stays fresh (vs the days I used shampoo.....it&#x27;s all in the PH, I hear)! Huge difference! I&#x27;ve read about the proportions etc online....Some people also use apple cider vinegar instead of traditional conditioner to soften and detangle the hair after washing it. Anyways....I think the price is good for this dry shampoo and it actually does a good job. One of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have swavy/curly, type 2C, fine, blonde hair and I workout five times a week and curly hair does not like to be washed daily.  So I use this product to refresh my 2nd and/or 3rd day scalp.  I follow the instructions and my scalp feels nice and dry, refreshed and clean.  It totally removes the oily  buildup from my scalp.  I personally do not notice any white residue on my hair. Nor do I really notice a big difference with &amp;#34;Volumizing&amp;#34; but it is a good product to keep on hand for those days that washing your hair is not a possibility and or practical.</li>
    <li> Not the best, left hair flat, and did not feel as clean as other dry shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I wish they had like a 3.5 stars. I have dark, colored, thinnish hair. I read a lot of these reviews and used some of the tips from the 5 star ratings and it worked. I sprayed it only a few times at the roots, massaged it in and then brushed it back, to the side, underneath. All which ways. Since I was in a hurry for a formal event, I didn&#x27;t want to over due it. My hair wasn&#x27;t oily, but it did&#x27;t have a lot of volume either. This is only after 1 time. It seems like if I did it more, this would be ok for a last minute fix.</li>
    <li> I did not wait until my hair was really gross, but it WAS oily.…and you could see that it was oily.  Tresemme Dry Shampoo made a difference!  It feels MUCH LESS OILY! I am not embarrassed to go out in public after using this.  Unlike one of the other reviewers stated, my can of dry shampoo instructs us to hold it 8-12 inches away.  I think not using too much product helps, too.  If it doesn&#x27;t work that well the first time, you can always use it again;  however, once you have used too much, there is nothing you can do.  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this to make much difference, but I am really happy with it.  I recommend Tresemme Dry Shampoo!</li>
    <li> Really gets rid of the excess oil on my scalp and hair when I don&#x27;t wash for a couple of days. Smells good.</li>
