### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>and i&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
      <li>Very good mask.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for a side sleeper.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m quite happy with the purchase</li>
      <li>It is by far the best cpap mask I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am sure it will work for some.</li>
      <li>very good, it is my second mask</li>
      <li>I can say as far as design and leaks, it is great.</li>
      <li>This does the trick just fine.</li>
      <li>The fit is great, it is quiet, it doesn&#x27;t leak, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
      <li>no lines, super comfortable.</li>
      <li>Other then that, was a good mask, easy to use and no leaks.</li>
      <li>Seems there should be a way to make it more quiet.</li>
      <li>I have only used it 3 nights, but getting more sleep than with the others.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft and comfortable, but makes a lot of noise when in use.  </li>
      <li>I am sure it would be the ultimate for a lower pressure patient.</li>
      <li>The fit is better, less leakage.  </li>
      <li>NICE ALTERNATIVE TO PILLOWS, NOT A GOOD FIT WITH MY HIGH RIDGE NOSE</li>
      <li>The Eson appears to be much quieter, but it leaks when you side sleep, and the n10 does not.</li>
      <li>This is my third mask, have a full face mirage Quattro, Eson F&amp;P Nasal, and now the n10.</li>
      <li>This one is a bit more compact and takes less room in my suitcase.  </li>
      <li>Leaks are rare compared to the larger style masks (with a forehead rest).</li>
      <li>, the other mask I have with a swivel type of connector that connects to the regular air hose does a better job of keeping it off my face.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the little hose that comes on this unit, my old mask had a swivel elbow that was nice for positioning the hose for side sleeping, this hose has a tendency to kink a bit...overall a big improvement from by old trusty mask.</li>
      <li>Great nasal mask only problem why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because where it hooks together the plastic is a little sharp.</li>
      <li>It is easy to get on and off with their magnet gimmick and it does a decent job of not leaking as I move around, but in the end not sure I would buy one again.</li>
      <li>Soft wraps for the silicon straps of the headgear has no closure fastening, would not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
      <li>I always worried about my old mask getting broke in transit (it never did) in the long trips to Japan or Europe.  </li>
      <li>The only down side is it&#x27;s very noisy, but with a setting of 20, I don&#x27;t know if any are going to be very quiet.  </li>
      <li>Good for the bed partner, bad for the user.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased the wrong item, my fault. Contacted Amazon who said this was third party deal.  Resmed never contacted me,</li>
    <li> Had a ResMed mask for 10 years before seeing this one in a local pharmacy display.  Decided to give it a try.  This one is a bit more compact and takes less room in my suitcase.  I always worried about my old mask getting broke in transit (it never did) in the long trips to Japan or Europe.  The fit is better, less leakage.  Not a bit fan of the magnet connectors, I still just slip it on over my head at night and off in the morning without using the magnet connectors.  I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the little hose that comes on this unit, my old mask had a swivel elbow that was nice for positioning the hose for side sleeping, this hose has a tendency to kink a bit...overall a big improvement from by old trusty mask.</li>
    <li> Caused a rash under nose, seemed to be rubbing due cpap motion maybe?  Just not correct shape for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to stop using after 3 nights to let nose heal. Other then that, was a good mask, easy to use and no leaks.</li>
    <li> 1. Soft wraps for the silicon straps of the headgear has no closure fastening, would not stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;2. Poor venting design, exhaling breaths blow against user&#x27;s face. Good for the bed partner, bad for the user.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am sure it will work for some.</li>
    <li> NICE ALTERNATIVE TO PILLOWS, NOT A GOOD FIT WITH MY HIGH RIDGE NOSE</li>
    <li> I just got this last night. It is by far the best cpap mask I have ever owned. The fit is great, it is quiet, it doesn&#x27;t leak, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! Only mask I will ever use .</li>
    <li> This is my third mask, have a full face mirage Quattro, Eson F&amp;P Nasal, and now the n10. I can say as far as design and leaks, it is great. I have only used it 3 nights, but getting more sleep than with the others. The only down side is it&#x27;s very noisy, but with a setting of 20, I don&#x27;t know if any are going to be very quiet.  The Eson appears to be much quieter, but it leaks when you side sleep, and the n10 does not. It&#x27;s great for a side sleeper. I am sure it would be the ultimate for a lower pressure patient.</li>
    <li> Finally, I can sleep on my side. I also wear glasses and wanted something I could wear with them. Leaks are rare compared to the larger style masks (with a forehead rest). This does the trick just fine. and I&#x27;m quite happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s soft and comfortable, but makes a lot of noise when in use.

    <li> very good, it is my second mask and i&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
    <li> I returned this unopened, with the shipper&#x27;s approval, and they have failed to refund my payment.</li>
    <li> Item  leaves lines daily as straps have to be secured to reduce &amp;#34;leaky air&amp;#34; .... this would be a major issue if I had to report to work early everyday!!</li>
    <li> Great nasal mask only problem why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because where it hooks together the plastic is a little sharp. I glued pieces of felt to keep it from scratching my face.</li>
    <li> Air noise at the interface of the cushion and the inlet junction is excessive.  Seems there should be a way to make it more quiet.</li>
    <li> no lines, super comfortable.</li>
    <li> Very confortable small mask, but even with continuious adjustment still leaks somewhat.</li>
    <li> Very good mask.  A little problem with leakage that I am not used to, Since I normally use a nasal pillow mask. Onle use nasal mask when nostrils are irritated.</li>
