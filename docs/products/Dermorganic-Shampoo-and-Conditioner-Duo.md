<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner, but it seems like the liquid settles to the bottom of the containers and it&#x27;s not as easy as shaking the bottle to correct it. I&#x27;ve had to take the nozzle off of the bottle and stir the product to mix it up again, but that&#x27;s the worst I can say about it.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t use any other shampoo or conditioner, and this is the lowest price I&#x27;ve gotten, even cheaper than my local CosmoProf.</li>
    <li> dont like the Shampoo actually bought new stuff, and have this whole bottle left over..  Makes my hair soo dry..  misguided reviews... :(  Shipped Fast though</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this shampoo and masque before purchasing this size and absolutely love it. I have been struggling with my dry scalp for about 3 months now. Nothing I have does has fixed it. I used this Dermorganic combo and it cleared up right away. I was amazed! I have very thin, straight hair with a lot of split ends and I feel like I have salon quality hair after using this shampoo and masque. It makes my hair feel fuller.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this is BY FAR the best price for the product.</li>
    <li> the packaging damaged the product, and it leaked. Take more care in the future. The product is good.</li>
    <li> Product came when expected and this shampoo and conditioner is great.</li>
    <li> I never saw any improvement on my hair. The 1st time I bought through Amazon the quality was good though. The 2nd time the shampoo seemed watered down. I switched to matrix essential oils and loved it</li>
    <li> My hair is soft, it has gotten its curl and softness back.  My hair seems to be growing better, my hair definitely feels like it is growing faster.  I will never stop using the shampoo and masque on my hair, this is really great stuff.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, so the this package is a great value. Hair is clean, light, and shiny, and the fragrance from the oil is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this.  I have waist length hair and need a really good shampoo and conditioner and this is it!</li>
    <li> OMG I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE PRODUCTS!!!! All organic and natural exactly as described. It leaves my hair clean (I am oily) yet hydrated without being greasy. My hair has become thicker and healthier and smells nice too! I loved them so much I replaced all of my hair care products with Dermorganic versions!!! Also it lasts a very, very long time. I recently saw a much smaller version in my local CVS for the same price as these large bottles.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, great price too!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it tends to not leave a residue in your hair like some products. The only problem that i had was the shipping. I did not open right away when I receive it and when I opened up the box the conditioner cap was not on tight and so some of leaked into the clear plastic bag that it was wrapped in.</li>
    <li> Thank you love this!! Really nice in my blonde hair</li>
    <li> I dont know if its supposed to be runny like watered down dish soap. If anything it damaged my hair. Would never recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner. Searched long and hard to find a good sulfate free combo and was very happy to find this because it&#x27;s been one of my favorite shampoos. I have long fine hair and using harsh shampoos really wore it down.. Hair started looking noticeably healthier after using this.</li>
    <li> I have really baby fine hair, this shampoo and masque i can use every day and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. has a fresh clean scent that can work for men and women.</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling really greasy. I have very thick/long hair. I wouldnt recommend to anyone with alot of hair.</li>
    <li> Works ok on hair color, but the major problem is the smell. My husband actually said my hair smells like vomit. I continued to use it and ignored him thinking he was either kidding or exaggerating. Well, that was until my daughter confirmed it by saying quite simply that my hair smells really gross. Through out what was left!! Plenty of products out there that are color safe and smell great...</li>
    <li> Delivered was fast. Good product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this set because it seemed like it had good enough reviews. When I first got it, it was awesome! My hair smelled nice and felt soft but then as the month went on, it has become more dry and brittle. My husband had to stop using it because it was making his dandruff worse than ever! I&#x27;m not a person that spends hundreds of dollars on hair products because frankly, I think it&#x27;s a waste, but I honestly wish I didn&#x27;t buy this product to save a few bucks. If you use this product once or twice in a while, then it works fine, but if you plan on using this every other day, then I advise to go in another direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting my set in the guest bathroom...</li>
    <li> the consistency of the shampoo is so thick, once it nears the end of the bottle it is nearly impossible to get any product out through the pump. I manually have to shake the bottle, unscrew the pump and remove the product from the straw/hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said: I rated it 4 stars ( would be 5 if not for that) because the shampoo cleanses extremely well, has a great scent,  is sulfate, salt, dye, etc. free and is MUCH healthier than a traditional shampoo.. makes it all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using the shampoo alone as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very conditioned.. Instead  I would highly recommend it being purchased with the masque because together they leave my hair clean, feeling extremely soft, manageable, stronger and much easier to comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the two.. the masque is my favorite and though I may purchase the shampoo again I definitely will purchase the masque for as long as they sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... I&#x27;m satisfied with Dermorganic and may try their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review and I hope it&#x27;s found to be helpful.</li>
    <li> This is some beautiful product! As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s made from really high quality ingredients, it give tons of moisture and body to my dry hair, and it leaves my hair clean and shiny for days. It smells nice. Such an excellent value for a nice product.</li>
    <li> Be careful! It says the package comes with shampoo and a masque, but it is actually the daily hydrating conditioner. There is a big difference! I love this brand, and it&#x27;s a great package if you get what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Has really made a difference in the texture and manageability of my curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo/Masque set.  The shampoo is sulfate free but it still suds up somewhat so you get the coverage that you are used with a product that has sulfates.</li>
    <li> I did not like this shampoo. Felt like it did not rinse out well.</li>
    <li> I wish more people knew about this product, it&#x27;s THE BEST SHAMPOO- soo gentle, it never dried my hair out, I only wash my hair 1-2 days a week and this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue like some organic shampoos&amp; conditioners have. It cleanses my scalp, and I have a dry scalp it&#x27;s always itchy but after using the conditioner it stops my scalp from itching and really gives me relief. But THE OIL .....LEAVES MY HAIR COMPLETELY SOFT. I have medium/long fine hair and all I can say is this product is like food for my hair. I really never want to use any other product, this one is it. I just wish it was more affordable for everyone.</li>
    <li> I gave this product time - used it for a month and can honestly say it&#x27;s one of the worst shampoo/conditioner combos I have ever purchased.  I have thick, coarse hair and since using these products, my hair is much dryer, has developed split ends and my color has noticeably faded and dulled.  This may work for other hair types but I would NOT recommend it for thick or coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Still lathers.  Doesn&#x27;t have any sulfates--or pseudo-sulfates like some brands.  My red color-treated hair is loving it!  Smells nice and not over-powering.</li>
    <li> Great price!  Love this line.  My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> Would not recommend buying the large bottle if this is the first time trying this product. I understand that everyone&#x27;s hair is different and would react differently to any shampoo. I gave this product a one month try and it just did not work. I feel like the shampoo and conditioner strips my hair of any softness or shine that it once had. While using this product I had a lot more hair fall out then when using others, my hair also felt really stringy and dry when using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo &amp; conditioner my family uses.  Chemical free and gluten free is very important to us!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are great but the pump on the shampoo does not work. I have to manually get the shampoo out instead of using the pump. The pump works fine on the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much softer and healthier after I start using this… I am very happy.</li>
    <li> This is watery compared to the one Im buying from Ulta. Disappointed</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful, improves hair condition</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Both of my daughters use it as well.  My hair was falling out using a Paul MItchell &amp;#34;Organic-ish&amp;#34; ginger shampoo.  One wash with this stuff and it stopped!  Would never even consider another shampoo or conditioner unless I had too.  Has worked very well for my family   Update:  Just purchased my second bottle and I am still overwhelmingly happy with this product.  It is wonderful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s organic shampoo which makes your hair clean but doesn&#x27;t make it soft and smell yummy. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> still my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner - I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years and have seen a remarkable difference in my hair; I use a lot less than traditional products so I save money using this product.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to all products containing forms of Formaldehyde.  This chemical is in many personal care products and has many different names.  DermOrganic Products do not have formaldehyde and I like that very much.  And, I like the scent.  And, I like the way my extremely curly hair gets tamed when I use DermOrganics.</li>
    <li> This duo is a must buy. My hair has never been so soft and managable and I use it on my daughter hair as well. This is the best and worth every dime. This will be the only shampoo I use period.</li>
    <li> I have long, color damaged hair &amp; this duo makes a big difference. Hair is less dry, less frizz &amp; no more tangles when I comb it after washing. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t really foam a lot but it DOES clean well &amp; that typical of sulfate free ones. Sulfates are hard on the hair so glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Feel good and smell good as using this product.  Hair feels moist after using the product.</li>
    <li> Love this two products especially the masque. It makes my hair smooth and shiny and no frizz. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this product,and I received my product early, however, when I received my package, the conditioner was leaking all over the place.  Luckily it was in a plastic bag, but I still don&#x27;t understand why the seller wouldn&#x27;t try to tape the top or do something in order to secure the tops of the containers, as I have ordered this product from other sellers and they never leaked.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this product.  I have seriously spent thousands and thousands of dollars on hair products and THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS WELL!!  I have fine hair, tames frizz, gets really dry at the ends and feels like straw, my ends usually split but this def helps with everything!!- so any type hair will.  Fine, curly, thick, ethnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they would TAKE OUT the parfum/fragrance- it is the only toxic item in the set.  Otherwise every other shampoo/conditioner out there has at least a half dozen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY, BUY BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; TO THE OWNER:  PLEASE REMOVE THE PARFUM/FRAGRANCE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used to have terrible eczema on my scalp and since using this shampoo it has cleared up.  I also have been able to grow my hair really long because I don&#x27;t have all the tangling and snarls that you get with a shampoo with sulfates.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t suds up like everyone is used to but my scalp feels clean and healthy for the first time in years.</li>
    <li> I have been using this combo for about 3 weeks now. From first use I was not a fan. It left my hair coarse and hard to manage. I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it wet or dry and my hair feels dry and gross with a slight waxy feel. I gave it a good run and effort. I would never order again.</li>
    <li> exactly as described. Fast ship. Thanks</li>
    <li> At first I purchased samples of the product and liked it. The more I use DermOrganic my hair isn&#x27;t as dry and definately is and more softer .</li>
    <li> Love this product . Great for dry color treated hair . After 1 week I noticed a difference in my hair . I high recommed .</li>
    <li> I just received the shampoo and conditioner in the mail today and I am already SO happy with the results! My hair is so dry and my breakage is getting pretty bad. My hairdresser recommended this product to me and told me that not only will it make my hair healthier but my color will last longer due to the pH balance. My hair smells great, looks shiny and feels a lot healthier after just one use. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo and masque conditioner my wife uses and she loves it for how it makes her hair very manageable.</li>
    <li> Not for me. My hair is coarse and frizzy plus I&#x27;m getting older and my hair is getting dryer. It wasn&#x27;t suppose to lather right? The ingredients are not natural. Not a good buy at all for hair like mine.</li>
    <li> After using this a few times, I found my hair looked and felt dry.  I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo at in the shower.  It left my hair feeling terrible, so of course I used the conditioner which I did like.  That being said, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again, even though I loved the idea of it, and using natural products on my hair.  I&#x27;ve yet to find something that really works for me other than my tried and true Pureology!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have had an issue with dry scalp since having children, and have tried every non prescription product imagineable. This product has given me great hair, and a healthy (not itchy) scalp for the first time in 5 years!</li>
    <li> Terrible. It made my hair more dry and course and it smells bad. Misleading.... it is not a full organic product</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. Shampoo is so watery and smell like coconout oil not argan oil. And mask do not misturize the hair.my hair after using it is really dry...lost of money</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair, which has been manageable for the most part until I bought the DermOrganic shampoo/masque, I was using Suave naturals. DermOrganic made my hair dry, brittle, and tangled to the point where I had to use Suave conditioner to untangle it. I only blow dry twice a week, and even then my hair has become puffy, frizzy and unkempt looking. This shampoo is awful. I&#x27;m sticking to Suave. Might not be &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; with a posh label but at least it has never ruined my hair.</li>
    <li> Came across the review for this on makeup alley.  Someone mentioned being able to purchase at Marshall&#x27;s. I lucked up and found the last set on clearance there but it is hit or miss if its there. My daughter and I have really liked these.  I love the easy pump, the sulfate free, and how soft it makes your hair.  My hair feels different now.  I still need a little help with frizz so I have ordered the leave in treatment but so much better than others i have tried.  my color lasts longer too. My daughter let her hair down after her soccer games and was amazed how it still looked and smelled good after being on the field 8-3.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product because my hair was recently fried (felt like straw) and I was desperate to get it back healthy and feeling soft.  I love this shampoo and masque!  Within a few weeks my hair was less tangled and frizzy.  I can run my fingers through my hair and its not tangled.  It&#x27;s not a heavy shampoo/masque and don&#x27;t feel its leaving residue or weighing down my hair.  My hair still has a long way to go to be repaired, but this stuff is working wonders!</li>
    <li> Since becoming pregnant I&#x27;ve tried to eliminate as much crap as possible from my &amp;#34;beauty routine.&amp;#34;  These both work really well and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I received a sample pack at work, not expecting to even use it but had no choice when I ran out of my Pureology. And I&#x27;m so glad I did! I&#x27;m addicted to the shampoo and masque combo. It has truly saved my fine, damaged, color treated hair. My hair is healthier and stronger and best of all, it doesn&#x27;t strip my red color out. It&#x27;s good for ALL hair types; my friends and I swear by it. And it&#x27;s sulfate free! The smell and packaging are a little off putting, I&#x27;ll admit, but the results are completely worth it. This combo mixed with vitamins has truly brought life back into my hair.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This product. Since I have tried this shampoo and the conditioner I have not gone back to any other. I have dry frizzy damaged hair. I used the shampoo and fell in love with the smell. I know many others hate it but to me it&#x27;s aroma therapy. Now since it&#x27;s sulphate free it&#x27;s not supposed to create all those suds that you see from other regular shampoos. I mean you can start seeing the suds a little but that&#x27;s because most people use sooo much unnecessarily. I guess it&#x27;s out of habit because when you switch from sulphate added shampoos to sulphate free shampoos you are sort of expecting all that lather. Anyway, I use an ample amount on my thick frizzy hair. After I wash, my hair is left somewhat soft... Which is a big deal because most shampoos would leave it brittle..which than I would have to apply an insane amount of conditioner just to keep it soft and manageable. Which leads me to the conditioner. First off let me start by saying I finish my conditioners first all the time because of how much I use them I&#x27;m comparison to the shampoos. Not with this one. I apply an ample amount and leave it on while I do the rest of my body and than rinse off. My hair is soooo soft and smooth and just beautiful... Than I have to apply a leave in treatment because the damage to my hair is so severe.. So stripped my hair color from black to blonde in two days..and so you can imagine.. HOWEVER, my daughter has fine straight hair and I can understand how the other commenters would say it leaves the hair oily. I would suggest to be easy in the amount of shampoo you apply. It does have argan oil so if applied a lot it can leave hair feeling a little heavy and somewhat greasy. I saw that on my daughters hair. So I changed the amount and it was perfect. Remember a little goes a long way... Especially in fine straight hair.. Or fine hair in general. So needless to say, she didn&#x27;t even need to use the conditioner!! Her hair since its virgin hair does beautifully  only with the shampoo. Now both my daughter and I wash our hairs every 3 days.. I used to wash my hair every other day but honestly with these products my hair can go on for 3 days without smelling or getting excessively oily. I guess it depends da on each person PH level. This shampoo balanced mine out. Now the conditioner I only apply to the ends... Never on the roots. But if you have fine hair and not so damaged as mine I wouldn&#x27;t recommend washing your hair every day. It defeats the purpose of you ask me not to mention that&#x27;s how you would tend to get your hair a little heavy. I highly recommend it... And yes the consistancy is like egg yolks or a little watery but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I guess all the Ingredients form differently. I must say I have not brought this product from Amazon. I purchased it from TJ maxx for about the same price... I can&#x27;t find the hair masque tho so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m buying the duo pack today.oo.

    <li> The shampoo is really not very sudsy. The conditioner is alright. I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing this so I can buy something else!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s pretty awesome that there&#x27;s a shampoo that&#x27;s sulfate free that lathers nicely. I use two pumps and my lengthy hair lathers perfectly. The masque I use one pump of and stay away from my roots since my hair greases easily. It makes my hair shiny and frizz free which is great. The only downside is that it causes a little build up after excessive use so I have to use a build up remover shampoo once weekly to keep up with the positive results. This is why I took away one star.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and masque. My entire family uses it. It doesn&#x27;t make hair dull. It makes it super silky and healthy.</li>
    <li> These products are the best of their kind that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s convenient that it&#x27;s a pump, works well, makes my hair soft and shiny. When the bottle gets low, the pump can be finicky and not really work, so I then just tap some shampoo/conditioner into my hand, but it takes a long time to get to that point, so I don&#x27;t find it a big deal. I think 1 set of these lasted me about a year because I wash my hair every other to every third day.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great.  The masque seems odd, can&#x27;t tell if it is leaving behind a weird coating or stripping my hair.  This masque doesn&#x27;t seem to work like the sample i purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY shampoos &amp; conditioners over the years for my semi-oily/partially wavy/extremely frizzy hair &amp; this is by far my favorite - every other shampoo is either too moisturizing or too drying for my hair.  I like the smell but it&#x27;s not girly or like any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tired (it almost smells like bar soap).  It also lathers up really well for a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo and conditioner. Creamy without weighing hair down. Nice light scent.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering and using sulfate free shampoo.  I ordered this brand after my hairstylist recommended the Dermorganic argan oil.  I had heard it might no later but it did.  After using it for one week, I noticed a huge difference and even got complements from coworkers.  They had no idea I had changed shampoo/conditioner.  I&#x27;m satisfied even though it was hard (especially for my husband) to pay so much for shampoo/conditioner.</li>
    <li> I must have read the size wrong, because I was blown away when i received the very large bottles.  This made the price even better.  I will continue to use this vendor.</li>
    <li> What an awesome deal this was .. Received in a timely manner and nothing was spilled or broken .. Awesome seller. A++++&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used DermOrganic , you are missing out . It&#x27;s far better than Wen and it cost far less. The scent is pleasant and not at all obtrusive . I have thick American Indian hair and this shampoo/conditioner really work in giving my hair shine,softness and a healthy look that I haven&#x27;t had in a long time. It doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to work. Great for colored treated hair also .. I would recommend this to friends</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and masque for a couple months, I color my hair every 4-6 weeks.  My hair stylist can see a difference.  It takes some getting used to and the pump really sucks, they could improve that part.  As for the product, I love it !!!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is so thick that I cannot get it out of the bottle...seems to be very old.  Masque is okay</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have used it for one week, washing every other day, so far and my hair is so soft and so much healthier looking already! I will certainly be ordering those again! They both smell great and leave my hair feeling and looking great! I have thin wavyish hair and this doesn&#x27;t make it fuzzy or weighed down. Also I feel like it moisturizes my hair nicely!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time and I&#x27;ve noticed quicker hair growth. I love the way it smells and how soft it leaves my hair.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner ever!  My hair was dry, brittle and falling out.  My hair feels amazing and has stopped falling out.  My hair color also lasts much longer since there are no chemicals stripping my hair.  I highly recommend this combo!</li>
    <li> Best ever shampoo I have ever used and I have used a ton of both salon and high dollar drug store brands. This is hands down the best ever.</li>
    <li> my grandmother uses these products and based on her review of the item she says five stars!! how about that</li>
    <li> Buy the set! The shampoo is awesome. I&#x27;m italian, and have always woken up with hair that is pretty, um, greasy. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo on my hair and beard for about half a bottle, and I have noticeably less beard dander, normalized scalp oil, and a bunch of comments on how shiny my hair is now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a product I&#x27;m excited to tell my friends about!</li>
    <li> I bought this from my hairdresser last year in palm desert and found it to be amazing on my hair. The hard water we have in the desert.is tough on my hair but this product makes it feel and look great It is so great on the hair you can wash it every day if you so choose. The seller sent this to me extremely speedy - within a couple of days of the order. The only bummer was one of the items had a loose cap so there was some spillage but luckily the shampoo and conditioner were packed in plastic so it was contained. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo size with pumps! Love the healthy feel and results this shampoo/mask combo provides for myself and family. No worries on sulfates and junk. I have stuck with this brand on a more continuous use than any other. Shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair oils and the mask nurishes your scalp and hair u til next wash.</li>
    <li> Probably the best shampoo and conditioner I have used.  I usually use Burt&#x27;s Bees for my conditioner, but since I moved to a house without soft water, the product wasn&#x27;t conditioning my hair very well.  I would have to comb out tangles and lost a lot of hair in that process.  This product does create more slip, so my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as much and so I&#x27;m losing less hair.  I also think it&#x27;s making my hair look shinier and healthier.</li>
    <li> Just as described. I&#x27;m not sure if my hair improved, but I like the natural ingredients used in this set.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and Conditioner on the market.  Well worth it to anyone to wants to clean their hair gently and without gluten or soy.</li>
    <li> These liters last a long time because you don&#x27;t need much product.  The shampoo lathers and suds very well and works well as a body shampoo as well.  They both smell like argan oil, which isn&#x27;t great but isn&#x27;t bad either.  The masque is amazing!  Leave it on for a couple minutes and your hair is silk!  That has been the case for the few years I&#x27;ve used this.  With that said, I recently got blonde highlights and ever since then, this shampoo and conditioner still leave my hair tangled and somewhat hard to tame after getting out of the shower.  I blame the color treatment, but for anyone who color treats or highlights, it may be an issue for you too?</li>
    <li> Works great, delivered quickly</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and soft conditioner. It leaves my hair without much freeze and really manageable. They are a little pricey but I would buy this again for sure, they last a looooong time!!!</li>
    <li> The masque leaves hair hydrated, manageable, and soft. I love the smell of both products too!</li>
    <li> This set is amazing. Love the smell and really leaves my hair feeling great. Have great body, does not weigh it down... also helpful with frizziness. Definatley a great value as well!!</li>
    <li> Weightless softness really helping my colored and heat tortured hair! Tried a new heat styler on a little too high setting...amazing results from this shampoo and masque. The sulphate free shampoo lathers beautifully and the masque works great as a conditioner or left on for deeper conditioning. Scent and quality is A+</li>
    <li> My hair feels so good when I wash and condition it...  Worth a try definitely for the price.  I also got oil for my ends.</li>
    <li> Best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
    <li> I gave this product a long trial and it was heavy in my hair. I lost all the shine and it lost its healthy look.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! When nearing the bottom of the bottle I add just a little water to thin it enough to pump, still has plenty of shampoo action. Used it for 4 months now.</li>
    <li> Was really excited to try this new product and when I opened the package I received TWO conditioners! I rechecked my order several times to make sure I didn&#x27;t order two conditioners and I didn&#x27;t. The package even said shampoo and conditioner....what a bummer...guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my usual. This is what I get for trying something new I guess. 😕</li>
    <li> Awesome. Great value as well!</li>
    <li> We tried this when we were visiting a friend and loved it. It makes your hair feel so soft and leaves it shiny. It can tend to make your forehead break out though if you have bangs. It is a little on the oily side. But otherwise it is a great product and definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love this Shampoo and Conditioner from DermOrganic ! My hair has felt great, soft and smooth ever since I have started using this. I also love that I can feel better about not putting Nasty chemicals into my hair and into the environment.</li>
    <li> I have been looking everywhere for organic shampoo and conditioner that really moisturizes my hair leaving it soft and not greasy. This is totally it!</li>
    <li> I visited a new hairdresser who used DermOrganic Shampoo and Masque Conditioner on my badly damaged hair.  While I had been using what I thought were superior products my hairdresser told me they had left my hair in deplorable shape because of the harsh chemicals in them.  After just one shampoo and conditioner treatment my hair was restored to a beautifully glossy and healthy condition.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I can wholeheartedly recommend this product to anyone seeking the very best hair care products that money can buy.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product! Smells awesome!</li>
    <li> This is honestly the worst.  It makes my hair look and feel greasy, coarse and unclean.  I can&#x27;t run my fingers through my own hair -- I have had better results with Pantene 2 in 1.  The smell is also not appealing.  Super disappointed!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s work well but when you look cerfully  you well find cheaper than  what those cost me.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair rough and frizzy. And don&#x27;t be fooled by the name- there&#x27;s nothing organic in that bottle.</li>
    <li> Its perfect for freezing weathers....moisturizes hair very well</li>
    <li> My wife and I tried using this product for 30 days.  Neither one of us liked it.  Our hair did not feel clean, and my wife&#x27;s hair was very dry and hard to comb.  She had to buy a detangler just to comb her hair.  It also made me have sores on my scalp.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE.</li>
    <li> I have thick, Caucasian hair that I can usually wait to wash every 3 days, but this shampoo and conditioner made my hair really greasy after about a day. I liked that it was organic but there&#x27;s just too much oil in this stuff.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have found and it&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon than from my hairdresser ($33 vs $60).</li>
    <li> I have never - in my life - spent so much money on shampoo/conditioner.  It was worth it.  The bottles are huge, and you really don&#x27;t need a lot.  A few weeks ago I got a really expensive haircut (first in my life) and the stylist told me - sulfates are bad, moroccan oil is good.  So I went on a search.  This stuff had fabulous reviews and so I went for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT love the way it smells, as others have commented.  But the awesomeness of the product more than makes up for it.  I have curly hair and after just a couple washings, I no longer have to put product in my hair to keep the frizzies away.  The shampoo lathers very well, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell it was sulfate-free.  The masque is very nice too.  My hair just feels soft and fabulous and holds whatever shape I put it in (when I blow it out, it&#x27;s REALLY good at staying that way - never has been before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think this product is not what it used to be. When I first started purchasing it, I loved it. This last time, it seems as if it were watered down or something.. also, the &#x27;masque&#x27; is not a good alternative for conditioner. I will be going back to enjoi products now.</li>
    <li> I used to love this shampoo and conditioner, but I think they changed their formula. The shampoo smells terrible - the only thing I can equate it to is a urinal cake. It also left a terrible residue that flaked off my scalp in large chunks. Very disappointing since it was my favorite.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these products, very gentle cleansing with a nice amount of moisture, but not so much it leaves your hair heavy.  I have purchased these several times.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it had mostly great reviews.. unlike some of the bad reviews I read on this, I had no problem getting the shampoo to lather .. but I have to say that this is the worst shampoo I have ever used hands down... I have used many products before, I have hair down to my butt.. I have used all kinds of shampoos including organic shampoos.. and this stuff made my hair (that usually looks really healthy) look damaged beyond repair, after just two uses.. I used a hot oil treatment and went back to my previous organic shampoo (that is a fraction of the cost).. and immediately my hair was almost back to normal.. now I have two huge bottles of overpriced shampoo that I won&#x27;t touch and wouldn&#x27;t even recommend to anyone.. waste of money and very disappointed... not sure what all the hubbub is about..</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was not a fan but I have realized that with my hair I have to use something more than once and now I love it!!! I do not want to use anything else! I bought the 33.8oz for both and it only takes 2 pumps of both to coat my hair! While washing it it may feel dry and harsh but once you brush and blowdry it becomes so soft and shiny and with 100% less frizz! Between my Brazilian blowout and this combo my hair is better than ever!</li>
    <li> I liked nothing about this. My hair was stringy, heavy and waxy. After about a week, both bottles went into the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have used hundreds of different shampoos and conditioners. I have tried going the \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; route as well. Nothing has ever left my hair feeling as soft, shiny and manageable as this shampoo and conditioner. I have very long, medium thickness, curly/wavy hair, and color treated hair. My curls are soft and bouncy and no sign of frizz. I have looked long and hard for a good sulfate-free shampoo, and I think this is the best. I love that this shampoo is sulfate-free. The other sulfate-free shampoos have left my hair feeling dull and heavy. his shampoo did not make my hair feel that way.</li>
    <li> the shampoo cleared up the whiteheads on my scalp and my back doesn&#x27;t break out from the suds from it. Scalp isn&#x27;t itchy anymore and the masque is amazing for making my hair soft and shiny. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I am not sure what caused my hair to have problems, but about 7 years ago it stopped looking healthy. I have dark curly, fine hair that I have always colored, as I started turning gray in my 30s.  When I was younger it was thick and shiny but as I got older it got dry, wispy and frizzy, the ends broken and bent. It stopped growing as long. It seemed like more hair was falling out. It felt thin and it wouldn&#x27;t style as well.  I assumed this was old age. I figured my gray hair (under the color) had a different, horrible texture. The ends were so chronically dry that they matted.  I tried Aveda, Davines, Wen and some other organic shampoos and conditioners - my hair seemed the same. No change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got DermOrganics. I am not sure what&#x27;s different about it but it is a miracle worker. Within 1 month my hair was looking and feeling healthier. After 2 months it is now shiny, the ends are no longer dry/broken/bent. My hair is like it was 20 years ago. It doesn&#x27;t mat or tangle. I can run my fingers through it and it doesn&#x27;t frizz.  Last and most amazingly, I am not losing hair anymore.  My hair is growing longer again. It is fuller/thicker. My hairdresser can&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who haven&#x27;t tried it, be prepared for the shampoo experience to be a bit weird. It does lather, but your hair actually feels like it is matting a bit.  It completely untangles though when you use the hydrating masque, which seriously moisturizes the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use Davines styling products but I won&#x27;t use their shampoo or conditioner anymore.  This is seriously the only shampoo/conditioner I will ever use again.  It&#x27;s a miracle for hair.</li>
    <li> I really love that this stuff is organic, and I really wanted to love it. Especially because I usually don&#x27;t spend this much money on shampoo/conditioner. At first it was fine. It lathered well, and seemed to clean my hair well. I also enjoyed the smell. One of the bottles had leaked slightly during shipping, but it was covered in plastic, so thankfully it was just the bottle that sticky, and that wasn&#x27;t that big a deal for me. The bigger problem for me is that they caused my hair to be hard to brush through. It was almost if my hair was a little sticky, kind of like if you have some hair spray in your hair and try to brush it. As soon as I stopped using these products my hair went back to normal, so unfortunately I will not be finishing them, and now I am stuck with two very overpriced bottles that I&#x27;m never going to use.</li>
    <li> Great product. Bought it for my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have Celiac disease, and I have tried a ton of products, searching for ones that meet my expectations.  I bought the DermOrganic shampoo, masque, facial moisturizer and leave-in conditioner.  They are all fantastic.  I highly recommend them for everyone.  Best products EVER!!  You should try these even if you don&#x27;t have issues with gluten.</li>
    <li> I used wen and my hair dresser told me my hair was thirsty for conditioner.  I switched to this and my hair has been soft, not oily, looks fantastic!  It doesn&#x27;t suds like traditional shampoo, but it works for me.  I have fine hair that gets oily by the next day.</li>
    <li> this product is not doing what I thought it would for my hair because my hair is still very dry and it feels sort of heavy when I shampoo. It also arrived damaged!!! the conditioner bottle was cracked and the pump was broken completely off!!! But thanks to Amazon....I was compensated for the loss, but non the less...I will NEVER order this product again!!! I am NOT satisfied at all!!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky and very clean.</li>
    <li> The shampoo had a broken top and no pump. Conditioners top doesn&#x27;t work and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem original. I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> Been using for a few months and love these products.  The shampoo lathers nicely for a product that is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> I rarely buy the same shampoo twice let alone one of this size.  This is a bargain as well costs more in the salon for just the shampoo.  Highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> ...if your hair is aging, coarse, dry, processed, damaged (like mine), these products may not be for you.  At least not if you want to continue to style your hair with heated utensils.  I boldly, and with confidence (because of the reviews), purchased the shampoo, conditioner, masque, styling hair spray, and styling oil (spray).  All that money spent and I think I&#x27;ll have to give it all to my daughter - who, generally, never styles her long hair.  I have had better results from Organix Macadamia products - shampoo, conditioner, intensive conditioner, and oil - at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased Macadamia Oil Flawless (Shampoo/Conditioner in one), and Macadamia Oil Healing Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Macadamia-Natural-Oil-Flawless-8-0/dp/B0082C55RQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362342724&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;macadamia+Flawless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Macadamia-Oil-Healing-Treatment-ounces/dp/B002WTC37U/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362342536&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;macadamia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a gazillion dollars on trying to find exactly the right products for my hair - and these two are IT!  I am never going to change it up... I have found perfection.  To top it off the oil smells spectacular.  For styling Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Hydrocream Whip can&#x27;t be beat, followed by a light and dry hairspray of your choice.  I like Sebastian or Rusk W8less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Mitchell-Awapuhi-Ginger-Hydrocream/dp/B004ZLZR8A/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362342960&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;paul+mitchell+awapuhi+wild+ginger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent the money over time so I can bring you this report... in hopes it saves you a dollar or two.  Successful shopping!</li>
    <li> It is my first sulfate free shampoo and I love how color stays so much longer than when using normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had a period of hair shedding with my hair feeling not very clean while using this shampoo when I used a tiny amount of this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I resolved the problem by using more amount at a time(I use the amount to create the same amount of foam created with the normal shampoo). I think the same amount of this shampoo cleans less effectively so more amount of this shampoo should be used to get the same cleaning effect. After starting to use more amount, my hair gets cleaned very well. Still, I use my normal shampoo about once every two weeks or whenever I want some squeaky cleanness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shortens the lifecycle of each product, but worth it since the shampoo keeps my hair color  for so much longer.</li>
    <li> Best Shampoo and Masque around. All my family is using it now. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Thanks  very happy,received quickly thank you</li>
    <li> Was hoping to like this product.  Seemed like a great deal price-wise but left my hair feeling coarse and dry even after using conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair feeling smooth. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and masque. However the conditioner is not that great. I always order the duo with the masque.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this product line at my hair salon -- the Argan oil leave in treatment. Then a friend said her salon also used the shampoo so I searched Amazon and there it was. I love the smell, the way my hair feels and how my color lasts.</li>
    <li> My family has been buying this Shampoo and Masque Duo for probably over two years now. We have always loved it!!! However, recently when I reordered it the Shampoo came watery in consistency. We didn&#x27;t use it right away since we still had some left over in my other bottles. When we started using it. I shook it up and tried to mix it up to make it a bit thicker. However, it didn&#x27;t work it is still watery. I can&#x27;t return it because it is past the window since I ordered the product too soon before running out of the old stuff I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that I do love the smell of this product and the way it makes my hair feel. My whole family loves it. It is a shame. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what but I don&#x27;t know if I want to order the product again. I really don&#x27;t want to receive another watery shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff does wonders!!I love it and NEVER using anything else! My hair is naturally thick wavy and coarse. It always looked like I had a wig on no matter how many times I straighten my hair it still looked crazy! I use this stuff and 100% pure  certified organic argan oil and let me tell you I&#x27;ve never been more in love with my hair Its so healthy now!! Highly recommended! And it might seem a little pricey but this usually last me about six month!</li>
    <li> Within 2 weeks of using this product I can feel the difference on my hair.  Would  recommend this product .</li>
    <li> I love this line. I found the line in CVS - it was SUPER expensive, but I tried it. Then I found it on Amazon for much less and branched out to other products. I love all the products so far. The shampoo and conditioner are fantastic. They smell great, leave your hair soft and shiny. So much so my husband commented on my hair the very day I used the S/C and the oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (the shampoo &amp; masque) for the past couple of years now and I can honestly say it has made my hair so much softer and healthier. It&#x27;s a great product! Normally I buy from the actual salon but when I seen the price listing from here I couldn&#x27;t believe it so I just had to purchase, keep in mind for the larger sizes it&#x27;s double the price in the salon then what you pay here so I had to take advantage. However I was completely disappointed! I don&#x27;t know if it was the shampoo or masque, maybe both, but it made my hair feel disgustingly sticky and I noticed I was shedding waaaaaaayyy more than I normally do. The shampoo feels the same but I noticed the masque feels watery and It doesn&#x27;t soak in like normal masque do. Now I&#x27;m reviewing actual reviews from people who actually purchased from this company have said the same so people keep in mind that some of these reviews and this one I&#x27;m writing is a review from the product I purchased here on Amazon however it does not reflect the product you get from the actual salon which is where I&#x27;ll be taking my business back to. Unfortunately&lt;br /&gt;, this price was just to be true. Two stars for the fast shipping and product wrapping.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo/conditioner because I&#x27;m trying to find a sls free shampoo that works well for my fine hair and this product had really good reviews. For whatever reason it left my hair feeling greasy immediately after each use. I tried to get this shampoo to work, but I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I guess this could have been a fluke or manufacturing error, but this shampoo literally had the consistency of scrambled eggs. After I used about a quarter of the bottle, it was so thick I couldn&#x27;t get it to pump out, so I had to unscrew the cap and pound it out into my hand every time I used it. There were little solid bits in it and even trying to water it down did absolutely nothing. I have never seen a shampoo that&#x27;s thicker than its accompanying conditioner, but this is. I ran out of conditioner about twice as fast as I did the shampoo because the conditioner was so thin I had to use a ton of it to coat my hair. Obviously wouldn&#x27;t recommend either product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner! The shampoo feels great (suds up nicely for a sulfate-free product) and the conditioner leaves my hair tangle-free. My scalp psoriasis has also cleared up completely after just a few weeks of use. I would highly recommend DermOrganic hair products.</li>
    <li> Closest I&#x27;ve come to an alternative to Wen. I love Wen but needed to find a less expensive brand that would work. I have kinky/curly hair and this works well. The shampoo cleans without stripping and it doesn&#x27;t take a lot to get the job done. The masque is thick and  leaves my hair well conditioned. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t compete with perfume or scented lotions, etc. that I might wear.</li>
    <li> First time purchasing salon quality shampoo on Amazon and was skeptical. I checked out the consistency of the shampoo and conditioner at a local beauty store just to be sure I was getting the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duo came shrink wrapped and I was pleasantly surprised. Looks and smells exactly as it did in the beauty store. I can&#x27;t speak yet to the effectiveness of the product, but am very pleased about what I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was Brand Names for Less. Fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> My sister told me about these products. It&#x27;s an excellent shampoo/conditioner combo that leaves my hair feeling clean. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for three years now along with the argan oil. I have long straight hair. It&#x27;s difficult to style and it needs nourishing. These products work very well and my hair stays styled much longer but you need the argan oil for that. One criticism is that the shampoo lumps up half way through using the product and does not come through the pump, so I have to dilute it to be able to use it, otherwise half of the bottle would be wasted. But it&#x27;s worth the trouble.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used. My hair is soft again, after years of coloring and just general aging. (I&#x27;m 55). It has a nice, clean scent, too.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist started using this product and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  I have very fine hair and this product does well with adding volume and fullness to my hair.  It also cleans out any styling products I&#x27;ve used without being too harsh.  The Masque provides me the extra conditioner I need since I color my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the smaller size and decided for yourself.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have used dermorganics for 3 years, never any problems.. Ordered it from them and tore my hair apart. Made it beyond dry.</li>
    <li> I used these once and my hair was noticeably softer and had no tangles! The shampoo isn&#x27;t that all conditioning by itself but with the Masque it is an amazing duo! Must try for yourself! :)</li>
    <li> I purchased a duo liter of shampoo and masque, only to receive a duo of shampoo and conditioner. I had never tried the conditioner before, and it does not work for my dry, curly hair. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a huge container of the *wrong product* that I did not intend to purchase. It did not arrive as represented; it was supposed to be the masque.</li>
    <li> Love the product and I received it very promptly after ordering it!  I would suggest this shampoo and conditioner to everyone!</li>
    <li> I tried it at a friends and loved it.  Had to have it for myself.  My hair has not felt this great in a long time</li>
    <li> The first time you use this shampoo and conditioner you will notice a HUGE difference. It is so gentle on your hair and skin, and for someone like me with very sensitive skin it is a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very fine, but also wavy and curly, so I have very specific needs with shampoo. It needs to moisturize so I don&#x27;t get frizzy hair, but it can&#x27;t have a bunch of artificial chemicals or my hair will end up oily. This shampoo is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then as just an added bonus, its natural, rice based, PH balanced and vegan! No animal fats or harsh chemicals and no animal testing! It is more expensive than a bottle of Pantene from Walmart, but it is worth every penny. These are HUGE containers of product, they usually last me about two months.  I would recommend this  to anyone with any kind of hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not contain sulfates which are chemicals called detergents. Alot of people aren&#x27;t aware that a detergent is a chemical that changes the shape of a protein, and a protein&#x27;s function is determined by its shape. So when you change its shape it can no longer preform its function. This is why those chemicals are so dangerous...your skin and hair are made up of proteins...not mention hormones and antibodies are proteins as well. And sulfates are in everything from shampoo to lotion to toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basic anatomy I learned in anatomy class. Not some rant from a hippie living in a forest.</li>
    <li> I am really impressed by this vegan shampoo &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;You pay a little more but it goes a long way in every sense. After only one use, my hair is shiny, softer, and looks healthier looking already.&lt;br /&gt;I am a new fan :)</li>
    <li> I have been washing my hair using a baking soda and vinegar routine for the last 8 months. I have been looking for a shampoo that is safe to use in between the No Poo routines. I love this product! I have thick wavy hair that dries out quickly and frizzes. Since I&#x27;ve switched to the No Poo routine my hair is softer, healthier and less tangled. I will def buy again!</li>
    <li> My new shampoo, I&#x27;m very happy with it, I have no more knots or tangels, and my hair is so soft</li>
    <li> Great product! Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> GOOD PRICE, EXCELLENT PRODUCT :)</li>
    <li> The 5 stars say it all.  Love it.  This shampoo leaves your hair silky smooth.  There is no build up.</li>
    <li> I love this product and this is the best price out there even though it has gone up $10 since I last purchased it. It does last me a long time though. But a 25% price hike is pretty substantial.</li>
    <li> I have used these product for a few years and I always get compliments on how shiny and healthy my hair looks. I actually ran out and decided to try a very expensive sulfate free product. Received that product and it was awful and twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else on my hair but Dermorganic.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shampoo and masque.  So glad that I was able to find it through Amazon at a1/4 of the price I would pay in my town.</li>
    <li> While visiting my sister, I tried this shampoo, and in ONE use, my hair was and still is TOTALLY transformed. My hair is soft, smooth, shiney, everything good. I really can&#x27;t get over the change.&lt;br /&gt;When I told my sister how much I paid for the set on Amazon, her jaw dropped, as her stylist was selling her very small bottles, at &amp;#34;cost,&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t ask what that &amp;#34;cost&amp;#34; was...but judging by her reaction, Amazon blew it out of the water. ;)</li>
    <li> I ordered the two-pack that was to consist of one one-litre shampoo and one one-litre conditioner. I received two shampoos!!!  Since one shampoo lasts me almost a year, I really am not thrilled to have the inconvenience of trying to correct this situation. I need the conditioner! There was no packing slip inside, so I have no customer service number for this vendor. I shop on Amazon.com and other online sites for the convenience. This is now a major INCONVENIENCE to try to correct.  The good news is that the bottles have not leaked during transport. This rating is more about the vendor than the product. I have used Dermorganic Argan products for about two years and obviously like them a lot because I go back for more. I tried Amazon&#x27;s Customer Service \\&quot;help\\&quot; feature and all that happened was that I was in e-mail jail! This has me re-thinking ever ordering from Amazon again. I used a different vendor online (Drugstore.com) and ordered what I needed. I have used them before and so far they have not messed up my orders.</li>
    <li> I would give zero stars if I could. After first use, my hair is greasy, smells bad and I swear, actually appears darker in color...like dull. Truly awful...this junk is going back.</li>
    <li> I tried to go &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; a few years ago and it just never worked for me. As a compromise, I figured I could use organic shampoo. I&#x27;ve used it for several years and have loved it. I recently noticed that I hadn&#x27;t had ANY issues with dandruff since I started using this shampoo - which had always been a problem during winter months. My mom has had scalp issues for years and has had all kinds of treatments for varying conditions including scalp injections for psoriasis. She still had horrible dandruff and flaky scalp issues. I ordered this set for Christmas (it&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper on Amazon than my local TJMaxx) and within a week she called and said her scalp problems had disappeared. She was shocked. She even called her dermatologist to report how well these shampoos worked. She&#x27;s convinced that she was allergic to an ingredient in normal shampoos. Now she has no problems.</li>
    <li> Since my family included me have super dry skin, I ordered this. I could tell the different first time we used.  I don&#x27;t think we can change to other products.</li>
    <li> Love it! I love the fact it has no sulfates. I have hair down to my but. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner combo in INCREDIBLE. Our household has been trying to go to Organic products as much as possible due to allergies some family members are experiencing. I really love that this shampoo as lathers just like every other shampoo on the market but this one does not make our scalps itch AT ALL and it&#x27;s Organic. I&#x27;m very pleased with the conditioner as it moisturizes but does not weigh down the hair. Overall, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the DermOrganic shampoo but this is the first I have used the Masque and I just love it!! It is better than the daily conditioner. My hair is so silky soft and shiny, more than before and I wouldn&#x27;t have thought it possible! I also tried a soap-less brand that has been advertised a lot lately and it didn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair; in fact my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft and felt coated, for lack of a better description;  so I am sticking with my DermOrganic cause I already have the best there is out there.</li>
    <li> The results are very good so far. It is good for short and long hair: makes it smooth, detangling fine hair well. It is especially good for normal and dry hair. I was hoping that mine would hold longer than 2 days without washing, it is probably not for that kind of hair that tend to be greasy. But no complaints: feels nice and smooth. I am happy that my man absolutely loves it. It was a great choice or him.</li>
    <li> I am challenged when it comes to hair skills but I used the DermOrganic styling mousse and loved it. I just finally received my order for the shampoo and conditioner and I expect I will love them also. Shipping took longer than expected. Tracking showed it was in my city on the 16th but wasn&#x27;t actually delivered until the afternoon of the 19th. Even factoring in the weekend that seems a bit excessive.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and is always a great product.  x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
    <li> this is the second time i have bought this.  it works great.  I&#x27;m allergic to sulfa and it is getting so hard to find anything that is sulfa free.  this is a little bit spendy but well worth it so that my head don&#x27;t hurt to touch it because of being allergic to the other.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair products I have all my clients using this now and have re ordered for myself because nothing else works this well. I love the price too!</li>
    <li> After I tried Avalon shampoo which didn&#x27;t lather at all, I spent more than $40 for this set.. First week was good. Lathers well and smells good...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of sudden I started to have pimples on my neck near hair line.. Then got spread to forehead and everywhere on my face. I thought make up or food.. I have a dry skin and rarely have pimples.. I stopped using this shampoo and all pimples are gone... What is wrong with this product? I read reviews in Amazon to make purchase and now I&#x27;m more careful than ever...</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have every found for my dry, wavy hair!  It washes thoroughly, without using very much, but does not strip out the oil from my hair.  The conditioner moisturizers without being greasy.  The scent is natural and not overwhelming.  I also use it on my older kids, works great on them, too and has only healthy ingredients.  Can&#x27;t be beat and excellent value, last forever.</li>
    <li> With blonde highlights in my hair, it seemed to strip the color out, making my hair look and feel brassy.  I used twice, then returned to my fav shampoo by John Frieda.  No I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair a birds nest. Had to buy Abba to fix the damage</li>
    <li> This shampoo lathers up really well and even more the second time around. The hair masque repairs and strengthens my strands like nothing before. However, the pumps may notr work well so keep the ones from your old Dermorganic ones.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the lustrous shine it leaves! It smells great and foams nicely. I find the results better than shampoos for which I&#x27;ve paid nearly twice as much.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! But I did buy this exact duo at Fred Meyer for $34.99. This price is outrageous.</li>
    <li> The product was purchased for my daughter who has long natural curled hair.  She really likes the product and states her hair has become healthier and more manageable since using it.&lt;br /&gt;Ordering the product through Amazon was incredibly easy and the item was shipped and received faster than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s time for more DermOrganic, we will be ordering from Amazon again! ! !</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom, since she wanted a shampoo that works well with hair color. The organic shampoo i was using didnt work for her as it removed the hair color much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally found this one and it is very good. It goes well with hair color and also makes the hair smooth. I&#x27;m not sure if it helps with hair fall, but it certainly doesnt make is worst.The masque is nothing but conditioner. The product quantity is pretty good. For one person, it can come upto 2-3 months, if you use it everyday. For my mom, she has a medium hair and uses it twice a week, this came for about 4- 41/2 months.I just re-ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a very good product,if you are looking for an organic shampoo for colored hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product buuut the shampoo had opened and overflowed everywhere. All the same. Stoked</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different products over the years and this is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s very gentle on my hair. I feel that after I use the product my hair is fuller and not weighed down (no frizz either!). I don&#x27;t feel like I lose as much hair either as far as it breaking and just falling out. It doesn&#x27;t seem like I get split ends as frequently anymore either. I also use their hair serum, which spells wonderful. I use a lot of heat on my hair and this stuff really keeps my hair in good shape. It takes some time to adjust to the fact that it doesn&#x27;t lather like shampoos &amp; conditioners from the store, but after you do adjust I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever go back!</li>
    <li> I first came across DermOrganic&#x27;s hair care products at my local discount store so I was skeptical.  Then I saw the big bottles and read the list of natural ingredients.  I bought it because it is Sulfate-Free and has Argan oil in it.  I&#x27;ve had good results from products without artificial ingredients.  Plus this duo has a pleasant light natural smell.  It cleans my scalp well (even after sports) but does not dry it out (which is important because I have hair and skin that&#x27;s on the dry side).  After washing with the shampoo, I use the conditioner and leave in for a few minutes before rinsing with warm-to-cool water.  I do not use blow dryers - just air dry.  It&#x27;s been at least a year that I have been using this shampoo and conditioner - I get over 6 months use out of the large bottles and am very satisfied.  My hair is now able to grow longer than ever because I am not getting as much breakage! Both ladies and men have complimented me for my long healthy hair.  My Amazon order was shipped safely to me with no breakage and I was pleased to see how the person that packed it used some bubble wrap around the pump tops and rubber banded them on.  Then sealed that into a large plastic zippered bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a convert from Wen. I used it for 2 years and I thought it was wonderful until trying this! Even better! By far! Best products ever! 10 stars! No frizz! So soft! Wonderful! Affordable! I love that it lathers! I can&#x27;t say enough fabulous things about it!</li>
    <li> This is a really good deal for me since I paid this same price for less then half the product at the beauty shop. *I have thin and coarse hair and LOTS of it. It&#x27;s slightly wavey and usually frizzy. I can&#x27;t die my hair (allergies) and I don&#x27;t use any heat on it. I&#x27;m also caucasian. I tend to get dandruff and oily roots, and split dry ends. Ya, it&#x27;s that bad. I also have server skin allergies to some chemicals and dies. I can&#x27;t use any of the store brands and a lot of the salon brands the added perfume makes me ill. I&#x27;ve used every single brand at my local Health Shop (Earth Fare), several online, farmers markets, and just other shops. None really worked for my hair, most broke my skin out in a rash and/ or left my hair dry or oily. It is a war for good hair care! I&#x27;ve tried well over 50 brands in 5 years.I found this recently at an Ulta (beauty supply shop). Figured I&#x27;d give it a go (I got a free travel bag full of goodies too). Well I must say I am amazed at the results! No rash! No oil! No dandruff! No dryness or split ends! Just soft soft wavey hair!!! XD I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s not the worst I&#x27;ve smelled but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s pleasant to me. But I tried the leave in treatment with argan oil (in the free travel bag, same brand), and it covers the smell and is very pleasant! Plus it helps with the fly alway frizz, speeds up dry time, and makes my hair really shiny! I would highly recommend it with this set! Overall very happy!!!</li>
    <li> This is my second order from Amazon. I love the size since I tend to go through shampoo and conditioner very quickly.  I think the price is good for a sulfate free/silicone free duo too. Don&#x27;t let the simple packaging fool you into thinking its low quality. The shampoo lathers very well for being organic and the conditioner is thick and moisturizing. My hair is wavy/frizzy. It helps smooth it out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this shampoo, but it leaves my hair very dull and dingy looking. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Ok so I have tried other gluten free, para-ban free, sulfate free shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. This Shampoo and Masque smells great! It doesn&#x27;t lather like a typical shampoo but this is a good thing! It actually cleans the scalp and is very gentle. I have had psoriasis since I was a baby. In between using prescription shampoo&#x27;s I need to clean my scalp because the plaque builds up. It doesn&#x27;t strip my hair like the prescription shampoo. It keeps my scalp clean and there is no gross smell from tars etc. It takes a while (1 month) for the scalp to get adjusted to natural shampoo. But wow what a difference! I have only had to use the prescription steroid shampoo 2x a month in comparison to 2x a week!</li>
    <li> Shampoo feels a little watery.. I&#x27;m doubting the authenticity.  But the masque is ok.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner  I have found that does not irritate my scalp with gluten containing ingredients. It leaves your hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine hair and it very long. I use this product everyday! I leaves my hair soft and shiny and makes brushing easier. My hair breaks away or snaps when I brush. (due to it being so fine) I can&#x27;t say it makes it stronger, but it makes brushing knots out much better.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products!! They are a great price and I received them quickly. I no longer use any other shampoo/conditioner because this leaves my hair so healthy.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Only shampoo that does not make my scalp itch.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner that I have ever used.  My hair feels thicker and healthier.  I love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with coarse, dried out hair. At the time, I thought it was normal for my hair to feel so dried out and become super greasy, super fast. I ignorantly washed my hair every day with sulfate shampoos in attempts to get rid of all the grease, but my hair already felt gross by the end of the day. After stumbling upon one these at Marshalls, I decided to give it a shot. I used to hate my hair for being so thick because it meant I had to deal with more brittle hair. Now, my hair feels awesome; the difference in shine and strength isn&#x27;t amazing, but I can definitely say that I can go 2-3 days without washing my hair and it wont grease up like it used to. In California, the shampoo bottle cost twenty bucks in stores, so I think ~$40 is a good price for both bottles/shipping.</li>
    <li> Mediocre quality,  don&#x27;t buy...</li>
    <li> I bought these products as part of a sample pack over the holiday season at ULTA. I just now got around to trying them and BOY, do I wish I&#x27;d done it sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had scalp issues (dry, flaky, itchy) for as long as I can remember, so I&#x27;d been using an all natural plant-based shampoo/conditioner duo with tea tree oil. While this may have helped my scalp a little, the drying effect it had on my very fine hair was not worth it. After three days of using the DermOrganic products now, I&#x27;m seeing not only a great change in my scalp, but my hair also. It&#x27;s the dead of winter in MT and my hair isn&#x27;t static clinging to everything?? Amazing! I can&#x27;t wait to use this product long term and see my hair improve even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is what impressed me the most. Although it doesn&#x27;t suds up, you can hear the air bubbles in there, and as you massage it in, it goes all the way to the scalp. In order for other shampoos to get all the way to the scalp, it takes some work. It also leaves my hair feeling so soft I sometimes don&#x27;t even condition (unheard of for me and my hair)</li>
    <li> A good product. Very gentle to my hair even if I use it every day. Free from chemicals that are harmful to our body.</li>
    <li> this product came with the masque leaking out :( otherwise great product.. work on the packaging!!</li>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy hair and to make matters worse I color it at home...that being said this shampoo does leave my hair feeling A LOT softer but it does nothing to actually tame the frizz. I think b/c it doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals in other shampoos/conditioners that leave a coating on your hair. I put argan oil in my hair while it is still wet and then when dry I will add a little more for a bit of shine and frizz control. I use the elma&amp;sana argan oil...it is only $9! on amazon. My hair still looks great even when I don&#x27;t use conditioner. I&#x27;m also a big fan of the Loreal ever pure series... a much lower price[[ASIN:B001P24STQ L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]]</li>
    <li> The price is a great value. I haven&#x27;t used yet as I am finishing up my supply from the hairdresser.</li>
    <li> My hair started falling out with this stuff. Maybe it&#x27;s common when you change products, but wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went back to the cheap stuff and no more issues. Note: this product isn&#x27;t organic. Not that it matters apparently.</li>
    <li> Love this duo. Excellent quality. My hair is happy :)</li>
    <li> My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
    <li> We have been using this (on our kids too) for several months &amp; we really like it.</li>
    <li> I have a makeup and beauty channel called GladazzleBeauty on YouTube and DermOrganic sent me some of their hair care products to try and review. I was pleasantly surprised by their products. It worked out good because at the time I was having itchy scalp and dandruff issues and these products cleared it right up. I currently regularly use the shampoo, conditioner and leave in hair treatment. I also occasionally use the weekly masque and the spray leave in treatment. I really enjoy all of the products and the ends of my hair thank me for it. They were so dry prior to using these products. The products have a nice fresh fragrance that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive scalp. I would definitely recommend them.

    <li> I never had any preference with shampoos, just mainly picked ones that smelled good. Now this is the only shampoo/conditioner I will buy! The main reason I love it is that I noticed I didn&#x27;t have clumps of hair on the drain after showering. I have a lot of hair &amp; I thought it was normal for all that hair to fall out every time I took a shower. Then I start using this &amp; I might have one strand of hair come out. I am sold on this product &amp; will never use any of those harsh shampoos anymore!</li>
    <li> I recently switched from Pantene Pro-V to DermOrganics and I am very happy.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather up a lot/really at all, but you don&#x27;t need lather for clean hair.  I was doubtful at first but after a month of use, I think it&#x27;s great.  I dye my hair blonde to dark brown and it&#x27;s even better for my color than the Pantene (in my eyes).  I use two pumps of shampoo and four pumps of conditioner and love it.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pumps, but I am fairly gently on them. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I do love this product. My whole family uses Dermorganics shampoo and masque (conditioner), and we feel better about not uaing products with chemicals, sulfates, and parabens! The only thing I would suggest is lowering the amount of &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; placed in it. It is wonderful for our hair (and mine WAS wirey and dry) but the smell is too strong. It does smell like I just left the salon and thescent is pleasant, but it is a bit too strong.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> The BEST hair products I have EVER used. Seriously. I have difficult hair that drys out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my dry frizzy relaxed hair. Pleasant smell. Masque needs to be more moisturizing. I&#x27;ll continue my hunt for a good sulfate free product!</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel gummy and gross. Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy something better. And to top it off it smells really bad!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is now all I use as a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner. I love it! I have only slightly tempermental hair (sort of average but tends to frizz quite a lot in the humidity) and my husband&#x27;s is very fine and this works great for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that occasionally the product has leaked into the bag it is shipped inside of making it kind of messy, and once in a while the pump needs some extra encouragement to open and function properly.</li>
    <li> I really liked how this comes in huge sizes because this is really a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I really liked this duo -- especially because it doesn&#x27;t have any bad chemicals in it. However, after a few weeks of use it really dried out my scalp. I&#x27;m planning on using them to the bottom because I am a poor college student, but I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase. I love the idea behind this product, and would definitely buy from this brand again, but they need to reformulate and add more moisturizers. I don&#x27;t have oily hair/scalp issues, so maybe if you do this would work well for you!</li>
    <li> Someone complained in a review that they thought the smell was awful. Either they got a bad bottle or they hate the smell of spas. The scent reminds me of going to a spa and getting my hair washed and my scalp massaged. Everyone wants to take that experience home with them through a bottle of product they associate with the spa. This smells just like bottles I&#x27;ve bought and you get a lot of it. I also read reviews from someone who had tight wavy hair and said it left her hair dry. First, one has to consider the type of hair they have and type of water they have as well how often they use products and straighten it. My mother dyes her hair a lot and it&#x27;s very dry. No shampoo is going to make it feel incredible. This will however clean her hair quite well. Hair like that needs hot oils. I have somewhat of a medium thickness, regular dryness or medium oily hair but it does get oily every other day. This shampoo completely cleans it. As any conditioner I&#x27;ve used, I can&#x27;t add it to hair on my scalp. It gets oily faster. I also have hard water and my hair stays pretty soft with this.&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice is that you must know your hair and how it responds to your water, products and weather. You must know what it requires. If you feel your hair is just too dry after washing it, you may need more than just shampoo to help but keep in mind, this is a &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo compared to the store bought junk which contains lots of chemicals that can mess up your hormones. Same happens with extra products used on hair. This shampoo strips my hair of oil and any products I&#x27;ve used and the conditioner works well against my hard water. The smell is wonderful too!</li>
    <li> I am not impressed while it definitely cleans hair it smells awful and I find it drying. I have used on myself and two daughters we all have different hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good for any of our heads!</li>
    <li> After using this for about a month, I can honestly say my hair feels and looks much healthier. It&#x27;s also much softer, which has allowed me to just blow dry my hair instead of straightening it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural shampoos and conditioners and Dermorganic is by far the best. My hair looks great and I don&#x27;t need to flat iron it to get rid of the frizz. The bottles are huge and will last me ages, and I&#x27;ve had no issue with the pumps.</li>
    <li> This combo shampoo and conditioner is amazing! I love the way my hair looks and feels and there are no sulfates, which is even better when trying to be healthy. The shipping was fast. Only complaint is the pump for the conditioner won&#x27;t work, which is a huge hassle.</li>
    <li> Love these products.  I&#x27;ve been using them for at least 3 years now.  My hair dresser recommended the shampoo because it doesn&#x27;t make the coloring in my hair fade and I love the masque (conditioner) because it makes my hair feel like silk which is hard to do when you have curly hair but this does the trick.</li>
