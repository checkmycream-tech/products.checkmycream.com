      <li>Same good stuff as always!</li>
      <li>(the scent was way too strong, I can&#x27;t find any reviews that say the product formula changed) and I don&#x27;t think what was put in the bottle was sulfate free, which I realized before it touched my hair, thank goodness.</li>
      <li>I tried Enjoy after running out of the brand of shampoo</li>
      <li>And - it is CHEAP on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Use with the conditioner AND the Enjoy hair oil.  </li>
      <li>I have used Enjoy products for years and know them well.</li>
      <li>I would also prefer it to be paraben free.</li>
      <li>It is sulfate free.</li>
      <li>The combination of all three products made my hair fabulous and have a lot of bounce and shine.</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy!</li>
      <li>great product for my very dry hair</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Shampoo is very watery for an Enjoy product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle, leaves my hair smooth and I like the way it smells.  </li>
      <li>Now it is extremely healthy and shinny and not dry.</li>
      <li>my kids take swimming lessons and its hard to get the chlorine/odor off, but this shampoo works great for that.</li>
      <li>I love this hair product, it&#x27;s not watered down, smells very nice,leaves my hair clean and shiny!</li>
      <li>purchased this at a local salon for more money than on Amazon (now I&#x27;ll be restocking from Amazon).</li>
      <li>I literally noticed after the first use of this product.</li>
      <li>This is a great hydrating shampoo, especially for hair like mine that tends to get dry.</li>
      <li>My hair felt stiff afterwards and needed a good conditioner.</li>
      <li>But after a few weeks my hair looks very healthy and shinny.</li>
      <li>is to use a BOAR HAIR BRUSH and a large tooth comb, wash with this shampoo and comb in the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I like the scent just fine personally.</li>
      <li>I use it with the hydrating conditioner and hair oil, so my hair is always soft and I rarely have problems with the humidity in the air.</li>
      <li>well, I am in total disagreement with the negatives about Enjoy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating, gentle hair cleaner.</li>
      <li>I have very dry hair and only need to wash it twice a week, leaves it clean and healthy, not dried out.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used enjoy for a long time and this didn&#x27;t smell like it</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weight it down and is gentle on the color.</li>
      <li>, this isnt right at all and want my money back !!</li>
      <li>I buy enjoy products all the time and this shampoo just seemed watered down to me...</li>
      <li>I always buy the larger version of shampoos because it typically won&#x27;t cost much more</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of hydration to keep my hair from getting dry without feeling greasy or losing body.  </li>
      <li>Was finishing an older bottle and starting this new one and the shampoo in this bottle was significantly watered down.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, that I straighten every day.</li>
      <li>This keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My hair is colored professionally every month and this shampoo does not lift the dye from my hair.</li>
      <li>This system makes me look like I have the hair of a 20 year old.  </li>
      <li>Either way I am really sad, I loved this</li>
      <li>I usually buy the Luxury shampoo by Enjoy and regretted trying to switch.</li>
      <li>Take your wiry hair back to shiny, soft young hair.  </li>
      <li>After using it once I noticed a major change in the way my hair felt.</li>
      <li>I decided to forgo buying my usual shampoo, Sudzz, since Enjoy is less expensive and produced great results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
      <li>I have straight naturally blonde hair and it tends to get quite dry and get split ends.</li>
      <li>After I wash, condition, and dry my hair, I usually flat iron it to give it a soft look.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I ordered my product it was in stock. 4 days later they finally tell me it is not in stock. They should have known it was not in stock.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo. It moisturizes without adding build up, smells great and leaves your hair feeling so clean and shiny. I have find, dyed blonde hair and this is a shampoo I come back to again and again. I have been using Enjoy products for YEARS and love them all but this one is a stand out.</li>
    <li> Best stuff.  Use with the conditioner AND the Enjoy hair oil.  Take your wiry hair back to shiny, soft young hair.  I am 44 with two kids and terribly wiry hair after they were born.  This system makes me look like I have the hair of a 20 year old.  I am constantly being told I look years younger today because of my hair.  And - it is CHEAP on Amazon. Thanks Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I am going to leave my 5 star rating, but sadly I can no longer use this product. Both the shampoo and conditioner contain both SOY and WHEAT. The ingredient list is cut short or has changed since this one posted online. I kept having a rash all over my face and finally figured out what product I was using that had allergens, it is this one. I didn&#x27;t used to have any problems so maybe they have changed the ingredients. Either way I am really sad, I loved this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a local salon for more money than on Amazon (now I&#x27;ll be restocking from Amazon). This product is amazing. I have straight naturally blonde hair and it tends to get quite dry and get split ends. Now it is extremely healthy and shinny and not dry. I literally noticed after the first use of this product. I have been using this a month now and my hair has never been prettier. I have begun to use it on my daughter as well and had the same results. I&#x27;ve done some research and if you have hair like mine the best regimen  is to use a BOAR HAIR BRUSH and a large tooth comb, wash with this shampoo and comb in the conditioner. Rinse out and follow with a cold water rinse so your hair is shinny. Never use those plastic stiff brushes they ruin your hair... for years I had no idea. If you do this you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like citrus/oranges. I like the scent just fine personally. I don&#x27;t like perfume smelling products as I am often allergic, I am not allergic to this.</li>
    <li> I tried Enjoy after running out of the brand of shampoo I thought I&#x27;d always use, and now I&#x27;ve switched.  It has just the right amount of hydration to keep my hair from getting dry without feeling greasy or losing body.  It&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> I got this shampoo since my trainer swears by it with the Brazilian Keratin treatment.  I was not so impressed.  My hair felt stiff afterwards and needed a good conditioner. Did not love it.</li>
    <li> Have been ordering this item from Amazon for quite some time.  Excellent!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great hydrating shampoo, especially for hair like mine that tends to get dry. I think I got a good deal on amazon.com. I got the 33.8 oz version for about $33 total, which includes the shipping. I always buy the larger version of shampoos because it typically won&#x27;t cost much more and I won&#x27;t run out of shampoo for a long while. I just started using this product based on a sample I obtained from my sister. I love how this product makes my hair feel and it is also so mangable. I decided to forgo buying my usual shampoo, Sudzz, since Enjoy is less expensive and produced great results. After I wash, condition, and dry my hair, I usually flat iron it to give it a soft look.  The other products that I use with this shampoo are Moroccan Oil Restorative Hair Mask (the orange lid) and Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment. I used to use the Moraccan Oil treatment, but the treatment from Agadir is half the price and you don&#x27;t even pay shipping. It is similar to the Moroccan Oil treatment and might even be a little bit larger in size. I bought everything from amazon.com. By the way, if you use the treatment, only use very little. Put a couple of drops in your hand and rub both handles together and concentrate placing the treatment from the middle of our hair to the ends. If you hit the scalp, it might feel oily and you don&#x27;t need it there. Concentrate on your ends.  The combination of all three products made my hair fabulous and have a lot of bounce and shine. I tried it once without the other products and it still works well. I just find these other products add a lot to the equation, so I tend to use them together.  My hair has a tendency to get dry, but it does not get dry with this product. I think you always should use some sort of treatment, mask, or conditioner after shampooing to get the best result. This shampoo suds, but not a lot, so I washed my hair twice so it would suds more. I color my hair regularly because I have a lot of gray. This product seems to keep my hair color intact without drying out my hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works great for hair that has been chemically straightened and color treated hair.  Gentle and leaves hair smelling good.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for several years now and would not be tempted to change.  I have very dry hair and only need to wash it twice a week, leaves it clean and healthy, not dried out.</li>
    <li> I buy enjoy products all the time and this shampoo just seemed watered down to me... I usually buy the Luxury shampoo by Enjoy and regretted trying to switch. Returned this shampoo for refund.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have lots of fine hair and this product doesn&#x27;t weight it down and is gentle on the color.</li>
    <li> My shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 years. It gives my hair body and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. It is sulfate free. My hairdresser suggested it to me and I&#x27;ve used it since, I would prefer that it cost less but it is concentrated. I would also prefer it to be paraben free.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel rough while you are washing it ! But after a few weeks my hair looks very healthy and shinny. Love this product !</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and this one is like water and no shampoo, this isnt right at all and want my money back !!&lt;br /&gt;This isnt right to do to a customer at all!!! I am having to use Triple the amount every time i wash my hair !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seal was even broken when i received it so im not sure what is going on with this product but its not RIGHT at all</li>
    <li> I have switched to WEN hair products</li>
    <li> Very hydrating, gentle hair cleaner. Great value too!</li>
    <li> my kids take swimming lessons and its hard to get the chlorine/odor off, but this shampoo works great for that.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans my hair and doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair color.  I use it with the hydrating conditioner and hair oil, so my hair is always soft and I rarely have problems with the humidity in the air.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! My hair feels soft and looks shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> I have this product and I love it!!! I have naturally curly hair, that I straighten every day. So you can Imaged how dry and damaged it is. After using it once I noticed a major change in the way my hair felt. It&#x27;s softer and it has a nice shine to it.  I&#x27;ll be buying this shampoo and conditioner more often :)</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly.  Same good stuff as always!</li>
    <li> I love Enjoy shampoo and conditioner! My hair was getting dried out from the coloring and styling I can constantly putting it through. This keeps my hair soft and shiny. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Always purchase the duo from Amazon and very happy with the Shampoo/Conditioner. Been using product for about 1 year now and it has my a world of difference in my hair. The bottles seem to last forever and I love that it is sulfate free. Great packaging, fast delivery and recommended product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the same product the salon I go to uses. I love having it on auto ship. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> No sulfur so that is a great plus in my book</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo that works on my hair. No fly away or frizzy ends when I use my ionic hair dryer with it!</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very watery for an Enjoy product. I will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Watered down. Was finishing an older bottle and starting this new one and the shampoo in this bottle was significantly watered down. No wonder it was inexpensive. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with almost all products bought from Amazon, but NOT this one. I have used Enjoy products for years and know them well. This is like water coming from the bottle. It pours through my fingers as I try to catch some to put onto my hair. This company needs to review where they buy this or stop watering it themselves. Do Not purchase.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product without prior knowledge of reviews listed here. About to reorder and decided to read critiques...well, I am in total disagreement with the negatives about Enjoy shampoo and conditioner. They  are absolutely FAB!!!!  My hair is colored professionally every month and this shampoo does not lift the dye from my hair. My hair looks and feels amazing. So many compliments since I began using Enjoy products.  (Hydrating Shampoo &amp; Conditioner)  you owe it to yourself to  give it a try!!!!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday to shampoo my hair while showering.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.  I&#x27;m allergic to sulfa, so thought this would be a good choice &amp; it&#x27;s been excellent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is perfect.  And I have found that my hair color does last longer.  Lathers well, so not much is needed.  A great value.  Also, scent is great. I have been using this shampoo for approximately 2 years, and use no other.</li>
    <li> great product for my very dry hair</li>
    <li> love enjoy products for my hair!!!</li>
    <li> The product was either mixed or swapped with another product. I&#x27;ve used enjoy for a long time and this didn&#x27;t smell like it (the scent was way too strong, I can&#x27;t find any reviews that say the product formula changed) and I don&#x27;t think what was put in the bottle was sulfate free, which I realized before it touched my hair, thank goodness.</li>
    <li> I love this hair product, it&#x27;s not watered down, smells very nice,leaves my hair clean and shiny!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4-5 years and I still love it.  Buying it in bulk size saves $$$.  I need something without sulfates as I color my hair and sulfates will strip the color.  It&#x27;s gentle, leaves my hair smooth and I like the way it smells.  A big thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Always LOVE ENJOY products!</li>
</ol>
