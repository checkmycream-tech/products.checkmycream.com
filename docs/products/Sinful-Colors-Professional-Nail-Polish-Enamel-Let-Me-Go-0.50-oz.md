### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If this is what your looking for its perfect.</li>
      <li>Sinful colors is a great polish!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something translucent, this is perfect.</li>
      <li>So based on the bottle here, I thought I was getting an awesome, multi tonal color for my nails.</li>
      <li>Great color!</li>
      <li>Seller transaction was great!</li>
      <li>LOVE this nail polish!!!  </li>
      <li>When I saw it on Amazon, my joy returned.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
      <li>Might be good for that.</li>
      <li>Even buying at the bargain drugstore price, this polish isn&#x27;t a good value.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love Sinful Colors brand!</li>
      <li>Light color still looks great.</li>
      <li>, hyperbole aside, this color is beautiful on its own, as i reacts to the light and the shade never seems to be just one color; add a couple more coats for a more drastic effect.</li>
      <li>and it still looks as great as when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>get so many compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.</li>
      <li>Love the polish &amp; it lasts well.</li>
      <li>It works ok as a top coat over another darker color, but I was hoping it would look how it does in the bottle.</li>
      <li>But on nails, you&#x27;d be better off using acrylic paint.</li>
      <li>I love the shimmer to the color when it catches the light.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product and I would recommend buying it.</li>
      <li>This also looks wonderful as the top coat over a dark color in the same cool tones that make up the elements of the tonal shift in this color; your greens, silvers, blues, purples, &amp; even pearls.</li>
      <li>purple color, it is very transparent making for only a good topcoat.</li>
      <li>Cute but clear..</li>
      <li>If you build up the coats to a more or less opaque appearance, it is especially pretty.</li>
      <li>I also love that the color has lasted a very long time without chipping.</li>
      <li>Too much money..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color, but it is rather sheer</li>
      <li>so I added another coat which made it stand out a little more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very unique color that can be worn year round.</li>
      <li>I personally like to paint my nails an opaque color such as hot pink and layer this on top to give it a faceted effect.</li>
      <li>When I got it I immediately put it on and found that it was very sheer but a pretty color nonetheless.</li>
      <li>It need a clear base to protect your nails but the color is a surprising lovely pale pink&lt;br /&gt; that changes as the light hits it.  </li>
      <li>Instead, it&#x27;s basically clear.</li>
      <li>Still have two bottles left thanks to Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The polish came pretty quickly, not sure exactly how long but a week or less.</li>
      <li>Subtle, beautiful and different, unfortunately it has been discontinued.  </li>

    <li> Sinful colors is a great polish! i use it all the time for my home nail art! BUT BUY IT AT WALMART FOR ONLY $1.79</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color, but it is rather sheer so I added another coat which made it stand out a little more. I love the shimmer to the color when it catches the light. I also love that the color has lasted a very long time without chipping. It&#x27;s a week  and a half later and it still looks as great as when I first put it on.</li>
    <li> Cute but clear.. Not what you expect</li>
    <li> LOVE this nail polish!!!  It&#x27;s a very unique color that can be worn year round.</li>
    <li> Too much money.. i buy this sinful nail polish at walgreens for 1.99</li>
    <li> The polish came pretty quickly, not sure exactly how long but a week or less. When I got it I immediately put it on and found that it was very sheer but a pretty color nonetheless.

    <li> Love the polish &amp; it lasts well.</li>
    <li> Light color still looks great.</li>
    <li> I love Sinful Colors brand! By the picture I thought I was getting a &amp;#34;pearly&amp;#34; purple color, it is very transparent making for only a good topcoat. If this is what your looking for its perfect. Seller transaction was great!</li>
    <li> Still have two bottles left thanks to Amazon.  It need a clear base to protect your nails but the color is a surprising lovely pale pink&lt;br /&gt; that changes as the light hits it.  Subtle, beautiful and different, unfortunately it has been discontinued.  Hope the company brings it back.&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great color!</li>
    <li> these nail polishes are sold at 1.99 at any drug store or walmart! no need to spend $7 on one when you can get about 4 different colors!</li>
    <li> So based on the bottle here, I thought I was getting an awesome, multi tonal color for my nails. Instead, it&#x27;s basically clear. You can see the different colors some, but it&#x27;s not like it looks in the bottle. It works ok as a top coat over another darker color, but I was hoping it would look how it does in the bottle. If you&#x27;re looking for something translucent, this is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this color, previously, but then could no longer find it.

    <li> Too thick to go on evenly, even with the lightest of touches. Even buying at the bargain drugstore price, this polish isn&#x27;t a good value. Unless you want a craft supply. Might be good for that. But on nails, you&#x27;d be better off using acrylic paint.</li>
