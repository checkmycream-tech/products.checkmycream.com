      <li>I&#x27;m glad bath and body works still carries this.</li>

      <li>/&gt;I will be purchasing more very soon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s got a sweet and flowery cent, yet very distinct from all the others.</li>
      <li>Okay, let&#x27;s get one thing straight.</li>
      <li>Fragrance Mist. was loved by my teen daughter who ordered it</li>
      <li>Love it, has a very yummy berry scent.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this light, sweet scent for summer, buy it!</li>
      <li>If its your first time buying a fragrance mist and youre looking for a fresh clean smell definetely look for something else</li>
      <li>Great product and was delivered much faster than expected</li>
      <li>shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>He did right away</li>
      <li>, this product remindse me of the sweet smells of Summertime in Hawaii after the rain in midday afternoon (think sweet smells of flowers in humid weather after the rain, basking in the sun), paired with a slight tropical kick of sweet fruit (light tropical scent), and a hint of sass (aka spice?).</li>
      <li>highly recommend it to any woman who well, just wants to spice up their day and put a smile on your (and perhaps someone special?)</li>
      <li>I plan order some more for gifts in future from this company.</li>

      <li>This is the first scent I bought</li>
      <li>The word spreads fast!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to purchase scented products online when you can&#x27;t test them, so I&#x27;ll do my best to describe the scent (or you can test it at Bath &amp; Body Works (Signature Collection), then buy it here because of the competitive price...</li>
      <li>I purchased it in the beginning of May and through people begging to use it and my own obsession with it, the bottle&#x27;s nearly empty!</li>
      <li>I feel like I got ripped off honestly from locally than ordering directly.</li>
      <li>The BODY SPRAY Is Just Like The Seller Described;-)  THANKS;-)</li>
      <li>I liked the fruity smell of the spray, which I usually don&#x27;t, but honestly once you spray it on (which lasts a very long time)</li>
      <li>Smells really good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast and the bottle was</li>
      <li>It is so much cheaper on here</li>
      <li>,I can&#x27;t place my finger on it really</li>
      <li>Got it on time and it smell really good🌹</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Very pleased with my savings from gas and time and diff saved money on this one rare gem that I can&#x27;t hardly find anymore here locally.  </li>
      <li>This is such a soft, clean scent.</li>
      <li>it has a hint of a higher end perfume, which I like especially for the price!</li>
      <li>I was excited to get this because of the reviews and a lot people seemed to love it sadly that was not the case for me</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the exact same body spray .</li>

      <li>I love this stuff it smells so sweet but not so sweet that it&#x27;s sickening.</li>
      <li>I have used it several times and i still have very plenty left, the smell is pretty long lasting</li>
      <li>, I have the old one left over and compared</li>
      <li>It smells like the typical higher end perfumes.</li>
      <li>On an average day, I get two or three people that actually stop me and say that I &amp;#34;smell really good&amp;#34;.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s perfect and arrived early. My favorite bath and body works perfum I hate that you can only buy it online now but it&#x27;s a couple dollars cheaper this way anyways</li>

    <li> This is such a soft, clean scent. My husband, friends and family have all said how great it smells. Its even great to spray in a room as an air freshner. Would buy from again!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh, this perfume is absolutely fantastic. If you&#x27;ve never smelled it before, buy it, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll fall in love with it.

On an average day, I get two or three people that actually stop me and say that I &amp;#34;smell really good&amp;#34;. (I know that sounds quite weird, but It&#x27;s the weird truth). This perfume is perfect for anyone in the high school age. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I love getting a great deal at Amazon even more. I would highly recommend this light, sweet scent for summer, buy it!</li>
    <li> Smells amazing what an amazing purchase. Thank you</li>
    <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get one thing straight. I never write reviews but this just blew me away.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast and the bottle was undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;The look of the bottle is beautiful and exactly like he picture.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is beyond amazing. This is the first scent I bought and I can honestly say I WILL be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten compliments about this and everyone asks me where I bought it from.&lt;br /&gt;Great product :)</li>
    <li> The smell is really nice! I have used it several times and i still have very plenty left, the smell is pretty long lasting i would definetly buy again !</li>

I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, I purchased this product via Bath and Body Works, on sale from their signature collection. I bought it along with the matching lotion and shower gel. I believe there is also a body wash as well. Anyway, I purchased it to pamper myself on a seldom weekend spent with my sweetheart and I felt that I wanted/needed to treat myself like a woman this weekend, not only as a mother, student, co-worker, etc, etcetera you get the idea. I loved it and hoped he would notice the difference. He did right away and he&#x27;s recommended it to his friends as gifts for their spouse/girlfriends as gift ideas. The word spreads fast! :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I found a great distributor and a competitive price on Amazon, I buy it from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to any woman who well, just wants to spice up their day and put a smile on your (and perhaps someone special?) face!</li>
    <li> I love this! It is so much cheaper on here that BBW! &amp;#60;3 I&#x27;m seriously in love tho. It is such a good sent ! 5 stars! Recommend you buy this! Also mine shipped faster than they said.</li>
    <li> Excellent Seller, Great quick delivery, Look forward shopping again. Thanks</li>
    <li> good price and shipping!</li>
    <li> I was VERY happy to find this fragrance again! I always seem to like a product and then they discontinue it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more very soon!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this because of the reviews and a lot people seemed to love it sadly that was not the case for me,I can&#x27;t place my finger on it really but it kinda smelled like something my grandmother would wear which isn&#x27;t a bad thing but not something I&#x27;d wear. I gave it to my mother and she loves it so not a total loss!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift. She loved it! Smells really good too!</li>
    <li> Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection ~Be Enchanted ~ Fragrance Mist. was loved by my teen daughter who ordered it</li>
    <li> Great product and was delivered much faster than expected</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it smells so sweet but not so sweet that it&#x27;s sickening. I also like the packaging. I do suggest that you keep an eye on the bath and body works wed site. They sometimes have cheap sales. And the best time to go to the store is in Jan. when these is plenty of clearance.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Got it on time and it smell really good🌹</li>
    <li> Maybe perfumes suit me better...</li>
    <li> Great price and smells so nice!</li>
    <li> Got it fast,but one of the bottles tops came loose and leaked out in the package. As soon as I opened my mailbox I could smell the body spray.</li>
    <li> Nothing negative to say ! Perfect!</li>
    <li> bought for wife she loves it and it does smell wonderful no damage to package and it arrived on time</li>
    <li> Love it, has a very yummy berry scent. The mist needs to be reapplied every three or four hours, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called a mist and not a perfume. People do notice this lovely, yummy scent though. It&#x27;s not as over powering as some of the other products out there. I&#x27;m glad bath and body works still carries this. I hope they do for a very long time!</li>
    <li> Same product from the one I got at the mall, I have the old one left over and compared and it&#x27;s the exact same body spray . I plan order some more for gifts in future from this company. I am not disappointed and it came 2 days before the due date . Very pleased with my savings from gas and time and diff saved money on this one rare gem that I can&#x27;t hardly find anymore here locally.  Last time I found it was double the price than the one I have from online . I feel like I got ripped off honestly from locally than ordering directly. It&#x27;s not run down and it has lasted 2 hours as I don&#x27;t mind taking it with me to refresh. Is not overpowering smell and not to flowery . I have allergies and is just right that I won&#x27;t go sneezing crazy like I used to with perfumes and some body sprays. I been loyal to this body spray for last 6 years and will buy as long they don&#x27;t change the way is made .</li>
    <li> the product arrived well, I like the fragrance</li>
    <li> This is a very nice smelling spray. I liked the fruity smell of the spray, which I usually don&#x27;t, but honestly once you spray it on (which lasts a very long time) it has a hint of a higher end perfume, which I like especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I have found this at Bath &amp; Body works immediately fell in love with it. It&#x27;s got a sweet and flowery cent, yet very distinct from all the others.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Good Job It Arrived On Time, And Made It Here Just Fine!!!!;-) The Body Spray Smells Great!!! I STILL PREFER A THOUSAND WISHES THE BEST THOUGH!!!!!&amp;#60;3 ;-) Other Than That The BODY SPRAY Is Just Like The Seller Described;-)  THANKS;-)</li>
