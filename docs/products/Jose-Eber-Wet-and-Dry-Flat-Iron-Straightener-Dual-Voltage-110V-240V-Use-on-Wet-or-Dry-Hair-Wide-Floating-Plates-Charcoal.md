    <li> I have used this product for several weeks now and I am happy with it. I love the wider plates and the variable heating temperatures. I have not used it on wet hair, though, and I don&#x27;t intend to.  Hopefully, it will last longer than my last flat iron did...</li>
    <li> After researching for a couple of weeks for a replacement flat iron I was sold instantly with the promise that this iron works on wet and dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment arrived two days before scheduled, which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tried this on my freshly washed, towel dried hair.  The iron sort of flattened my hair, but not completely and not to my satisfaction.  This is the only reason I am leaving a 4 star versus a 5 star review.  I will try again with wet hair and update my review if I get different results.&lt;br /&gt;I blow dried my hair and tried the flat iron again.  It is AMAZING!  I have never had my hair left so shiny and soft after using a hot tool on it.  This iron is well constructed and easy to hold and operate.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this flat iron to other.</li>
    <li> The reviews are correct with this one! After years of my very expensive flat iron, I needed to find another one. I like the wet/dry option since I rush around a lot and have thick hair. With the first use of this Flat Iron, I was so happy. My other flat iron was over $200 and lasted for years so I figured I would need to spend at least that much for a new one. However, this flat iron is even better. I would highly recommend it and will buy another one just to keep in case I lose mine or something happens to it. I have a wave to my hair and it frizzes out after highlighting it for many years. This flat iron makes my hair so smooth and strait and my hair feels silky.</li>
    <li> Not a very good straightener. Will not buy again and wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> The wet/dry iron feature is great. The construction and buttons are a little flimsy for the price, but I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it yet and it has a good warranty.</li>
    <li> Daughter loves it.  She likes to wear her hair smooth and straight and this did the job</li>
    <li> Piece of crap.  Was cheap plastic.  The plates did not even line up together !  How embarrassing for Jose&#x27;!</li>
    <li> Been looking for a hair straightener and I am in love with this one! My hair is dry and wavy and this straightened my hair so quickly with lasting results! I&#x27;m even able to straightened my stubborn curly baby hair which is close to my face! My hair feels smooth and soft with volume! Ordered it the night before and got it the next day before noon! Fast shipping and delivery.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product.  Leaves hair silky.  Highly recommended.  Tried other wet to dry irons but nothing like this.</li>
    <li> Jose Eber flat iron have thought thru about their design.  This is a great iron and it works well for my coarse and thick hair.  Easy to control and great holding position where you can push your thumb without burning yourself.  It would get a five star if it has self turn off feature.  Ok,  I am reducing 4 to 2 star.  It started out nicely but the iron seems to starting to pull on my hair so much and perhaps the plate is no longer work well in 2 months.  The iron is on max high temp but did not do much for my hair (my hair is straight already).  no I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL HAIR TOOL.. I HAVE VERY HARD TO CONTROL HAIR, AND THIS FLAT IRON TAMES IT LIKE I&#x27;VE NEVER HAD BEFORE.
