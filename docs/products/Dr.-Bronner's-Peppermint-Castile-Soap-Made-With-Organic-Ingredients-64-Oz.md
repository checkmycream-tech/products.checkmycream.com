    <li> Love the way it feels and cleans.</li>
    <li> I not only have been using this soap in the shower for over 30 years but I put it in a spray bottle and spray down my shed as the Peppermint repels rodents and keeps my shed clear of mice and rats putting up nests! It also repels many other insects! I use it to clean the floors in my house also. Smells great! Feels tingly when you use it in the shower or on your scalp. Great versitle soap!</li>
    <li> Great product, and I am always left feeling incredibly clean. I would definitely recommend this product to someone that is looking for a natural body soap that really works.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be bigger.  We had a larger one before and thought this would be the same size.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap since 1973. It works great for everything, I recommend it to all.Good bye, folks.</li>
    <li> This is the only soap that I use.  It offers great refreshment.</li>

Talk about not only feeling absolutely squeaky clean, in addition and the most surprising, is the aroma that goes straight into your nose and the tingly feeling of the mint all across my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I was in one of those fancy spas... but it was just my regular old shower.  I immediately fell in love with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a something that is different (even the labeling... kind of odd, but interesting), something that will wake you up every morning before you trudge off to your job, something that will send chills up and down your body - well this is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel for work, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of fancy soap samples - but none of them compare to this peppermint delight that awaits me when I get home.  Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very refreshing soap - make your skin tingle.</li>
    <li> I go through these gallons every couple of months. The peppermint was reasonable in price. No complaint about the product itself.</li>
    <li> Fourth bottle can&#x27;t say anymore !</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re repeat customers and have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Castile Soap for years.  It&#x27;s a high quality, liquid castile soap.  We find that it helps repel mosquitos in the summer.  Love the refreshing feel of a shower using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  There&#x27;s nothing like it!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> this is a half gallon, not a full gallon for a higher price than sold elsewhere here on amazon.  do your homework.</li>
