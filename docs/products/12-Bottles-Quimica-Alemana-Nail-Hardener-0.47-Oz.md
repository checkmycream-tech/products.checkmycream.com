    <li> I PUT MY REVIEW IN 5 SARS BECAUSE PEOPLE DONT LOOK AT THE ONE STAR REVIEWS OFTEN. THIS PRODUCT IS CRAP. IT DOES HARDEN YOUR NAILS BIG TIME BUT BEWARE ITS DANGEROUS. I USED IT BECAUSE MY AUNT HAD PURCHASED IT AND IT WAS THE WORST NAIL EXPERIANCE OF MY LIFE. I LITERALLY WANTED TO CUT ALL MY FINGERS OFF BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS TOO MUCH I COULDNT HANDLE AND THOUGHT I WOULD LOOSE ALL MY NAILS. I CRIED MY EYES OUT THAT HOW MUCH IT HURT. I WANTED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL BUT TOOK THE PAIN IDK HOW. THE PAIN TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO LEAVE AFTER I STOPED THE USE.  THIS PRODUCT HAS A REALLY STRONG CHEMICAL IT SHOULD BE CAUTIOUSLY USED OR USED AT ALL. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>

    <li> This is an amazing product.  A girlfriend with equally brittle nails lead me to this product.  I used&lt;br /&gt;Duri nails before and was happy.  But Quimica can not be topped.  It has strengthened my nails&lt;br /&gt;so much better.  And I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it. Now I use Duri as a top coat...double&lt;br /&gt;strength.  You can not find a better product.  If you do, please let us know about it.</li>
