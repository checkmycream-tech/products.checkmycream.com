<li> Berries were great - worked fantastically for making syrup for cold and flu season.</li>
<li> Crushed the the mix to get all the nectar from the berries, strained with a fine metal colander, and when cooled to 118 degrees, mixed in a half cup of raw honey (recipe calls for 1 cup</li>
<li> We haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
<li> and I still have plenty left over do use for other things.</li>
<li> This taste different from other elderberries.</li>
<li> The flavor seemed off once rehydrated but maybe it was due to not being from the US as the flavor may be different in other areas of the world.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not pure elderberry.</li>
<li> Just use about half or less than what recipe calls</li>
<li> A little bit like thyme or another herb.</li>
<li> Refrigerated for a day and then took a few teaspoons to taste.  </li>
<li> I boiled the berries and then strained them, measured the juice and went about on a recipe that I have used with dried cherries.  </li>
<li> Dried, of course, but not so flavorful, and don&#x27;t reconstitute well.</li>
<li> Very tightly sealed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m a bit nervous to give the syrup to my family as I&#x27;m not sure what else is in this.</li>
<li> This past winter I had made elderberry syrup, and now, this spring and summer I am putting them into my ice teas, and Kombucha tea.</li>
<li> I have a small business making jams and jellies, and people ask for elderberry jelly all the time!  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but will try it next time we get sick.</li>
<li> The smell of these faintly remind me of my father.</li>
<li> I was skeptical that organic could be this inexpensive.  </li>
<li> so I don&#x27;t know how well it keeps you from getting sick.</li>

    <li> Great price, great berries. Shipped quickly. would be 5 stars if there weren&#x27;t so many stems etc in there.</li>
    <li> Good amount for the price.  The flavor seemed off once rehydrated but maybe it was due to not being from the US as the flavor may be different in other areas of the world.</li>
    <li> Yummy!! And fast delivery!</li>

    <li> Very good product for making Elderberry syrup and the delivery time was great.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering the Elder berries from Starwest. This past winter I had made elderberry syrup, and now, this spring and summer I am putting them into my ice teas, and Kombucha tea. Elderberries are so good for you and they have so many benefical properties. This company is always so fast in their delivery times. I&#x27;ve never had to wait more than a week. I am very impressed.</li>
    <li> I found a recipe to make elderberry syrup that drug stores over charge for and it is just as effective.  I will not purchase off the shelf any longer.</li>
    <li> Used for my kombucha.  Soaked finished brew 3 days in mason jars and then refrigerator.  Perfect way to fight off bad bugs!!</li>
    <li> Good delivery time, well packaged, excellent product - I will definitely order again.  I use this to make Elderberry syrup to ward off colds and whatever creeping crud is going around.</li>
    <li> Had some small particles which made it necessary to use paper filters but the taste was excellent.</li>
    <li> I use elderberries medicinally. We rely on elderberries to throw off colds and flu. These are very nice elderberries and I am very pleased with the quality of the berries.</li>
    <li> These elderberries are perfect for making elderberry syrups or tinctures for those that are trying to stay healthy naturally. They come in a resealable package, which is great because I can&#x27;t use them all at once. They arrived very quickly as well, which was nice.</li>
    <li> i add these to my tea as a vitamin c boost. there are recipes to use them in jams and jellies too! its a great way to have fruit that does not spoil always available</li>
    <li> Made elderberry syrup with the a cup of the berries (with a lot still left over!).  Boiled berries for 35 minutes with 4 cups water, three 1/4&amp;#34; inch slices fresh ginger, 3 cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks.  Crushed the the mix to get all the nectar from the berries, strained with a fine metal colander, and when cooled to 118 degrees, mixed in a half cup of raw honey (recipe calls for 1 cup but I didn&#x27;t want it so sweet).  Refrigerated for a day and then took a few teaspoons to taste.  Excellent!  Will use it through the winter to ward off or cut short colds and flu.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I make elixir all the time with these.  Elder berries, honey, ginger, cinnamon and other good stuff keeps one healthy.</li>
    <li> The smell of these faintly remind me of my father.</li>
    <li> Very tightly sealed.  Very fresh product.  Very consistant berries.  Great quality with great flavor.  Will definitely order this product for future needs.</li>
    <li> Elderberry tea got rid of my rhino virus in two days. In lieu of a flu shot, I take an elderberry capsule every day. Since I discovered how quickly it cured my rhino virus I drink a cup of the elderberry tea instead of coffee in the morning. Elderberry tea is delicious and excellent for your immune system. It really works on many viruses; it has been documented by NIH!!</li>
    <li> pleased beyond belief. it is already healing my family and centering our health state. my only issue is that i wish i had money and space to buy even more!</li>
    <li> I have a small business making jams and jellies, and people ask for elderberry jelly all the time!  And since it is such a seasonal berry in my neck of the woods, I thought I would try making a jelly with this product.  I boiled the berries and then strained them, measured the juice and went about on a recipe that I have used with dried cherries.  Product was very well recieved and to me tastes a bit like cooked raisins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used some of these berries to make elderberry syrup, one of those must haves for us during flu season.  Great quality berries with no sticks or leaves included.  You get what you are expecting!  Keep in mind that you do get a lot of berries in this bag, so if you are making small batches of syrup, I do recommend transferring them to a glass storage container and keep them out of the light!</li>
    <li> I recently made an elderberry syrup with these and it tastes great. It is so much cheaper to make your own than buy Sambucol which is around $15 for a small bottle. We haven&#x27;t been using it long so I don&#x27;t know how well it keeps you from getting sick. I also made a tincture and let is sit for 6 weeks in 100 proof vodka. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but will try it next time we get sick.</li>
    <li> In both cases, the berries showed up promptly and in good condition. I&#x27;ve read that elderberry extracts are useful in fighting flu. Supposedly, compounds in the extract coat the virus in the blood stream and make it more difficult to penitrate human cell walls. Whether true or not, it makes a very promising wine - which is what I used them for. Hopefully, that will reduce suffering one way or another...</li>
    <li> They are very nice.  I am using them in my tea elixir.</li>
    <li> These berries made great elderberry syrup and I still have plenty left over do use for other things.</li>
    <li> Great price and helps the kids stay healthy</li>
    <li> I made syrup with these, seems great to me.</li>
    <li> Use these to make my own elderberry syrup.  Tastes great and keeps us healthy.</li>
    <li> Made Elderberry Syrup...  YUM.  Recommend highly.  Just use about half or less than what recipe calls for.&lt;br /&gt;because these are dehydrated.</li>
