<li> had seen same product in half size for about same price at walmart.&lt;br</li>
<li> and it may leave blue globs and too little doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient hold.</li>
<li> , it is not like the goo that dissolves in wet hair.  </li>
<li> it says what it will do and no stiffness if you blend it or put it in your hair wet!</li>
<li> I compliment this product with a wax paste for the front to keep hair from dropping down onto my forehead.</li>
<li> Only takes a small amount!</li>
<li> it takes very little to hold your hair in place and it is not sticky when it dries.</li>
<li> You have to use an extremely small amount and work through your hair.</li>
<li> I have thick wavy hair that can get out of control unless gel is used.  </li>
<li> Can be quite thick on hair</li>
<li> I have been using hard up for years!</li>
<li> Got the wrong product, not the one from the picture!</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to help my hair have a spiked windblown look.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this gel forever, and it&#x27;s the only gel he will use. I just hope we really got 100% more free!</li>
    <li> I love this gel! It is super firm, super hard hold. It adds shine. It dries out your hair, but I keep my hair short so the style quality is more important.</li>
    <li> Last&#x27;s 16+ hours and great for short hair (under 2 inches). I did notice that as my hair starts to grow out between cuts, this isn&#x27;t as effective. But, it is marketing at short hair so this isn&#x27;t a flaw. This is priced low enough for regular use and I have been using it for several years. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I did notice that you really have to only use about a dime sized amount. Too much and it may leave blue globs and too little doesn&#x27;t provide sufficient hold. I compliment this product with a wax paste for the front to keep hair from dropping down onto my forehead.</li>
    <li> We love this gel!! It is used every day by my husband and my three boys.  It keeps their hair in place all day long. GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for people with unruly hair like me. It will make your hair crisp, but you can rest assured it will stay in place</li>
    <li> Can be quite thick on hair but I love that it spikes my hair even when using it in the Bahamas!</li>
    <li> Good Prices. 100% more for free.&lt;br /&gt;I had seen same product in half size for about same price at walmart.&lt;br /&gt;So this one is more like buy one get one free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for over 5 years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  No flaking and strong gel.</li>
    <li> Got the wrong product, not the one from the picture! I did use the one I got but would of like to get what I ask for.</li>
    <li> Works well on all hair types</li>
    <li> Its last all day and you can actually control your hair which alot of gels can not do. Ive been using this gel forever now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 15 years to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; my hair....I love it.  It holds the hair in place but can be brushed out without leaving the hair sticky!  Only takes a small amount!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!  I have short hair that I like to spike.  Before I this product I had tried others and they either left my head feeling itchy OR left me with flakes looking like I have dandruff!  This product does neither!  No flakes what so ever, no itch and holds strong all day long no problem!</li>
    <li> Perfect, on time and incredible, i really enjoy this purchase.  i never had been found a product like this.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sexy Hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is over my ears and kind of short on the top but I found this product to be very sticky. You have to use an extremely small amount and work through your hair.</li>
    <li> Do not order this, it is not the product &amp;#34;Short Sexy Hair&amp;#34;. Twice I have ordered &amp;#34;Short Sexy Hair&amp;#34; and received &amp;#34;Style Sexy Hair&amp;#34;. I have a short spiky haircut and Style Sexy Hair is not doing the job. I am going back to my hairdresser who sells the right product!</li>
    <li> I like that it takes very little to hold your hair in place and it is not sticky when it dries.</li>
    <li> I have never found a product that works so well at holding your hair in place.  When you put it on your head wet and then blow dry it, your hair is so soft.  No hairspray is needed.  A+++ product.</li>
    <li> i love this gel!!!! it says what it will do and no stiffness if you blend it or put it in your hair wet! and love the extra amt! alittle goes along way love its styling !!!!!</li>
    <li> good price for how much there is and its a 10 hold actually</li>
    <li> Do people really write reviews on hair gel???  I have been using this product for several years for numerous reasons...&lt;br /&gt;The hold is incredible.  It does not flake when it dries.  It does not make my scalp itch.  Oh--and my hair looks incredible!!!!  Short and Sexy just like the package indicates.  The price seems a bit &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; but worth it when it delivers as promises.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best product I&#x27;ve found. Now have friends&lt;br /&gt;who ordered this procuct as well.  As long as they make it..I will&lt;br /&gt;keep buying.</li>
    <li> This hair gel keeps my unruly hair in place.  I have tried many different kinds, but keep coming back! I have thick wavy hair that can get out of control unless gel is used.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> If you are a man and need a good gel, here it is. Holds as expected, this particular product offers 100% more free, I did the math and it is true. Great price on a top quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using hard up for years! It is the only gel that works all day with me. Being a UPS driver and working in windy conditions at times, I can tell you, this product holds your hair in place! Plus the price you pay here is excellent! Buy this and you won&#x27;t consider another gel!</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  I have had to learn to use it, it is not like the goo that dissolves in wet hair.  You need hold, this is it!</li>
