### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>Wonderful cream.</li>
      <li>and my cuticles are great too.</li>
      <li>Product worked great, my wife has breast cancer and the chemo pill she takes makes here</li>
      <li>not oily, unscented, works great.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the one with 20% urea.</li>
      <li>Product was good.</li>
      <li>It is a good cuticle cream as well.  </li>
      <li>Works so great on dry and cracked heels, plus it&#x27;s just a great all around moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I think they could come up with a more sophisticated design.  </li>
      <li>It is non-greasy which I love.</li>
      <li>and now I am able to go home with hands that dont feel like sandpaper.</li>
      <li>Does OK.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and this works better.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different lotions, oils to heal my hands, this one is the best!</li>
      <li>This is an excellent cream for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I have used the extra care cream andit has been very good for my chemo skin sideffects,&lt;br /&gt;Betty Lou Morrison</li>
      <li>I really bought it to battle toenail fungus (I heard that urea is good for this...and for spider veins).  </li>
      <li>This is the best cream for dry skin and it leaves your skin smooth and not oily.  </li>
      <li>You can find it easily and apply it easily, and it does not appear to stain anything.</li>
      <li>Despite the reviews, this cream does NOTHING to smooth chapped hands.</li>
      <li>But, this cream is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I emailed The People&#x27;s Pharmacy, and they suggested I try Udderly Smooth with urea.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use as the jar has a large screw-top lid.</li>
      <li>So far she is more than satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Works great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff, not quite as potent as the stuff I get with a prescription, but that is expected.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many other creams, including one prescription one -- Aquaphor, Eucerin, anything anyone recommended, but this (Udderly Smooth Cream) works the best for dry and cracked skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using the original cream for many years and purchased the new one because it contains urea.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, and lasts most of the day, unless your hands are in water a lot.  </li>
      <li>Unscented this may be, but is has a powerful odor that triggered a whopper of an asthma attack.  </li>
      <li>It started working right away to relieve the itching and then reduce the inflammation.  </li>
      <li>and it goes right into the skin.  </li>
      <li>This works pretty well</li>
      <li>Thanks for having what I needed!</li>
      <li>For some reason this stuff isn&#x27;t available at very many stores, at least in our area anyway.</li>
      <li>Great product for my extra dry skin.</li>
      <li>Really softens my dry skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I really find it helpful.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and really absorbs.</li>
      <li>After seeing some of the reviews, I really hoped this would be a help for my cracked and split fingers.</li>
      <li>It helps a lot and is very soothing.  </li>
      <li>Other hand creams do a better job.</li>
      <li>They help, but the Udderly Smooth with urea clears up the itchy rash caused by the dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it off and on since then, as needed, and  highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>This is first cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin more and actually helps keep my irritation &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; minimal!</li>
      <li>Nothing special,  Did not live up to</li>
      <li>After trying so many other lotions and creams for extra-dry skin, I finally ordered this.  </li>
      <li>and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really takes care of it.  </li>
      <li>The scent will dissipate after a while, but I wish it could be completely removed from the product.</li>
      <li>I have had dermatitis and sensitive skin (on my face especially),since</li>
      <li>This fall and winter I have been applying Udderly Smooth lotion with urea and I haven’t had any rash problems and very little itching.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product with urea in it, as it really works on dry skin.  </li>
      <li>The urea really helps to eliminate flakes and itchy dry skin.  </li>
      <li>Two weeks of regular use and my hands were back to normal!</li>
      <li>For me it has not been, but apparently works well for others.</li>
      <li>I had read about the product many times and hope that it will help the veins in my legs be a little less noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this for really dry skin or areas of callus build up.</li>
      <li>It will also clear up dry spots on your elbows or wherever almost overnight.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s just an ordinary moisturizer.  Nothing special,  Did not live up to it&#x27;s hype</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for my aunt that has very bad dry skin because this is one of the only products that she says helps her. So far she is more than satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Does OK.  Not as good as the one with 20% urea.</li>
    <li> Foot Doc recommended that I get a foot cream with 25% Urea, this popped up and it does well softening my dry feet.</li>
    <li> seems to help with a chronic problem with my hands. At this time I am skeptical of everything, but this actual does help for now</li>
    <li> This is an excellent cream for dry skin.  It is a good cuticle cream as well.  I have been using the original cream for many years and purchased the new one because it contains urea.  The urea really helps to eliminate flakes and itchy dry skin.  There is very little fragrance and it goes right into the skin.  Does not feel oily at all.</li>
    <li> Works so great on dry and cracked heels, plus it&#x27;s just a great all around moisturizer.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had read about the product many times and hope that it will help the veins in my legs be a little less noticeable.  After a few weeks of use, it seems to be working for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream. not oily, unscented, works great.</li>
    <li> After seeing some of the reviews, I really hoped this would be a help for my cracked and split fingers. For me it has not been, but apparently works well for others. For that reason I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s no good, only that it did not improve my situation. Your mileage may vary.</li>
    <li> Works great for dry skin.  I really bought it to battle toenail fungus (I heard that urea is good for this...and for spider veins).  No results yet, though (it&#x27;s been a week)</li>
    <li> The company does not seal this and since it was packed and sent upside down and leaked out, I wasn&#x27;t too&lt;br /&gt;happy.  I checked with Redex and no it&#x27;s not sealed.  Since I have seen people in stores opening things and poking&lt;br /&gt;around with their fingers, I am having second thoughts about buying this again.  I bought from AmericaRx and&lt;br /&gt;notified them of the leaking but only got a &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Product worked great, my wife has breast cancer and the chemo pill she takes makes here hands and feet red and sore the cream has helped eliminate the problem</li>
    <li> The dry winter skin on my hands especially has been awful in the past but this year I tired Udderly Smooth and have had not one problem with dry skin and my cuticles are great too.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my hands and feet and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really takes care of it.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it really takes care of my dry skin.  I was looking for a product with urea in it, as it really works on dry skin.  this is it!</li>
    <li> I have used the extra care cream andit has been very good for my chemo skin sideffects,&lt;br /&gt;Betty Lou Morrison</li>
    <li> I have had dermatitis and sensitive skin (on my face especially),since having my two kids. This is first cream I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin more and actually helps keep my irritation &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; minimal! I love it.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, not quite as potent as the stuff I get with a prescription, but that is expected. For some reason this stuff isn&#x27;t available at very many stores, at least in our area anyway. Thanks for having what I needed!</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that helps my extremely dry skin.  I&#x27;ve tried Lubriderm and Gold Bond.  They help, but the Udderly Smooth with urea clears up the itchy rash caused by the dry skin.  I started using it when I developed hives from an allergic reaction to an antibiotic a few years ago.  I couldn&#x27;t find relief.  I emailed The People&#x27;s Pharmacy, and they suggested I try Udderly Smooth with urea.  It started working right away to relieve the itching and then reduce the inflammation.  I&#x27;ve been using it off and on since then, as needed, and  highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well, it IS similar to the more expensive balm I have been buying, but it does have a scent the other balm does not.  The scent will dissipate after a while, but I wish it could be completely removed from the product.</li>
    <li> Despite the reviews, this cream does NOTHING to smooth chapped hands. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Other hand creams do a better job.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream for dry skin and it leaves your skin smooth and not oily.  It will also clear up dry spots on your elbows or wherever almost overnight.</li>
    <li> With consistent use, this lotion can smooth the worst of feet! It is non-greasy which I love. Highly recommend this for really dry skin or areas of callus build up.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended by my oncologist to use during my chemotherapy.  It helps a lot and is very soothing.  I had been trying some much more expensive stuff and this works better.  You can find it easily and apply it easily, and it does not appear to stain anything.</li>
    <li> The cold weather played havoc with my hands and this cream took care of them.  I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from cracked or chaffed hands or fingers.</li>
    <li> This product fixed my severely chapped hands and feet after only a few applications. It does leave your hands feeling greasy but I have found that all products that actually work do that. I have a job that has me both indoors and outdoors all day and now I am able to go home with hands that dont feel like sandpaper.</li>
    <li> By Christmas time I usually have painful upper body rash and it itches too. This fall and winter I have been applying Udderly Smooth lotion with urea and I haven’t had any rash problems and very little itching.</li>
    <li> This cream made a chronically dry and rough patch on my elbow go away as soon as I started using it. Everything else I tried  didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This item arrived within the specified time shown on the site.  It is very easy to use as the jar has a large screw-top lid.</li>
    <li> Product was good. Needed it for my mom who has cancer. The chemo causes blisters in her hands and feet.</li>
    <li> my hands were so dry that they would crack and bleed daily. I have tried many different lotions, oils to heal my hands, this one is the best! Two weeks of regular use and my hands were back to normal! 100% healed.</li>
    <li> After trying so many other lotions and creams for extra-dry skin, I finally ordered this.  I have hand/foot syndrome as a result of a chemotherapy I take for breast cancer. The pharmaceutical company that makes the drug includes a tube of udder cream in their \\&quot;starter kit.\\&quot;  It is not at all greasy and has no scent. I really find it helpful. I have tried so many other creams, including one prescription one -- Aquaphor, Eucerin, anything anyone recommended, but this (Udderly Smooth Cream) works the best for dry and cracked skin. It is not greasy and really absorbs. I prefer the unscented version.</li>
    <li> Great product for my extra dry skin. Definitely would recommend this product this product for someone with dry, itchy skin</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, maybe because of the weird decor of the container!!  I think they could come up with a more sophisticated design.  But, this cream is fantastic.  Really softens my dry skin better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used.  Must be the urea it contains.  It absorbs quickly and completely into the skin, and lasts most of the day, unless your hands are in water a lot.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Unscented this may be, but is has a powerful odor that triggered a whopper of an asthma attack.  I did not know what the product was, but described the smell as acrid beef before I was told what it was.</li>
