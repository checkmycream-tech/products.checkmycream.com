### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>its perfect to use for school!</li>
      <li>and it makes my lips look great!</li>
      <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>but the tint is cute and does stay on!!!!!</li>
      <li>Great price too.</li>
      <li>so that s great</li>
      <li>that was great.</li>
      <li>it works just as great.</li>
      <li>but in the end it was just too watery (sort of like food coloring) and it didn&#x27;t smell or taste good.</li>
      <li>The product it&#x27;s good, but this size</li>
      <li>i swear i laughed at its size...</li>
      <li>Now, the product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Honestly I&#x27;m inlove with this, it came in  2 weeks</li>
      <li>it looks nice on lips,I will be purchasing on more of this Korean products</li>
      <li>it&#x27;;s better if you buy a another one</li>
      <li>Too time crunched and surprisingly better results and longevity.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t do many lipsticks anymore, just basically lip liners and this lip tint and lip balm.</li>
      <li>I am not in love with the bottle either.</li>
      <li>and I decided this was a good first one to try</li>
      <li>Thanks so much &lt;3</li>
      <li>For the price, though, it&#x27;s a good deal and a decent lip tint/stain...</li>
      <li>love it wish there was more of a variety of colors though (pink) :p</li>
      <li>It is a nice color that makes your lips look more alive.</li>
      <li>I love the color especially when its layered with gloss and stays well for a good amount of time.</li>
      <li>Great quallity item that goes a long way.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;i cant really say im satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>Man i really wanted to love</li>
      <li>i just love the way the korean actresses lips look, but i just don&#x27;t really...</li>
      <li>if im lucky..</li>
      <li>So pretty!</li>
      <li>i didnt really get to enjoy it as i thought i would i can apply it maybe three or four times maybe five</li>
      <li>Gives it a nice berry red stain.  </li>
      <li>great product but really really small.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those that want to look for a good lipstain, i would recommend the revlon just bitten lip balm, they are around the same cost of this but works a million times better, and plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like a normal lipstain would.</li>
      <li>This was my first ever lip tint</li>
      <li>I found it to be bothersome to keep on reapplying it, and wished it had more lasting power.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s ridiculus small, and it doesnt close good</li>
      <li>You get a good amount of product for how small it is.</li>
      <li>like its a cute red :) not so much on the pink side at all</li>
      <li>If you want bright color and a long lasting look</li>
      <li>It stays on for a decent amount of time and it was a lot cheaper than the one that Sephora sells!</li>
      <li>I really like te color and the texture</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really find a pigmented lip tint</li>
      <li>i would recommend to just use a dash, dont put too much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a relatively budget friendly lip tint that didn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
      <li>However, be aware that if you don&#x27;t have perfectly smooth lips, this won&#x27;t work really well, and for some reason, doesn&#x27;t matter how much i exfoliate my lips, i still can&#x27;t get the color to be even, this product seem to only want to stain the middle of my lips and</li>
      <li>Cute little bottle, half-full with red-pink liquid.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so cute for some reason it doesnt look round or like the picture .but</li>
      <li>I was thrilled when I received my adorable little pink package 3 weeks earlier than expected!</li>
      <li>I tried experimenting with it to see if it could also work as a cheek stain, but it looks very streaky and too red...</li>
      <li>It has a bitter and kind of alcoholic smell and taste.</li>
      <li>If you use too little, the color is uneven, if you use too much, it gets really dark, but it does have a good staining power.</li>
      <li>It goes on really dark, but don&#x27;t worry, it fades into either a deep pink or red, that fades out into a nicely subdued color.</li>
      <li>Although the bottle looks really small, you only need a tiny amount of product to stain your lips--I just use one swipe for my bottom lip, and one swipe for my top lip.  </li>
      <li>i mean its cute and all but its so tiny</li>

<li> biggest gripe with this stain is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
<li> and it does last a long time.  </li>
<li> And as the other person you do not need a lot of it so may last a while too.</li>
<li> It goes above and beyond Revlon&#x27;s bitten series for less.</li>
<li> But the liquid somehow spills a little over when you put the cover back on or if it liesnon its side.</li>
<li> It has a little taste but no big deal</li>
<li> the bottle was not filled up only came up to atleast</li>
<li> Everything I expected.</li>
<li> the color is nice, but it seeps into the tiniest cracks you have on your lip and the staining is so uneven it just looks bad, if you lick your lips(even after its dried), it tastes like chemicals</li>
<li> no where else, i look more like i got a bloody chapped lips than a lip stain:(&lt;br</li>
<li> they sent me samples of other ones though!</li>
<li> half the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I can see this making a mess overtime</li>
<li> Try this if you want to narrow your everyday lip wear down to a minimum when going to work, school, or just whenever and not worrying about if lipstick or gloss is on your teeth or worn off.</li>
<li> The only complaint I have is it tastes pretty bad</li>
<li> I never imagined it was so little</li>
<li> The tint comes on a little darker than I would like.</li>
<li> It seems like it goes away after a few hours, or after drinking or eating something.  </li>
<li> and I feel like the product that gets stuck around the opening of the bottle is going to waste.</li>
<li> Although I had read it was small</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be like that.</li>
<li> guys know what i mean, damn those korean dramas), but i just can&#x27;t achieve it with this product.</li>
<li> , i wanted to go for the really subtle winter/frosty look(you</li>
<li> However, I paid the 6 dollars shipping and handling but idiot me, only ordered 1 tint when I could have gotten at least 5-10 for my 6 dollars.</li>
<li> It smells and taste really weird though.</li>
<li> I was extremly shocked when i got this product...</li>

    <li> Cute little bottle, half-full with red-pink liquid. It is a nice color that makes your lips look more alive. It smells and taste really weird though. It has a bitter and kind of alcoholic smell and taste. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be like that. Also, when I put the brush/cap back into the bottle, bubbles form at the mouth of the bottle as I push the brush inside. And some of the liquid gets stuck at the opening. I can see this making a mess overtime and I feel like the product that gets stuck around the opening of the bottle is going to waste.</li>
    <li> You get a good amount of product for how small it is. It has lasted about a year and still is alot.</li>
    <li> like its a cute red :) not so much on the pink side at all but the tint is cute and does stay on!!!!! love it wish there was more of a variety of colors though (pink) :p</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a relatively budget friendly lip tint that didn&#x27;t break the bank. It goes above and beyond Revlon&#x27;s bitten series for less. Yay! It goes on really dark, but don&#x27;t worry, it fades into either a deep pink or red, that fades out into a nicely subdued color. I would say it lasts about 6 hours with no reapplication on moisturized conditioned lips. I layer it with lip liner and balm and go. I don&#x27;t do many lipsticks anymore, just basically lip liners and this lip tint and lip balm. Too time crunched and surprisingly better results and longevity.Try this if you want to narrow your everyday lip wear down to a minimum when going to work, school, or just whenever and not worrying about if lipstick or gloss is on your teeth or worn off.</li>
    <li> When they say this is mini-size, they are not kidding.  This bottle is about the size of a big gumbball.  It comes in a plastic round container which, when I received it, was dented, but that wasn&#x27;t really a big problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle also comes with this applicator, as shown in the picture.  Although the bottle looks really small, you only need a tiny amount of product to stain your lips--I just use one swipe for my bottom lip, and one swipe for my top lip.  Gives it a nice berry red stain.  I tried experimenting with it to see if it could also work as a cheek stain, but it looks very streaky and too red...so, uh, don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe with this stain is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  It seems like it goes away after a few hours, or after drinking or eating something.  I found it to be bothersome to keep on reapplying it, and wished it had more lasting power.  For the price, though, it&#x27;s a good deal and a decent lip tint/stain...just don&#x27;t expect it to be long-lasting.  I&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t order this again in the future.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled when I received my adorable little pink package 3 weeks earlier than expected! Now, the product is amazing. Everything I expected. However, I paid the 6 dollars shipping and handling but idiot me, only ordered 1 tint when I could have gotten at least 5-10 for my 6 dollars. SMH. That&#x27;s on me! Don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;m inlove with this, it came in  2 weeks I though it would take forever, I have to say  it&#x27;s so cute for some reason it doesnt look round or like the picture .but the shape and size like a grape it came with two instead of one! It has a little taste but no big deal it looks nice on lips,I will be purchasing on more of this Korean products</li>
    <li> Although I had read it was small I never imagined it was so little, the truth is that it doesn&#x27;t bother me because what matters is the quality of the product,&lt;br /&gt;but what was my surprise when opening the box I found two mini tints. I&#x27;m the happiest person for choosing this product. Thanks so much &lt;3</li>
    <li> The product it&#x27;s good, but this size it&#x27;s ridiculus small, and it doesnt close good, soo it licked  lot. it&#x27;;s better if you buy a another one</li>
    <li> great product but really really small. they sent me samples of other ones though! that was great. its perfect to use for school!</li>
    <li> Man i really wanted to love this cause i just love the way the korean actresses lips look, but i just don&#x27;t really...the color is nice, but it seeps into the tiniest cracks you have on your lip and the staining is so uneven it just looks bad, if you lick your lips(even after its dried), it tastes like chemicals, i wanted to go for the really subtle winter/frosty look(you guys know what i mean, damn those korean dramas), but i just can&#x27;t achieve it with this product.

However, be aware that if you don&#x27;t have perfectly smooth lips, this won&#x27;t work really well, and for some reason, doesn&#x27;t matter how much i exfoliate my lips, i still can&#x27;t get the color to be even, this product seem to only want to stain the middle of my lips and no where else, i look more like i got a bloody chapped lips than a lip stain:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that want to look for a good lipstain, i would recommend the revlon just bitten lip balm, they are around the same cost of this but works a million times better, and plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like a normal lipstain would.</li>
    <li> This stain does work and I like it but it is indeed tiny about a gumball indeed. And as the other person you do not need a lot of it so may last a while too.</li>
    <li> I was extremly shocked when i got this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) it arrived wayy before the eta date..so that s great&lt;br /&gt;B)the bottle was soooo tiny...it was lliterally the size of a cherry...so tiny  i swear i laughed at its size...&lt;br /&gt;and C) the bottle was not filled up only came up to atleast half the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i cant really say im satisfied with this product i mean its cute and all but its so tiny i didnt really get to enjoy it as i thought i would i can apply it maybe three or four times maybe five if im lucky..but thats it poof all gone.... WHEN THEY SAY MINI..THEY&#x27;RE NOT KIDDING!</li>
    <li> This was my first ever lip tint and I decided this was a good first one to try but in the end it was just too watery (sort of like food coloring) and it didn&#x27;t smell or taste good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! If you want bright color and a long lasting look this is the stuff for you! So pretty! Only con is is that the bottle is so tiny. Very happy with this product. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I love the color especially when its layered with gloss and stays well for a good amount of time. But the liquid somehow spills a little over when you put the cover back on or if it liesnon its side.</li>
    <li> Great quallity item that goes a long way.  I really like te color and the texture and it does last a long time.  Makes me feel like a feme fatale.</li>
    <li> The tint comes on a little darker than I would like. I am not in love with the bottle either. It stays on for a decent amount of time and it was a lot cheaper than the one that Sephora sells!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color. It stays on. The only complaint I have is it tastes pretty bad (obviously you&#x27;re not supposed to taste it), but when you lick your lips a lot like me...lol!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t really find a pigmented lip tint but when i tried this product out it really&lt;br /&gt;vibrant. I recommend it. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I put this on, everytime i wear my make up and it makes my lips look great! i would recommend to just use a dash, dont put too much. it works just as great.</li>
