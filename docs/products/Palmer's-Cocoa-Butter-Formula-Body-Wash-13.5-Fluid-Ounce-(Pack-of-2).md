      <li>Palmers body wash works great in the shower in aiding dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It must keep your skin at an optimum PH because in between my next spray tan when I&#x27;m using a tan maintainer or gradual tanner</li>

      <li>Leaves my skin soft and smelling nice.</li>

      <li>I can use this one body wash for the whole family .</li>
      <li>much prefer another soap / lotion mix I have tried just because it is richer.</li>
      <li>However, for some reason they dramatically increased the price for this, I just paid $11.98 with free shipping and now it&#x27;s almost double that plus a high shipping cost.</li>
      <li>I am very partial to most of Palmer&#x27;s products.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I found this on Amazon and was able to get it with free shipping since I bought it along with a few other things.  </li>
      <li>Not a waste of money rest assured 1-10 10!</li>
      <li>This one made my skin soft !</li>
      <li>A bit pricey but moisturizes and recommended for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Lathers well, too, even in my soft water.</li>
      <li>This winter I have had more problems than usual with dry skin and</li>
      <li>Decently moisturizing for dry winter weather, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  </li>
      <li>The unscented still smells of cocoa as cocoa butter is left to naturally scent the product.  </li>
      <li>I had the Palmers cocoa butter formula in the little white tub which I love the scent of, so I thought Id buy the other products thinking</li>

    <li> very nice and creamy, mild scent. makes me skin feel amazing</li>
    <li> Love, love, love the way this smells.  The fragrance reminds me of a chocolate shop.  Lathers well, too, even in my soft water.</li>
    <li> Loved this body wash. There are many body washes that make my skin even more dry than it already is. This one made my skin soft ! overall I loved this product</li>

    <li> Simply divine  and perfect like everything Palmer&#x27;s.  This is the last stop for me for Bodywash!</li>
    <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s lotion but for whatever reason, no local stores sell their body wash.  I found this on Amazon and was able to get it with free shipping since I bought it along with a few other things.  Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife who loves the palmers lotion. The body wash doesn&#x27;t lather up at all she says. And the smell is not quite like the lotion either. I would not recommend.</li>

    <li> Good product, but can be found cheaper other places.</li>
    <li> I had the Palmers cocoa butter formula in the little white tub which I love the scent of, so I thought Id buy the other products thinking theyd smell the same. WRONG. Its sort of similar but not nearly as delicious.</li>
    <li> Non-irritating, scent free, gets ya clean and moisturizes your skin. Very concentrated so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product. A bit pricey but moisturizes and recommended for sensitive skin. I will probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am very partial to most of Palmer&#x27;s products.  I&#x27;ve only used this body wash for about a week now, and so far, I think it does an excellent job.  I would recommend this product to anyone that may be on the fence.  Will probably reorder when the time comes that I need more.</li>
    <li> Great!!! Body wash is the best for dry skin. It is difficult to find this body wash in many of the stores in our area. Will only buy it this way.</li>
    <li> The body wash is rich and lightly scented--not overpowering at all--great deal for 2 bottles--skin is softer and uses less lotion--yay!</li>
    <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Body Wash, 13.5 Fluid Ounce (Pack of 2)&lt;br /&gt;this is super moisturizing and it smells good too.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Ingredients full of vitamin E, which is good for the skin, hair and etc... There&#x27;s not much more to say.</li>
    <li> This is a soft, mild body wash. It smells really nice, like cocoa butter and vanilla.  I have never seen this body wash in stores, so it was a nice find. However, for some reason they dramatically increased the price for this, I just paid $11.98 with free shipping and now it&#x27;s almost double that plus a high shipping cost. It&#x27;s nice, but not that nice. If it goes back to the previous price I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I love this wash,it smells like cocoa and leave my skin glowing and smelling delicious, for extra moisture and scent also use the body cream or oil .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just what you would expect... a great body wash that gives moisture and smells great.  I always love the smell of cocoa butter products :-)</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my skin soft and when used with other products in it&#x27;s line it becomes more effective.</li>
    <li> Palmers body wash works great in the shower in aiding dry skin.  Makes skin appear smooth and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;It is a long proven name.</li>
    <li> Thus product has a pleasing fragrance and it moisturizes while it cleans. I will buy this again  The whole family uses this</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find this product as I love every Palmer&#x27;s product I&#x27;ve ever tried. This winter I have had more problems than usual with dry skin and this body wash really helps. Recommend it!</li>

    <li> Decently moisturizing for dry winter weather, but my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell of it.  Will be looking for something different when this is gone.</li>
    <li> Very luxurious bath soap. So far the best I have used yet and ive used them all. Some of the others are too heavy and leave a film on your body, some of them leave you dry and itchy. This one is fantastic. It is winter so I am not sure how it will be in the summer but I am pregnant and I need all the moisturizers I can get my hands on. This one is now my FAVORITE. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;And surprisingly enough it came unopened and intact. I was afraid in shipment it might explode or some such thing.</li>
    <li> this product was such a good deal I did not hesitate to add more products to my card to get the free shipping. I love how it is so lightly scented makes my skin feel extremely soft after even the first use and can help correct a little bit of skin tone after a sunburn will repurchase over and over again and have the whole family using it by now.</li>
    <li> item as described. I like it. my skin feels soft and clean. I like Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter products because they are not tested on animals. and the product actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing body wash I have ever tried. My skin is finally soft and clean, not dry after wash and my daughters love it too. No sulfates, which strip skin. The smell is fantastic!</li>
    <li> This body wash has a light scent ... which makes it easy to wear your favorite perfume without a clash.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smooth lotion feel .... but .... it is so watery that it takes more work to get a lather.&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer another soap / lotion mix I have tried just because it is richer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve become a real fan of these Palmer&#x27;s products.  They are relatively inexpensive but smell so nice and work so well. This particular one foams well and gives a nice moisturizing effect to the skin.  The unscented still smells of cocoa as cocoa butter is left to naturally scent the product.  Very nice</li>
    <li> I love this bodywash . It&#x27;s great for both sexes .  Very gentle . I even use it on my kids . I&#x27;m a spray tanner and I have tried many body washes that are supposed to be good to use after a spray tan , but I found this to be the best . It must keep your skin at an optimum PH because in between my next spray tan when I&#x27;m using a tan maintainer or gradual tanner it seems to make less of a chance of that orangy look you can sometimes get if your skin is at the wrong PH . It also helps keeping your tan from fading as fast and it&#x27;s a great price, so I can use this one body wash for the whole family . It&#x27;s a win win !!</li>
    <li> Great product! It&#x27;s luxuriously thick and has just the right amount of cocoa butter scent. Leaves my skin soft and smelling nice.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful fragrance and makes you feel smooth and moisturized.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
