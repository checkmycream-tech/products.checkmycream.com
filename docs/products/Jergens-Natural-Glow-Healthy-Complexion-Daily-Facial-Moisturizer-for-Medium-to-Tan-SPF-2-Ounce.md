<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve bought off brands before but I see color with this faster.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite product!! It is amazing and I now will be using it daily or at least every other day. What makes this product special is that it isn&#x27;t just a tanner its a moisturizer, sunscreen, and tanner all in one. The color it gives your skin is so nice and natural not orangey at all!! Also once your skin absorbs the tan it actually covers up any redness you may have, it makes breakouts less noticeable while making your skin look more even toned at the same time, and with this being said it isn&#x27;t as necessary to wear foundation! This tanner isn&#x27;t greasy at all but it keeps your skin at a good moisture level leaving you with less breakouts, and slows down the skin aging process by keeping you moisturized and by protecting it from the sun with the SPF in it. Not to mention its only 8 bucks which is good for a product that provides a tan, moisturizing, and sun protection and the bottle should last you awhile. I love this product so much but I will note that i originally tried the fair to medium shade and it was a disaster because it made my skin look super orangey ( I have light skin.. not fair or medium..just light) so basically unless you have a fair skin tone please please go for the medium to tan shade unless you want to turn orange. The medium to tan tone is good even for people with light skin like me it gives you great natural looking color and I honestly got very tan after the first day of applying I know its supposed to be gradual but for me it only took a day which I think is awesome. I have used an expensive fake &amp; bake face tanner before and it was garbage, greasy, uneven, and had gross scary color, and way too expensive. This tanner blew that one out of the water. Who would of knew the drugstore brand would beat the high end brand? Please give this one a try guys its worth it you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product mostly because of my late night job.  I hardly ever get to see the sun so I thought I&#x27;ll try to get some color to my face.  It starts off slowly coloring your skin and finally gets to a reasonable color point.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I read about the chemicals could cause cancer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I must compliment this product. I have been looking for a good tanning lotion that has a natural color with no bad smell and I have found it. I have tried about 5 others but the tan is always uneven or orange looking or just outright too dark to where it doesn&#x27;t look real. This gives a regular tan that is not too outrageous but you still look tan. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I think it works well and my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to react negatively to it.</li>
    <li> Maintains a natural color - i get compliments on my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; year round.  Moisturizes well too.</li>
    <li> I saw results in one day. I went from looking sickly and winter-stricken to looking like a Sport&#x27;s Illustrated cover model with a healthy glow. I feel more radiant than usual and have noticed many men, women, and children looking at my face with a look that says &amp;#34;that lady&#x27;s facial glow is well above the standards of facial glow.&amp;#34; I then note that they are racking their brain looking for an answer as to how I look this fabulous. I highly recommend it for anyone who comes down with occasional or seasonal whiteness of the face. Thank you, Jergens, thank you.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m trying to get a natural/safe tan so I decided to try this product. I must say I am very surprised because most facial lotions make my face breakout real bad but this doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s slowly giving me a natural glow, just what I wanted! Overall I am very pleased and will continue using this product!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Exactly as described and what I ordered!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff a lot. It moisturizes without being heavy and leaves your skin with a nice complexion.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion.  I wear it all summer long!  Not only does it give my face a nice glow, but it also contains sunscreen.  I apply it every day before I put on makeup and every night after I wash my face.  The smell is very, very mild and I don&#x27;t even notice it.  I would highly recommend this product.  I have been wearing it for years.</li>
    <li> Title says it: this product does what it claims, though I gave it three stars due to it including Oxybenzone and erythrulose - the former being linked to cell destabilization and cancer in mice, and the latter being unapproved for external use by even the FDA. Of course, I didn&#x27;t discover these facts about these chemicals until now, and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. Crap. Anyone here know of any alternative tanning facial lotions which do NOT incorporate these chemicals? If not, I suppose I&#x27;ll have no choice but to go back to my naturally pale complexion. Sigh.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints about the functionality of this product. I&#x27;m a fair skinned red head, and while I can get a tan naturally, it&#x27;s not without a lot of laying out and sunburn in between. While my mantra is usually to buy the most natural, organic products, I just couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t turn me streaky orange or that even worked. So I tried this, and my legs look so perfect. No orange to be found here. I got the fair to medium skin, and it is definitely formulated for fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it a four star review is because it&#x27;s rated a 6 on the cosmetic database. I wish a company could come up with something less toxic that works. For now, this will do, and I will enjoy my nice, sunny color over the summer.</li>
    <li> This product was a huge disappointment.  My skin is pale and sometimes too pale.  That&#x27;s why I bought this, thinking it would give me a healthy glow.  The next morning I was shocked to see the dark blotches on my face.  Unless your skin is flawless, without a freckle or spot of pigmentation, DON&#x27;T use this as it will magnify these areas into grotesque dark spots.  It took many daily facial scrubs to lighten them.  Horrible experience.</li>
    <li> I have blonde hair and blue eyes so my skin is fair. If I were to go out in the sun I would burn than tan. So I thought I would try the medium-tan color. I have to say this color combo works great on my skin. It covers my red blotches on my face really well. Now I don&#x27;t have to wear a lot of make up to cover my blotches. It gives me a slight tan glow..not too dark. It took about 4 applications to get it to the color I like. I really love this stuff! I&#x27;ve suffer from acne since my teens (I&#x27;m 51 now) and this lotion does NOT break me out. In fact my acne seems to be getting better and I have very sensitive skin. This lotion isn&#x27;t heavy and it has a slight aroma that disappears when it dries. It leaves my skin so soft too! I wish I knew about this stuff years ago! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Everything it claims to be. Moisturizing, simple to use, love the color, natural tan look.</li>
    <li> I have been super excited to try this cream out! When this product came, I immediately opened the box and put a small spot on the back of my hand. To my surprise it burned. Not, like, &amp;#34;fiery inferno I need to wash it off now&amp;#34; but a slight menthol kind of burning sensation. I thought, maybe my hands are just dry so I decided to try a few other test spots. One behind the ear and one inner arm. BOTH started burning instantly!! Being an avid user of the Natural Glow body lotion,  I&#x27;m super disappointed in this product. I won&#x27;t even attempt to use it on my face knowing it burned in 3 other spots.</li>
    <li> Safe and natural way to tan.  Works great under bare minerals and not to heavy.  No streaks and added sunblock.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t complain about color for summer. Makes me look alive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years. It is moisturizers great and provides a healthy, beautiful tan color that is not orangey or fake at all.</li>
    <li> takes awhile to get color but it looks natural plus it smells OK and moisturizes. i buy this stuff in bulk!</li>
    <li> My skin is fair and I purchased the medium to tan.  I am glad I did because it is just enough color.  The fair to medium would have been too light.  I use it every morning and like that my moisturizer and self tanner are just one step now.</li>
    <li> Great alternative for make up on those days you are in a rush or want a more natural look.  Just gives a hint of color... just right!</li>
    <li> I used to swear by this product and used it for several years.  It did double duty as a sunscreen and developed a nice looking faux tan. Ever since Jergen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Improved&amp;#34; the product to get rid of the self-tanner smell the self tanner element of the product no longer works for me.  I even switched from the fair/medium color to the medium/tan.  The product provides very little color and what little color it provides is gone by the next morning.  I do hope Jergen&#x27;s &amp;#34;Improves&amp;#34; the product again with a formula that does produce a lasting faux tan.</li>
    <li> This works great!!!  This works so great to give you an even skin kissed tone.  And it is so much better for your skin.  It works fast too!  Once I get a little tan this is all I need to keep my sun kissed glow.</li>
    <li> Works well, great for my skin. Does darken your after several uses but make sure you rub it in completely especially on feet and hands because it can streak. Also don&#x27;t shave for at least 2 days after putting it on your legs</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I have used it and will again soon.</li>
    <li> This product gives the face a beautiful and natural glow, without the appearance of artificial color or streaks I use it daily, and the results get me tons of compliments. I don&#x27;t need a night cream or another moisture lotion. It is inexpensive and gives fabulous results. I highly recommend it if you want a healthy appearance and natural glow, as it&#x27;s named.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> It works great and looks very natural. It doesn&#x27;t go very dark though, even after using it almost 2 weeks in a row. I liked this about the product, but if you&#x27;re looking to go super dark get a regular tanning cream or the darkest shade.</li>
    <li> Better than any other ones I tried and it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
    <li> Many of these types of products leave your skin blotchy but this never does. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use a slighter darker shade than you think  you need. It doesn&#x27;t build up much. I use it 2-3 times a week, though I could use it more often if I wanted a darker shade. If  you are looking for a real dark shade, this doesn&#x27;t do that, but rather does what it states which is to give a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, non-greasy, natural color! Love it.</li>
    <li> Arrived as promised and was what I expected.  I&#x27;ve used this before and it gives a nice natural tan.  Has a slight odor at first, which is probably why it&#x27;s less expensive than the newer one in the stores. I  have a light complexion, but recommend the medium to tan.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for products, but after searching high and low for a product to replace tanning booths I finally found one.  Like you I&#x27;m pretty suspicious of what tanning beds will do long-term to my health, so I went cold turkey and just quit them.  Sure I miss the all over tan, but this product is a fantastic replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think about it, it&#x27;s actually doing two good things for you: replacing the dangerous effects of tanning booths plus protecting your skin with SPF 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was actually amazed at how close it looks to a good tan, it bronzes plus gives your face a nice glow to it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: There is a fair to medium option and this option (medium to tan). Stick with this one, I found the fair to medium tan option a lot less effective.</li>
    <li> Love it goes on evenly gives a nice light color to your face, not orange at all. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is oil free - non comedigenic and doesn&#x27;t break your face out.</li>
    <li> I thought it was color but no…..</li>
    <li> I mix my non-toxic, all-natural/organic spf 30 sunscreen with Jergens Natural Glow spf20 as part of my daily routine after a shower or washing my face. The shade is definitely a bit darker than light/medium, which actually works out perfect for summer. I spend a lot of time outside come summertime, but I ALWAYS wear a visor, so my face tends to naturally look ghostly white compared to my body without my Jergens... Thanks to my lil&#x27; helper I LOOK Cali without the wrinkles and skin cancer! Win-win!</li>
    <li> I use Banana Boat self tanner for my body and this Jergens DARK daily for my face. Love that it has sunscreen and produces a gradual, attractive color that adds just enough &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and made my face break out-most likely to being too drying. I ended up returning it. Maybe I got the wrong color-but I don&#x27;t think so. I used it for two weeks and didn&#x27;t notice anything-besides drying and breaking out.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used for several years</li>
    <li> Works well, but the typical self-tanner chemical smell is masked not gone completely.</li>
    <li> The cream does not smell or makes you feel Like you can&#x27;t breath. It is good quality but I use it for the color as I use other expensive creams for the quality and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the color on my face. I see a slight difference and I was hoping for more. I will still use it as some little color is better than none.  I can see more difference in the summer when I already have a tan, it seems to give it that little extra it needs. In the winter when my face is white, not much help there. Overall pretty good produce,must wish it can do more.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for my daily moisturizer for several years.  I love that it gives me a little color gradually and it does not clog my pores.  It also has an SPF 20 in it so I&#x27;m covered there too!</li>
    <li> I used to go tanning once every week or two to maintain a healthy looking complexion. After doing some research about the negative effects of tanning (both from the sun and tanning booths) I decided to give the artificial tanning products a try. It does not give you as deep of a tan as regular tanning does but it does the job well. Most importantly it saves you from cancer causing UV rays that are unavoidable when tanning. Its also a great moisturizer and has a lot of ingredients to keep your skin healthy and looking younger. If you have acne do not worry, I actually think this product reduces acne by keeping your skin hydrated. I use it every night and every morning.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with a boost to give you a glow! It doesnt give my skin enough moisture in the winter but works perfect in summer.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my face but I broke out so I use it for my arms and top of my hands and I love it because it has SPF and protects me from the Miami sun. I don&#x27;t tan anymore but I always like a little tan on me. I use the body one for my legs</li>
    <li> Great cruelty-free (no animal testing) product but because I don&#x27;t use it daily, I don&#x27;t appear to be much tanner.</li>
    <li> I ordered medium to fair but I got fair to medium</li>
    <li> I use a small amount every day and after a few days stopped wearing base.  I love that it has sunscreen and it is the perfect tone for me.  I went one higher than I thought I would need and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Item as described -- fast delivery. I use the product daily year round and am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This product works. I have been getting compliments on the color of my skin.</li>
    <li> works...but it expires in 2 weeks ....yuck!</li>
    <li> Gives a nice natural color - no orange peel look!  Keeps my face moisturized while providing protection from the sun and a great looking glow!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Adds a gradual tan. No weird smell or anything. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really confused by the other 5 star reviews..are we using the same product? The product does not produce a tan over time and the smell is horrible. When you first apply it smells decent then as the day progresses the smell gets worse. My skin is not sensitive at all, but this product makes your skin oily and itchy. Perhaps after all the scratching it will appear like you have a tan. I wouldn&#x27;t call this a glow or a healthy complexion at all.</li>
    <li> I used the Jergens natural glow lotion for my bottle on a regular basis and love it. It gives me that natural tan glow all year round and goes on easy and smooth. I use the face lotion less frequently because the color results are not as great. It gives you a little color but not much. I only use it occasionally.</li>
    <li> This product stinks, clogs pores, and turns skin orange. Why do people keep saying Jergens changed their sunless tanner formula so it doesn&#x27;t stink anymore? It still stinks people! Don&#x27;t waste your money... try Fake Bake Self Tanner for Faces. I&#x27;ve gotten much better results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really good.  The price is right. It gives a natural color. I doesn&#x27;t make my hands orange.</li>
    <li> Yikes!  Extremely dangerous.  Look at the data from good guide [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gets a 0 rating for health (worse possible rating) due to containing Propyl Paraben and Octinoxate (not allowed in Japan, and high health concern in Japan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like getting a tan might actually be safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like this is a much better alternative (good health rating, and high ratings from users on Amazon):&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0051PLB6Q B0051PLB6Q]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True Natural Self Tanner: Anti-Aging Face &amp; Body (Lavender Scent)</li>
    <li> Great product for great price</li>
    <li> Keeps my face moisturized and gives it just a tinge of color.  Have used this product for years. Have found it harder and harder to find.</li>
    <li> Meh.  I&#x27;ve tried the Jergens tanning lotion for the body on my face and it works!  This lotion &#x27;for the face&#x27;... not so much.</li>
    <li> This is super moisturizing facial lotion which gives discreet healthy glow with added SPF 20. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3-4 years and I am not looking for other face lotions.</li>
    <li> very good facial moisturizer and it gives me the perfect glow</li>
    <li> Jergens is my favorite brand of self-tanner due to the nice tan color I get, plus it doesn&#x27;t have a bad after-smell like most brands do. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of self-tanning products and I highly recommend Jergens. I took away one star because this face moisturizer is so small (2 fl oz) compared to the regular daily moisturizer (7.5 fl oz) and it costs about the same price. I attached some photos so you can see the size difference. Because of the small size I will not purchase this again, and instead will use the regular 7.5 oz version on my face and body. I posted a video on my website CherylMartinez .com discussing the best self-tanning products, tips &amp; tricks if you want to check it out!</li>
    <li> Someone should please see me through on the meaning of all these medium to tan, light to medium, I am Anna Faris complexion, don&#x27;t know what is best for me</li>
    <li> I use this daily.  It isnt heavy or greasy like some make-up&#x27;s!  Tried finding it in a number of stores to no avail .  Paula</li>
    <li> I just received this product and the expiration date is next month. I&#x27;m not sure if I should use it because it says it was produced 3 years ago.</li>
    <li> Everything perfect. It gives a very natural glow to your face and fades evenly</li>
    <li> As someone who stopped using tanning beds years ago, I often see quite a pale face staring back at me in the mirror. I have no problem getting spray tans, but those can pricey and let&#x27;s be serious - cold! A girlfriend started using Jergens Natural Glow lotion, and I could really see a difference. I bought a bottle for myself, and was able to cut down on the amount of spray tans I was getting. I had one issue though - my body looked nice and bronzed, my face was still ghost white. I purchased the lotion that is specifically for the face as well, and I love it! I don&#x27;t use it every day, but when I think I need a little boost or know I have weekend plans, I&#x27;ll use it in the morning during that week and have a nice glow! I have great results with both the body lotion and the face lotion, though I will recommend to wash your hands good after use, or else you&#x27;ll start to see coloration on your palms! Also, the face lotion can come out a little thick, so small amounts work best or else it almost feels like a mask.&lt;br /&gt;**4.5 stars**</li>
    <li> Love this product and works great</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! I use it every day, mixed with a little extra bronzer gel. There&#x27;s definitely a limit to the color build up, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about looking orange at all. I would recommend applying the lotion all the way down the neck and behind the ears though, just so the color is even ;)</li>
    <li> 1st off I&#x27;m a black red bone male. My feet look sick after using this lotion. I was able to file the yellow out of my finger nails. You can still see it on my finger nails. If you focus. 3 weeks ago I use this product so now I can see my new clear nail growing out. Its almost at 1/2 clear nail and 1/2 yellow nail I can&#x27;t wait till my nails grow out. This is a women&#x27;s product I believe I just had bad chemistry with the product. I did like the way it made my skin look tho. It also turned the bottom of my foot yellow. The dead skin areas are were it absorbs with bad results. For example I do pull ups at the gym so my callous on my upper palm turned yellow. I conclusion this is not for men it was my fault so I will give them a three secretly but I hate this product so people will view the one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup and this is a major part of my morning ritual.  Skin is glowy and soft, never greasy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype.. I use the Jergen&#x27;s firming medium natural glow. It works great.. This one for the face I see no change at all?!? Hmmmmm. Guess it doesn&#x27;t work on me..</li>
    <li> Love the look it gives me, however, I wish it had a better smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Gives great, realistic looking color.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this lotion didn&#x27;t work well for me. I like the other products in the Jergens sunless tanning line, but this one is watery, greasy and caused my skin to break out. It did give some color, but I think that a bronzer does the job just as well, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a fake tan.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin tone.</li>
