      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>) Thank you :)</li>
      <li>I have wore this perfume for over 4-5 years and what was sent smells extremely strong and nothing like the perfume I wanted.</li>
      <li>Best little bottle of cologne I ever bought for my wife.  </li>
      <li>IF YOU LIKE THAT LIGHT SMELL</li>
      <li>The scent is light, but not so light as to not notice it.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived as described in original box.</li>
      <li>It got shipped to me super fast, way before I expected, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
      <li>It arrived in a timely manner with no damage and the bottle was full.</li>
      <li>I think this smells much &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than most floral perfumes, but it seems I might be in a minority on that one.</li>
      <li>I am hoping they will take care of this and refund my money quickly.</li>
      <li>and it came early, in a sealed (new) box and for a good price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very feminine with a light flower smell.</li>
      <li>It is a cheap knockoff being passed off as the real thing.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I thought I was getting.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to getting this since I ran out a while back and folks would tell me how much they liked the scent when I wore it.  </li>
      <li>A light sweet flower scent and you only have to apply once</li>
      <li>ABSOLUTELY EXACTLY</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as pretty as I remember.</li>
      <li>and I love it- lots of tropical floral notes, and it lasts for quite a long time.</li>
      <li>Good sized bottle that should last a long while.</li>
      <li>She loves the fragrance as much as I do.  </li>
      <li>It came so fast that I was amazed.</li>
      <li>This is not the real perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made with real honeysuckle.</li>
      <li>This is not for a little girl, it is a woman&#x27;s perfume, and like other Estee Lauder scents, it still smells great at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>It is such a fresh scent and not overpowering</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviews that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to enjoy it all day.</li>
      <li>It smells like something a vibrant, classy lady wears.</li>
      <li>I really love this perfume and have a hard time finding the lotion and powder..</li>
      <li>This is the answer for those ladies that are sensitive to smells.  </li>

<li> Sadly I got a brief e-mail from customer service stating it was DUE TO TECHNICAL ERROR that it is not deliverable to me.</li>
<li> THIS IS THE ONE, THERES NO OLD LADY SMELL HERE!!!!!!</li>
<li> So I order it on Amazin every few months</li>
<li> , the scent is not strong, but it can be smelled at 9 hours after you put it on.</li>
<li> Not nice...</li>
<li> It is floral but somewhat complex and sensual.</li>
<li> A delicate and pleasing sent that lasts.  </li>
<li> Seems to be watered down and the scent is very faint.  </li>
<li> Just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m soo disappointed as it is 5yrs</li>
<li> Worst order I have ever had for perfume.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Worst order I have ever had for perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like what this perfume smells like. I have wore this perfume for over 4-5 years and what was sent smells extremely strong and nothing like the perfume I wanted.</li>
    <li> It came so fast that I was amazed. The product is no longer in stores and my daughter just loves it.</li>
    <li> This perfum has a great smell for women. It&#x27;s very feminine with a light flower smell. It is not over-powering like other fragances I&#x27;ve smelled. Another one that is great is Miracle by Lancome.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time, but... There was no note attached to it!!! Not nice...</li>
    <li> Good sized bottle that should last a long while.</li>
    <li> I would buy from this seller again, &amp; encourage anyone not to hesitate from buying from this seller. They are wonderful in every way!</li>
    <li> This is one of the presents that my grown daughter requested. She was very pleased to receive it!</li>
    <li> I really love this perfume and have a hard time finding the lotion and powder.. So I order it on Amazin every few months</li>
    <li> My wife loved it. She&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> IF YOU LIKE THAT LIGHT SMELL, THAT ROMANTIC SMELL THIS IS THE ONE, THERES NO OLD LADY SMELL HERE!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it, the smell is beyond paradise :-), the scent is not strong, but it can be smelled at 9 hours after you put it on.</li>
    <li> I have used Beyond Paradise for years. I love most of Estee Lauder&#x27;s perfumes, but this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the 3.4oz and it came early, in a sealed (new) box and for a good price. I agree with other reviews that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to enjoy it all day. It smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was really looking forward to getting this since I ran out a while back and folks would tell me how much they liked the scent when I wore it.  However, it is not like my last bottle.  Seems to be watered down and the scent is very faint.  Very disappointing, especially since it cost so much money!!  I won&#x27;t buy anymore, anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents of all time. It&#x27;s made with real honeysuckle. You know on a spring day when you walk pass a honeysuckle bush and you can&#x27;t help but stop and take in that wonderful scent? You&#x27;ll smell like that, but even better, because it&#x27;s Estee Lauder :)</li>
    <li> It makes her smell like paradise!</li>
    <li> I will be wearing this for a while :) I have always stayed with the perfume -- Beautiful -- This though is # 1 for me and us :):) Thank you :)</li>
    <li> This definitely appears to be a love or hate thing and I love it- lots of tropical floral notes, and it lasts for quite a long time. I think this smells much &amp;#34;younger&amp;#34; than most floral perfumes, but it seems I might be in a minority on that one. I love this perfume, and it has become a favorite. I love the rainbow-colored bottle. Delightful!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I thought I was getting.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments when wearing this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is floral but somewhat complex and sensual. This is not for a little girl, it is a woman&#x27;s perfume, and like other Estee Lauder scents, it still smells great at the end of the day. This is excellent for daytime and perfect for the office as it is not overwhelming. It smells like something a vibrant, classy lady wears.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.......NICE SIZE BOTTLE....LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 3 years now and I still get compliments from people who see me almost every day.  The scent is light, but not so light as to not notice it.  The bottle is another plus, it looks great on a dresser.  I&#x27;ve been incredibly satisfied with this perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, soft, but sofisticated, the aparience its fancy so its perfect for me, I recomend to wearing it any time!!!</li>
    <li> great product! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I smelled this perfume on another woman while I was on vacation and asked her what it was. As soon as we got home I ordered a bottle. It is such a fresh scent and not overpowering</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne my wife uses.  She gets many compliments when she wears this fragrance.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> One of my all-time faves. It&#x27;s just as pretty as I remember. It&#x27;s light and floral, a perfect scent for spring and summer.</li>
    <li> Gotta love all Estee Lauder perfumes. My favorite perfumes are all made by Estee Lauder. I got a 3.4 oz for $54.99 and no shipping cost. Smells great; makes you want to go to paradise. It arrived in a timely manner with no damage and the bottle was full. Great deal and I will continue to purchase perfume from this company in the future. A light sweet flower scent and you only have to apply once and it last all day long.</li>
    <li> This is one of my top 3 perfumes.  I love the smell and get many complements. I always have to have some of this.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend LOVES this perfume, and so do I!</li>
    <li> arrived in great shape, thanks</li>
    <li> This is not the real perfume. It is a cheap knockoff being passed off as the real thing. I have contacted the seller and Amazon. Since this is a third party, I have to wait to hear from the seller. I am hoping they will take care of this and refund my money quickly. I have worn this perfume for YEARS and this is not even close.</li>
    <li> Best little bottle of cologne I ever bought for my wife.  She loves the fragrance as much as I do.  Just wish it was not so expensive.</li>
    <li> A delicate and pleasing sent that lasts.  This is the answer for those ladies that are sensitive to smells.  My gal has always gotten compliments about this fragrance when ever she wears it.</li>
    <li> My mom order it, she is very satisfied with the product, it smells really good and it&#x27;s her favorite of all.</li>
    <li> This was great! It got shipped to me super fast, way before I expected, and it&#x27;s perfect. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described in original box. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Sadly I got a brief e-mail from customer service stating it was DUE TO TECHNICAL ERROR that it is not deliverable to me. I&#x27;m soo disappointed as it is 5yrs anyway since I wore any.</li>
