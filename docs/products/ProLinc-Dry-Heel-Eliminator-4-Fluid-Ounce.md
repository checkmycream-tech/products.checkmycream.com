      <li>Great price!</li>

      <li>Keeping my heals nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>and I really love it.  </li>
      <li>I like the callus remover bath scrub but the lotion isn&#x27;t better than eucerin or any drug store product</li>
      <li>But if you put this on after every shower, you&#x27;ll be able to keep that issue at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>May need to use so many days in a roll for it to soften feet.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
      <li>It met my needs, made my foot feel better</li>
      <li>The lotion smells good,its ok.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this cream.</li>
      <li>, I got most of the callous off but not all</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s OK... but not a miracle.</li>
      <li>It made my feet super soft and delicious feeling.</li>
      <li>Soft beautiful heels.</li>
      <li>I use it twice a week to keep my heels from drying/cracking and from building up new calluses after using the callus remover once a week (which also works great, by the way).  </li>
      <li>This dry heel cream is the best I have ever used</li>
      <li>This product smells good but does not keep my feet very moisturized.</li>
      <li>I went easy</li>
      <li>This is the best active ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same</li>
      <li>Easy to use and seems to do the job.</li>
      <li>Use the paddle first then this amazing lotion.  </li>
      <li>It may be okay for someone that doesn&#x27;t have super dry/cracked heels.</li>
      <li>after just one night I noticed a huge improvement.  </li>
      <li>there are photos available of the size they sent me.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my feet silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>But it is important to mention here that this does not moisturize your feet.  </li>
      <li>When I use this cream every night before bed, my heels stay smooth</li>
      <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
      <li>I very rarely write a review</li>
      <li>I then wipe off my feet with a clean towel and use the foot scrapper.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s doing and excellent job keeping my feet soft and free of dry skin.</li>
      <li>Nothing special about this.</li>
      <li>Certainly nothing magical about it.</li>
      <li>but don&#x27;t think this did anything special for my feet.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff so much.</li>
      <li>After using for many months, I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t do anything that any decent moisturizer doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and just what I needed.</li>
      <li>The super star of he bunch is the callus eliminator, read my review.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but none as good as this one.  </li>
      <li>The product did exactly what it claimed!  </li>
      <li>If you want soft feet, buy this! :)</li>
      <li>I bought the ProLinc Callus Eliminator, 4 Fluid Ounce which was amazing and put this on afterwards.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if they switched the photos out so that customers knew what they are actually getting.  </li>
      <li>Effective cream, used daily, to prevent cracked heels.</li>
      <li>I put this lotion on my feet last night and really liked it.</li>
      <li>I still use the lotion after I shower, but other then that I dont do anything different, I still walk around my foot barefoot lol and no problems :)</li>
      <li>I had been using Kersal, which is sufficient, but was looking for something cheaper yet more effective in terms of exfoliation, helping to get rid of dry dead cracked skin and get to nice softer skin that feels moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away, even after using it just once.</li>
      <li>She was right.</li>
      <li>I bought after reading all the good reviews and I followed instructions accurately, but this product works only as well as the pumice stone you have to use following.</li>
      <li>With this regimen, my feet are as smooth and soft as they were when I was a kid!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
      <li>Heels are softer than they were, but return to exact state of being if you miss even a day.  </li>
      <li>but this stuff really works!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the stuff!  Arrived quickly and just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Am 48 years old and a lifetime of fighting dry skin and heels has ended with this product. It&#x27;s nice to know how other people without dry heels feel and I will buy this product until I kick the bucket.</li>
    <li> Have winter socks and dry air caused your feet to be an embarrassment at yoga class? Is summer sun and chlorine making you afraid to wear your flip-flops? Then this product is for you. It really works! It even helps with sore, badly peeling feet. Apply generously at night - best after a shower or bath - in the morning those cracks and rough patches are greatly improved. Use it as an emergency rescue or regularly to maintain your feet. I even use it to extend a pedicure to keep my feet looking neat and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is the best active ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same as used by toilet drain openers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19% use ventilation, do not touch skin, ingest, breathe, keep away from children. If ingest go to emergency room immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use gloves if use as professional and ventilation insufficient use of  \\&quot;organic\\&quot; respirator recommended by many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best formula on market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not green, organic or harmless.</li>
    <li> So I have some terrible feet!  I am 32 but my feet look about 80, my husband cant believe how awfully callous they were.    I tried everything.  Vaseline on at night with socks on, sea salt soak, ped egg, baby oil.  Nothing works!     So I found this stuff on amazon and figured I&#x27;d try it, I also got the callus lotion and a different type of foot scrapper.    I can tell you my feet are just wonderful now, and so soft, you would never believe I had terrible callous feet.    the first time I used it I went easy, I got most of the callous off but not all, I had it pretty thick, I think I did a bit to much because my heel was a bit sore at first but it soon pass.  I do this every 7 days (Once a week), I let my feet soak for about 10 mins in a nice warm soak, I then apply the Callus Eliminator and leave it on 5 mins.  I then wipe off my feet with a clean towel and use the foot scrapper.  I give them another quick soak to wash off the rest of the callus stuff and dead skin and apply the lotion, and my feet are just so soft.    I still use the lotion after I shower, but other then that I dont do anything different, I still walk around my foot barefoot lol and no problems :)</li>
    <li> Like most, I was skeptical at first but this stuff really works! I use it once a day --- it&#x27;s easy to apply, not too greasy, and has eliminated much of the dryness that has plagued me for that last 10-15 years.</li>
    <li> I have tried all sorts of products for rough heels.  Let me tell you, after just one night I noticed a huge improvement.  I slather this stuff over my entire feet and the next morning they look pedicure fresh.  You also need to use the metal sloughing tool to get the dead skin off too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week now.  Heels are softer than they were, but return to exact state of being if you miss even a day.  That being said, though the product softens the dry heels, it doesn&#x27;t provide enough hydration, so I still have to use another product to make the skin comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use it regularly until the first tube is gone, then I&#x27;ll give an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;This product must be applied daily and followed by additional moisture for optimal results, but it is in a class  by itself for making feet soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fabu foot care, use the micro plane, then apply some of this to heels, and follow up with a slathering of a good foot cream.  Your feet will thank you and you will notice a difference!!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Great price! It&#x27;s doing and excellent job keeping my feet soft and free of dry skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really eliminate dry heels... it just moisturizes temporarily; just like almost every other brand of skin cream.  It&#x27;s OK... but not a miracle.</li>
    <li> This along with the callas eliminator are the best two products I&#x27;ve ever used on my tough old feet. It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to like feeling my feet again.</li>
    <li> This cream does magic to my rough heels - they are rather soft now. The smell is nice and not invasive.</li>
    <li> This stuff just works. Use it once or twice a week for even the worst calluses on heels. Glad I found this!</li>
    <li> I had this product recommended by a really great pedicurist.  I use it every night with cotton socks.  It keeps my feet silky smooth.  However, I am aware that this product needs to be used in tandem with other products that this company offers.  This is something that you have to research on your own.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Dry Heel Eliminator and the photo shows a large bottle with a pump.  I received a small flat tube that would not by weight need a pump.  So what I paid for was a smaller size then shown.  Other than that I am pleased with the heel lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The photo shown is for the 16oz....there are photos available of the size they sent me.  I prefer using pumps as it is easier to deal with when using these types of products.  It would be nice if they switched the photos out so that customers knew what they are actually getting.  Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it , it does not hydrate the skin, it soft out the death surface of the skin like chemical pilling , it is not product for dry skin ,it is for removing death skin cells so your regular feet lotion can be absorb better and keep the feet hydrated what will prevent dry heel , it is very effective after first use , I had to use gloves as it soft out my finger tips that become sensitive ..</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff. It leaves my feet feeling really soft. I don&#x27;t have dry heels but I always have to have lotion on my feet. A little sticky when you first put it on but absorbs nicely. If you want soft feet, buy this! :)</li>
    <li> I am a stickler for dry cracked heels and I have used all different products. Now this one is here and I love it.  Get a pedicure and use it afterwards it keeps your feet looking soft and dry free.</li>
    <li> The lotion smells good,its ok. I don&#x27;t think it works as well as advertised. I will not buy this lotion again.</li>
    <li> The product did exactly what it claimed!  It met my needs, made my foot feel better - what&#x27;s not to like!</li>
    <li> My pedicurist insisted I try this cream and said it would make more of a difference in keeping my heels from being rough and cracking than any other cream I have ever tried. She was right. When I use this cream every night before bed, my heels stay smooth--amazing! I am able to skip an pedicure appointment now and only go every other month. I read reviews of this product and related ones by the company and I would be careful about using some of their other products, as they seem to be strong enough to cause burning, but Dry Heel Eliminator is the right strength and does the job very well. I am buying several to give in Christmas stockings this year for the young ladies in my family.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for the cost. I recommend it to anybody for purchase. Also a very good price.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully.  Keeping my heals nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Results in days, love this product, my heels were very dry but after applying this cream daily it has made a huge difference!</li>
    <li> This lotion is miraculous in its ability to cure rough and cracked heels. It works on all other skin as well.</li>
    <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not what i expected...........thought it would help to soften my rough heals, but it didn&#x27;t do what i expected.  would try another product.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works!  I have had dry cracked heals in the past and since using this product, I no longer have this problem. I got a pedicure one day and the person who did my pedi asked me what I used to have such smooth heals.  I told him about this product.  One thing you need to remember about this product is that it is therapy.  You have to use it every day. A little dab will do you. It is not greasy. I put a small amount on my heals at night and sometimes in the morning. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I thought there was no way that just a lotion could fix the cracks in my heels, but it does!  Its time for flipflops and winter isn&#x27;t kind to anyones feet.  It was so try my heels would get really dry no matter how much lotion I put or how much I scrubbed with pumice.  I stated applying this lotion everyday when I got out of the shower, and in only ONE WEEK, my heels were soft and smooth!  This is a summer must have!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years and it not only takes care of my dry heels but has reduced the size of my calluses so I don&#x27;t have to go to the foot doctor as often to remove the calluses.</li>
    <li> I have used so many products to try to get rid of the ugly hard skin on my heal for YEARS.  I was happy when I found the peg egg, but the results did not last that long and after using it I still saw the cracks in my heel and it hurt very bad sometimes.  I purchased the be natural dry heel eliminator and I was amaZed.  I love this product.  I soaked my feet for about five min and I put on some gloves and poured a little of the heel eliminator on the glove and I rubbed my feet where the dry skin was at and I left it on for about 3-4 min.  I used Denco Easy Grip Professional Foot Smoother to get all of that dry skin off of my feet and let me tell you my feet was as smooth as it have every been. I have not been able to wear sandals or pretty flip flops or anything because of that ugly dry skin on my heal.  Since I used this dry heel eliminator I can&#x27;t wait for summer time to grt here because I am putting on me some pretty flip flops and I&#x27;m about to show off my pretty feet.  LOL I am very happy I bought this product and I will continue to use when needed.  thanks for reading my review...</li>
    <li> Simply the best foot moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s heel magic in a bottle!</li>
    <li> Get a pedicure then use this after bathing. Wonderful</li>
    <li> This product smells good but does not keep my feet very moisturized. It may be okay for someone that doesn&#x27;t have super dry/cracked heels.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of the dry heel eliminator and I think it works well... as long as you use it every day... well, like most of the other moisturizing creams!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best heel softener I&#x27;ve found to date.  It really does work.  I use it twice a week to keep my heels from drying/cracking and from building up new calluses after using the callus remover once a week (which also works great, by the way).  The best way I have found to use it is to slather it on at night and then cover it with some socks so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your sheets while you sleep.  In the morning, my feet are soft and supple...my boyfriend even commented as such.  It also is a great buy - I&#x27;ve tried other lotions that cost twice as much and don&#x27;t work half as well.  Give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write a review but I had to on this product. This dry heel cream is the best I have ever used and I have bought a lot through the years. Living in the Northeast and the dry heat we get from our heaters being on all the time our skin and heels get extremely dry. When I put the product on didn&#x27;t expect much and was truly surprised when at the end of day my skin was still smooth and soft especially my heels. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but none as good as this one.  If you use a few dabs daily, it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I been using this product, I should use it every day but i don&#x27;t. It works! my dry area is looking better.</li>
    <li> I use this daily and it has helped immensely with my dry, cracked heels. I put it on every morning before my socks and shoes and it keeps my feet feeling awesome. GET THIS NOW!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great alone but even better when you use that pedegg after a bath or shower. It last a long time as well, the smoothness that is.</li>
    <li> This product works well....but you have to apply it daily if you want your skin/heals to stay soft.  I mean if you miss a day your all dry and cracked all over again.</li>
    <li> After using for many months, I have to say that it doesn&#x27;t do anything that any decent moisturizer doesn&#x27;t. My heels are no better today than when I began using it. Buffing is still required, so I&#x27;d say save your money.</li>
    <li> This works great, I bought the callus eliminator, microplane colossal and this. The super star of he bunch is the callus eliminator, read my review.</li>
    <li> First purchased this as part of a kit, and now back to reorder it separately because of how ll it moisturizes and relieves dry hands/cuticles, elbows (as well as dry heels).  Sinks into skin immediately and does not feel greasy.  Ordered this size to keep in my purse/car as well as a large 16 ounce pump bottle to use at home.  Contains lots of good ingredients like urea, aloe, canola oil, olive leaf extract, vitamin A, vitwmin E (tocopherol acetate), vitamin C (ascorbyl phosphate).  Very affordable and best of all it WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product.  I used it after using the Microplane foot file paddle and my heels are amazing.  I went from ugly dry, cracked and bleeding heels to soft heels.  Had I not used these items myself, I would not have believed the results, AMAZING!  I just ordered additional bottles. Use the paddle first then this amazing lotion.  You will not regret it. Soft beautiful heels. YAY!</li>
    <li> I bought after reading all the good reviews and I followed instructions accurately, but this product works only as well as the pumice stone you have to use following. Certainly nothing magical about it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it. It is not different from any average moisturizer you can get from the drug store. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this that actually works, for a long time. Finally! This product along with the callus eliminator is the best!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff so much. Works wonders with the skin removal gel. It made my feet super soft and delicious feeling.</li>
    <li> Keep feet moisturized.</li>
    <li> As advertised this item helps tremendously with dry heels.  Noticeable difference within a few days.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I care for my husband, and this product makes caring for his feet so easy!&lt;br /&gt;It is so smoothing, softening, and healing.</li>
    <li> If you are looking at this product, you have probably tried many other products. This one does work well and the price is/was great. For severe, deep cracks, the Emu oil product should be where you start.</li>
    <li> I bought a tiny bottle of this at a local store and was so suprised that it really works so got on line to get a larger bottle. I use it once a day and no more cracked, horrible looking heels. I highly recommend to anyone who is bothered by dry, cracked heels.</li>
    <li> I put this lotion on my feet last night and really liked it. I am very picky when it comes to my feet.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I even use it on dry hands and it&#x27;s the first thing that helps my dry cuticles here in California.</li>
    <li> At first it seemed that this was just sloughing the dead skin off my foot. Closer examination revealed that when you scrub the product off your feet, it comes off as a thick goop which might be mistaken for dead skin, but is merely the product which thickens when dry.</li>
    <li> works well when soaking  your feet and elimating dry callused heels hands  elbows feet,my husband and I enjoy this product</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and using lotion.  May need to use so many days in a roll for it to soften feet.</li>
    <li> Effective cream, used daily, to prevent cracked heels. Easy to use and seems to do the job. Reasonable price for the size.</li>
    <li> i use  the callus eliminator made by the same manufacturer which is the product my salon uses.  i worked well so I tried this creme after trying everything even prescription creme.  this product works very well if used on a daily basis.  You only need a little after showering.  I highly recommend it and have given it as a gift along with a pedicure gift certificate.</li>
    <li> I have an ongoing problem with dry feet and callous build up. I&#x27;ve tried expensive products that did an ok job. This product really works and during my last pedicure, the pedicurist used their callous-remover product. I put this lotion on my feet and put comfy socks on before bedtime or use it before putting on my socks for the day. Great product.</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this. It just felt like ordinary  lotion.  A bit thicker than your run of the mill body lotions but don&#x27;t think this did anything special for my feet. I don&#x27;t have particulary rough heels to begin with but didn&#x27;t see a difference after use of this product. Tried it got 2 weeks. I&#x27;ll stick with my usual body lotion for now. I&#x27;ve been using the rest for my elbows at night. Not sure it makes a difference there but I don&#x27;t like the smell enough to use it anywhere else and couldn&#x27;t be bothered to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Please let amazon know if this review was helpful.</li>
    <li> it feels soft to have it  on the skin. i use it daily as a regular dry heel lotion not only after callus removal.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. After a few application I went from rough feet that caught on my bed sheets to relatively smooth feet (not sounding like sand paper catching on my sheets anymore).  Yes, I need a few more applications before I&#x27;ll be rid of all the cracks on my heels but I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was told by the sales clerk that every professional recommended this product and she just couldn&#x27;t keep it on the shelf. SURE! But I am totally shocked by the results. I was a vaseline/sock person, soak and scrub until I was weary. Not a skeptic anymore. Love this cream.</li>
    <li> This product works well.  I have some calluses on the heels of my feet.  I bought the ProLinc Callus Eliminator, 4 Fluid Ounce which was amazing and put this on afterwards. It does feel nice and works well but not as amazing as the eliminator.&lt;br /&gt;Still,  I would buy this again when I run out because it is a good value.</li>
    <li> Where has this stuff been all of my life?? Amazing. Works great! I used a foot scrub in the shower by The Tree Hut first, then applied this after and put on socks for bedtime. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have dry feet and my husband gives me foot massages almost daily....but he hates the feel of lotion on his hands. We&#x27;ve always had a difficult time finding lotion that he likes as most feel greasy to him or start to ball up and it drives him crazy. This lotion however does not have a greasy feel to it nor does it ball up. So my husband of course loves this lotion. It even smells nice as well.</li>
    <li> I like the callus remover bath scrub but the lotion isn&#x27;t better than eucerin or any drug store product</li>
    <li> This product made a big difference in my feet. I always get dry, cracked heels no matter what I do. This works well. I noticed a difference right away, even after using it just once. Now I use it once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I noticed my heels started feeling smoother after one use. I am running Iow and need to buy another one soon. definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this instead of the well-known \\&quot;Kersal\\&quot; brand of dry foot/heel treatment.  I do not have calluses.  But I do have very dry feet that sometimes crack at the heels.  Regular lotion and standard pumicing alone is not enough to get my feet nice and soft.  I had been using Kersal, which is sufficient, but was looking for something cheaper yet more effective in terms of exfoliation, helping to get rid of dry dead cracked skin and get to nice softer skin that feels moisturized.  So far so good with this product. This really does work! ( It also cheaper than other products I had been using before.) However I just started using it.  I will write another review after I have been using it longer.&lt;br /&gt;April 1-  so I have been using this product for a while now and I really love it.  It is terrific at exfoliating the dry skin on your heels and all over the bottom of your feet.  But it is important to mention here that this does not moisturize your feet.  It exfoliates and removes the dry skin from the souls of your feet.  You will need use a thick moisturizing lotion on your feet after this product has been fully absorbed.  I found thst this is best used after you have scrubbed or pumiced your feet in the shower.  With this regimen, my feet are as smooth and soft as they were when I was a kid!</li>
    <li> If you skip a day, your peely, flaky feet will come back immediately.  But if you put this on after every shower, you&#x27;ll be able to keep that issue at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the bottle seems small, but a little goes a long way.  It&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
