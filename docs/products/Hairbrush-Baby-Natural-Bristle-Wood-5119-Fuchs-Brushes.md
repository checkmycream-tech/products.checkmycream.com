<li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my little girl since she was born.  </li>
<li> The bristles are firm but not overly so.  </li>

    <li> This brush is really great. It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair very soft &amp; silky!! I also bought one for my nephew and his hair has never looked better.</li>
    <li> The brush is nice and soft but bristles come out at almost every stroke. I just don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s good quality control. The bristles become one more thing I have to worry about my toddlers putting in their mouth but it&#x27;s also one more thing to clean up. In terms of size and softness it&#x27;s perfect. Bristles falling out that much is not what I consider normal.</li>

    <li> Not my favorite. It makes my daughter&#x27;s fine, curly hair very frizzy. Might be better for a newborn.</li>
    <li> My natural baby brush was too soft for the mob of hair my daughter is growing. This is perfect...not to hard or soft. I may get another for play for she likes brushing her own hair. Price is great on Amazon. Two pack offered better deal. I would get that one if you need to or just ordering.</li>
    <li> My son has a lot of hair and keeps meddling them all the time. This comb has soft bristles and is gentle on my son&#x27;s head. Does it&#x27;s job well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is the handle is a little small. When I try to comb his hair, I feel it could be a little bigger. Other than that, it works great!</li>
    <li> Okay, I admit that I brush her hair at least once a day, usually while she is nursing. This brush has the perfect amount of stiffness for a baby&#x27;s head...not too hard, not too soft. So far (born with a head of hair and still has it all at almost 6 months) I&#x27;ve maybe seen 4-5 bristles come off. Not bad!</li>
    <li> It is very soft and I followed the tip to rub some oil on it and it feels even softer now. I&#x27;m using it for the baby&#x27;s fine hair and although it looses some of its bristles it is a great brush. Very affordable too.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Bought it to use as a clothes brush for a fur I bought.  It worked just as I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> EDIT: although this brush does a fine job with my daughter&#x27;s hair, and she loves it both as a toy and hairbrush, it sheds.  Baby easily pulls the bristles out, and some come out when brushing hair too.     We wanted a natural brush for baby and this fit the bill.  Our daughter loves having her hair brushed and this brush helps with her dry scalp.  The bristles are firm but not overly so.  She doesn&#x27;t currently have much hair at 2-3 months but I think this brush will last her a long time.</li>

    <li> I was very disappointed as the it actually doesn&#x27;t brush even very fine little hair. It doesn&#x27;t brush at all.</li>
    <li> High quality, gentle and cute!  Much better than those cheapies you get in the grooming kits. This will last a lifetime.</li>

    <li> i love it ,l,looks very lovely and very suit my baby.the quality&lt;br /&gt;is very well.soft handle&lt;br /&gt; i will recommend this product to my firends</li>
    <li> Natural little baby brush. My little one just turnd 6 month and already has some decent hair to brush. I use it also to massage his scalp to try to avoid a cradle cap. Works well. I also use Sweetsation Therapy baby hair wash that helps with that. It helps.</li>
    <li> I wanted a keepsake as well as a quality baby brush and this is it. Exactly as advertised. I plan to get it engraved with the baby&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> Never has baby&#x27;s hair looked so fine.</li>
    <li> Bought it twice after losing the first one.  Really good at combing dinner out of a one-year-old&#x27;s long curly hair.</li>

    <li> I love this baby brush. It is soft but yet still brushes my babies hair. It is good quality and I&#x27;m glad it is made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Cute little brush! My baby loves the soft bristles &amp; for the price, I&#x27;d gladly buy several more. Two brushes are included.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 14-month-old for Christmas. We&#x27;ve been using it for about six weeks and really like it.  Works great for her thick-volume, but fine-texture hair.  She loves to try to brush her own hair. WE HAVE NOT LOST ANY BRISTLES! After doing much research, I&#x27;m glad I chose this brush!</li>
