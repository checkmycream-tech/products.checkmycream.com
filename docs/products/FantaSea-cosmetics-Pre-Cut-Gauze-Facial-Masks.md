      <li>The price was great and they work wonderful.</li>
      <li>LOL</li>
      <li>I have a need (LOL).</li>
      <li>They are what they are but they do work great</li>
      <li>Good product and great shipping.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Very useful product work perfect when I use paraffin</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>more easy to take off</li>
      <li>Good product, thanks, arrive at time too</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Clay must be moist to be effective and if you let it dry, it will not be good to your skin.</li>
      <li>not bad but its not quite fit well for me.</li>
      <li>Plus you look so cool wearing it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;s see how these &amp;#34;masks&amp;#34; have received such good reviews.</li>
      <li>Great for lotion masks and whatever other DIY mask kitchen concoction.</li>
      <li>They fit nicely on the eyes, nose and mouth, but you obviously want to cut to size.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described and shown in the pic.</li>
      <li>rather wait for these than use the first set.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty large.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable delivery time.</li>
      <li>It was my fault for not realizing before I bought these for use under my high frequency device, but the nose is cut out.</li>
      <li>and when use high frequency also work with any mask&lt;br /&gt;make</li>
      <li>Not everyone knows you&#x27;re supposed to keep a clay mask moist the whole entire time.</li>
      <li>Very stringy and the webbing is very thin, so require more than one to use to hold applied potions to face for rmoisturizing nightly.</li>
      <li>But she purchased a mask that required the use of facial gauze masks and we couldn&#x27;t find them at any professional beauty supply stores (like CosmoProf and Salon Centric).</li>

<li> Can you make them in pink please?</li>
<li> The threads are so wide apart</li>
<li> They cannot hold any liquid for that reason and are useless as a facial sheet.</li>
<li> I hated these facial masks.  </li>

    <li> Exactly as described and shown in the pic.</li>
    <li> Good product. Reasonable delivery time.</li>
    <li> Very good product ... When I use my home made face I use this I love it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;s see how these &amp;#34;masks&amp;#34; have received such good reviews. The threads are so wide apart I can stick my finger through them. They cannot hold any liquid for that reason and are useless as a facial sheet.</li>
    <li> I hated these facial masks.  Very stringy and the webbing is very thin, so require more than one to use to hold applied potions to face for rmoisturizing nightly. Amazon also have some that appear thicker and are a different type of fabric, but they take a month to come from China.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather wait for these than use the first set.  Cut them up and made bandages from them, just in case I have a need (LOL).</li>
    <li> Good product, thanks, arrive at time too</li>
    <li> Good product and great shipping.</li>
    <li> These are pretty large.  They fit nicely on the eyes, nose and mouth, but you obviously want to cut to size.</li>
    <li> It was my fault for not realizing before I bought these for use under my high frequency device, but the nose is cut out. Why on earth would the nose be cut out? I also mistakenly believed them to be hoods so I could use them on myself but they are face only. That was my fault, not the product fault.</li>
    <li> Best on the web. Not everyone knows you&#x27;re supposed to keep a clay mask moist the whole entire time. Clay must be moist to be effective and if you let it dry, it will not be good to your skin. So you can moisten this and use it to keep the clay mask moist! Great for lotion masks and whatever other DIY mask kitchen concoction. Plus you look so cool wearing it. Can you make them in pink please? LOL</li>
    <li> My mother is a cosmetologist and does my facials for me and I never knew this existed. But she purchased a mask that required the use of facial gauze masks and we couldn&#x27;t find them at any professional beauty supply stores (like CosmoProf and Salon Centric). I never thought I would find them on Amazon, but I did. The price was great and they work wonderful. We will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Work so well for me, however i wish it doesn&#x27;t have the eyes and mouth cut</li>
    <li> They are what they are but they do work great</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Thank you</li>
    <li> Very useful product work perfect when I use paraffin&lt;br /&gt;mask and when use high frequency also work with any mask&lt;br /&gt;make more easy to take off</li>
    <li> not bad but its not quite fit well for me.</li>
