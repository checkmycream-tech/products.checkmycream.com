      <li>SKIN IS NICE AND SMOOTH</li>
      <li>I love this product,  I</li>
      <li>Just joking, I know you can get in on the net,but thats how much I love their products</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping more wrinkles will disappear.  </li>
      <li>I would say this is mostly for wrinkle prevention and not for anti-wrinkle.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
      <li>so i put this on top of that at night.</li>
      <li>This cream feels nice and smooth and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>but it is strongly scented..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok product but nothing special.</li>
      <li>, just make the face feel smooth and</li>
      <li>My skin has never been this smooth or luminous.</li>
      <li>Applying this product makes my skin feel comfortable so the florescent lights no longer bother the skin on my face.  </li>
      <li>I tend to like things unscented or lightly scented.  </li>
      <li>I liked it so much I also purchased the Day cream too.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, not as good as STRIVECTIN, but now i have enough cream for years!!!  </li>
      <li>My face feels soft and I am allergic to so many things it was nice to find a line of creams that I can use.</li>
      <li>I do like the cream because it is soft and creamy and smells good.</li>
      <li>I used to use it but the price has gotten kind of high.</li>
      <li>An affordable quality product well worth the money!</li>
      <li>and clean up their product.</li>
      <li>and I certainly intend to purchase more of this cream</li>
      <li>THIS BOOTS 7 CREAM IS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE AND FOR  THIS 65 YEAR OLD</li>
      <li>has a great smell, but after one jar, no better than most creams you buy at drug store...bought because of the good housekeeping seal but performance was same as any others not with seal.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s almost a sweet orange</li>
      <li>Not a bad cream, but not a miracle worker either.  </li>
      <li>I started using the night cream and the serum and not only was my skin moisturized, but it had a beautiful healthy glow with younger more vibrant look.  </li>
      <li>I like to smell fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>WHAT A LAUGH.</li>
      <li>Ethylparaben is linked to cancer and is absorbed by the skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs right away</li>
      <li>It does NOT accomplish anything more than an inexpensive night cream from CVS could do for more than half the price</li>
      <li>It is even better paired with the serum, which soaked into my skin almost instantly altho having a milky texture.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had better, like Total Moisture by Benefit.  </li>
      <li>In the morning my skin feels smooth, soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a more scented than I wanted which is the only downside.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It made my skin feel much more comfortable, even during the day, after a few use.</li>
      <li>Highly rated product, worth every penny.</li>
      <li>One container lasts me about three to four months with daily use - it is pretty easy to apply so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to cover your face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my face feel hydrated but I think over rated but it feels good and non greasy</li>
    <li> very moisturizing. use it nightly.. on top of serum</li>
    <li> This is awesome. My face feels soft .</li>
    <li> I LOVE BOOTS! If the U.S. decided not to sell Boots anymore, if I could afford it, I&#x27;d go to England just to buy some! Just joking, I know you can get in on the net,but thats how much I love their products</li>
    <li> I have tried every skin care product out there (La Mer, SK II, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Origins, etc) and nothing has improved the quality of my skin like the Boots products. It is truly amazing.  I use the Pore and Perfect Night and Day cream, as well as the Intense beauty serum.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot (my skin is oily, so I don&#x27;t slather it on) and it lasts forever.  My skin is smoother and has a nice glow.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> I ordered the No 7 face cream, ONE only. I got FOUR. Why do you guys always send doubles or triples or quadruple? i know you make more money that way, but i didn&#x27;t WANT four. I also didn&#x27;t want to pay for shipping back.   It&#x27;s ok, not as good as STRIVECTIN, but now i have enough cream for years!!!  kersti Stoen  PS try to keep orders straight so pple don&#x27;t get charged for FOUR items instead of ONE!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from my local target. I am 34 and decided it was time to add a night cream to my regimen. In the past I have used skinceutical. I loved the result but couldn&#x27;t stomach the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used boots no. 7 day cream for years.I have normal to oily sensitive skin and usually breakout easily. I have used protect and profect night cream, without using the serum, for the past 4 nights. My skin has never been this smooth or luminous.</li>
    <li> Boots No7 line of products is awesome.  I especially love this night cream, that goes on smooth, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AARP eligible &amp; I really do love the way this stuff works to make facial skin look &amp; feel softer, brighter &amp; younger.. I&#x27;m a believer after a month- I&#x27;ll definitely buy again- I would like to tell women that if you are sensitive to perfume- this isn&#x27;t the cream for you- It smells quite nice- but it is strongly scented..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 3 years now. Very silky. Smells good. Non greasy. A little goes a long way. Very satisfied with this line.</li>
    <li> I like this product but haven&#x27;t seen much results</li>
    <li> This cream is so thick and rich that it&#x27;s almost gel like in texture. But, when you smooth it on it instantly transforms into a super soft skin barrier, without being heavy, greasy or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;And the smell is sooo nice. (Like the day cream it&#x27;s almost a sweet orange scent.)&lt;br /&gt;Its in a nice glass jar, and looks as nice as it works, finally, something affordable that works as great as the department store brands. Awesome!</li>
    <li> I bought it cuz my face gets flaky and dry in the winter. I have combination skin and was worried this cream would be too creamy and makes me break out. The cream smells great, goes on smoothly, and feels very comfortable, not oily/greasy as some creams are. Part of it does gets soaked into the skin, and part of it feels like it sits on top of the skin (but not in a bad way, just make the face feel smooth and supple).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin feel much more comfortable, even during the day, after a few use. It is even better paired with the serum, which soaked into my skin almost instantly altho having a milky texture. I tried the day cream version, which was slightly greasy and made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this night cream for dry/combination/normal skin. I can&#x27;t really tell if it reduces the one tiny teeny wrinkle under my eye (I&#x27;m 20 afterall), but it did reduce dehydration lines and makes your skin feel great. I would say this is mostly for wrinkle prevention and not for anti-wrinkle.</li>
    <li> The first few days I was able to see the difference. My face looks and feels a little more firm.</li>
    <li> I really like the moisturizing this cream provides.  And the fragrance is wonderful!  It really seems to diminish lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Have always loved the Boots/No7 product line and its great to have them come right to my door! Pricing is great!</li>
    <li> Not a bad cream, but not a miracle worker either.  I don&#x27;t much care for the scent, but there&#x27;s not a whole lot of perfumy smells I care for anyway.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
    <li> This is less expensive than most of the night creams I have tried. It has ceramides in it which has recently been recommended by several dermatologists for use after peels. It is not sticky or greasy which is a big plus. It has a mild ,pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Ok. My skin was a bit softer. Did not see any other difference.</li>
    <li> I am dissapointed in this item, because I felt that it did not work as well as I expected it to.</li>
    <li> Not for me..not enough moisture.</li>
    <li> I sit under florescent lights all day.  The skin on my face ends up hurting by the end of the day.  Applying this product makes my skin feel comfortable so the florescent lights no longer bother the skin on my face.  A little goes a looooooooong way.  Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love this product,  I so someone recommend it on Dr. Oz show I decided to try it out.  So happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I also use the night time serum, the day cream and the eye serum.  My face feels soft and I am allergic to so many things it was nice to find a line of creams that I can use.</li>
    <li> Probably the best and most affordable night creme out there.</li>
    <li> I choose this product because I have lost a lot of weight and I need something to help with the sagging skin in my neck and face.  It has improved my skin so much and it is even softer then before..</li>
    <li> this stuff really moisturizers your skin. Works for me bec i use a retinol which is drying so i put this on top of that at night. the next morning i hv a glow</li>
    <li> I have had problems with dry skin but I don&#x27;t like heavy creams.  This works great and smells great too.  I liked it so much I also purchased the Day cream too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. This product clearly does not work. I used it daily as recommended  but it proved to be just another promise in a bottle. I was terribly disappointed and do not recommend throwing your money away.</li>
    <li> The feeling of my skin was remarkable.  I&#x27;m hoping more wrinkles will disappear.  The more I use the product, the more I like it.  I intend to continue using Boots No 7 all facial products.</li>
    <li> Be careful you actually get the size you think you are getting.  I thought I had carefully made sure it was 2.4oz for the money I was spending.  But they sent the 1.7oz size.  It is also heavily scented which I do not like!  It&#x27;s not a great scent either.  Feels okay on my skin but I&#x27;ve had better, like Total Moisture by Benefit.  It&#x27;s amazing but it&#x27;s  expensive so I thought I&#x27;d try something else.  Will be stuck with this stinky container for awhile as it seems like to much of a hassle to return to Amazon and pay the shipping.</li>
    <li> THIS BOOTS 7 CREAM IS AMAZING FOR THE PRICE AND FOR  THIS 65 YEAR OLD, I AM TRULY A BOOTS CONVERT. THIS WHOLE  LINE OF SKIN CARE IS THE \\&quot;CATS WHISKERS\\&quot;!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that doesn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
    <li> If you are looking fot a lightweight nightcream that requires a small amount, then this it the one for you.love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that tends to be a little sensitive to break outs.  I started using the night cream and the serum and not only was my skin moisturized, but it had a beautiful healthy glow with younger more vibrant look.  It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs right away and my skin is clearer than ever.  I LOVE this stuff!  My skin feels and looks great! I just moved from California to Alberta and the lack of humidity is about killing me!  I accidentally packed it in my boxes and I&#x27;ve noticed such a difference in the texture of my skin when I didn&#x27;t have it.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Boots no.7 is my favorite products to use. I have extremely sensitive skin but no.7 products have never been a problem for my skin. They make me glow :) great buy! A little pricy but worth it</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 months. Haven&#x27;t seen much, if any, improvement in facial lines. But will give it one more shot.</li>
    <li> This cream feels nice and smooth and absorbs quickly.  It&#x27;s a more scented than I wanted which is the only downside.  I tend to like things unscented or lightly scented.  My skin feels great in the morning.</li>
    <li> has a great smell, but after one jar, no better than most creams you buy at drug store...bought because of the good housekeeping seal but performance was same as any others not with seal.</li>
    <li> I like this cream even better than the day version of it. I will sometimes use this during the day if I am using a separate product that has SPF in it. This version is less greasy and feels better to wear. It has a wonderful light scent and makes my skin feel very smooth. One container lasts me about three to four months with daily use - it is pretty easy to apply so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot to cover your face.</li>
    <li> NICE PRODUCT, BUT AS YET SEE NO GREAT RESULTS.  SKIN IS NICE AND SMOOTH THOUGH WHEN USE.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all.  The No 7 is perfect for my skin.  I tend to be dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream because the reviews said it would reduce the wrinkles. WHAT A LAUGH. I do like the cream because it is soft and creamy and smells good. But there is NO CREAM OUT THERE THAT WILL REDUCE WRINKLES. If there is, would someone PLEASE tell me what it is. I have worn moisture cream for MANY years and none of it will STOP wrinkles. I won&#x27;t do BOTOX or PLASTIC SURGERY so I guess I will just live with the wrinkles. For what this cream costs I would NOT buy it again.</li>
    <li> must be used in conjunction with the day cream to see how it helps the skin,it gives it a glow in the morning.</li>
    <li> I tried every company and Boots No7 is by far the best one!!! Your face feels soft when you apply the cream but the best part is your skin is as soft in the morning as it was the night before.</li>
    <li> It feels like a quality product, and the jar does too. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> An affordable quality product well worth the money! Absorbs easily and deliveries everything that a night cream for mature dry skin should. Highly rated product, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Greasy but makes me feel very moisturized after washing my face.  Would never ever use during the day</li>
    <li> For those of you who are allergic to &#x27;fragrance&#x27; STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!  I purchased it in a pack of three products:  the serum, day cream and night cream.  The package was labelled &#x27;hypoallergenic&#x27; and I couldn&#x27;t figure out why I have been up the past two nights with itching so bad that I bruised--and that is with Benadryl and Zyrtec on board!  It finally occurred to me and I found the ingredients on drugstore.com.  &#x27;fragrance&#x27; is listed in the middle of the ingredients so its not a small or judicial amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is in my pillows so now I get to buy new memory foam pillows.  Thanks for nothing Boots.</li>
    <li> I had seen this product on the Dr Oz show and decided I would try it, it is a great night cream, made my face feel really good.</li>
    <li> Great product and ships fast</li>
    <li> Greatest night cream.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD AND KEEPS MY FACE MOISTURIZED. DOES IT&#x27;S JOB WELL. I BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOTHER THIS CHRISTMAS BECAUSE I LOVE IT. AND IT&#x27;S AFFORDABLE</li>
    <li> Ethylparaben is linked to cancer and is absorbed by the skin.  Parabens have been found in human breast cancer tumors.  Sadly, it&#x27;s not an uncommon fungicide used to preserve skin and hair care products as well as food.  I wouldn&#x27;t put it on my face or in my mouth, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I used to use it but the price has gotten kind of high. I prefer olay regenerist these days. But this is a good product, just expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good moisturizing cream that was not oily.  My complexion never felt or looked this good.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My wife like it a lot.</li>
    <li> Good for nighttime use. Not heavy, but apply sparingly if you want to wear it under makeup. Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a review from someone else. But it is very heavily perfumed and I don&#x27;t care for perfumed night creams. I like to smell fresh and clean. But other than that it is what it is no better or worse than others I have used.</li>
    <li> Feels great and smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It goes on well, not sticky and you don&#x27;t have that &#x27;heavy greasy&#x27; feeling.  In the morning my skin feels smooth, soft and silky.  Like it a lot.  Get this.</li>
    <li> It does NOT accomplish anything more than an inexpensive night cream from CVS could do for more than half the price</li>
    <li> as someone had said in their review before I made my purchase,It looked as if the product had been used before. maybe returned and sent out again. Well, the same thing here. The product looked as if it had been used. I like the cream, but I&#x27;m not sure if I will reorder. They need to read these reviews!!!!! and clean up their product.Could have had a 4-41/2 star.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t really notice any difference from other night time creams I have used.  I bought it when I saw it described on &amp;#34;The Doctors&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s an ok product but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t,t get the resultsI was hoping for.</li>
    <li> This face cream is great.  I would definitely re order it.  Makes you skin look and feel great.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> hav not had item long enough to see how el it works he scnt is plsant</li>
    <li> Not too thick and I actually like the scent! Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker or anything but feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I had dry, flakey skin, and the first night I used it, my skin was soft, and smooth again. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is how oily my skin is in the morning. Not sure if that&#x27;s the way it reacts to my skin, or what.</li>
    <li> It made my face soft and pliable but did no changes to it.  I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This brand is impossible to buy at any of our stores, so I ordered it to try.  It did not disappoint me and I certainly intend to purchase more of this cream and I&#x27;m also going to try the other creams.</li>
