### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So happy with the results!</li>
      <li>this is the perfect solution!  </li>
      <li>The fact that I can just add it to my own moisturizer or lotion is the best part... and that it is a gradual tan.</li>
      <li>I heard about this on The View and am happy with the product.</li>
      <li>It is of great quality ingredients.</li>
      <li>It is amazing!</li>
      <li>Good value for quantity.  </li>
      <li>Got this for a friend she loved it</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;perfect solution to summer fair skin.</li>
      <li>Works so well for fair skin.</li>
      <li>I originally saw this on the Dr. Oz show as one of the best self tanners on the market.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Gives a nice warm color for your face and neck.  </li>
      <li>But it does and leaves you face with a nice glow.</li>
      <li>It is nice that you use it with your own moisturizer but even when I did it still sort of had that \\&quot;bottle</li>
      <li>would make this product more effective.</li>
      <li>Do not use a mineral oil based lotion or it will just sit on top of your skin which beats the purpose of getting a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also...</li>
      <li>Blending it with lotion that I love is the</li>
      <li>Ok for color, but it clogs my pores.</li>
      <li>I am able to use some of my darker foundation makeup that I bought by accident so that is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>So make sure to wash your hands.</li>
      <li>make sure to wash your hands after using this product to make sure you don&#x27;t have stained palms or between your fingers.</li>
      <li>Best facial sunless tanner ever.</li>
      <li>It will stain your fingers so make sure to wash your hands after use.  </li>
      <li>And do not use more than recommended ( 3 drops to start) or your color will not look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I seem to need more than 3 drops, more like 6 to get any effect.&lt;br /&gt;Clarins used to make a self tanner, in light white cream that cam in a slim container for the face that was perfect</li>
      <li>Wonderful---so easy to apply and control the depth of color</li>
      <li>Nice subtle color looks great for this time of year!</li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s important to exfoliate before applying which</li>
      <li>Clarins self tanner has been my favorite for years and this is just as good as the original, plus I can simply add it to my lotion.  </li>
      <li>Use your own normal lotion (which is the best part about it) and add just one or two drops every few days--works like a champ.</li>
      <li>You add this to your own moisturizer - as much or as little as you want - so you get use your favorite moisturizer and still have a nice glow.  </li>
      <li>It really does give your face a nice golden glow.  </li>
      <li>so this gives me a nice even darker natural glow.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few days now and have noticed a great complexion to not only my face (in part because I am using my own moisturizer), but my body as well.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, gives gradual natural looking color.</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash your hands and nails/cuticles after using this, it has left marks on me.</li>
      <li>This works exactly as specified.</li>
      <li>I suppose this does what it says just pretty pricey</li>
      <li>This is so ingenious, since you just add a couple of drops to your daily moisturizer (or night cream) and voila!</li>
      <li>I had used Clarins self tanning products in the past and although they were good...</li>
      <li>I use 2 or 3 drops every day in my moisturizer and never look like I used self tanner, but somehow look a little more healthy and &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34; This does not break me out and I am prone to occasional T- zone breakouts.</li>
      <li>I bought this thinking I would use it for my whole body</li>
      <li>I really like this product and plan to continue ordering</li>
      <li>strongly recommend this product and will be a long time customer to come.</li>
      <li>I like having a light tan on my face, but none of the face Self Tanners that I&#x27;ve used have a high enough SPF.</li>
      <li>The key to get optimum results is to use a minimal amount(1-3 drops), blend into skin completely and wash your hands immediately afterwards!</li>
      <li>still trying it, only 3 times so far and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change</li>
      <li>and it will not go far if using on your whole body.</li>
      <li>So, when I heard about this new product I was intrigued.</li>
      <li>and it faded very naturally.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
      <li>it was a very natural look.</li>
      <li>Better than expected !!!!</li>
      <li>I already have color, I am not pale</li>
      <li>You add a few drops of a light oil solution, blend with your moisturizer, and apply.  </li>
      <li>You get a natural looking glow.</li>
      <li>No mess or smell.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This got me darker much quicker than most self tanners I have used in the past, though I must admit, I haven&#x27;t used self tanners in quite a few years as I remember the orange.</li>
      <li>Just gives you enough color to enhance your natural skin color.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this mixed with moisturizer and it works well. I used it daily until my face had color and then cut back so that the color didn&#x27;t get too dark.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and plan to continue ordering</li>
    <li> I had used Clarins self tanning products in the past and although they were good...they took a long time to dry on my skin and the scent was always like something from a tanning salon.  So, when I heard about this new product I was intrigued. It is amazing! The fact that I can just add it to my own moisturizer or lotion is the best part... and that it is a gradual tan. I have been using it for a few days now and have noticed a great complexion to not only my face (in part because I am using my own moisturizer), but my body as well.  I do recommend using a moisturizer that blends into the skin without leaving it oily. On my face I found that using apricot kernal oil (I use the NOW essential oils and bought mine on amazon for around $10) because it truly moisturizes the skin without leaving it oily. And it blends into my face immediately. On my body I use a coco butter lotion as that seems to blend it the quickest. Do not use a mineral oil based lotion or it will just sit on top of your skin which beats the purpose of getting a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... make sure to wash your hands after using this product to make sure you don&#x27;t have stained palms or between your fingers. And do not use more than recommended ( 3 drops to start) or your color will not look natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product and will be a long time customer to come.</li>
    <li> Just gives you enough color to enhance your natural skin color.  I heard about this on The View and am happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I can see a SLIGHT tanning.  It will stain your fingers so make sure to wash your hands after use.  I do think it&#x27;s important to exfoliate before applying which would make this product more effective.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, gives gradual natural looking color. I use it both morning under my moisterizer and evening under my night cream</li>
    <li> You add this to your own moisturizer - as much or as little as you want - so you get use your favorite moisturizer and still have a nice glow.  Most self-tanners have an unpleasant odor or are too greasy for me... this is the perfect solution!  You add a few drops of a light oil solution, blend with your moisturizer, and apply.  Gives a nice warm color for your face and neck.  NOTE - the extra drops do thin out your cream a little so it will take a few seconds for you face to absorb.  But it does and leaves you face with a nice glow.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would use it for my whole body but it&#x27;s such a small bottle that I only ended up using it on my face.  And now that I am, it is lasting a long time.  It really does give your face a nice golden glow.  I already have color, I am not pale so this gives me a nice even darker natural glow. It is nice that you use it with your own moisturizer but even when I did it still sort of had that \\&quot;bottle tan\\&quot; scent but just not as bad. I would recommend for anyone using either just on their face or for a short period of time on the body. I feel it is a little pricey for such a small amount and it will not go far if using on your whole body.</li>
    <li> I suppose this does what it says just pretty pricey and you have to continue to use it to keep the glow...</li>
    <li> Arizona heat melted product</li>
    <li> This works exactly as specified. I originally saw this on the Dr. Oz show as one of the best self tanners on the market. So I decided to try it. It was the same price on Amazon as everywhere else. The bottle is small but you only need to put two drops in enough lotion for your entire face and neck every few days. I did another two drops for 1/2 my body and another two for my other 1/2. So a total of 6 drops about 2-3 times a week or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This got me darker much quicker than most self tanners I have used in the past, though I must admit, I haven&#x27;t used self tanners in quite a few years as I remember the orange. I did not get any orange look at all. it was a very natural look. Though I admit one day I forgot to wash my hands after applying and I got some brown lines next to my finger nails like dirt. So make sure to wash your hands. Other than that, I saw no streaks or signs that it was fake at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a week or so and it faded very naturally. I see no downside to this at all. I am able to use some of my darker foundation makeup that I bought by accident so that is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> Wonderful---so easy to apply and control the depth of color</li>
    <li> Works so well for fair skin. Blending it with lotion that I love is the&lt;br /&gt;perfect solution to summer fair skin.</li>
    <li> Very Subtle.  Don&#x27;t know If I like it yet.  I seem to need more than 3 drops, more like 6 to get any effect.&lt;br /&gt;Clarins used to make a self tanner, in light white cream that cam in a slim container for the face that was perfect&lt;br /&gt;but now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I bought this.</li>
    <li> Ok for color, but it clogs my pores.</li>
    <li> Works well and subtle</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference at all!</li>
    <li> still trying it, only 3 times so far and haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change</li>
    <li> Got this for a friend she loved it</li>
    <li> expensive and does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been wanting this forever. I like having a light tan on my face, but none of the face Self Tanners that I&#x27;ve used have a high enough SPF. This is so ingenious, since you just add a couple of drops to your daily moisturizer (or night cream) and voila! You get a natural looking glow. Clarins, please don&#x27;t ever discontinue!</li>
    <li> Clarins self tanner has been my favorite for years and this is just as good as the original, plus I can simply add it to my lotion.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Better than expected !!!! Love this stuff. Now I understand what a the hype is about this ! So happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Simple to use.  No mess or smell. Good value for quantity.  Nice subtle color looks great for this time of year!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use 2 or 3 drops every day in my moisturizer and never look like I used self tanner, but somehow look a little more healthy and &amp;#34;alive.&amp;#34; This does not break me out and I am prone to occasional T- zone breakouts. Make sure to wash your hands and nails/cuticles after using this, it has left marks on me. But simply washing my hands after I use it solved that problem. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Best facial sunless tanner ever. Use your own normal lotion (which is the best part about it) and add just one or two drops every few days--works like a champ. My skin is very sensitive so I do not like trying products on my face as it usually makes me break-out; this is a dream facial tanner.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does. It is of great quality ingredients. It works well with any face moisturizer. The key to get optimum results is to use a minimal amount(1-3 drops), blend into skin completely and wash your hands immediately afterwards!</li>
