      <li>Their  very best one was a peel you could do at home.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this one.</li>
      <li>This one was perfect for me.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Syn-Ake Face Lift Youth Serum for just a year, I can&#x27;t amagine the wonderful result I will have after another year of use.</li>
      <li>I have found Syn-Ake Face Life Youth Serum to be the best, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
      <li>but the results all day are remarkable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have been told how good my skin looks.</li>
      <li>This is really good stuff........</li>
      <li>Tried this and even more wrinkles are gone.  </li>
      <li>Oil of olay is better</li>
      <li>I did notice more moisture</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve spent HUGE amounts of money on creams and serums, but find this to be the best product for the money.  </li>
      <li>It slides easily</li>
      <li>This is important.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, it actually worked and the price was good.</li>
      <li>i cant more than perfect for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
      <li>Syn-Ake makes an instant improvement, on even a good complexion.  </li>
      <li>My skin is smooth, and a special improvement below my eyebrow which were starting to get wrinkly.  </li>
      <li>I have used many different products on my face, but they would irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I really see a difference!  </li>
      <li>and I was very hot all over my body and developed a headache.</li>
      <li>Upgraded from 3 to 4 stars with the recommendation to be very patient with this product.  </li>
      <li>another brand, that doesn&#x27;t require so much effort to use.</li>
      <li>Reasonable price, visible reults:</li>
      <li>and I would say my wrinkles and sagging are a little MORE pronounced.</li>
      <li>Also, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much of anything, my skin doesn&#x27;t even feel really moisturized after using it twice a day for several days.  </li>
      <li>I am not sure if it is the magic I want, but I m still using.</li>
      <li>Usually they come up with outstanding product.</li>
      <li>product seems ok, but the bottle it comes in is ridiculously hard to pump and use and it takes forever to get the product to come out.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend this product for people who have sensitive skin like me.</li>
      <li>Unlike some viewers said,I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it moisturize.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old and am constantly being told I don&#x27;t look my age.</li>
      <li>but it did not make a marked difference in my skin overall.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, the container is the most frustratingly inefficient&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face swelling and redness was still apparent the next morning.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old, and can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find it.</li>
      <li>The downside is still the bottle that didn&#x27;t work right, but a tiny dab goes a long way and this little tube is lasting a lot longer than I anticipated.  </li>

<li> I will not likely purchase this again due to the frustration of use and thus far lackluster performance.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s engineered so that only the first few drops can be drawn out, by the press-down&lt;br /&gt;top, which is too short to reach to the bottom of the small inside container.  </li>
<li> long as I need it.</li>
<li> it actually burnt my skin, I did stick with it and noticed a slight improvement.</li>
<li> With further use - a couple of months now, I think this may be working on the little crows feet.  </li>
<li> within 5 minutes of application it started tingling which I expected.</li>
<li> A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
<li> I spent the money</li>
<li> large&lt;br /&gt;quantities of the cream, so that several days of quantity is wasted.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;y like is that the pump mechanism is not consistent in delivering product to one&#x27;s fingertips.</li>
<li> I do use this with other serums (vitamin C and hyaluronic acid)</li>
<li> Upon reading other reviews now</li>
<li> I see I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this frustrating problem.  </li>
<li> but I think it is helping give that usual regimen a boost.  </li>
<li> No more!</li>
<li> i used a lot of brands for facial cream , very expensive, but since i use it</li>
<li> Then it seriously itched and my face swelled up</li>
<li> Not good for sensative skins.</li>
<li> The product is worthless, do not waste your money.</li>
<li> Im sorry</li>
<li> Useless product.</li>
<li> This one fails.</li>
<li> I washed it off with cold water and took benadryl.</li>
<li> I had been using it for 2 years, now I can&#x27;t find it in the stores! :(</li>
<li> Too bad, it works!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is really good stuff........I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it actually worked and the price was good. I had been using it for 2 years, now I can&#x27;t find it in the stores! :( WTH! Too bad, it works! get it while you can. Walgreens, Walmart and CVS no longer carry it. I&#x27;m 50 and have been told how good my skin looks. Dang!</li>
    <li> i used a lot of brands for facial cream , very expensive, but since i use it i cant more than perfect for my sensitive dry skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use Analon C-Serum for a couple years, but an Amazon review reported it had changed it&#x27;s formula.  Tried this and even more wrinkles are gone.  My skin is smooth, and a special improvement below my eyebrow which were starting to get wrinkly.  No more!</li>
    <li> I really see a difference!  I have some very deep wrinkles, and this product definitely minimizes them.  I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> I have found Syn-Ake Face Life Youth Serum to be the best, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I&#x27;m 67 years old and am constantly being told I don&#x27;t look my age.I have been using Syn-Ake Face Lift Youth Serum for just a year, I can&#x27;t amagine the wonderful result I will have after another year of use.</li>
    <li> I have used many different products on my face, but they would irritate my skin. This one was perfect for me.  I am very happy with this one. I would recommend this product for people who have sensitive skin like me. A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Syn-Ake makes an instant improvement, on even a good complexion.  It slides easily&lt;br /&gt;over the skin, and absorbs at once.  I like it and desire to use it for&lt;br /&gt;as long as I need it. HOWEVER, the container is the most frustratingly inefficient&lt;br /&gt;device I&#x27;ve run into.  The glass tub is about 3 times the size of what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s engineered so that only the first few drops can be drawn out, by the press-down&lt;br /&gt;top, which is too short to reach to the bottom of the small inside container.  After that,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a struggle to obtain the cream.  Also, the underside of the rim retains large&lt;br /&gt;quantities of the cream, so that several days of quantity is wasted.  I&#x27;m searching&lt;br /&gt;for another brand, that doesn&#x27;t require so much effort to use.</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning. I am not sure if it is the magic I want, but I m still using.</li>
    <li> *update* With further use - a couple of months now, I think this may be working on the little crows feet.  I do use this with other serums (vitamin C and hyaluronic acid) but I think it is helping give that usual regimen a boost.  Upgraded from 3 to 4 stars with the recommendation to be very patient with this product.  The downside is still the bottle that didn&#x27;t work right, but a tiny dab goes a long way and this little tube is lasting a lot longer than I anticipated.  I will likely purchase it again. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product seems ok, but the bottle it comes in is ridiculously hard to pump and use and it takes forever to get the product to come out.  Upon reading other reviews now I see I&#x27;m not the only one who has had this frustrating problem.  Also, this product doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing much of anything, my skin doesn&#x27;t even feel really moisturized after using it twice a day for several days.  I will not likely purchase this again due to the frustration of use and thus far lackluster performance.  Should anything change, I will update my review.</li>
    <li> This product works great!  I am told all the time that I look so much younger.  And then they ask what I use.  I finally admit to using something, and recommend this to everyone that asks!</li>
    <li> I feel foolish for falling for yet another claim. This product simply doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money ladies.  Oil of olay is better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent HUGE amounts of money on creams and serums, but find this to be the best product for the money.  I&#x27;m 63 years old, and can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find it.</li>
    <li> within 5 minutes of application it started tingling which I expected. Then it seriously itched and my face swelled up and I was very hot all over my body and developed a headache. I washed it off with cold water and took benadryl. My face swelling and redness was still apparent the next morning. Im sorry I spent the money and I don&#x27;t know if I can return an unopened bottle as I had purchased 2.</li>
    <li> I did notice more moisture but it did not make a marked difference in my skin overall.  I have just the beginning of wrinkles and it did not effect them at all.</li>
    <li> it actually burnt my skin, I did stick with it and noticed a slight improvement. Not good for sensative skins.</li>
    <li> I have purchased items by this company for years. Usually they come up with outstanding product. This one fails. They currently do not have any products on the market. Their  very best one was a peel you could do at home. After that the company sort of lost its edge.</li>
    <li> The product is worthless, do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> When will I learn to age gracefully and accept the sagging and wrinkles. Once again I have thrown away money on a product that does nothing. Unlike some viewers said,I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;nasty&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, nor does it moisturize. I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 days and I would say my wrinkles and sagging are a little MORE pronounced. Useless product.</li>
    <li> It does what it says.  This is important.  It works.  Nothing is permanent not even this but the results all day are remarkable.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, visible reults: only thng I don&#x27;y like is that the pump mechanism is not consistent in delivering product to one&#x27;s fingertips.</li>
