      <li>so it&#x27;s ok,</li>

      <li>But otherwise ok.</li>

      <li>Great colors and high quality</li>
      <li>They have heart shapes at the top rather than a smooth rounded top.</li>
      <li>These were perfect to put in the bag along with nail polish and other pedicure items.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t go between the toes as easily with the hearts.</li>
      <li>but it is easy to accidentally stretch them out.</li>
      <li>They rip easily...</li>
      <li>They do smash easily</li>
      <li>they tear easily.</li>
      <li>These are fine for toe separating.</li>
      <li>They will serve their purpose fine, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>The seller&#x27;s description is accurate.</li>
      <li>Really cheap flimsy and took almost 4 weeks to get.</li>
      <li>I hope they gonna be comfortable to wear and hold in shape when using.</li>
      <li>And they are SO cheap.</li>
      <li>They seemed cheap.</li>
      <li>I put one in my toes and even trying to stretch them to fit my toes made them immediately tear.</li>
      <li>So cheap they fall apart.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not even sure that they are good enough for one polish.</li>
      <li>Cheap quality, nothing special, but they work</li>
      <li>They were party budget friendly.  </li>
      <li>Thought there were be many colors and they were all the same color, They are also kind of flemsi.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m not so happy with the fact that the product is not very sturdy</li>
      <li>But not a bad deal for the price.</li>
      <li>They made quick exit to trash.</li>
      <li>For me they work perfectly, came in a different colors, pink, yellow, blue and purple, and they fit awesomely!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say how the product really is, but seems cheap.</li>
      <li>Love that I can get a lot of these for such a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Just right.  </li>
      <li>Inexpensive and just right for my daughters spa part.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re really comfortable, and have alotnof flexibility so it makes doing the pedicure so much easier, they really work like a charm!</li>
      <li>, this is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty flimsy, but what do you expect when you&#x27;re paying 30 cents?</li>
      <li>a bit flimsy......will probably be able to use only once or twice</li>
      <li>I was waiting for more than a week and finally received it today!</li>
      <li>They come in many colors and individual packages.</li>
      <li>Probably would try to find better quality ones the next time I order.</li>
      <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.</li>
      <li>I have purchased toe separators from many different places, and these are the thinnest and cheapest ones I have gotten.</li>
      <li>These are pretty much disposable</li>
      <li>Have to be very careful though because they tear super duper easily.  </li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I will not complain to to much</li>
      <li>And very flimsy and don&#x27;t stay where you want then to</li>
      <li>These shipped fast.  </li>
      <li>Fast service.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t care to much for the colors</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive toe separators for pedicures, I highly recommend these!</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.</li>
      <li>However, they are crammed into such a tiny manilla envelope that most of them are out of shape.  </li>
      <li>They are extremely lightweight and easily bendable.  </li>
      <li>These are meant for one time use, and aren&#x27;t really made for everyone&#x27;s feet - mostly too small.  </li>
      <li>These looked very soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to say a lot more about this product, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t think of much other than these do the job like they&#x27;re designed for, are incredibly cheap, and are basically the same as the ones the salon gives you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, they really don&#x27;t work for that, a bit too big.</li>
      <li>I found them to be soft enough for between the toes.  </li>
      <li>These keep your toes separated, but they&#x27;re pretty stiff.</li>
      <li>It really doesn&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re having a party with 12 sets of little toes.  </li>
      <li>Very soft , compared to some other brands I recently tried!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not very sturdy!  I love the colors but I&#x27;m not so happy with the fact that the product is not very sturdy, you can only use them once, they are too weak.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to say a lot more about this product, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t think of much other than these do the job like they&#x27;re designed for, are incredibly cheap, and are basically the same as the ones the salon gives you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for inexpensive toe separators for pedicures, I highly recommend these!</li>
    <li> great product for girls party</li>
    <li> Very flimsy. Used once and lost their shape already</li>
    <li> I found them to be soft enough for between the toes.  What I was looking for was individaul toe separators but I guess they are not made anymore.  I took these and cut them into individuals.  They work great.</li>
    <li> Did not receive what was pictured, I knew colors could vary but it was a completely different style as opposed to what pictured!</li>
    <li> They look nothing like on the picture, I got pink with hart shapes, and I choose those because I wanted different colors and round shape. I am very specific what I like and what I don&#x27;t. They are also very cheap, but they do their job well, and for that price, hey! I will not complain to to much</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have 6 toes, so I&#x27;m not sure why these separators are set up for that. In the picture, they looked thick enough, but when they arrived, they were so thin, and so soft, that they didn&#x27;t do a thing to separate my toes. they literally don&#x27;t work to keep the paint from getting smeared. Maybe they would work for a salon, where the customers are sitting still until the polish gets a skin on it, but when I paint my toes at home, I sometimes have to get up and deal with this or that. I need toe separators that will help me do that and NOT waste the time I just spent on my nails.</li>
    <li> Assorted color toe separators is a great product didn&#x27;t care to much for the colors but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.I would buy again overall they are good..</li>
    <li> The seller&#x27;s description is accurate. It&#x27;s 12 single toe separators, NOT 12 pairs, as the 1st customer review states. These get the job done.  They&#x27;re pretty flimsy, but what do you expect when you&#x27;re paying 30 cents?</li>
    <li> This should say 6 sets, not 12.  It really doesn&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re having a party with 12 sets of little toes.  (urgh)</li>
    <li> They arrived, although I was slightly disappointed when I opened the package. I did not receive the colors shown, and got multiples of the same color. I know it says assorted,  but I guess I expected the ones pictured. I have purchased toe separators from many different places, and these are the thinnest and cheapest ones I have gotten. They will serve their purpose fine, but you get what you pay for. Probably would try to find better quality ones the next time I order.</li>
    <li> all of the ones sent to me where pink. they tear easily. expect to dispose of them after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> Really cheap flimsy and took almost 4 weeks to get. They are from China I guess and I would not recommend. Definitely not OPI or any other brand name quality.</li>
    <li> a bit flimsy......will probably be able to use only once or twice</li>
    <li> They seemed cheap. They only came in two colors, unlike the picture that shows four...I got purple and yellow. Every two are stuck together, they aren&#x27;t hard to break apart but it is easy to accidentally stretch them out. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
    <li> These are meant for one time use, and aren&#x27;t really made for everyone&#x27;s feet - mostly too small.  But not a bad deal for the price.</li>
    <li> These looked very soft. They did come on time . They have different colors pink, orange, purple, lime green pastel. Mostly a lot of orange and purple. They re a heart shaped between the toes. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet. I hope they gonna be comfortable to wear and hold in shape when using.They each in an individually pack of two in the final shipping container .$2 I believe is too expensive though.</li>
    <li> The spaces are way too big.  It was very hard to get them between toes and  and keep them there.</li>
    <li> When the item I purchased said 12 count I imagined that meant twelve separators.  Well, I needed 11 pairs, so I placed two orders.  Turns out it means 12 PAIRS of separators.  Hope that helps someone else!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these except they keep my toes separated when I polish them since I bought these.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how these could get a bad review... toe separators are pretty basic and hard to mess up. Haha. Love the colors!</li>
    <li> I received mine and all of them are cut with heart shaped spacers. I didn&#x27;t like that (although some people might think it&#x27;s cute), so I cut the heads of the hearts off. It didn&#x27;t go between the toes as easily with the hearts. I had to turn each one sideways and pull it between my toes ad then turn them back again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have no idea how they can send these all the way from China and it only cost me 99 cents and no shipping.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was making little mistletoe bags for Christmas gifts. These were perfect to put in the bag along with nail polish and other pedicure items. You can&#x27;t beat the price-perfect!</li>
    <li> Very, complicated....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to receive at all, however the packaging was terrible and most of the separators are squished and bent out of shape.. I&#x27;m sure they will get the job done though...</li>
    <li> Well, they aren&#x27;t colored at all.  They are all pink with heart tops on them.  You actually get 12 pair, not just 12 separators.  However, they are crammed into such a tiny manilla envelope that most of them are out of shape.  They still work just deformed.  They are extremely lightweight and easily bendable.  Have to be very careful though because they tear super duper easily.  I have thin toes and small feet (I wear size 6-7 depending on the shoe) and I did have a hard time getting them between the last couple of toes.  They do smash easily it&#x27;s just getting them smashed in there without ripping them is the problem.  It&#x27;s still a great deal for the money, just don&#x27;t expect to pay your $2 and get a high end product. They still work for what I need so it&#x27;s ok, just want to let you know what you&#x27;re getting with this.</li>
    <li> It took about 2 months for me to receive these. When they arrived, they all came in a single color: pink on both sides. The quality was just ok. I think they are flimsy.</li>
    <li> Keeps toes apart, but on the hard side</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say how the product really is, but seems cheap. They came in an envelope about 3&amp;#34;x6&amp;#34; and were just wadded up. A few are probably still usable, but since they were for a party, I cannot give them to people---off to the dollar store I go for a replacement :(</li>
    <li> not what I expected.  they are so THIN.  I should&#x27;ve known better for the price and quantity.  VERY poor quality.  These are pretty much disposable but I&#x27;m not even sure that they are good enough for one polish.</li>
    <li> THere are SO many! And they are SO cheap. They rip easily...but then you have 50 more as backups.</li>
    <li> they are just like the ones at the spa.  They do what they do with great colors.  My grandaughters loved them.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because i have fat feet but they are VERY SMALL! And very flimsy and don&#x27;t stay where you want then to and it hurts your toes i had a better time using them on my fingers</li>
    <li> I got these ahead of schedule! For me they work perfectly, came in a different colors, pink, yellow, blue and purple, and they fit awesomely! Very soft , compared to some other brands I recently tried! They&#x27;re really comfortable, and have alotnof flexibility so it makes doing the pedicure so much easier, they really work like a charm! Great colors and high quality, I&#x27;m going to look at the kid size toe separators available now! I just realized they came all the way from China after looking again at my package! Happy with this item. Five star product.</li>
    <li> Received these today and they are not worth the money! They came James in a small envelope in no type of bag or plastic at all, just simply named into a small 4x6 envelope. Three were so damaged and/or torn that I threw them away. They are so thin and cheap. I put one in my toes and even trying to stretch them to fit my toes made them immediately tear. Also the description says a variety of colors, which is why I ordered them, and they only sent pink. I will never order from here again!</li>
    <li> Thick, not soft..in short, useless. I still don&#x27;t understand how anyhing can be shipped for under a dollar. They made quick exit to trash.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item awhile ago and jut received it today and they are all pink! Not assorted colors as promised in the description. It&#x27;s bad enough I had to wait so long that I actually forgot I ordered them...they could have least been exactly what I ordered. Shipping way to long to send back and get what I paid for .. what a joke! and they&#x27;re all shoved inside of the mailing envelope! No packaging whatsoever..Like they have a big bin of them and whenever they get an order, they count them out, shove them in the envelope and send them out(after about 3 weeks)</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t look like the picture. But they work just as well. Love this product</li>
    <li> good product, but it took forever to ship...</li>
    <li> I expected these to be a lower quality item for the price but I didn&#x27;t expect them to be all mangled up in the envelope when they arrived.  It only has 12 single pieces &#x3D; 6 pairs not 12 pairs.  The actual items received are different from the picture shown. They have heart shapes at the top rather than a smooth rounded top. Some people might prefer that but I prefer the basic ones. Will not order again.</li>
    <li> The product itself was average, but I guess you get what you paid for. It shows multiple colors in the image; I received one all purple except for one yellow which was scuffed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrived after I needed them as well because it would not show a shipping date before I purchased them. I ordered at least two weeks before Christmas and didn&#x27;t receive until after and therefore they didn&#x27;t get used in my &amp;#34;mistle-TOES&amp;#34; gift sets.</li>
    <li> chinese product made for those of you with six toes</li>
    <li> These are fine for toe separating. I bought them to keep sewing bobbins neat, they really don&#x27;t work for that, a bit too big.</li>
    <li> So cheap they fall apart. Plus it came in a color not even shown her. Not happy.</li>
    <li> Fast service. I&#x27;ve been looking for these for awhile now, this is exactly what I wanted. They work very well.</li>
    <li> they are pretty good quality, good price, comes in a package of 12 and they are just perfect for spa party</li>
    <li> Whether you go through them a lot or plan to use them during a spa party, they are perfect because they can be tossed out or used again by the same person.</li>
    <li> These keep your toes separated, but they&#x27;re pretty stiff. If you expect to walk out of the salon with these still on (as I like to do to ensure my nails really dry fully), expect some very uncomfortable walking in your future!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! These work to separate toes but if you walk on them at all they get squished and are useless.</li>
    <li> So upset! I wanted what was advertised because those work best for my toes. I received these heart looking ones.</li>
    <li> aww They Work Great ! and my girls adore them! the product showed up on time and i have No complaints !</li>
    <li> Used this on my daughter&#x27;s SPA PARTY and put some in the giveaway goody bags. Girls loved it! I still have left over and my daughter and I are using them when we&#x27;re doing our own pedicure!</li>
    <li> I was waiting for more than a week and finally received it today! The quality is not as good as the one I had but I hope it will work.</li>
    <li> These shipped fast.  Inexpensive and just right for my daughters spa part.  They were party budget friendly.  Just right.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great value.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> Poor quality, but inexpensive. Took forever to ship.</li>
    <li> Thought there were be many colors and they were all the same color, They are also kind of flemsi.</li>
    <li> There were no assorted colors - everything was 1 color, and many of the separators were severely bent from shipping.</li>
    <li> Ordered last minute for my girls bday party. Got them in time for the party. Made great party favors for the kids.</li>
    <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect. Works for fingers and toes.</li>
    <li> bought them as a part of a gift bag of pedicure tools for my sisters at our annual spa weekend. inexpensive and reusable</li>
    <li> Love that I can get a lot of these for such a cheap price. They come in many colors and individual packages. Definitely recommend these toe seperators.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality, nothing special, but they work</li>
    <li> The package was torn open when I received it.  Some of the toe separators were bent up and apart. But otherwise ok.</li>
