      <li>I love the product</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s magic on my hair as well as my husbands.  </li>
      <li>Many years ago my mother had gotten Hask from a barber shop for my father.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ~$5 in most B&amp;M stores.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Hask Tonic isn&#x27;t more readily available and mentioned more in forums/message boards.</li>
      <li>Did you ever see an 80 year old man dance with joy?</li>

      <li>It keeps Dandruff undercontrol and makes hair easy to manage.</li>
      <li>It continues to be a fine product.  </li>

      <li>No where was this stuff available</li>
      <li>Thank you Amazon for having it available.</li>
      <li>so I tried good old tried and true Amazon</li>
      <li>The formula has not varied from the original and again it did</li>
      <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by the lack of offensive smell, and amazing effectiveness.</li>
      <li>He has tried everything on the market and finally resorted to rx shampoo usage 2-3 times a week with good results but always there was flaking and itching.</li>
      <li>Make sure to use this product generously, as it says in the directions, and massage your scalp very well.</li>
      <li>This REALLY works!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t understand why since I used it for years and with no ill effect.</li>
      <li>I found the product to be effective for its stated purpose, but discontinued use due to the overpowering odor.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Thanks, D.Storm</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, tried product and has a soothing feel to the scalp.</li>
      <li>Thanks for helping me out, Amazon.</li>
      <li>I tried many other brands.</li>
      <li>Some old products deserve to have a long lifespan, this one surely does.</li>
      <li>I have been using Hask for many years now and it is getting hard to find in stores.</li>
      <li>Been using this for years and have not found anything better, but it is hard to find.</li>
      <li>Reminds me of an old fashion barbershop.</li>
      <li>Expensive, but good.</li>
      <li>The only reason this is not a five star is because the packaging was too loose and one of the liquid filled bottles bumped around enough for the cap to loosen and leak.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t long and the whole family was using it.  </li>
      <li>When my barber used Hask on me for the first time I never tried any other.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE OF MY BUSY LIFE STYLE, I CANT TAKE THE HASSLE OF SHIPPING IT BACK, AND BESIDES</li>

    <li> My husband has fought dandruff for years. He has tried everything on the market and finally resorted to rx shampoo usage 2-3 times a week with good results but always there was flaking and itching. His barbar suggested this product, Hask Hair Tonic. I was VERY skeptical! After less than one week, I am a believer...Since it works so incredibly well, I am buying the product for my mom who is 85 and my brother who is 60.   I have never written such a glowing report about any product in my life....this is one testimony that is truly genuine!   Carol H of Fort Lauderdale Fl</li>
    <li> I get terrible dandruff. This product works really good. I only use it at night because even though its not oily or greesy, it leaves my hair pretty weird. So I just use it at night. Has helped my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> This tonic is absolutely AMAZING! Not only does it successfully get rid dandruff, but it also does a nice job of getting rid of the itchiness that was a huge problem for me before purchasing this product. Make sure to use this product generously, as it says in the directions, and massage your scalp very well. I am so amazed at how amazingly well this product works. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This REALLY works! Nothing else ever did...at all...This is an amazing product at an amazing value...</li>
    <li> I love the product but I am unable to find it anymore</li>
    <li> THE PACKAGING WAS POOR. THERE WAS NOTHING TO CUSHION THE PRODUCT, I RECIEVED IT LEAKING INTO THE BOX, JUST A BOTTLE OF LIQUID HAIR TREATMENT IN A BOX, NO BUBBLE RAP, NOTHING. I DONT EVEN KNOW IF THE PRODUCT IS AUTHENTIC. BECAUSE OF MY BUSY LIFE STYLE, I CANT TAKE THE HASSLE OF SHIPPING IT BACK, AND BESIDES IT&#x27;S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE</li>
    <li> The product is one I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It continues to be a fine product.  I ordered this in August and my credit card was charged.  I was told that it would be backordered.  It was backordered twice and from the time my card was charged until I received the product was two months.  Too long.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, tried product and has a soothing feel to the scalp. Thanks, D.Storm</li>
    <li> I have used this product for thirty years and it is hard to find locally. It is very refreshing for your scalp.</li>
    <li> With Spring here, it is nice to see the end of snow on my shoulders. I was a bit concerned that there might be some lingering scent from a product left in my hair. I have been pleasantly surprised by the lack of offensive smell, and amazing effectiveness. As for shirts, black is back.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hask for many years now and it is getting hard to find in stores. Thank you Amazon for having it available.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0001X0TXO HASK HAIR &amp; SCALP TREATMENT DANDRUFF CONTROL 16oz.]]Hask is a great product, we  have been using it for years. It keeps Dandruff undercontrol and makes hair easy to manage. We used to purchase Hask at our local beauty supply and they stopped handeling the product, so we turned the Amazon and started purchasing it through them.  Even though you pay postage, it has been more economical to purchase through Amazon. Great product and service.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and have not found anything better, but it is hard to find. Expensive, but good.</li>
    <li> Many years ago my mother had gotten Hask from a barber shop for my father.  He had dry itchy scalp and dull hair.  Within a couple of weeks his hair was shiny and manageable and his scalp no longer was dry and flaky.  It wasn&#x27;t long and the whole family was using it.  Our hair regained it&#x27;s vibrancy it lost from chloranated pools and we never had scalp problems.  When my husband started complaining of the same thing I had looked everywhere in the city and none of the places carried this simple to use and moderately priced hair care product.  I sent for it on Amazon and received my shipment promptly.  The formula has not varied from the original and again it did it&#x27;s magic on my hair as well as my husbands.  He is flake free and both of us have renewed luster and vibrancy to our dyed hair. Some old products deserve to have a long lifespan, this one surely does.</li>
    <li> I have terrible dandruff. I have seen two dermatologists for prescription medications  which did not work. I have tried almost every over the counter treatment and none of them worked. This product was my last attempt, and I used it as directed for two weeks. And again, it did NOTHING to control my dandfuff. I wish I could write a glowing report, but this product was a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The only reason this is not a five star is because the packaging was too loose and one of the liquid filled bottles bumped around enough for the cap to loosen and leak.  Everything else was A-Okay!</li>
    <li> My father was visiting for the month of July and forgot his Hask Hair Treatment.  He went all the barbershops in the area and could not find the product anywhere.  The only place we could purchase it was online.  He has been using this Hask for as long as I can remember and he is 84.  I&#x27;m just happy that I was able to find it for him.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and love it.  None of the stores in our area carry it and I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  This is my second order for it and I definitely will continue to use it.  Thanks for helping me out, Amazon.</li>
    <li> Prior to using Hask I tried many other brands. When my barber used Hask on me for the first time I never tried any other.</li>
    <li> wish this was still available.  awesome product</li>
    <li> Sad to see this taken off the market. I don&#x27;t understand why since I used it for years and with no ill effect. MISS THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Hask Tonic isn&#x27;t more readily available and mentioned more in forums/message boards. I&#x27;ve tried all the home remedies out there in addition to over the counter products. Given the price of this it&#x27;s God send. Maybe we DON&#x27;T want it to get more popular....might drive the price up :) If anyone finds any alternatives that I can find in Canada, please let me know! I&#x27;m having to bring this from Sally&#x27;s in the US. Also, why does it cost so much more on Amazon? It&#x27;s ~$5 in most B&amp;M stores.</li>
    <li> I found the product to be effective for its stated purpose, but discontinued use due to the overpowering odor. Reminds me of an old fashion barbershop.</li>
    <li> No where was this stuff available so I tried good old tried and true Amazon and there it was.  Did you ever see an 80 year old man dance with joy?</li>
