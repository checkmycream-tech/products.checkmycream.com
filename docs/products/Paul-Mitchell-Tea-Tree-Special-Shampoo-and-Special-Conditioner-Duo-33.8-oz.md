<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It may be just me, the shampoo leave my hair dry and I noticed more hair falling out during the shampoo.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner is to of the line! It makes your hair so soft smooth and shiny and my favorite is how it makes my scalp feel cool and refreshed from the mint</li>
    <li> Great combo! You can feel the tea tree oil company cooling affect in your hair. Product does not make me breakout as I tend to have acne on my back of the head from other product. This is fantastic! Will reduce acne breakouts after a few weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I have been using it for six months and my hair has never looked better. My hair and scalp are so much healthier. The scent of mint is wonderful and relaxing when applied. I would totally recommend Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the regular stuff I buy at the salon which I should have figured with the price. It did last me almost a year though so 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery!! A low price!! A satisfactory quality!!</li>
    <li> I buy tea tree shampoo in super cut salon and the conditioner too good I like it my hair to long.😃</li>
    <li> The set is always great to use-have ordered before-you need to try -to experience the Paul Mitchell effect</li>
    <li> Smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;I liked it a lot, but it may make your hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;Comepare to lavender mint, this one has stronger minty smell and also minty feeling.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smells amazing.</li>
    <li> Great product ,for my wife and me. Big change on my hair .....Great smell silky soft.I worth the value. I will buy again.....</li>
    <li> I really love the the tingly sensation from using this product. It has the scalp messaging effect and relieves the stress.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo, everytime i use it i feel cool and refreshed. even with shipping, buying on amazon saved me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Very happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> Just as described. Be careful where you buy it not all are equal. I have ordered this a couple times before with bad results. This time i looked for one that is fulfilled by Amazon and it worked out well. It is just like the ones I would get at the solon.</li>
    <li> The only kind my husband will use. Save your smaller bottles for refill for the shower.</li>
    <li> Not happy with my purchase. Should have read the reviews before getting excited about the price, which caused me to make an impulsive purchase. My fault. If I could return this product, I would in an instant. I will not be purchasing this product from this seller ever again. Disappointed.. Now I have to purchase else where and spend more money than anticipated :(</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but when my order was shipped BOTH pumps were broken.</li>
    <li> Works great and what a deal! The shampoo is very drying to the hair but buying the conditioner with it makes the deal even better.   Be careful not to get the shampoo in your eyes. It burns worse than regular shampoo because of the tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Best Deal Online. Real as can be, but 1/2 price.Sorry to all the dealers don&#x27;t listen to their B.S. about any of the professional shampoo and conditioner not being real.. LOL, They are mad they missed out on the $50.00 profit they make from these..</li>
    <li> I was using the Organix Tea Tree shampoo for the longest time because I couldn&#x27;t find anything better. I am a guy with fairly short hair who basically wanted this stuff because it does not smell feminine and it wakes you up with the smell and the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; sensation. This is definitely worth the price, and due to me having about 1\\&quot; length hair on the top of my head I have a feeling these bottles will last about 2 years if my mother and sisters don&#x27;t come over and use it all lol.</li>
    <li> The products are amazing, the seller&#x27;s price was great and it was shipped in a reasonable time. I would definitely buy my products here again</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, which was nice.  I was expecting the worst from a few other reviews regarding the smell, but it is nowhere near as strong as actual Tea Tree oil.  I can not pick out the lavender or mint smell.    I had read a lot of reviews about it tingling, and it didn&#x27;t.  My hair is no longer trying to reach out and electrocute people when it is dry out.  The conditioner works decently as a de-tangler.    Two month update:   Pros: It really does last a long time.  I have waist length hair and have only gone through 1/2 of the bottle.  It kept my hair from electrocuting folks during dry periods.  Stopped my scalp from itching.  Cons: None really, it works if you have dandruff.  Per a hairdresser I have dry scalp, not dandruff.  These products actually aggravate that condition.  Oops!  I gave my bottles to a friend that had \\&quot;real\\&quot; dandruff and he is very happy and now dandruff free.  I use the Malibu well water shampoo for dry scalp and it has solved my issues.    Hopefully this will help someone who was as confused as I was.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  Great way to buy it!  So easy with Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great product, although could have bought at the local sports clips for a couple $$ more.  Not that great of a deal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really upset because it does not help with my dandruff. But I still like it. But not buying it again.</li>
    <li> The tea tree oil feels so good on your scalp. My husband and I really like this product.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite shampoo and conditioner. It helps my scalp stay healthy and flake-free, my hair is soft and healthy, and I love the way it smells.    LOVE IT.    My whole family (2 parents, 3 kids) use this, and a liter lasts us 5-6 months. You only need one pump.</li>
    <li> I love it! Makes my scalp feel cool and tingly...plus my hair feels super soft!</li>
    <li> I like this product but don&#x27;t buy it in the large 33.8L packaging. Two out of the three times I bought this Duo it came with the tops broken and half the product spilled inside the box. They need to ship it with simple screw-on tops and the pump tops taped to the side; an easy switched after delivery.</li>
    <li> I have a very dry scalp and I was excited to use this tea tree shampoo and conditioner for that purpose. I am often drawn to products by their attractive labeling, the pretty green bottles inspired me so it has that much going for itself. I have to say I&#x27;m awfully disappointed for the price I paid for this designer shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo smelled wonderful and left my scalp feeling cool and tingly but it also made my hair feel brassy and corse. I was hoping the conditioner would soften it up again and it does if I use three times as much conditioner and lather it up, however; once it washes out, it&#x27;s back to feeling brassy and dry. It&#x27;s hard to brush my hair because it leaves it so unruly and brittle where as other designer shampoo and conditioners do not. In the end, my hair is shiny and my scalp feels great so I will continue using it until it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to buy this product again. I have yet to see if this will solve my dry scalp and dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo!  I have been using for around 3 weeks and my head no longer itches.  I still have some scalp issues, but hope those will clear eventually.  I don&#x27;t know if it is worth the expense to get the conditioner, but I will definitely purchase the shampoo again.</li>
    <li> paul mitchell laverder mint shampoo and conditioner is great if you have psoriasis of the scalp, as long as you use it, it goes away..family tested!! mother approved!! [[ASIN:B001MEI4F6 Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Lavender Mint Moisturizing Shampoo &amp; Lavender Mint Moisturizing Conditioner (10. 14 oz) Give Peace Set]]</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioners i have ever used. I normally have numerous different brands and kinds of shamp/cond in my shower but I use just this and its GREAT on my hair. It makes your scalp feel great and has an awesome tingling minty scent. My boyfriend also uses it, it was actually his hair cutter that recommended it and i happen to use it once, it works great smell wise for men or women&#x3D; ) Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on me once, and I was sold.  I love the way it smells, feels on my scalp, and how great my hair looks. I also purchased it for my daughter...she loves it too!!!  GREAT STUFF!</li>
    <li> Good product, prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This product Helps with my husbands dry scalp the only thing that works we have tried so many different things but this really works. Disappointed we didn&#x27;t get the leave in conditioner that we got with the last time we ordered</li>
    <li> I am 45, my hair is thin and colored and my scalp is oily.  I was confused as to which would be the best shampoo to use on my hair under these circumstances.  While visiting my daughter who is currently in beauty school she did a lot of bottle reading before she recommended this product to me.  And OMG I can&#x27;t imagine ever going back to regular ole store bought shampoos!  At first I balked a bit at the price...cause I am cheap but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the tingly sensation, invigorating scent, full body locks and numerous compliments like \\&quot;who did your hair today?\\&quot; tee hee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About every other day or so I&#x27;ll put a smidgen of conditioner on the ends to make them easier to comb out.  More would just be too rich for my hair; so I know the bottle will likely last me like a year!  Using this shampoo has cleared up my problem with scalp acne, my color still looks fresh and my hair feels clean longer.  This is a keeper for sure...thanks Angelface!</li>
    <li> This product is very effective. It cleans your hair well and the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Takes only a small amount to do a nice job!</li>
    <li> Tea tree helps my hair stay healthy! I have been using this product for more than 3 years and won&#x27;t be replacing it anytime soon.</li>
    <li> Yes, a little too soon to judge something like a hair product but. I didn&#x27;t feel anything like a tingle but it feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> I first got these at a barbershop and really enjoyed them. My hair felt clean soft and flowing. LoL it keeps me fresh.</li>
    <li> For troubled, itchy, or normal scalp, these products are fantastic.  all my daughters and myself use these with great results!!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingle you feel from the tea-tree shampoo is second to none, and has to be felt to believed - it can&#x27;t really be described. I would highly recommend this product to any friend looking for a great shampoo and conditioner set to improve scalp health and reduce dandruff. This set appeared to be 100% authentic!</li>
    <li> Bottles arrived leaking and one of the dispensers broken.  Like the product, but bad packaging and mailing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of the product and the tingle, but the shampoo leaves my normally dry hair really, really dry.  Unfortunately, the conditioner does not replenish the moisture well either.  If you have normal or oily hair, this product would probably be perfect, but for those of us with thick, coarse hair there are many better options to keeping healthy looking.</li>
    <li> This works well for dry scalp, smells good and we love the easy to use pumps</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have dry, flaky scalp! Leaves hair smelling &amp; feeling minty.</li>
    <li> perfect Christmas present</li>
    <li> Like I stated, I received both of my bottles in a timely fashion but the pumps were broken. One was completely shattered while the other was broken at the connection to the bottle. I tried to file with Amazon but they wanted me to ship it back. Kind of gross if you want me to shop used bottles of shampoo back so I guess I will have to deal with a shampoo/conditioner with small broken pieces of plastic inside. For 60 dollars for both, I would have expected better.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping, fair price. Product is awesome. It smells so good and makes your scalp tingle when you use it. Definitely recommend the pump size bottles.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Smells great and leaves you feeling refreshed. BUT it dried out my hair bad after I used it a few times.</li>
    <li> The fact alone they have a pump allows for easy use as well as portion control.  They have lasted the two of us over two months and are used by us both twice a day.  Great product and value indeed.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo, hoping it would give a clean Tea Tree feel. I expected it to be cleansing. After all, that is the nature of tea trea oil. What I didn&#x27;t expect, however, is that this shampoo would be the worst shampoo I have ever used in my WHOLE LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this is not a tea tree shampoo. Rather, it smells extremely strongly of mint. &amp;#34;That&#x27;s OK,&amp;#34; I thought to myself, &amp;#34;mint smell is kind of nice.&amp;#34; - until I started rubbing it on my scalp and I felt my eyes begin to tingle. After a while, I noticed that my eyes were burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that if I was extremely careful, I could keep from getting the shampoo in my eyes. Unfortunately, even the tiniest residue in my eyes will cause them to sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, if you do not want your eyes to burn while in the shower, don&#x27;t buy this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love the actual product advertised. But I was sent the wrong thing.... I got lemon sage..</li>
    <li> It came with the conditioner lid not screwed all the way and it leaked everywhere.  After reading many reviews (which I unfortunately didn&#x27;t see first because I just looked at the overall rating) saying this was fake - it&#x27;s going back!</li>
    <li> I have gone through more shampoos than I care to count, especially in the last few years. My hair is thick and fine-textured and my scalp is oily. I don&#x27;t have dandruff, but I have problems with my scalp being very, very itchy. Quite a lot of shampoos dry my hair out and turn it into tangled straw. Others weigh it down. I found good stuff in my daughter&#x27;s organic, herbal baby shampoo but that still didn&#x27;t seem to completely tame the awful itch I deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this, I swore up and down I&#x27;d never spend this kind of money on a shampoo. Paul Mitchell products are far from cheap, and its not like I can just run down to the drug store and grab some. Still, I was desperate and had heard really good things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased. This stuff smells amazing and will help clear your sinuses in the shower. The minty-herbal smell is very strong and lingers beautifully even after your hair is rinsed. Your scalp feels cold and tingly while you&#x27;re washing. It lathers wonderfully and rinses out easily. The conditioner is thick, but not heavy feeling at all, and rinses out easily as well. A little bit goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft and full, which is awesome. My itchy scalp seems to be tamed, and that&#x27;s more than I could have ever asked for.</li>
    <li> These *look* really cool, big dark-green translucent containers. The products are excellent, the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I love the fact that they have pumps on top -- makes dispensing at 4:30 in the morning easier given that only a few brain cells are online when I stumble into the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great products. A worthwhile indulgence. The tea tree essence is helpful for your scalp, also, it gives you a slightly tingly sensation that you notice with the shampoo, not so much with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist first turned me on to this shampoo and conditioner.  She noticed that I had a lot of dandruff and had success with these products in the past.  She used these simultaneously in combination with some other shampoos and conditioners and we could both tell the difference the first time.  It wasn&#x27;t long before I was purchasing this product for use at home as well.  I intially bought smaller bottles but this time around, I went with the full liter sizes.  I expect them to last a very long time, so I feel the price is justified.    As an African American woman with both relaxed and color treated hair and a dandruff problem, I woulld highly recommend this to others like me.  I barely see dandruff anymore and I know it&#x27;s a result of using these products.  However, I caution that I wouldn&#x27;t use the Paul Mitchell products alone.  I still use them every time I wash my hair, but I also use other shampoos and conditioners that I have found to work for me as well.  Do what works for you.</li>
    <li> super deep clean you hair</li>
    <li> I was using this type of shampoo because my eye doctor suggested I use tea-tree shampoo because of my Blepharitis.  It did not solve my problem and I could not stand the odor of this shampoo.  I got tired of my husband asking...what is that smell.  I gave up and junked it.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, I guess it is okay.</li>
    <li> I love how the product&#x27;s aroma therapy works. The shampoo drys my hair out though. It is so relaxing though- I just mix the shampoo with a more moisturizing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I had been having problems with dry scalp and flakiness.  These products are reducing the symptoms ... and if all goes well, maybe it will alleviate the problems entirely.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a gift.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is good. Conditioner is just okay.</li>
    <li> Love this product . One of my kids had purchased this and I tried it and it smells like mint and leaves your hair very soft and you use very little</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after my daughter, with extremely curly hair, had head lice. Tea tree oil is a natural head lice repellent. After lots of research I landed on this product. Now that we have gotten rid of the lice, I am using this with both my kids in order to hopefully avoid another infestation down the road. My daughter, due to possibly heredity and/or the curly hair, has a very flaky and dry scalp. Inadvertently, this keeps her scalp clean and it&#x27;s not too drying with her hair type. I use it as well as I also have curly hair. It works well and is not to harsh. Beware, however, my husband has very curly hair and a flaky scalp and he is extremely sensitive to this shampoo and conditioner. He broke out on his scalp when using this. Tea tree oil, in general, can cause irritation on the skin in it&#x27;s purest form. I do have sensitive skin (ie., have sensitivity to many detergents, face creams and deodorants) but not have had a reactions like my husband&#x27;s. My daughter is young and has not had a reaction as of yet.</li>
    <li> This does give you a nice tingling sensation and I think it helps with my itchy dry scalp. I only gave it 3 stars because when I use it my hair feels wiry and dry in the shower and not clean and soft. Once I blow dry and fix my hair it&#x27;s fine though. I just like that soft feeling when I&#x27;m washing and I just don&#x27;t get it with this but I like it.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. The tingling sensation lasts even after you are out of the shower. This stuff is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a year because I bought big bottles of the shampoo + conditioner, and it might have worked a bit in the beginning but after a while, it did not work anymore. My scalp is still itchy and oily and i have pimples one my hairline and on my scalp(I have fine blonde hair). I am still looking for a remedy. :-(</li>
    <li> I love using this shampoo in the morning. It smells like a spa and I feel like I&#x27;m pampering myself.</li>
    <li> I have used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuii quite a few times as well as Biolage in the past but this blows it all away.  I love having the smell of tea tree oil every time I wash my hair.  It just makes sense! Shouldn&#x27;t we all be getting some tea tree oil falling onto our heads if were outside when it rains?  Tingly, invigorating, worth every dollar -no matter how much I paid.</li>
    <li> It made my hair fall out. My. Hair. Fell. Out. People. I ignored the cautionary reviews on this product and decided to chance it. Well, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m grateful for a very thick head of hair. Otherwise, my hair would be embarrassingly thin. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient(s) specifically caused it, but I will never trust a salon product purchase outside of a salon ever again. I noticed the smell was overwhelmingly strong. To the point that it made my eyes water just by putting it on my head. But the package was also sealed with scotch tape. That&#x27;s right, not factory sealed. So anything could&#x27;ve easily been added to it. Several folks complained of a weak smell, so who knows what was added to amp it up. And it was poorly packaged as a good portion of the shampoo had leaked during shipment. I wish I could give this product negative stars.</li>
    <li> Smells good and makes your hair feel nice and clean. My hair feels healthier since I started using it I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner.  for fine and oily hair types this is a great product to keep the hair silky and soft and not greasey.</li>
    <li> The seller sent me the conditioner portion of my order in 2 small bottles without pumps, instead of the larger one with a pump that I had requested and paid for.    Their justification for having done this, was to say, \\&quot;We ran out of the liter bottles and thought you wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the 2 smaller bottles\\&quot;.  As a seller, it isn&#x27;t their right to assume what a customer wants. My order was specific, and matched exactly what was advertised on Amazon.    Their response to my email regarding their error, was to propose sending me a pump to be used with the smaller bottles.  Bottom line is that I don&#x27;t have what I ordered, they didn&#x27;t offer to make it right, and I don&#x27;t accept the makeshift  solution they offered. I still want what I originally ordered, so I&#x27;ll have to go through the process of ordering it again through some other company, and use the smaller bottles that they sent as refills for the larger one with a pump that I get in my new order... very expensive doing business with them.</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Shampoo is my favorite. I usually get the pump top version when I have it (due to the cost, I usually only use it when I want to slurge on myself or when it&#x27;s a gift).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant fragrance that is neither male nor female. It gets your head squeaky clean (You can tell if shampoo did its job by pressing your fingers around a bit of hair and pulling. If it makes a squeak, it&#x27;s clean).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You notice that you need more Tea Tree Shampoo than some other shampoos. I use probably 20% more than my day-in-day-out brand (Treseme).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the conditioner doesn&#x27;t do a ton for me. It&#x27;s okay, but the shampoo is really the thing to pay for in my book. So I rarely get the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to consider just getting the shampoo (at the moment, you can get it here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MD65FO ).</li>
    <li> The product arrived with broken pump heads and leaked everywhere in the package.</li>
    <li> i was excited when i first purchased it thinking both shampoo and conditioner would work for my hair.unfortunalty not for me.  i myself have really thick hair so using the conditioner was like using half the bottle ,and it didint make my hair soft.  the only good think about using paul mitchells product is that the tea tree makes your scalp tingle but other than that  i wasint that impress. glad i only only paid 30 bucks at ulta!</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that does not break me out. Just have to smell like a mint. lol, but it works great.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It is the first time that I received a sample in the mail and actually tried and LOVED it. Went on Amazon and bought the full sizes right away! It clears your sinuses and makes you feel refreshed - just from washing your hair!</li>
    <li> My favorite all time Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for Dandruff and keeping away pesky critters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and plan to continue.&lt;br /&gt;This size usually lasts me over a year.&lt;br /&gt;And YES... I do shower every now and again.</li>
    <li> I used to use cheap shampoo and conditioner then I changed to this. I can honestly say that this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever owned. I can tell when it&#x27;s clean and I love the tingling sensation of the shampoo and the cooling sensation of the conditioner. By far the best shampoo and condition on the market.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to me because I am worried about loosing my hair.  It seems to help a bit.  And I enjoy the tingling feeling from the tea tree oil.  My hair is way softer as well</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my 7 year old daughter at the advice of my hairdresser. My little girl has oily hair and scalp odor even though she showers every day. This is the only shampoo that actually gets to the root (no pun) of the odor by killing the odor  causing bacteria.  I tried switching to a cheaper tea tree shampoo but it was not as effective.&lt;br /&gt;I started using the shampoo myself during the summer months because it leaves a cooling feeling on the scalp for hours after being used. Very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give it 4 stars not 5 is the price. We go through it quickly and it does add up.</li>
    <li> Received goods at awful condition. Shampoo and conditioner  leaked and soiled the books</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the only shampoos that doesn&#x27;t give me a flaky scalp. The minute I stop using it I have issues again. Amazon overnight shipping got it here safe and sound just this morning at an okay price. If I have any complaints is that it&#x27;s a bit high priced, just a bit. $29.99 would be perfect :)</li>
    <li> Boy do I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shampoo and conditioner!  It emits a minty freshness as soon as you put it in the palm of your hand.  Once I put it on my scalp, it makes my head tingle a bit while I take in the smell.  It makes me look forward to stepping in the shower because I know my hair is going to come out smelling delicious.  I catch myself sniffing the ends of my hair sometimes because it smells so good.  It&#x27;s refreshing and leaves my hair feeling very clean.  Yes, I can see what others say about it drying out the hair too much.  But with the conditioner, it makes it very smooth and clean.  I LOVE THIS SHAMPOO/ CONDITIONER!  This will be my regular buy from now on!</li>
    <li> I have fine straight hair. The shampoo was great at first. I think that is because it was removing other shampoo and conditioner build up. After buildup removal my hair was too dry and I started getting fly away hair. Not good. So I use it alternately with other shampoos. The conditioner is much better. When I get fly away hair I would use a drop (dime size) and apply it to my hair and the fly aways would be tamed. Easy to style. The conditioner extremely well as a skin lotion. I&#x27;d apply it to my face neck and ears. No greasy feeling and it absorbs well. I&#x27;ve started using the conditioner on my legs and arms as well. It&#x27;s better than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried so far. And I tend to have dry skin. Especially in the winter. I&#x27;d recommend the conditioner for hair and body.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell</li>
    <li> This item is not brand new, this item has been opened before, it has tape instead of a seal, I refuse to use something that has already been opened. It seems like it was opened so they could dilute the product.</li>
    <li> I use this product but have recently started using the condtioner on my dog....My SHEDDING dog...  The condtioner pulls out so much hair that the first time you use, you will think your dog is losing all his hair. My ivans coat feels like a mink coat now and his skin is as healthy as you can get. He&#x27;s always going to be a shedder but hes a soft fluffly 65 lb. shedder.[[ASIN:B001OVQSJG Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo &amp; Special Conditioner Duo 33.8 oz (1 Liter)]] So if you have a SHEDDER I highly recommend this conditioner for you</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. If you have really dry hair it might be a little strong but it was worth it to control my scalp acne. Has really helped with keeping the acne under control. I love the fragrance but if you do not like an herbal, minty smell it may not be for you. I color my hair and it has not faded the color at all.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like product. It felt like it dried my hair out vs. moisturizing it and my hair is already processed.</li>
    <li> The item is the perfect size and perfect value for my money. Item arrived on time and in perfect condition. Very happy and will be purchasing soon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I just love these Tea Tree products.  The work great and help to eliminate dandruff and pimples.  Plus they are very soothing.</li>
    <li> Great product; leaves your hair looking great. Leaves your scalp with a wonderful tingling sensation!!! Am using it daily, using it sparingly &amp; it goes a long way!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I have a very dry scalp and this shampoo smells and works great. These giant bottles also last quite a long time. Price seems high, but considering how long it lasts, it isn&#x27;t that bad.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of shampoos and conditions, and several other Tea Tree shampoos and conditioners, and this is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 18 months, and I love it. I&#x27;ll never use another product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No dandruff, no dry scalp, healthy great looking scalp and hair!  love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Licensed Cosmetologist and I even attended a Paul Mitchell school. This is a great everyday shampoo. Has a good balance of moisture and protein. Has a strong Tee Tree scent. Perfect for a dry scalp and to prevent lice. This is way over priced. Try buying on a sale at a salon or supply. There is often great liter duo sales. Keep your eyes open. I wouldn&#x27;t pat more then $30 for this product off a retail shelf. Cosmetologist get it for $22 at cost.</li>
    <li> Greatest shampoo and conditioner ever.</li>
    <li> Hands down my favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Works wonderful for my otherwise thick and unmanageable hair.  You feel incredibly refreshed at the end of your shower and not as though you&#x27;ve stripped every drop of natural oil off of your hair till its quite literally squeaky clean.  Smells wonderful (to me) though the Lavender is my favorite scent.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo hands down. Leaves my scalp tingly and clean. The minty scent is fabulous. Pair it with the conditioner and you will have beautiful, clean, healthy hair that&#x27;s simple to style.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t always have time to zip to the mall and grab the shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s nice to have it delivered- and the price is not to different from what I pay at the hair salon- except it&#x27;s deliver to home.  The smell is really nice- although it can sting in my  eyes with the strong mint smell in the shampoo.  But, the smell defiantly is a nice way to wake up in the morning and start my day.</li>
    <li> I have had seborrheic dermatitis for many years, but this winter it has been very bad. I searched the &#x27;Net for something to help me, as I get color on my hair every month, and other products turned my hair color a different shade and were also irritating to my scalp. I found good reviews for these products so decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo/conditioner for a few weeks now, and I am very pleased. I was initially turned off by the smell of the shampoo, but the smell isn&#x27;t noticeable once it is rinsed off. The shampoo tingles and soothes the seb derm that has been so itchy at my hair line, and I am noticing a lot less irritation and redness now. The shampoo itself is a bit drying, but the conditioner helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am very satisfied, and I am will be purchasing these products again in the future.</li>
    <li> Got large bottles since everyone in the family loves this shampoo.  Hair feels really clean after  use and keeps scalp healthy too.  Love the smell!  Also, I color my hair but it doesn&#x27;t affect color at all.  Larger bottles are a bargain.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the real deal, no rip offs here..</li>
    <li> My son loves this product and with his long hair and beard it should last him awhile.</li>
    <li> wife loves it. hair is smooth and shiney</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised</li>
    <li> I used this while I was deployed to Afghanistan. One word...amazing. When I got back and started using other shampoo, my scalp dried and flaked. Especially with the Florida water. I got this again and my hair is healthier and flake free. I do recommended switching to a normal shampoo every few washes though. It keeps your hair guessing...</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product but when I received it the lid to the shampoo and conditioner opened up and spilled all over.  Thank goodness it was in a bag, but neverless I love how this makes your hair feel and smell.  My husband hauls livestock and my son works in a hog barn and this stuff works so well for THAT smell.  Many people will know what I&#x27;m talking about if they use this product! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING!</li>
    <li> Husband and I both love this shampoo and conditioner.  It smells pleasantly of herbs and mint and keeps our scalps clear and our hair shiny and manageable. We also find the pump despensers are very nice to use instead of messy flip caps or screw caps.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. The only downside is it is ridiculously expensive. I am not sure the cost in the actual hair salons as I haven&#x27;t checked, but either way I expect it to be expensive. The shampoo works like I expected it to. I don&#x27;t have dandruff or anything, just like the Tea Tree shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of Paul Mitchel Shampoo&#x27;s, but haven&#x27;t used them in quite some time. So when I ran across this set I thought I might splurge a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aroma: 5&lt;br /&gt;Tingle: 5&lt;br /&gt;Cleanliness: 5&lt;br /&gt;Softness: 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these my hair always feels great afterwards. Both from the nice high quality of the shampoo and conditioner from Paul Mitchel and from the fact that it uses the Tea Tree which gives a great tingling hot/cold effect when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a recommended purchase from me if you feel like splurging a little on some nice Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Beware. Product was leaking when i opened. Pumps were already inside shampoo and cond bottles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this shampoo and conditioner several times on Amazon from different suppliers.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with the product and will continue to buy it but not from Sweets and Treats.  It took over a month to receive the parcel and once I finally did it had leaked all over.  I notified them (including pictures) and their attitude was that &amp;#34;it happens&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Everything went smoothly from this outside vendor. Product is great. I love the intensity of the aroma. Trying to figure out how to open the pump was quite difficult but eventually the pump handle did extend for easy use. Would/will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this stuff.  He has crazy think hair and most other products leave his scalp itchy and dry</li>
    <li> We are avid users of Aveda Tea Tree and Arbonne Tea Tree hair products, and wanted to see if Paul Mitchell had a comparable product at a lower cost. The scent is definitely stronger with the Paul Mitchell products than with Aveda and Arbonne. The quality is so far the same. We will continue to purchase this product from Amazon, as when I price compared at my local beauty supply store, the Amazon price was lower. I am a Prime member, so I am not as concerned about the price of shipping as someone who may be price comparing and is not a Prime member.</li>
    <li> Love this set. It has worked wonders one and my daughters hair! I was hesitant about paying this much for yet another hair product but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo/conditioner. I love the tingling/cooling feeling it gives me. Leaves my hair feeling really clean. My hair seems thicker and fuller. Also, I love the scent.</li>
    <li> i have suffered from scalp psoriasis for over 5 years, and after reading the reviews I thought this might help, but it only made my scalp WORSE. it made my scalp burn because of the tea trea and that caused inflammation and more flakes to develop because of the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;dandruff and scalp psoriasis are very different i learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found what works the best, nizoral shampoo and using a completely natural oil shampoo.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of a hairdresser after complaining that my scalp itched all the time, but I didn&#x27;t have dandruff. She explained it was probably build up from all of the other hair products that I used, and that I should try a tea tree shampoo and conditioner to alternate between my Morrocan Oil Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one fits the bill completely. After 2 uses, no more itchy scalp! It also does not damage color treated hair.</li>
    <li> The product is great, I have been using it for years and will continue doing so as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> Truly great if you have eczema of the scalp.  Combined with pine tar soap, it practically clears it up completely.  Nothing better.</li>
    <li> I bought this combo and thought it would be really good for my hair. Unfortunately, the only good thing was the fragrance. It dried my hair out, and the conditioner did nothing.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioner! It leaves my hair soft, healthy looking and not weighed down at all.</li>
    <li> Get the conditioner. It makes your melon feel like it&#x27;s on fire which is a nice tingling sensation. Buy it now. Don&#x27;t wait home.</li>
    <li> I have a naturally dry scalp and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I now use after years of trying MANY others.  It works amazingly and I can use it daily exclusively without getting that &amp;#34;dull hair&amp;#34; issue that can happen if you use one brand/kind of shampoo and conditioner too long.  In addition, the smell is absolutely amazing.  I constantly get compliments on the smell of my hair.  I highly recommend this duo to anyone - it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I USED WEN FOR 2 YEARS AND FOUND THAT I WAS LOSING HAIR.  SOMEONE SUGGESTED I USE TEA TREE AND I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice.  My husband loves it but I used it once because I was having an itchy scalp.  The next day my scalp was raw!  I went to the dermatologist who put me on a steroid shampoo (clobetasol) and  and Ketoconazole and my scalp cleared up.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the shampoo so I used it  and my scalp was raw again the next day.  Back on the Ketoconazole and I will never use this again or anything like it.  Not sure what I am allergic to.</li>
    <li> First off, some people are saying that the bottle has changed and they are complaining about the product.  The product&#x27;s bottle has NOT changed; the bottles are still green and short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo - does not lather and is drying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner - not moisturizing at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these products for people looking for moisturizing products.  In addition, I didn&#x27;t really feel a big tingle in the scalp from using these products.  Murad thinning hair and colored hair products are better.</li>
    <li> I have bought and currently use this shampoo because my stylist is a Paul Mitchell salon so he sells and uses it on customers.  My hair is fine and thinning so I don&#x27;t need any conditioner.  In my opinion it is as effective as any I have used in the past.  I don&#x27;t remember what I paid him for it but I will check and if less expensive will buy it from Amazon from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the best product if you have itchy and dry flaky scalp before getting prescription products. I&#x27;ve tried everything including oils, nothing works as good as these. If you are not sure because of the price (Yes, is very pricy)start with the treatment first, then with the smaller size. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels a little different than the ones you would buy from a stylist, but still works and smells pretty good</li>
    <li> Works very well and smells great. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is one of the best we have ever utilized.  Very invigorating and deep cleansing.  You can actually feel it working when you apply.  Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have Scalp Psoriasis, this is the only shampoo I have bought that helps and actually makes the peeling stop and soothes the itching into virtual non-existence. Highly recommended to anyone with Scalp Psoriasis. Buy a small bottle try it. I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry. Plus I love the smell of Tea Tree.</li>
    <li> Really good...cap came off during shipping... but nothing got hurt.</li>
    <li> Works wonders love it. Made my hair health. The smell was great and my hair was fresh and clean. I would buy again</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use for my hair, great product for all hair type and by the way it smells great!</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviews about the conditioner not working so well.  It doesn&#x27;t detangle and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as hydrated as other conditioners. The shampoo seems to make my hair shiny and soft, but I really don&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s like really strong eucalyptus cough drops.  No one in my family likes it so I have to buy a different shampoo for them and I am stuck with this huge bottle.  Overall the shampoo works well if you like the smell but it was so expensive I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Being a bald guy I have little use for this myself so I am writing review based on my (3) teenage daughters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They just love this product and at times fight over it, thus we have to provide each with there own set.  Great and easy gift for birthdays and xma.</li>
    <li> Great for dry scalp and hair. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and Paul Mitchell works best for me.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much. The item you sent is perfect.</li>
    <li> Was sent paul mitchell hair and body moisturizer instead of the TeaTree special conditioner.. No clear way of sending it back or replacing it.</li>
    <li> The price and quality is really good. One of my favorite Paul Mitchell duo packs. I like to use their product not only because they are good, but Paul Mitchell doesnt use animal testing which is a huge plus for me. Animals dont have to be hurt to allow people a good shampoo and conditioner. This product proves that.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo but definitely not color safe</li>
    <li> Before I opened the shipping box I could smell the product.  The pump had already been released and the bottle top was partly unscrewed on both the shampoo and conditioner bottles making a huge mess inside.  I cleaned them up and began using them but there is something not right about the product I received.  I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for a long time and I Love the way it works on my hair.  So I would highly recommend this product.  But I will never buy this product from this vender again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! My hair has stopped falling out so much now that I have been using it.&lt;br /&gt;It may be too fresh feeling during the winter months but, it&#x27;s great for the warm weather California is experiencing right now :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while, so I kew what I was getting into.  The product at this size sounds expensive but it will last two people 6 months or more.  You only need a dime-sized amount applied.</li>
    <li> Only product I put in my hair.  Gives me a scalp massage leaving head refreshed.  Ive been buying this product for some time now and its way cheaper this way than it is at the stores.</li>
    <li> These products are wonderful.  My stepmother recommended that I try these and after one use I was hooked.  They are very light and the most cleansing products I have ever used.  They leave a pleasant tingle and wonderful smell after you rinse and nothing has made my hair so silky and manageable with no weigh down.  My hair and scalp with never feel clean again with any other product.  I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon, the salons only ever have very small bottles.</li>
    <li> Great product for my scalp! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and I love the larger sized bottles!</li>
    <li> The conditioner cap didn&#x27;t work.  It was broken due to poor quality, and this is very inconvenient.  This is not what I pay for.</li>
    <li> This is clearly fake or watered down (not the same as the last time I purchased it from the salon).  The tingle is barely there and the conditioner leaves my hair in a tangled mess, making me use leave in conditioner as well.  I ripped out a ton of my hair!  Don&#x27;t buy it.  I wish I had read the reviews.  Oh, and it is non-returnable.  I did not know that.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo and conditioner!!!  The smell is so clean.  The tingle makes me think it is really working.  I would not recommend using this shampoo and conditioner everyday for color treated hair.  It helps clean the scalp very well without drying hair out -  packaged very well no leaking and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> I love it. It makes my scalp feel like new. with my tight dreads I can condition too. The shampoo and conditioner feel great.</li>
    <li> I love it , thanks, everybody tells me i have a soft and healthy hair . Thanks I love it</li>
    <li> I reccomend this product to everyone, your scalp feels great, your hair is soft and mangeable. You dont have to spend a lot of money on fancy hair products as this one does it all for me</li>
    <li> Yummy minty smell. Really gets your hair clean without stripping moisture out of your hair.</li>
    <li> This product has a great scent and feels great when washing.  I have purchased more and it&#x27;s a must have in our family.</li>
    <li> We have been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree for three years because we have found it to be an excellent shampoo and the conditioner works well too.  We especially like the fresh minty smell while and after we use it. Will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> good for summer showers. Love the cooling sensation in summer. Its great for dryness control/dandruff. I love tea tree based products and this is one of the best tea tree shampoos in the market</li>
    <li> I had been using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil Shampoo for years, but had shied away from conditioner because it tended to weigh my hair down, but when my local supplier closed, I decided to check Amazon to get more.  Most of what I found featured the shampoo and conditioner together and so I hesitated.  I finally took the plunge and I am very impressed with the conditioner.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but it has made quite a difference.  I am very satisfied with the product and with the delivery via Amazon Prime.  It is well worth the cost of the subscription.</li>
    <li> super fast shipment and i love the product. i&#x27;ve always used the shampoo only and now i&#x27;ve got the conditioner my hair is even more beautiful and healthy looking!!</li>
    <li> Good price.  Bottles were taped to try to prevent leakage,  but shampoo still did a bit. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. I&#x27;ll order again</li>
    <li> Large quantity? Check&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful? Check&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my wife&#x27;s hair beautiful? Check</li>
    <li> Short version: Do you know someone whose hair smells awful? Gift this. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anecdote:&lt;br /&gt;One of my guy friends had the worst smelling hair ever (gag), and I asked my hairdresser what he could do about it. She said that many men who use hair products don&#x27;t use shampoo strong enough to get rid of everything, so it builds and builds until there is a smell (bacteria build up - gross). She pointed me to the tea tree shampoo and conditioner from Paul Mitchell to get rid of the smell.  Guess what - it worked! She said that it was a little strong to be using every day and recommended using it once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo regularly over the years as a weekly shampoo to get rid of any build up from my daily shampoo - and I am so happy that she told me about it. It keeps my hair soft, clean, and smelling nice. I have also referred some other guy friends to start using this - and everyone has loved it. It cleans thoroughly and leaves your hair good enough for a commercial shoot! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even got my parents to try it. My mom&#x27;s scalp is a little sensitive, so this set didn&#x27;t work well for her - but my dad looooooves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shampoo and have been faithfully using it since 2005...so that makes it 9 years now.</li>
    <li> great product, love the tea tree fragrance, fresh</li>
    <li> Love this combo and the tingling!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based on reviews from Amazon (ended up purchasing at a Salon as I was worried about counterfeit goods from the 3rd party sellers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Colorado where humidity is not a word at times. I suffer from dry scalp that leaves quite the flakes on my head. I have done everything from using Tea Tree Oil to brushing my scalp with a harsh brush to get rid of the dry skin, washed my hair every few days, didn&#x27;t use hot water, bought a humidifier, supplemented with this hoping it would help, no luck. Swapped over to Head &amp; Shoulders with Almond Oil, in one week it is almost gone. If you&#x27;re purchasing this for the Tea Tree Oil and the dry scalp relief, I recommend trying a cheaper product first.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner but can&#x27;t get the pumps to work. What&#x27;s the secret? Just received and we can&#x27;t figure it out. Frustrating!</li>
    <li> Good product over all. I have been using this combo for years. I started to use it on my sons recently and I could not believe the difference when compared with a cheap shampoo.</li>
    <li> just love to use the shampoo and conditioner when I have a head ache, it stimulates the scalp and smells good to !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected .. Will recommend to anyone.. My husband would not use anything else...he loves the mint fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh aroma of mint and the way it gets my hair squeaky clean!  It removes all product build up and leaves your hair feeling  great.</li>
    <li> Conditioner leaked all over the box. Very annoying</li>
    <li> I know this product was once real since I used it at a friends house who ordered it some time ago.  It&#x27;s the whole reason i wanted to switch form crew products to this Paul Mitchell product in the first place.  However..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product IS NOT REAL. Not anymore at least.  Calling it a product is being very polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very strong with mint and tingling when I first got it.  Perhaps from some of the negative reviews saying the tingle wasn&#x27;t strong enough they put some more of whatever it is that now causes the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; (burn).  I thought maybe it would take time to get used to it.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ended up burning my scalp.  I&#x27;ve never had dandruff and flakes started.  My scalp was red and raw. I didn&#x27;t start using this product immediately upon purchase to use my old product and thus ran out of time to return it or I would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks into &amp;#34;recovery&amp;#34; and my scalp is a solid thin to medium scab and very scaly.  It itches constantly, though I cannot itch it or like any scab it would bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive skin, and never have.  The closest thing I can describe this experience to is a light to medium acid burn.  I could have washed my hair with muriatic acid mixed with a mint lotion for a couple weeks and achieved a similar result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on the sellers, and shame on Amazon for continuing to peddle this faux and DANGEROUS product</li>
    <li> Nothing on earth makes me feel more refreshed, cleansed, and tingly than Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products. The bar soap is amazing too.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel amazing. I use the conditioner with the Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Keratin Cream Rinse and it works great. Leaving hair really soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> This is the worst shampoo/conditioner combo I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried it for one week and my hair is now more dry and brittle than it has ever been. It now tangles like never before and breaks anytime it&#x27;s brushed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m now addicted to this shampoo and cannot do without it. I&#x27;m completely screwed if they ever discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Great quality shampoo and conditioner - hair feels nice and clean.</li>
    <li> i really hate to stir the cup more, but the sad truth is this is just not authentic. It is just not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing the shampoo and conditioner combo (shipped from TheBeautySource), my friend and i could tell right away that something was a bit off. We were aware of the warning about counterfeit product on the label from previous uses bought at salons, but didn&#x27;t really think it was that true, especially when it is being sold at respectable pharmacies and even Amazon. But we did some research and came across a \\&quot;5 On Your Side consumer alert\\&quot; video clip online and it explained everything very nicely and easily and it came very clear that this is, in no way, an improbability. These products are not authentic and that is all there is to it. Wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am giving it 2 stars instead of one since the product did clean my hair and smell like mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: i should&#x27;ve been a tad less critical. It is possible that the product is \\&quot;authentic\\&quot;, but old, defective, or tampered with.</li>
    <li> Tingles at first then stings. Rather disturbing. Thought it might just be me but it was the exact same for my wife.</li>
    <li> Better price elsewhere</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for hair and scalp it makes your hair dark,soft and managable. It waks you up from&lt;br /&gt;sleep. The natural effect of tea tree removes bad stuff and clears up dandruff. the pepermint makes good circulation in the scalp while the lavender relaxes you/</li>
    <li> My haircutter used this on me and I love this shampoo and the container is nice too as it doesn&#x27;t squirt too much out like just about all containers do. They do that so you will use it up quicker and have to buy more than you need.</li>
    <li> this has lasted me over a year these bottles and are only half way gone, its nice but deff doesnt help with dandruff</li>
    <li> HI I bought this since last summer and i ONLY use it once a week but when i use it it dry my hair and makes it look stupid and when my hair dry out from water some white stuff come out and it was itch most of the time and it has so many stupid chimicals that will damage your hair, and now i do not even buy shampoo anymore i just but organic stuff for cleaning</li>
    <li> This set fights dandruff, the tea tree oil kills lice/crabs (pay attention if you&#x27;re a teacher!) and the peppermint oil gives your head a fresh tingle.</li>
    <li> Shampoo Pros: smells fantastic, makes my scalp tingly, lathers well (when you use 2 pumps)&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo Cons: stripped away too much (left my hair &amp;#34;not in a good way&amp;#34; squeaky clean)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner Pros: ...&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner Cons: does not spread/lather well, leaves my hair &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34;, does not untangle knots/kinks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: The first few times I used this product it didn&#x27;t clean my hair thoroughly or make it soft. I spent a good amount of money on them so I figured I should keep using them. Eventually, my hair ended up being soft, but more prone to frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Type: Normal (not oily or dry), slightly wavy, not dyed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would not recommend this product for everyday use, but if you need a small pick-me-up, the mint will do the trick.</li>
    <li> bought by my son who says it is the best he&#x27;s used,.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t use any other shampoo.</li>
    <li> Item not as described. Fake. Product shouldn&#x27;t be green. Came as green and dried out hair. The authentic Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo/conditioner is not green and works wonderfully. Returned. Will not purchase from this vendor again!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get these, and used my birthday Amazon gift card to buy them.  They arrived on time, but the shampoo had spilled all inside the plastic it was in.  The cap was completely loose.  Then, since there are no returns, I save what I can and go shower.  It is clear that it was diluted with something.  I&#x27;m not going to venture if it was water or another shampoo like others say.  My fault for not reading the reviews from others.  I just assumed that it was the genuine article, which IS an amazing product.  This diluted product is not genuine and not worth the $53 dollars I spent.  Amazon is great for most, just go buy this at a salon, you will regret buying it online.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love PM Tea Tree Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. I was previously using another brand of anti-frizz shampoo and conditioner and it worked okay, but my hair was always oily by the end of the day, and my head was always so hot after washing my hair. I used to use PM&#x27;s Tea Tree products before, so I switched back and what a difference it has made. The cooling effect is amazing and my head feels so much cooler after a shower (no more sweating after a warm shower), and my hair doesn&#x27;t get oily by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> This stuff is as good as it gets! Hands down...without a doubt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any of the poor reviews are obviously made from uneducated....low IQ....democrat morons! (they should stick with their $4 Suave brands!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No offense....of course!</li>
    <li> I saw some reviews that said it was fake and not the authentic brand  and I was hoping that it was not true given most of the reviews were good. Well I bought it and it is not the authentic Paul Mitchell shampoo/conditioner. I think they diluted it with another shampoo. The smell is weaker and the tingle on the scalp is almost not existent. I am surprised amazon would allow people or companies to represent themselves as the original brand without verifying. I had some of the real shampoo and this shampoo side by side and you can easily smell the difference. The real shampoo is a lot more potent. I am pretty disappointed. AVOID.</li>
    <li> I was contacted by the seller and told that if I modified my last review they would send out a new package.  I am writing a second review to state that I will ammend my first review if and when I actually receive a replacement package.  While a USPS tracking number was generated for me it seems clear that the package has not yet been sent out. In addition, I see that many other customers had the same experience as I did. Still disappointed and hoping for a quick resolution.</li>
    <li> Thank you.  The product was excellent; I felt I was provided good value for my money and will order again in the future.</li>
    <li> I love it. It is such a great product I would recommend it to all my friends and family. It treats build up for hair but it is also a great daily cleanser.</li>
    <li> great shampoo that leaves your scalp tingling</li>
    <li> These products are GREAT!  The tea tree in them make your scalp tingle and hair clean and bouncy. Love them both.</li>
    <li> I am constantly getting compliments on how good my hair smells. I like the tingly feeling you get, although that does tend to go away.</li>
    <li> Just got out of the shower and my hair ... i feel like it just went through a complete orgasmic \\&quot;Hallelujah\\&quot; experience. I have never in my 24 years and 11 months of life has my hair ever felt so great. Its like walking out of a salon after a AWESOME hair treatment day but times that by 20. I put some biosilk on the ends and used a low setting on my ceramic hair dryer. I feel like those girls in the hair commercials when the flip their hair back and forth in slow motion lol! Smells great too. I get a fresh uplifting feeling. I feel AMAZING.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is excellent.  My wife claims it helps untangle her hair.  Conditioner is okay; she prefers her old conditioner.  Also, conditioner doesn&#x27;t have the fresh tea tree fragrance that the shampoo contains.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else. My hair dresser got me started on this at the salon and I love it. Can&#x27;t find it in the store so I&#x27;m happy to get it here.</li>
    <li> Just a baffling, pointless disappointment for anyone looking for a tea tree oil product like the very excellent Body Shop line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shampoo? Good, not great. They use it at my Walmart haircutting place -where&#x27;s it&#x27;s $10 less, and the haircutter gets a couple of bucks commission, at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the trouble of returning, but never have I seen a product so mislabeled. C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;onsider all rave reviews to be suspect or from people without noses.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It keeps my hair looking shiny and does not dry it out.  Plus the scent is relaxing.</li>
    <li> The conditioner does not seem like the kind I get from the salon, so I am using more at a time than when I bought ones from the salon.</li>
    <li> Very nice shampoo, smells great.  I&#x27;m not sure this is how the mfc wants this promoted, but tea tree oil is supposed to be effective against lice, and since using this, my children, who had been constantly catching lice, haven&#x27;t had a case.  Not cheap but in this large bottle is a lot less expensive and more pleasant than shampoos marketed for lice prevention.  (I doubt it is a treatment for a real infestation of course)</li>
    <li> The mint is nice but it does not untangle hair</li>
    <li> Smells terrible and after washing with shampoo and conditioner feels like my hair is still dirty! DO NOT PURCHASE!!! It is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> the conditioner was just ok.  Like another reviewer stated it did not untangle knots like most other conditioners do. But the shampoo did leave my hair feeling refreshed and silky smooth. The eucalyptus aroma is pleasant and not overpowering. Over time the shampoo effervescent effects wear off and is not as obvious as when the shampoo was &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;. But thats to be expected. Packaging was a minor issue as it did come with the pump in the bottle and spilled a bit. But it was wrapped in plastic so spillage was minimal.</li>
    <li> Buying just ONE of these at a salon would cost you how much both are on priced together on amazon. GREAT deal.  The shampoo leaves your scalp tingly and smelling minty fresh.  I wish the conditioner was a bit more thick, but either way, love both!</li>
    <li> Product is great but both shampoo and conditioner leaked during shipment. The bottles weren&#x27;t damaged the lids just came loose. The leakage was confined to the plastic they were wrapped in.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Will buy again when I run out. Don&#x27;t know why you have to write so much but I hope this does the trick. Thanks</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair tangled and not soft at all. My hair has been shedding a lot more, and I see no marked tingling or radiance as advertised. The $4 dollar shampoo from CVS probably works better than this. A complete waste of money</li>
    <li> I love it---Moisturizes your hair very well and your scalp feels fresh and cool</li>
    <li> Great product and makes your hair feel silky and smooth.  I had lots of compliments on the smell also.</li>
    <li> By far my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner on the market! The peppermint gives a great little tingling feeling and your hair will never feel cleaner as it does when you use this shampoo and conditioner. I have been using this for the last five years and I will continue to buy it as long as they sell it.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, but being a dude, don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices for the stuff ($15 for a couple of weeks&#x27; worth?!).  The containers are large and I bought two smaller bottles to keep in my standup shower.  It makes my hair look great.</li>
    <li> I really want to love this shampoo and conditioner.  My husband does, but it makes my hair SO OILY!  If you have super dry or very short hair, I think this is probably fine for you, but if your hair is already a little oily, I wouldn&#x27;t really recommend it.</li>
    <li> Has a wonderful menthol/tea tree odor and really wakes me up!  My hair feels clean and soft, I love this product!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser originally introduced me to these products (shampoo and conditioner).  She uses it herself and said she loves the smell (as do I) and it leaves such a clean feeling (I agree 100%).  She went back to using the product she used before the Tea Tree and said her hair didn&#x27;t feel clean but more weighed down and not as light.  I noticed, like others, that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I&#x27;d like, however, when I leave it on for about 5-10 minutes, it does leave my hair soft and smooth and I have no problems getting a comb through my wet hair.  I feel like I go through a lot more of this than other conditioners and shampoos because I have long thick hair, but it&#x27;s worth it to me.  If you&#x27;re expecting it to be like other shampoo and conditioners, you will be disappointed.  These are very unique and leave your hair clean and healthy.  I recommend giving them a try.  I love this product!!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner and with this much it should last me a long time I hope! Good price on it too considering my hair is the best it has ever been with this product!</li>
    <li> I thought this product would be the best product but there are still sulfates and these are terrible detergents for the hair</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic.  The large bottle last more than 6 months with the entire family using it.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> The real stuff I&#x27;ve been looking for! Love it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a more expensive set of hair products and they do not leave my hair as nice as this does. I know the purpose of this is not medicinal but my daughter has psoriasis of the scalp and Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products are the only products I use for her other than her prescriptions. That is after trying many other products. Also, when I had Shingles I used the shampoo as a body wash and it helped with the itching. I also have Celiac Disease and have every few years had a terrible reaction to something I ate and broke out in sores. This wonderful shampoo is the only product that helped me survive this breakout. The shampoo soothed my skin and was very helpful with returning my skin to normal. I still have some dark places but no scarring. I would have never believed that was possible when I was going through all of it. The body wash is fine but for this I found the shampoo to be more soothing. I still use it as a body wash a few times a week. Yes, it is a little pricey but believe me when I say it is worth the investment. I have my hair colored and it is not as harsh as some products but does get your hair clean. Just be sure to use the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is pretty good stuff.  If you like tea tree smell, then you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair a lot.  Great dispenser. The wash is foamy and fresh. Smell is clean and it seems to keep my hair oiled or hydrated well. I swim for exercise and my hair seems to handle chlorine well or this product keeps it healthy.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time, the tingling very clean sensation is something I am unable to come by with other shampoo &amp; conditioner duos. Leaves my hair shiny and at its best.</li>
    <li> Nice and prompt  had no problems and not a long wait to get my package and it was as stated in the ad</li>
    <li> I tried this in November when at a friends house.  I love the clean fresh scent .. kinda wakes you up in the morning.  I will definitely order more when I start running low.</li>
    <li> I called up Paul Mitchell products and talked to their rep and she explained that they never sell any of their products alone - let alone Amazon. This page is very deceiving and I wonder what these knock offs actually have in the bottles.... BEWARE.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped in a plastic bag which was a good thing because product had leaked out and bag was full of product.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaned up bottles and had lost quite a bit,&lt;br /&gt;This was a gift tat I had to give that looked partially used.&lt;br /&gt;I have already emailed about this and ws never responded to.</li>
    <li> Not much lather.  Wasn&#x27;t a big favorite of mine</li>
    <li> Not at all happy with the conditioner.  Had to throw it away.  It turned rancid, something I never expected in a hair conditioner.  It must have been extremely old.</li>
    <li> Great products at a great price. Will order again for sure!</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s too strong or something, but every time I use it I have clumps of hair fall out! I haven&#x27;t had this happen with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. IT&#x27;S HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> This product was horrible. I bought Paul Mitchell shampoo before an actual store, and I could say that this stuff was not the real thing. It was diluted and dried out my hair after a few washes. The mint smell was also way too overpowering. I don&#x27;t  recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess you get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> Thank goodness, this is the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s always hit or miss when trying to buy &amp;#34;Salon-only&amp;#34; items and I&#x27;ve been duped once before with a watered down version of this product.  I purchased from &amp;#34;TK Health &amp; Beauty&amp;#34; and this was the real thing.  Comparing it by smell and texture/lather to what was left of a true Paul Mitchell Tea Tree shampoo/conditioner I am confident this is genuine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have to go into detail how great the product is itself, but it&#x27;s good to know I now have a good six months&#x27; supply at the ready.  I almost want to buy another set just so I won&#x27;t go through the anxiety of dealing with a fake the next time around!</li>
    <li> I like the tingle, it keeps my hair clean and controlled without feeling heavy and greasy. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted to switch from the shampoo and conditioner i had been using for several years. I was really excited to get it in the mail, but was thoroughly disappointed when i finally used it. It smelled amaaaaazing (like eucalyptus and spearmint). I have fine, thin hair and for me, it made my hair staticky and tangly. I did not like this at all. I don&#x27;t know if this particular product was not made for my hair type and i failed to read up on it enough, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Really good Shampoo and Conditioner combo.  Im a guy with really short hair and i could feel the difference right away after using these two. My scalp especially feels great after a the shower and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smelling great! Keeps lice off the kids&#x27; hair. Also has the tingly feelings on your scalp! Was really concerned about ordering after reading some if the reviews, but it works great and leaves my hair feeling great!</li>
    <li> Love the feeling and scents.</li>
    <li> Bought it elsewhere, but this shampoo is great. Keeps away dandruff and is nice and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Shipping need to be better, but overall it&#x27;s pretty good</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year on my color treated hair and adding &#x27;It&#x27;s a Ten&amp;#34; spray on my ends and my hair has been holding up better then when I was younger.  Nice scent too.</li>
    <li> I buy these for my daughter and they wash her natural hair well.  Love the conditioner how it makes her hair so manageable to de-tangle .  This is my second time purchasing and we were out for a while and there is just no substitute.</li>
    <li> Surprised by how well this works! I have temperamental hair that will knot up at the drop of a hat, so I&#x27;m skeptical to try anything new. Can&#x27;t believe how silky and manageable my hair was after using this. And, if you have any irritation going on with your scalp like psoriasis, dandruff etc.., this works wonders as well. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> my tea tree loves it, it has nice and shiny leaves now, but awfully small to cover the whole tree, needs to be sold in gallon sizes at least</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. it not only smells great but leaves a refreshing feel even after used.&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend this to anyone. Wish they made one for color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Stuff smells amazing, and has a really nice cooling effect on your scalp. Works great for my dandruff that I have been suffering from all my life as well; which, always limited me to dandruff shampoo. I don&#x27;t mind being limited to this shampoo though it is probably in my opinion best smelling and most refreshing feeling shampoo I have ever used. Of course the price is way above the average shampoo but I feel it was worth it. Don&#x27;t be afraid to go for these big bottles they have a lot in them and I feel like for someone with short hair its going to last me for a long time.</li>
    <li> Heard about this shampoo and conditioner as being really good for all hair types. I&#x27;d have to say that the reviews are right on. It is excellent and worth buying the bulk size.</li>
    <li> I used it and i was very satisfied.  I had dry scalp and this product took care of it.  And the smell is awesome.</li>
    <li> Beautiful effect after using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree special shampoo.</li>
    <li> The product in the bottle is not the actual product. Wrong color, wrong scent, and made my scalp burn! Will be going to Ulta and spending $10 more for the real thing!</li>
    <li> i love it!!&lt;br /&gt;A smell is good and the head is cool and it is good.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again~</li>
    <li> A ton of Tea Tree!  These HUGE bottles of shampoo and conditioner are packed FULL of tingly tea tree.  Pretty great product leaves you with flowing feeling silky hair!  Beautiful product.</li>
    <li> They should up at my door, fast &amp; secure -tape on the pumps with a bag around the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;They are original Tea Tree Paul Mitchell Products.. I love how my head feels tingly. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Package came with shampoo and conditioner leaking everywhere. Then, to make matters worse, neither of the pumps work on the bottles so I have to unscrew the tops each day I&#x27;m in the shower to spill alittle into my hand. Not happy about spending $50 on hair product with broken bottles and 1/3 of contents spilled in delivery box.</li>
    <li> Bottels showed up broken.. pump issues.. all around drag.</li>
    <li> Love this product and thank you for making it easy to get delivered to my home.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this product and it does wonders for the hair. Our whole family loves this combo. Definitely a good buy for the size.</li>
    <li> I love the green tea shampoo and conditioner!!!  It smells good and makes your hair feel great!  The best part is you feel like your at the salon getting your hair done.  Thanks a lot guys!</li>
    <li> They smell so delicious that we&#x27;re actually considering buying all their Tea Tree products just so we can small their scent more. Minty, clean, herbal and refreshing. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is FAKE... Been using these that are from professional hair dresser, the quality are totally different. Don&#x27;t buy them...</li>
    <li> Love it...is my favorite shampoo forever. ..</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> Genuine product here, although the conditioner is less strong scent wise than I thought it would be, but still smells fantastic and product is just overall excellent. However, this product seems as if it takes regular soap and adds a bunch of truly natural products to low quality shampoo to make it appear high quality.</li>
    <li> Seller SPEED-BOX sent me fake product. It came in outdated packaging in a ziplock bag with scotch tape around the caps. I compared it to the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo and conditioner I already have and it&#x27;s thinner consistency, different color, and smells awful. Worst part is that I have no idea what I just put in my hair.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great.  Besides the wonderful smell, the shampoo makes my scalp tingle.  It is not harsh yet cleans the hair and scalp quite well.  My hair is colored and I find it as safe to use on my hair as shampoos labeled \\&quot;color safe.\\&quot;  The conditioner goes on nice and also makes my scalp tingle.  It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t over-condition.  I usually have the conditioner on my hair while I&#x27;m shaving (the conditioner is also great to use on facial hair -- makes it nice and soft versus prickly which goatees can be).  This dual set comes at a great price and lasts me a long time.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel. I also find it very soothing to soak my tired muscles at the end of the day</li>
    <li> My scalp was infested with tiny, itchy, and greasy dandruff. Head and Shoulders did not help at all and apple cider vinegar did not help treat my scalp much either. My dandruff was so severe that it poured down like snow with just a simple stroke of my head. Talk about embarrassing. Thus, I speak with honesty that this product is my holy grail for treating dandruff. The first wash visibly eliminated 99.99% of dandruff and daily use inhibits the buildup/formation of dandruff. My scalp is also no longer itchy and greasy. The minty cool sensation is very invigorating, making it an awesome wake-me-up. Would definitely be sticking with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Oil shampoo and conditioner. Hopefully, with more use it will eliminate the cause of my dandruff.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! It made my 65 year old hair shine again! It softened the dry ends as well. Would recommend it highly! Thank You Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> Love  this shampoo.. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Invigorating and wonderfully smelling Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner. I bought some on a trip at a drug store and HAD to buy on-line, no store in my area carry the Liter bottles.</li>
    <li> Having used this product previously, I must say it is well worth the price, and the convenience of shopping online is a bonus!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner arrived with 2 small sheets of bubble wrap in the box explaining the rattle when I picked it up.  The bottles had one piece of tape over the top.  However, a tremendous amount of shampoo had leaked all over the box and I am glad I opened it promptly or I would not have had any product remaining.  On a positive note, I love the shampoo and conditioner.  The tingle on your scalp is worth it and the aroma is not overpowering...my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair and an oily scalp this is perfect for you. Love this brand by Paul Mitchell. Plus they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
    <li> I purchased this set of shampoo &amp; conditioner after using the Tea Tree scalp treatment. I love the way it tingles and it make my hair soft and shiny. I have shoulder length super thick hair and sometimes have issues with flakes and dry scalp. I have been using this shampoo &amp; consitioner for a little over a week now and no more itchy scalp. -To those of you that said you didn&#x27;t like or feel the tingle... the more you scrub it into your scalp and the longer you let it sit on your head the more it will tingle. I love the tingle!</li>
    <li> Love the tingle but does not do the trick for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a difference in my hair. It feels very healthy and my hair feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo, great price</li>
    <li> I bought this set 3 months ago and I still love it.  The first time I used it my hair felt so fresh and clean.  There are two of us and the occasional house guest using this set and we have only gone through about 1/3 of the bottles....and yes our hair always feels and looks clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful investment!</li>
    <li> The shipping was fast. I love the tingly and minty feeling on my scalp. Keeps my scalp not feeling dry. My flakes are gone. I&#x27;m asian - straight long thin black hair.</li>
    <li> excellent product &amp; excellent delivery</li>
    <li> I met my item very good</li>
    <li> The shampoo is luxurious.  The tea tree smell is invigorating.  It cleans the hair and scalp well.  I bought the shampoo and conditioner as a special treat for myself.  I alternate between the Tea Tree conditioner and the Lavender Mint one (not part of this &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34;).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Husband uses it in rotation with head and shoulders and it completely clears up his dandruff. It also lasts a REALLY long time for a guy with short hair.</li>
    <li> That tingly feeling in your mouth is what my head feels like when I use this. I love this stuff. I have mild dandruff when the weather changes and this actually helps with that. So yeah, i like this stuff.</li>
    <li> However, I wished I had only purchased the shampoo - the conditioner seems like a total WASTE!!!  It has no scent and the texture of it is strange...</li>
    <li> I love the tingling feeling that Tea Tree gives in the shower. It got rid of my itchy scalp. It really makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great at keeping my scalp healthy.  Very expensive to buy at the salon, but buying it like this makes it affordable.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo that leaves head feeling fresh. Stops scalp from flaking and itching. Comes with nice tea tree oil lotion too.</li>
    <li> My preteen and teenage daughters, as well as myself, use these and can see (and feel) the difference.  I love the tingly feeling duing use and definitely believe it improves the overall health of our hair.</li>
    <li> Some people have said they have received fake or watered down product.  This does not seem to be the case with my order.  This is the first time I have ordered this from Amazon myself, but I have used the product my friend purchase locally and I find it work and feels the same.  I love this stuff.  It deals with my scalp issues, smells great and makes my hair feel and look great.  Now let me be clear I still use my &amp;#34;medical&amp;#34; shampoo some times, but this let me take a break from it and helps me feel better about myself knowing that my hair smells nice and not like some medical monster.  Thank you Paul Mitchell!</li>
    <li> I purchased these after trying them at my sister&#x27;s house. What can I say? This is a good product and I love the pump dispenser. It works really nice in my shower.</li>
    <li> I realized that this is NOT a genuine Mitchell product as the ones I purchased in the salon. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheaper price! The shampoo on my scalp felt different and the after effects were definitely poor. Also the shampoo was watered down!!! It was obvious that the shampoo was mixed with water!!!! I was very upset that Amazon can allow business to sell brand name items that are not genuine.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, shampoo a little drying but conditioner makes up for it.  Conditioner made my hair super soft. And the feeling of the mint felt so good.</li>
    <li> We were first introduced to this product from a hair salon my wife goes to.  She has some flaking of the scalp, but not enough to warrant dandruff shampoo.  This refreshes the scalp, cleans the hair and leaves it tangle free and smooth.  We found these larger bottles here on Amazon, at a competitive price and both use them for every wash.  The mint smells great and really lets you know where the soap and conditioner are working.  BTW, do not get these in your eyes...  they are not for babies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Shampoo and Conditioner pair we have ever used.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, and unlike some products that I have ordered online it was authentic! when shopping and buying online it seems its a 50/50 chance on if your getting the real product. I would buy from this seller again :)</li>
    <li> The only thing you may not like about this is that it will last so long you&#x27;ll get sick of it. *sarcasm*</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combo for 5 years now and still love it! The scent and minty tingle are invigorating early in the morning and they&#x27;re perfect for my dry and itchy scalp</li>
    <li> Have been using this shampoo for years to help my psoriasis.  The smell is refreshing and it is very smoothing to my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and love it it makes my head feel great after each use.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner works great! I have used Pantene, Purador, Dove, etc and I have to say this shampoo and conditioner is by far the best. The scent is very minty, and you can feel that your hair is refreshed. That being said, it is very pricey, and I think there may be other shampoos that may have &amp;#34;more bang for your buck&amp;#34;. But at the end of the day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Shampoo products of course great. Price was nearly double what it can be purchased for at Walmart SmartStyle.</li>
    <li> the brand and product itself was great.  the only thing that bothered me was, when the product arrived, the condition was leaking from the top.  it was actually quite messy, but since it was wrapped , it didnt get onto the box.  if that could be prevented, that would be great.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this shampoo &amp; conditioner!! Smells great too! She feels it helps with the oily hair problem she was having!</li>
    <li> I have an itchy scalp and the tea tree really helps. I tried the generic brand but didn&#x27;t like it as much -</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my scalp tingle and feel alive!</li>
    <li> The items arrived as ordered and in a timely manner....but one of the pump mechanisms was hard to engage and the other was broken.....so I had to use a pumper from another bottle. They were taped down for shipment....but not sure if that had anything to do with the issue.</li>
    <li> Really refreshing.  Conditioner isn&#x27;t as slick feeling as others.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good fot asian&#x27;s hair also. until use this item, My son had complaint about the quality of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;but now hi is saticefied, only weak point for teen&#x27;s use is that this item could make mild irritation to teen&#x27;s eye.</li>
    <li> Great product at an exceptional price.</li>
    <li> Best price anywhere, worth buying the bigger size.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit watered down from identically bottled product they use at salon. Still feels nice in my hair.</li>
    <li> I feel John Paul Michael&#x27;s hands in my hair every time I use this.</li>
    <li> I exercise regularly, live in Phoenix, have hot flashes and seem to be sweating constantly which irritates and dries on my scalp, I&#x27;ve tried every thing out there but the Tea Tree Shampoo and treatment are miracle workers!  This is really worth the money.  I also love the tingly feel on my scalp after the Tea Tree treatment, when rinsed with cool water after a strenuous hike in 107 degree heat, it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
    <li> I ordered the tea tree invigorating shampoo and conditioners in the liter size because with long hair I use a lot of product. My husband has dandruff and his stylistic recommended this for him to use and he loved it. I have dandruff and oily hair and thought I would give it a try. I love the scent and the tingle on my scalp. I have also noticed the dandruff problem getting better. I color my hair all the time and it is safe. The conditioner does wonders with my hair but it is oily to start with. This might not be a good option for people with dry hair. There was a little leakage in the conditioner bottle upon arrival but that was more of a problem with shipping than with the bottle itself. Overall a good experience.</li>
    <li> Product arrived with a stuck dispenser in the Conditioner bottle. Read instructions for help, but none found. Then noticed on bottle, \\&quot;all guarantees are null and void if not purchased from hair salon\\&quot; (ie like from Amazon). Swell.&lt;br /&gt;When I finished using product, it took me approx 20 minutes to remove the tangles from my hair. Somehow the product found its way to my trash can. Complete rip off.</li>
    <li> My daughter has Psoriasis of the scalp and after five years of treating with steroids and creams and injections, it is still difficult to manage. After reading the online reviews of this product we decided to give it a try.  IT WORKS!!  It is not a cure by any means, but I am happy to announce that since she started using this product the itchy, flaky, sore scalp has changed significantly. The flaky patches on her head have almost disappeared. It doesn&#x27;t itch as much and we are finding that she isn&#x27;t using the prescription medication at all.  As an added bonus, the rest of the family loves it too... Really glad we gave it a try!</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo but is not sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Love teatree and the feeling it gives you after each use. Nothing better than starting your day off feeling alive. Can only speck from the Guy point of view - try not to get it on your man parts or all 3 items will tingle as well. Doesn&#x27;t hurt just an odd feeling.</li>
    <li> I have always had dry scalp until I found this shampoo! I purchased a small set of this from a local salon and loved it! I looked on Amazon for a better price then at the salon and I found it!! Most people with dry scalp don&#x27;t wash their hair daily but condition it daily...this works the opposite! Wash daily--really scrub your scalp with your fingertips--let it sit for a few minutes--rinse and then use the conditioner the same way. It smells fantastic and makes your scalp tingle!! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough about how GOOD these smell. Minty, fresh - They wake me up in the morning! ....BUT I am pretty disappointed with the quality of this set......  I really love a shampoo and conditioner that helps my dry frizzy hair.... The conditioner, doesn&#x27;t condition at all - If I knew that ahead of time. I would have just bought the shampoo and spent the rest of my money on a conditioner that works..... Also, you cannot seem to get a good lather with either of them, so you find yourself using more shampoo than you would usually use....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know - With so many options out there..... I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;But if you are looking for something that just smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t do much... this is the shampoo and conditioning set you have been waiting for!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but had the darnest time figuring out the caps. It was apparently a suction problem or something, because after taking a screw driver and tapping it like mad it finally came unjammed. (and no, you don&#x27;t just screw it in place; it was jammed - both of them).</li>
    <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t normally comment on the shampoo and conditioner I buy, he just uses it. But he made of point of letting me know he likes this one (nice fresh smell). He was really happy to hear it also helps with dandruff.</li>
    <li> The very top of my head has been itching for about 7 years, worse in the winter.  I have tried numerous shampoos, have been to dermatologists( got very expensive medicated shampoo, no effect), and on and on.  Got so bad that one night I cut off the off the hair on the top of my head to about an inch. The rest of my hair was shoulder length,awkward look.  Tea Tree oil dabbed on my scalp is the only remedy I have found.  Imagine my excitement at finding these products, imagine my disapointment when I discovered that they were completely ineffective and my hair looks lousy.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. Tea tree oil is great for my scalp and helps me wake up in the morning. The 33 fl oz lasts forever and I have a ton of super thick long Asian hair.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant on purchasing $50 products but after using it for the first I fell in love.  After using this product I do not think I can go back to my cheapy herbal essence products. This is baddddd for my bank account but soo good for my hair. It smells glorious. The smell hits you hard and wakes you up in the morning. So much better than drinking coffee to wake up!  I have been washing my hair with this and I can honestly say I do not need to straighten my hair afterwards.  My hair look straight after I blow dried it.</li>
    <li> Since I was 11 or 12 years old, I&#x27;ve had bad dandruff. I have thick, coarse hair that itches like crazy as it grows. I used to shave my head every summer so things didn&#x27;t get too intense, and over the last 5 years, I shaved it on a weekly basis. Want to know just how bad my dandruff was getting? I got to the point where I was scrubbing my head in the shower with a 3M green scrub pad used for cleaning tile floors. I&#x27;m not kidding! Yep, I pretty much gave up on having hair again. I don&#x27;t know why, but over the last 3 months I started to grow it back out again, and as a result, I needed to get a good shampoo. When I got my haircut, the stylist immediately suggested this brand to me. I&#x27;d never heard of it before and figured it was worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first day of using Tea Tree Special Shampoo, the itching stopped! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Head and Shoulders never helped me out in this category from what I remember, but for it to just completely stop so soon? That&#x27;s crazy. I used just a tiny, dime-sized dab of shampoo, which covered my entire head easily. The smell is excellent as well, reminding me of mint chocolate chip ice cream more than anything else. Isn&#x27;t that something you can get used to each morning in the shower? My hair felt cleaner than it&#x27;s ever felt before after one wash. Even a few minutes after I rinsed the shampoo out, as I ran my fingers through my hair, I could tell that it was completely clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the dandruff, it&#x27;s not completely gone, but there&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m not having to dust off my shoulders every 30 minutes, and I can wear black shirts again! Most of the time I&#x27;ll use the shampoo one day, then just use water the next, repeating this pattern. It&#x27;s working just fine. The conditioner&#x27;s equally great, and since it&#x27;s part of this bundle, you can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. You&#x27;re getting A LOT for your money here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I never thought I&#x27;d grow my hair back because of the dandruffproblem. While I can&#x27;t say I won&#x27;t shave everything off once summer hits just to keep cool, I&#x27;m willing to give it a shot as long as I keep using this shampoo.</li>
    <li> So my bf loves it. And since he lives in north carolina and I live in ny I just had it shipped there and he got it on time and so far loves it. Im glad I could make him happy with the little things. And the tingly feeling you get when you use the shampoo exists. Thats what he loves about it. Thank you for getting it to him on time. From a long day of work he came home to a gift.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;m willing to buy! Great product !</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Love the mint</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. Great smell and works great, I use it everyday and it has helped with the irritation other shampoos used to cause, very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The last time I needed this product I visited a Paul Mitchell Salon and got hit for retail. They really push hard about buying only from their salons due to counterfeits. Tried this to save money and received the real thing at a tremendous saving.</li>
    <li> I used this product along with Defense Soap Bar to fix my problems with ringworm. I noticed results in a little over a week. Consistent use is the key but yes after some time I noticed hair coming back. I did not want to go to the doctor for my problem and thankfully I did not have to.</li>
    <li> Great smell and works wonderful. Good value.</li>
    <li> After trying several shampoos for my itchy scalp, I discovered Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner. The product is cool on the scalp, but it really has helped my skin condition like no other product.</li>
    <li> I bought this from a salon.Because the bottle clearly states that if you do not buy  from a salon there is no guarantee.I actually paid way less for the double pack at salon than price here.&lt;br /&gt;I bought because having scalp issues and tried other over counter stuff-did not work.Did search and this came up #1.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it and all I can say is WOW!! I am in love! The scent is ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! Not medical at all.The texture is creamy and you do not need a lot in either. The set makes your hair soft and smells good.The tingle means it working.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does not itch any longer and my hair smells good.I wash my hair daily so this is for every day use. I have short hair,but if you have longer hair you will need the conditioner.If your hair is short-you may can forgo it.My hair is fine so its not a must have.But I will say that my hair feels different when I do use it.&lt;br /&gt;Try a small bottle and see what it does for you.It is definitely worth the price for this shampoo! In this world-you get what you pay for.And this is the case here!!!</li>
    <li> just love this product...[[ASIN:B001OVQSJG Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo &amp; Special Conditioner Duo 33.8 oz (1 Liter)]][[ASIN:B001OVQSJG Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo &amp; Special Conditioner Duo 33.8 oz (1 Liter)]]</li>
    <li> While the product itself is as described and expected, the packaging was the issue. The bottles arrived in a plastic bag which had product spilled in it. After cleaning the bottles up, the pumps wouldn&#x27;t come out of the cap, making them unusable.</li>
    <li> I HAVE HAD THE SHAMPOO BEFORE AND I LOVE THE TINGLING FEELING IT GIVES TO MY SCALP. I WILL BUY THE SHAMPOO AGAIN. I DO NOT USE THE SHAMPOO AS OFTEN, BUT I LIKE</li>
    <li> cool~~~but smell is so so</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis on scalp and this shampoo and conditioner feels great on it.also smells amazing</li>
    <li> I like the minty feeling but the shampoo/conditioner dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> My son has been u as ing this product for years and I could not find it locally now that I&#x27;ve moved</li>
    <li> I think this product is not authentic. It left my scalp VERY DRY AND ITCHY after I used it and it did not perform as advertised. I think the supplier of this product is diluting it or something. I hope that amazon fixes this.</li>
    <li> what more could you want in a shampoo/conditioner? love the large size bottles; easy to use in shower and less time spent buying shampoo.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing! My scalp &amp; hair feel so clean &amp; refreshed after using this. I use a cleansing shampoo once or twice a month just because I&#x27;m really picky about my hair &amp; want to make sure there&#x27;s no build up, but PM Tea Tree doesn&#x27;t seem to leave much guck behind.</li>
    <li> Love it! Invigorating!!!</li>
    <li> I have used the shampoo before this order and loved it. I like the price and the quantity on amazon though better than my local store.</li>
    <li> Cost was a little less than buying in a salon. Our family loves this shampoo and conditioner. Free shipping and handling and I didn&#x27;t have to leave my house.</li>
    <li> Cannot get the squirter on the conditioner unlocked.  The shampoo was also difficult to unlock but finally did by accident.  Have not succeeded in doing so with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> very good product.  had a little issue with packaging had two of them arrive broken.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I use this shampoo and conditioner because it smells, feels, and works great! Also, the teatree repels ticks and mosquitoes, which works well for me, since I work in the woods</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair tingle in an awesome way. And makes it nice and soft too!</li>
    <li> My husband and I love this product and hope they never discontinue it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Stops itching on scalp and smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive and does not prevent scalp acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to prevent scalp acne I would definitely suggest trying a different product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff. I used to use PertPlus with the cooling agent but this stuff blows it out of the water when it comes to the cooling effect. I have jewfro type of hair and if I do not dry my hair immediately, it leaves my hair soft for hours. The ladies will want to rub their hands through your hair with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews saying it is fake or watered down, but felt safe ordering the Prime option.  I purchased from amazon earlier this year and it was the real stuff.  The new bottle is not.</li>
    <li> excellent transaction + Product</li>
    <li> Really great for relief of itching scalp.</li>
    <li> made my hair very dull and lifeless. it feels so good when you wash it, but ultimately my hair is worse off!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I will use in my hair. Leaves the hair feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> It feels fantastic just sitting on my scalp, leaves my hair feeling and looking great and takes so little product (I&#x27;m a dude so not that much hair to wash) that these bottles ought to last a LONG time.</li>
    <li> The product is very minty-smelling. Leaves a nice tingly feeling after shower. I originally bought this product to relieve myself of my dry scalp and i see a reduction of it but it is still remaining.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve used it for years!! It feels cool to my scalp and it keeps my hair and scalp fresh and flake free. I find it to be a better alternative to using a more chemical shampoo to deal with potential dandruff.</li>
    <li> My fiancé and I have very dry scalps and we have both tried almost every shampoo and conditioner on the market.  None of them has helped to do any repairs or add moisture to our parched scalps.  My fiancé&#x27;s hairdresser of 12 yrs recently recommended that she try Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner and now it is a necessity in our house.  When applied, the shampoo leaves a tingle feeling that just feels clean.  This is definitely the BEST shampoo ever.</li>
    <li> I have sever itchy scalp and dandruff.  I have been using this with conjunction with a clarifying shampoo to keep down the buildup and it is truly worth its weight in gold.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but it arrived with the pump broken on the conditioner and I had to clean up the bottles first and the pump doesn&#x27;t work at all on the conditioner. Kind of overpriced for a broken container.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner however has a very awkward smell. Real earthy and &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; not nasty, but actual dirt type smell. I&#x27;ve had this product before and it has never had that scent. Probably won&#x27;t get it again cause it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky all day long.  It is not too  hydrating and not too dry.</li>
    <li> I got this because i was having scalp issues and red that Tea Tree Oil helps and it really does. I love how it tingles so you know it is doing something. It also makes my hair smooth and shiny. I am hooked!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as advertised.  I exercise often and sweat profusely  This product is very refreshing and keeps your scalp clean too</li>
    <li> Best product for thick and long hair.</li>
    <li> I meant to buy the Lavender Mint moisturizing shampoo instead of this, but this style wasn&#x27;t bad.  It had a menthol feeling, where you could feel it working when you used it.  Like a cool sensation.  Still like the way the Lavender Mint version smells better.  Both will burn your eyes if you get it in them.</li>
    <li> I love the way these make my hair feel, smell, and look. This are my favorite shampoo and conditioner set. I use it on my beard too and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> i have really dry hair and bleach it alot well i bought this and after a week my hair is soft shiny and so light weight my hair fall inbetween my shoulder blades. i highly reccomend this product, it will take a week to work bc it gets built up residue out also love the minty feeling its also helped my hair grow faster.</li>
    <li> Its good so far. Not great. Unfortunately my husband thinks it smells like toothpaste. Im also a little disappointed that I could have bought it cheaper at a JC Penney salon.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell and how well the shampoo and conditioner work in my hair.  I would have given the product 5 stars but the bag was leaking when I opened the box.  Hate to spend this much on shampoo and have it spill everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown medium thickness hair, and sometimes dandruff.  Since using this shampoo I have noticed that, in addition to it being invigorating and refreshing, a deal of increased volume, and less dandruff, which I do not have an extreme problem with.  So I would give it five stars because it has helped over standard off the shelf shampoos to increase volume and help my scalp in general.  In addition it is a good deal considering you may pay about 1.5 times as much for the same volume, but in the end it is worth it if you care for your hair, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Smells great cleaned my hair good and felt great. It is my first time using the product so i have no idea if its real or fake but it was odd that there was absolutely no tracking info, The tops were possibly tampered with considering the scotch tape on them and the shampoo in particular was a rather messy bottle.</li>
    <li> my husband has tried everything he can with over-the-counter products for his dandruff issues.  over the last year, his dandruff got worse, when he&#x27;d come home from work he&#x27;d have what looked like a light snow fall on his shoulders!  even in summer.  i don&#x27;t know what other people think, but i find that totally gross.  i got some of this stuff after talking to my own hair stylist.  this stuff has worked.  it&#x27;s not 100% but it&#x27;s pretty close!  instead of the snow-fall look, now it&#x27;s a few dandruff pieces here-and-there.  This is just after 3 washings!  So, I&#x27;m hopeful that it will continue to clear up.</li>
    <li> Great products to keep your hair healthy, shiny and your scalp dandruff free. Made with tea tree oil that gives you great benefits. I have been using these products for about three years.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Works as expected.  I will order more when these run out. What more can one say really.</li>
    <li> I had issues with my scalp, it was actually &amp;#34;inflammed&amp;#34; according to my doctor and I used this product a couple times in combination with another paul mitchell product and so far so good!</li>
    <li> The scent is very minty, and you can feel that your hair is refreshed. That being said, it is very pricey, and I think there may be other shampoos that may have \\&quot;more bang for your buck\\&quot;. But at the end of the day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have been using this product for more than two years! I love it! The styling gel is great too!</li>
    <li> 1. I use this product every day. I love it! Love the tingle, love the smell, love the way my hair feels after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;2. The conditioner is not the Tea Tree Special conditioner that goes with the shampoo. What you get is Tea Tree Hair and Body LEAVE IN CONDITIONER!&lt;br /&gt;3. Ordered this twice hoping the second time I would receive the correct stuff. The packaging is not great. The first time I ordered it the cap was not screwed on and the shampoo had spilled! Second time the shampoo cap was actually broken. Not to mention, I received the wrong conditioner AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;4. Would not buy from these people ever again!&lt;br /&gt;5. I gave 3 star because I love the product, but hate the sellers &amp;#34;Beauty In Style&amp;#34;. If you want damaged, leaked, or wrong goods Beauty In Style is the seller for you!</li>
    <li> These are not the right product. Not official Paul Mitchell Tea Tree. I have been using the real stuff for years. I would normally get it at my salon but they went out of business. I went to amazon and little did I know they are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I noticed the smell was off.&lt;br /&gt;noticed the tingle sensation was different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my girlfriend complained about it drying her hair out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway if you compare the real bottle next to the fake it very obvious that the bottle is fake. you can see the mis-prints in the writing.</li>
    <li> I used Nioxin for a long time, as I loved the scent and the effects of it, but I have come off that product due to price and availability. I came across this product one day with a hairstylist and found I really liked it. It keeps my hair healthy and shiny, and smells good for a man&#x27;s hair product. My personal hairstylist also says it is a great product, even if she doesn&#x27;t sell it herself. I have had no problems with Amazon shipping this item to me in general, but one delivery did have a broken pump tip so contact customer service if you have this problem or keep your old pump tips from previous bottles as I did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 months, I dyed my hair the day before I used it, and my hair has grown an inch.. It&#x27;s actually great. I refuse to use any other shampoo or conditioner</li>
    <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner set. Doesn&#x27;t smell girly. My boys will use</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I have severe dandruff often. Well, I used to until I tried this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d use Head &amp; Shoulders with Pyrithione Zinc, and it would calm it down for a couple days, then come back. I tried Selsun Blue with Selenium Sulfide, and that stuff did work at first, but then it stop working. According to what a dermatologist told me, the fungus/bacteria that causes the dandruff will gain a resistance to the active ingredient over time. That must have been what happened. Neutrogena&#x27;s Coal Tar ingredient also did little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had been hearing about Tea Tree oil and its benefits in combating dandruff. The problem is that this ingredient is rather hard to find in shampoos - I know you can find it in the pure extract form. Most dandruff shampoos either have Pyrithione Zinc, Selenium Sulfide, Salycic Acid, or Coal Tar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found this stuff, and decided to try it (both the shampoo &amp; conditioner). It works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you notice at first is how it has that \\&quot;cool burn\\&quot; effect like almost a menthol feeling to it. To me it lets me know it&#x27;s \\&quot;working\\&quot; and really re-invigorating the scalp. You let it sit for a few minutes after scrubbing &amp; working it in. Then rinse and apply the conditioner, which also has that same cool burning sensation, and rinse again. First thing you notice is that the itching has gone away, and so has the flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented by seeing how long after this shampooing that I could go without shampooing again until the dandruff came back. I went roughly a week without touching the hair before any flakes came back, which was amazing. And the dandruff was minor. Of course, this is intended to be used at least every other day to ensure its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently looking for any other Tea Tree Oil shampoos that aren&#x27;t as expensive - but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re as effective. Axe has a Tea Tree shampoo for men, and Organix Hydrating Tea Tree Mint I&#x27;ve also tried.</li>
    <li> My stylist kind of conned me into buying the product.  I was reluctant because I had tried many salon products and didn&#x27;t find that they were worth the expense.  My hair is very dry, to the point where I can only wash it every two or three days or else it turns into hay.  I was nervous about the Tea Tree because I had heard that it was very drying, but when I bought the shampoo there was a buy one get one half off sale and I also purchased the Lavender mint conditioner.  It is the perfect combination of products for my finicky hair.  The Tea Tree shampoo feels amazing on your scalp.  Its like taking a drink of cold water after chewing really minty gum! It strips off any buildup on your hair leaving it feeling really light and clean.  This took care of my issue with a little dandruff after the first use.  The Lavender Mint conditioner keeps my hair from turning to hay even in really humid conditions! My hair has never felt, looked, or smelled better! I will never go back!</li>
    <li> excellent product smells great and gives you a cool feeling, but pricey,</li>
    <li> My boyfriend gets a lot of dandruff. When he first uses this stuff it really helps him control the dandruff for more than a few months. A year later his dandruff came back so I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo/conditioner combo were the reason his dandruff disappear in the first place! I personally don&#x27;t like it because although they smell very good (i love tea tree), I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling after shampooing and the combo really dries out my hair. In addition, I am not a fan of the pump - I can see that there is a lot of conditioner left in the bottle but because of the consistency of the conditioner, the pump can&#x27;t pump out the conditioner well.</li>
    <li> BEST PRODUCT for hair. leaves your head crystal clear, feeling fresh and clean. never leave the shower without it.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Hair nice a clean and fresh.  Makes you scalp feel cool..(yes cool like a winter breeze).  I would prefer not have to take out a loan to buy it though.</li>
    <li> Still the best shampoo for my Mexican hair. My hair is full and thick, I rely on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Product is OK. Package leaking on arrival &amp; dispensing pumps do not work. Had to pour it out to use.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo/conditioner based off of the previous reviews. I have very dry hair and dry scalp and thought I would spend the extra money to buy a product that would help. This shampoo/conditioner DOES smell good and DOES tingle on the scalp, but it still leaves my hair and scalp very dry. I have found another product that is better for my hair and more hydrating that is half the price.</li>
    <li> Scrub a dub dub you and this product in the tub. After using this shampoo &amp; conditioner you feel like a millions bucks $. It leaves your hair so sparkly and shiny people will think you are Paul Mitchell himself! My hair is so silky smooth like a lamb fresh out of a nice grooming session from his loyal farmer. People have often asked me if this shampoo is from Amazon, and I say yes: THE AMAZON RIVER. But nah, I just tell them I got it online from Amazon.com rather than the vast Amazon river in South America. Mmmmm.... will be the expression from your co-workers and loved ones. You will truly be the man in the workplace and you will soon get that highly deserved raise from your boss. Excellent stuff here my friends, you should buy this.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this product. He showers me with this shampoo like no other. I don&#x27;t exactly know why, I think he may be addicted. Is there a 1-800 number I could call?</li>
    <li> The shampoo is exactly as expected however in retail stores I normally buy a two pack that looks the same as this however this package contains a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; moisturizing conditioner, not he traditional conditioner I am used to getting in the combo pack.</li>
    <li> Well i read the reviews after making the purchase. this product is probably the fake, i have no idea if it is or not but it did burn my eyes a little so theres that. my recommendation is just to spend a little more cash and buy it from an official supplier</li>
    <li> Came fast.... But pumps on both shampoo bottles are broken</li>
    <li> What a wonderful product. I love the sensation it gives my scalp with the mint, and the smell is so refreshing!</li>
    <li> It is not moisturizing.  I wish I would have read the ad better.  I love the smell and am combining it with a moisturizing conditioner so that I don&#x27;t end up with breakage on my long hair.</li>
    <li> This product has an amazing smell.  It is like being at a spa.  I love this so much.  My husband uses this product.  I have used it a couple of time and loved it.  However, I am not sure yet wether it makes my hair look good.  I will update when I use more consistantly.  My husband loves it and uses it everyday.  He found this product based on a recommendation from his friend.</li>
    <li> I loved the smell and tingling it gave my scalp, but it left my hair feeling stripped and very dry</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the condition of my hair after using these Paul Mitchell products!</li>
    <li> Products were shipped with items not being secure. Leaking</li>
    <li> The smell is very strong when you put it on then very weak when its rinsed. It smells like halls throat losingers.  With in a weak my scalp was dry a flakey. It almost seems like there is shampoo in the conditioner.  There is no conditioning effect with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My wife had the same problem. Very expensive way to try out a product that is terrible for my head.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product from Supercut, and it was wonderful. I thought this would be the same product online, but it does not seem so. It is much diluter than the earlier one I had. It leaves a lot of mint on your head and did not help with dandruff and hair falling. The one I had used earlier stopped my dandruff and hair fall like a magic.  I will go and buy it from an authorized store/professional only.</li>
    <li> Packaging was great! Pumps were taped down to prevent spillage during shipping. Both bottles were placed inside a large ziplock bag in case spillage did occur. I can&#x27;t wait to try it for my dry itchy scalp! Will update this feedback in a few weeks :)</li>
    <li> This product has a light scent which is very attractive.  I like how it cleans and moisturizes my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good shampoo/conditioner package.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better experience with the different shampoos for me it&#x27;s not a bad shampoo get your hair clean smells kind a mini minty but it&#x27;s not for me I would not buy it again but maybe it&#x27;s for you I don&#x27;t know</li>
    <li> So in case you didn&#x27;t know, dandruff and dry scalp are two different conditions, and should be treated in different ways.  I only say this because I used head and shoulders anti-dandruff shampoo for about 20 years before a hair stylist finally corrected me by saying &amp;#34;if you don&#x27;t have large yellow flakes, you may be using the wrong product&amp;#34;.  Since switching to this Shampoo and Conditioner combo I&#x27;ve had noticeably less flaking, and supposedly it&#x27;s better for my hair. I will leave that to the experts to figure out.  All I know is I like the smell, and the tingle I get from using it.  Thumbs up from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This will not solve all of your dry scalp issues.  Make sure you are drinking plenty of water, and don&#x27;t overwash your hair.  I still get flaking, but only when I don&#x27;t hydrate during the cold months.</li>
    <li> I like the shampoo, but the conditioner is so-so. I now use different conditioner from Costco to go with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Paul Mithcell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special Shampoo is an invigorating hair wash that&#x27;s effective at cleansing normal to oily hair.  It smells and feels wonderful, especially during the hot summer months.  If you enjoy using tea tree oil, then you&#x27;ll love this shampoo.  Sure it&#x27;s expensive, but it actually works as advertised.  If you have dry hair, you&#x27;ll probably want to look elsewhere.  But for everyone else curious about this product, you might enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
    <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo will leave your hair as dry as a bundle of straw. I was very disappointed. Both the shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair, leaving it feeling coarse to the touch and full of tangles. I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair- not too oily or dry, so I thought these products would work for me, but I was very wrong. I wanted to try this product because of its decent pricing and favorable reviews, but I must move on to another brand.</li>
    <li> love this product, it is the only thing I have been able to find that helps my dry scalp!</li>
    <li> We like the smell and feel</li>
    <li> I use this regularly. Great tingle, leaves my hair clean. Rinses out very easily and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note, the scent of the conditioner takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes well with the moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I am a Paul Mitchell student . none of our ACTUAL products are sold anywhere besides our salons . this is a complete scam !!</li>
    <li> No problem. Everything was perfectly fine!</li>
    <li> I need a more nourishing shampoo. I have dry hair. It smells good. I like tea tree products, i wish it was good for my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I actually like this product. I can&#x27;t say that it smells that great, kinda reminds me of a urinal cake. But it works well with my hair. The seller wrapped this up well, bu not well enough, it still came a mess. There was conditioner all over the place and the pumps were broken. Which now sucks becuase every time I need to use them I have to try to juggle the bottle and the pump and get shampoo or conditioner out of the bottle all at once. If I had a new pumps that work, I might change my rating.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this shampoo. It lathers nicely without using too much.&lt;br /&gt;Your scalp feels so tingly and clean as you lather and rinse. It made my hair very shiny. Worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are:&lt;br /&gt;It took a long time to receive the product.&lt;br /&gt;It strips the color from your hair. Although I may need to blame the box dye I used for that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Lasts and lasts. My only gripe, and it&#x27;s a known issue, is the shipping. If we could talk the manufacturer into using those little foil seals like on very condiment you ever buy these guys wouldn&#x27;t leak. Shipper tried valiantly to individually wrap and protect bottles. Tiny bit of leakage , nothing to get excited about.</li>
    <li> Deep cleaning.  Does not strip color.  Hair stylist uses something similar  -  but only conditioner.  Have been using this for over a year!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. I bought this because of the Tea Tree because it was suggested to help with my itchy scalp. It did the trick and has a very good smell. I bought this almost 1 1/2 years ago and just hit the bottom and needed to reorder. Not bad for shampoo and conditioner of this type under $50. That&#x27;s a tad over $2.50 a month. A lot more expensive had I bought from a local store.</li>
    <li> I ordered this last year, and I still have half a bottle left.&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;You really get your moneys worth on this item.</li>
    <li> When my husband cut off his deadlocks he had a dry scalp. I noticed a difference immediately after using this product. By the end of the week his scalp cleared up.  We both enjoy the tingling feeling tea tree gives off as well.</li>
    <li> Really like this product and at a great price</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so far the best shampoo and conditioner that I had tried in long time. It makes u feel ur hair clean and fresh, leaving its looking healthy and soft. I&#x27;m in love. :)</li>
    <li> My scalp is so in love with this shampoo and conditioner. One wash was all it took and I was hooked. Good-bye itchy scalp, you will not be missed! This product does strip your hair, and can be drying if you don&#x27;t moisturize. I suggest using Argan oil to moisturize after conditioning. Put it right on while your hair is still wet. Your hair soaks it all up and does not leave your hair greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo and conditioner scent is that of sweet peppermint. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have been using this for years</li>
    <li> The best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> when I received my package it was leaking. luckily I caught it before it was necessary for return. please write fragile on items with liquids. I think the carriers would take care of them a little better.  If its not the carriers maybe there can be a way to keep liquids cool so they don&#x27;t spill out...? Or it could have been the packaging the top was loose when I attempted to clean the bottle, pictures were taken if you would like to see them.....but its all just a thought</li>
    <li> great shampoo for dry scalp issues</li>
    <li> This combo is way better than expected! My scalp feels alive again. Shampoo and conditioner are very good and I am a happy customer. 5 Stars!</li>
    <li> I thought that to lose the itch I would have to sacrifice the benefits my salon shampoo have me. But no. This stuff is amazing. The minty tingle feels great My hair is loving it and it&#x27;s even color safe. Soft, manageable, and so easy to style. If I had known it was this good, I would have switched over ages ago.</li>
    <li> They sent me two conditioners, instead of the set. I tried contacting them through Amazon, but never heard back.</li>
    <li> I like that this shampoo and conditioner works great. My hair is always smoother after and smells great. I also like how it makes my whole head tingle.</li>
    <li> For what its worth it was packaged and sealed to perfection. Words of wisdom make sure you arent carrying anything else along with the package because it is rather heavy. Very pleased</li>
    <li> Love this!! Helps with dry scalp! Came packaged well and free of leaks!</li>
    <li> I really feel this product has been working on me. I had dry scalp for the passed few weeks, due to the winter conditions. This product has made my scalp feel a lot better and after using it the minty feel relieves the urge to want to itch. Love it!</li>
    <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much stronger than the real product. It totally burns my eyes even though I don&#x27;t get it in my eyes.  The conditioner does not condition at all, in fact my hair is more tangled after I use it. The conditioner pump also does not work at all. Very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This product has a strong mint smell but smell good. Its really a good cleanser for your hair.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, and I think it is the best I have used at controlling dandruff.  It smells great, really invigorating in the morning.  This is a good deal for a large amount of shampoo and conditioner.  Much less expensive then buying at a salon.</li>
    <li> Great product now that I am not coloring my hair, since it does have a tendency to strip color quickly.</li>
    <li> i have been a paul mitchell hair product user since the 1980s.  the green tee tree line is one of my faves (along with awapuhi) for it&#x27;s invigorating scent and potential anti-dandruff properties.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo for my husband. Love the smell. I like the big sturdy bottles. We will buy this product again</li>
    <li> We started using this shampoo and conditioner BC of head lice going around at school! I have one child that would get it every time! I did some research and found that head lice does not like tea tree oil! I bought it and have never had any more issues with head lice!</li>
    <li> These are relatively large bottles, but the price is just so high. There&#x27;s mint in the shampoo and conditioner, so you&#x27;ll feel that tingly sensation when you apply it and massage your head, but make sure that it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes because it&#x27;ll burn like crazy! The good thing is that you only need to use only a few ounces each time you wash your hair, so it can last longer. My boyfriend is the one who really uses it all the time. His hair is short and a bit coarse. It feels a bit softer after a month since he started using it... let me say it again... it feels A BIT softer. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s worth $55+. It smells lovely and it&#x27;s by Paul Mitchell, but man it&#x27;s costly. Not worth it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check with beauty stores or salons that sell hair products. Sometimes they have &amp;#34;buy one, get one half off&amp;#34; deals or coupons (even for Paul Mitchell) that you might save more money with them than on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been using these products for years.  I like the mint smell and the tingling sensation on my scalp.  Cleans great and leaves my hair soft and smelling great.</li>
    <li> I love these, really and truly. As someone with a chronically dry scalp, I&#x27;ve found that this combo really helps to clear up my skin and relieve my dry, irritated scalp. The peppermint smell is strong and incredible (though I imagine if you don&#x27;t like the smell of peppermint, this may be a huge turn-off). The smell sticks around on my hair for days, and it&#x27;s wonderful! The only reason I give this 4 stars isn&#x27;t because of the quality of the product, but simply because of a bit of a shipping problem. When it arrived, the conditioner was broken at the top and had leaked all over the shampoo and the box. Amazon did however, being as wonderful as they are, respond to my inquiry within the 24 hour period and handled the case. Other than that little hiccup, great product! And for the price, it&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper than buying an 8oz single (conditioner or shampoo) for 30 bucks.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for two reasons 1st because I was told it will help prevent lice and 2nd I was told it was good for dandruff. Makes my head feel tingly and minty wich is kinda weird but it smells awesome been using it for about a month now and so far my dauhgter has had any lice (had and outbreak at school about a month ago) and my dandruff problem is so much better.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years. Love the &#x27;tingle&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Have used Paul Mitchell Shampoo with Awapui off and on for years.  Love it.  Noticed the new Tea Tree Special Shampoo and Conditioner.  Had developed an itchy scalp this winter and decided to try it (read a review that it might help).&lt;br /&gt;On day one, I noticed I hadn&#x27;t been scratching scalp.  Hooray!  Day two, scalp felt &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; (best I can describe it).&lt;br /&gt;Noticed my hair seems to have more shine and bounce.  It&#x27;s only been two days!  Scent seemed a trifle strong at first.  Becomes a very light scent in a short time.  So worth it!</li>
    <li> Greatest hair product I&#x27;ve found.  It was recommended to me by my son.  Works for him; now it works for me too!</li>
    <li> I have been having itchy scalp for so many years. This shampoo do not completely stop my itching. It does decreases my itchiness by 90% which is amazing. I don&#x27;t need to depend on dr prescribed steroid cream anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for years. I got the Conditioner this time, but don&#x27;t use it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember years ago getting this for a lot less, and it was thicker then too. But I still get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like it in the winter where I use it as a full body wash on my dry, itchy skin. The tea tree and peppermint really relieve the itchiness. Just need to follow up with some lotion so skin doesn&#x27;t dry up again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to wash with after I&#x27;ve been around animals I am allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even started experimenting. Mixing peppermint and tea tree oils with a basic lotion, but I haven&#x27;t gotten the right combo yet that matches how well this works.</li>
    <li> Packaging was sloppy, and the shampoo had opened and leaked during shipping, I had not considered this being bootleg or imitation... because who knew? I can confirm that when i get my hair washed at the end of a cut and they use this product (purchased wholesale direct ) the feeling and the freshness are much more present. Though I don&#x27;t know if i have had positive &amp;#34;results&amp;#34; i do enjoy the product, though a little less after realizing the possibility of it being imitation.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner.  I had been having a problem with an itching scalp.  Using these products stopped the itch.  So happy that I heard about these products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo and conditioner first time, I hope I received the correct stuff. The packaging wasn&#x27;t great. The first time I ordered it the cap was not screwed on and the shampoo and conditioner had spilled all over in the box! The shampoo cap was actually broken. I&#x27;m going to order and try again.</li>
    <li> Love the tingliness this product gives you after letting it sit in your hair for a bit.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance. Makes my scalp tingle and refreshed. People at work have been saying my hair shines.</li>
    <li> I struggled with dandruff for the better part of 2 years. Tried every single dandruff shampoo out there to no avail and was about to give up when I ran into these beauties. I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil in them that does it. Not only has my dandruff been kept completely in check since I started using this combo but it has really made a difference on my hair. It looks and feels stronger and better. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this combo product... Thanks to Amazon for shipping it problem free this time (first time the bottle leaked).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only shampoo we are happy with...</li>
    <li> Works great for people with dandruff. Feels great, leaves hair feeling clean and silky. Smells like a cross between mint and eucalyptus, but in a good way. Have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I have to use tea tree every winter cause my hair gets insanely dry and lifeless. I have used this product for many years</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and then some.  The combination of tea tree and lavender has an amazing effect on the senses, as well as being an excellent hair product.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome! I&#x27;ve had dandruff problems and my hair is usually VERY rough, this shampoo has helped me dramatically and I haven&#x27;t had any flakes! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> smells fantastic but don&#x27;t give enough moisture imo...</li>
    <li> I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner.  They make your scalp feel AWESOME!  It provides a cooling sensation and aroma that somehow relaxes you.  The feeling lingers a while after rinsing-out but.....you won&#x27;t want to rinse it out!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo and Conditioner for over four years now.  I had a difficult time finding in salons after moving so I hesitantly purchased online.  I should&#x27;ve heeded the Paul Mitchell warning only to buy from an authorized salon or they cannot guarantee authenticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the shampoo I noticed that it had an unfamiliar chemical smell.  After using for a month, it has dried out my hair and given me dandruff.  I&#x27;ll be throwing this out and either hunting down a salon that has it or finding a new product.</li>
    <li> Having used this identical Tea Tree shampoo for many years previous, I took a break from their usage until recently being treated to it again at a hairdresser. The refreshing feeling that the tea tree leaves in your scalp as it washes over a sweaty summer-drenched lock of hair is unrivaled. The cooling sensation is exactly what one needs deep into a humid summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular version of the product, however, fails to deliver this amazing cooling sensation which is the best aspect of this shampoo/conditioner. Somehow, I feel that either the large quantity size or a long storage duration has somehow affected the active ingredients in this shampoo, robbing it of its cooling touch. Smell and consistency seems to be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say to attempt to purchase this great brand of shampoo/conditioner from elsewhere, and in a smaller quantity size in order to fully experience the best out of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please spare a click to let Amazon know that this review has been helpful for you! If it has, of course. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I found out about this combination after visiting the local hair salon.  I noticed that after every visit my hear looked and felt great.  I first started to purchase it from them but it was difficult to make it by their shop to pick it up.  I found these on here online and encouraged my wife to purchase them for my birthday.  All I can say is wow.  I don&#x27;t think I will have to get any more shampoo or conditioner for at least another 12 months.  My hair and my beard have never been happier, or softer for that matter.  What a great product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dandruff problem. It has not eliminated the problem, but has helped a great deal! It used to be so bad, I had thick scaly HUGE flakes, and I would leave a trail everywhere I went. Using this and a vinegar rinse a few times a week, it hasn&#x27;t been as dry and itchy! Smells great, and the tingle is nice!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent and fantastic tingly sensation. However, used too often will dry out your scalp.</li>
    <li> Was Leary about spending that much money on shampoo and conditioner but it will easily last  6-12 months with me and wife using on a daily basis</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel and smell great- Got this because I get a very dry scalp, but this works great.</li>
    <li> Oh its the tingle!!! Love the shampoo, and the conditioner. Both tingle so nicely and leave my hair feeling awesome.</li>
    <li> Not every product in the shower is worth talking about, but this stuff is really great. For either dry or normal scalps it works wonders. Plus the aroma is like having a cup of coffee while showering, gets you up and ready for the day.</li>
    <li> If you have oily skin/scalp or get acne on the scalp, this stuff is for you!  I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s and my hair/scalp is still an oil slick :(  My stylist also told me that acne on the scalp leads to scarring, which is part of the reason my hair is thinning :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these daily to keep the breakouts at bay. It really helps.  And don&#x27;t let the price scare you, a little dab will do ya for both the shampoo and conditioner, so they really last :)</li>
