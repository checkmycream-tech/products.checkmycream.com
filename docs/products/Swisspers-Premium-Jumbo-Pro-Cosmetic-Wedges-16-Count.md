### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are the best for applying makeup and face lotion.</li>
      <li>The wedges are not the best; they crumble and break apart</li>
      <li>Great value!</li>
      <li>Perfect for applying concealers and foundation.  </li>
      <li>These are great for applying liquid foundation.  </li>
      <li>Great for blending foundation and blush.</li>
      <li>Great for someone wanting to put makeup on a good amount of people.</li>
      <li>so this was perfect for me :)</li>
      <li>These make-up sponges are much more porous than any others I have ever used or purchased... in my life!  </li>
      <li>So much better than cotton!  </li>
      <li>These are fine, quality is great, just not the size I was expecting..</li>
      <li>and you need more than one to put on makeup or remove…cotton balls work better!</li>
      <li>I thought these would be a lot better since the description said that they didn&#x27;t absorb makeup.</li>
      <li>probably won&#x27;t buy them again since I can get more for my money elsewhere, but in a pinch these will do the job.</li>
      <li>For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
      <li>I wish that it had more</li>
      <li>Will not need to replace for a while so you can spend more money on cosmetics what can be better.</li>
      <li>I like these sponges because they blend your make up and for the most part</li>
      <li>Love that its latex-free and makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
      <li>they are so soft on the skin&amp;#62; It works great for nails too.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because they are latex free.</li>
      <li>Theyre soft , good for blending.</li>
      <li>soft and good quality</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had expected, work perfectly in applying Kryolan AquaColor Halloween makeup</li>
      <li>These are ok, not the best but not the worse quality</li>
      <li>I had bought these in a local store and loved them.  </li>
      <li>Now keep in mind I am using these for an artistic application, not for makeup.  </li>
      <li>They come apart with the very first use and continue to break apart</li>
      <li>They really help to smooth and even out the foundation.  </li>
      <li>The whole point of using a cosmetic wedge is to smooth everything over, not irritate your skin and soak up all your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>use some of these and they are so strong and sturdy it seems you can use them more than once, just was immediately after use and let air dry.</li>
      <li>My make up did not apply right with these.</li>
      <li>wish I&#x27;d spent a couple extra dollars and gone for the good ones!</li>
      <li>Consequently, they soak up too much foundation AND almost immediately (by day 3!)</li>
      <li>I bought these to apply foundation, but they&#x27;re pretty flimsy.  </li>
      <li>They soak up way too much makeup, for my liking, and I found that they really don&#x27;t rinse well, either.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Initial review: While I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call these &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; sized since at the widest part they are only 1 1/4 inches they are adequate for makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So much better than your average wedge.  </li>
      <li>Perfectly soft and actually better than the more expensive singular one I purchased before.</li>
      <li>but they are normal size.</li>
      <li>Do NOT waste your money on this!</li>
      <li>They are much more substantial and longer lasting than other cosmetic wedges I have tried.  </li>
      <li>They not only absorb makeup, but they also don&#x27;t apply the makeup very well to my skin.</li>
      <li>Soft sponges.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re large enough and dense enough to do the job and you won&#x27;t get foundation all over your hands.</li>
      <li>You get a lot for cheap, but they&#x27;re a little rough on your face.  </li>
      <li>Typically, I would pick these up at Target or Walmart since they offer latex free wedges for about half the price.</li>
      <li>Too much trouble to return, could not think of an alternate use for them... ended up tossing the whole bag (and writing this unfavorable review!).</li>

<li> I felt they are too small and very foamy.</li>
<li> Total waste - just buy the slightly more expensive make up sponges and have piece of mind instead of pieces of sponge everywhere.</li>
<li> They do the job but are different from wedges previously purchased in store.</li>
<li> These are literally the worst-&lt;br /&gt;Rough, porous, hard on sensitive skin, and suck up all your foundation.</li>
<li> Really was hoping they were the larger sturdy ones, but they are small and weak.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m told they&#x27;re a bit rough on the skin compared to other wedges.</li>
<li> But, I was shopping online for other things and found these to be convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Just as expected, lots of make up wedges!</li>
<li> Did not spread foundation on evenly like other brands I have used.</li>
<li> Warning to other gals:  </li>
<li> imagine all the other sponges that has all the build up on them and even though you can wash them these you can toss and not worry about breakouts.</li>
<li> After wasting money on cosmetic wedges that made false claims about size and quality, I went back and ordered these.</li>
<li> Too soft and soaks up foundation makeup like crazy</li>
<li> They fall apart with hardly any pressure.</li>
<li> But I thought Jumbo would mean......</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste you money!!!</li>
<li> These are terrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Theyre soft , good for blending.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for applying face paint.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m told they&#x27;re a bit rough on the skin compared to other wedges.</li>
    <li> These are literally the worst-&lt;br /&gt;Rough, porous, hard on sensitive skin, and suck up all your foundation. The whole point of using a cosmetic wedge is to smooth everything over, not irritate your skin and soak up all your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d spent a couple extra dollars and gone for the good ones!</li>
    <li> What I received does not look like thy are jumbo sized</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the texture</li>
    <li> Warning to other gals:  These make-up sponges are much more porous than any others I have ever used or purchased... in my life!  Consequently, they soak up too much foundation AND almost immediately (by day 3!) fall apart, i.e., tiny pieces have been crumbling off.  Too much trouble to return, could not think of an alternate use for them... ended up tossing the whole bag (and writing this unfavorable review!).</li>
    <li> Just as expected, lots of make up wedges! Great value!</li>
    <li> They do the job but are different from wedges previously purchased in store. The material seems different. I think it&#x27;s because they are latex free. Didn&#x27;t see that in description. I am using them but prefer the regular ones.</li>
    <li> These are great for applying liquid foundation.  They really help to smooth and even out the foundation.  I also use these to remove my eye makeup (with some liquid eye makeup remover).  So much better than cotton!  I&#x27;ve found that they can be mashed out and reused a couple of times.</li>
    <li> These are the best for applying makeup and face lotion.</li>
    <li> I like these sponges because they blend your make up and for the most part is you can just toss them imagine all the other sponges that has all the build up on them and even though you can wash them these you can toss and not worry about breakouts.</li>
    <li> You get a lot for cheap, but they&#x27;re a little rough on your face.  For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect much more.</li>
    <li> Now keep in mind I am using these for an artistic application, not for makeup.  But I thought Jumbo would mean......well, Jumbo. These are fine, quality is great, just not the size I was expecting..</li>
    <li> Too soft and soaks up foundation makeup like crazy so that is wasteful. Did not spread foundation on evenly like other brands I have used.</li>
    <li> I use these to paint gradient colors on my nails.</li>
    <li> These are big and porous.  I like the smaller size ones that are smoother too.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money!!! Even the $2 I paid for these was not with it. They come apart with the very first use and continue to break apart so you get maybe two uses. Total waste - just buy the slightly more expensive make up sponges and have piece of mind instead of pieces of sponge everywhere.</li>
    <li> they are so soft on the skin&amp;#62; It works great for nails too.  I wish that it had more but they are normal size.</li>
    <li> I thought these would be a lot better since the description said that they didn&#x27;t absorb makeup. They not only absorb makeup, but they also don&#x27;t apply the makeup very well to my skin.</li>
    <li> I had bought these in a local store and loved them.  When I couldn&#x27;t find them locally again, I found them on Amazon.  They are much more substantial and longer lasting than other cosmetic wedges I have tried.  Perfect for applying concealers and foundation.  You can also wash them to extend their use.</li>
    <li> Great for someone wanting to put makeup on a good amount of people. For yourself, I would recommend just buying a brush or beauty blender (dupe too!). I wouldn&#x27;t want to use my beauty blender over and over again on different people so this was perfect for me :)</li>
    <li> use some of these and they are so strong and sturdy it seems you can use them more than once, just was immediately after use and let air dry. Will not need to replace for a while so you can spend more money on cosmetics what can be better.</li>
    <li> So much better than your average wedge.  Love that its latex-free and makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
    <li> The wedges are not the best; they crumble and break apart and you need more than one to put on makeup or remove…cotton balls work better! That&#x27;s a shame!</li>
    <li> These are ok, not the best but not the worse quality</li>
    <li> The texture wasn&#x27;t what I thought.</li>
    <li> Soft sponges. Like them</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had expected, work perfectly in applying Kryolan AquaColor Halloween makeup</li>
    <li> Great for blending foundation and blush. Perfectly soft and actually better than the more expensive singular one I purchased before.</li>
    <li> These are terrible. They fall apart with hardly any pressure.</li>
    <li> After wasting money on cosmetic wedges that made false claims about size and quality, I went back and ordered these. These do what the others claim. They&#x27;re large enough and dense enough to do the job and you won&#x27;t get foundation all over your hands.</li>
    <li> I bought these to apply foundation, but they&#x27;re pretty flimsy.  I&#x27;ve used two and now they&#x27;re just sitting in my dresser.  Id recommend trying a different brand.</li>
    <li> I didnt care for these. I felt they are too small and very foamy. My make up did not apply right with these.</li>
    <li> What can you say about a cosmetic wedge?  It applies make up!  Job well done!</li>
    <li> Really was hoping they were the larger sturdy ones, but they are small and weak.</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money on this!</li>
    <li> soft and good quality</li>
    <li> Update: I initially gave these a 3 star review but am downgrading them to 2 stars. They soak up way too much makeup, for my liking, and I found that they really don&#x27;t rinse well, either. I am tossing them out and will move on to something different...or go back to using my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial review: While I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call these &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; sized since at the widest part they are only 1 1/4 inches they are adequate for makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these as an add-on item for $2.16. Typically, I would pick these up at Target or Walmart since they offer latex free wedges for about half the price. But, I was shopping online for other things and found these to be convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably won&#x27;t buy them again since I can get more for my money elsewhere, but in a pinch these will do the job.</li>
