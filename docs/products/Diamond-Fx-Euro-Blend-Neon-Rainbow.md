      <li>They are very bright and beautiful though, even under normal light they are excellent quality paints, I have even slept in them and they look pretty much the same the next day, even dancing won&#x27;t melt them away</li>
      <li>I typically apply this cake with a cut sponge or dauber with excellent results!</li>
      <li>I painted their faces with this really easy and quick.</li>
      <li>Worth money!</li>
      <li>I did research on different ones and this one had good reviews.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s not glow in the dark, but looks super vibrant during the day and good black lights.</li>
      <li>I was terrified of buying something that might not ACTUALLY glow in blacklight, but I put few black lights up and showed up painted, and the colors were super bright and super glowy.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t crease, and they stay vibrant.</li>
      <li>Unlike most UV paints, it dries totally on the skin and washes off INSTANTLY with water.</li>
      <li>The color was vibrant until I decided to brush my hair - then it turned into powder and peeled off.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Really brings the wow factor for butterfly&#x27;s &amp; face masks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was a rainbow for halloween and used this on my face. Since the makeup is basically a solid block, it is hard to apply and use as paint. I ended up just adding some water and using a finger since brushes weren&#x27;t really stiff enough to pick up sufficient paint. It went on kind of sheer (probably related to using a lot of water to try to soften the paint) but was buildable.  I went to a party with blacklight, and the makeup looked AWESOME.  The colors glow exactly as neon and bright as in the picture.</li>
    <li> By far my favorite rainbow palette - but it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other darker colors and it doesn&#x27;t do too well in the heat like the regular rainbow colors.  BUT I love it and I love the Pink is on the edge for the eyes and nose and the purple is the bottom color for the forehead - It is just everyones favorite.</li>
    <li> If they ever discontinue this, I may just kill myself. I&#x27;m a blacklight body painter and though I&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of different UV paints, I always come back to this blending cake. I must own 7 of them by now, and I can&#x27;t get enough! The colors blend and layer like a DREAM, spread beautifully like watercolor, and glow like crazy. The only drawback? It doesn&#x27;t look good in the daylight, but WHO CARES! Oh, but did I mention that IT DRIES! Unlike most UV paints, it dries totally on the skin and washes off INSTANTLY with water. I&#x27;ve never done F/X work that requires so little undoing. Finished a total body shoot where my model is covered head to toe in the stuff? Most of the time it would take hours to get all that paint off. With this, I have her jump in the shower and 2 minutes later she&#x27;s TOTALLY clear. Buy it. Buy it. Buy. Then buy it again. My camera can&#x27;t capture the beauty of the layered colors, but I&#x27;ve attached some pictures.</li>
    <li> We used this for my daughter&#x27;s talent show and the swirls we painted on her arms and legs looked amazing on stage in the black light!  All her friends thought it was the coolest thing ever ;).</li>
    <li> These paints are GREAT! So bright that they almost glow during the day!!!! Super bright glow under any kind of UV/Blacklight- awesome! Great buy, great value. The paints wash off easily BUT stick very well once dried onto the skin. KUDOS!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect combination of colors even if you are not experienced, it makes your work stand out. Great Bright colors ! ! !</li>
    <li> Bought this for an Electric Run.  It was difficult to paint on (seemed clay-like) so we dipped the brushes in water and it seemed to work well!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s glow-in-the-dark birthday party. When it arrived, we just had to try it out! We set up a black light in the bathroom and started to drawn on our faces. What great colors and they glowing effect was amazing! I did think the color palette would be larger in size, but that&#x27;s not a big deal because you don&#x27;t need a lot to make a big statement!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly under the blacklight and didn&#x27;t com off even after hours of sweating and dancing.</li>
    <li> We had been pricing Neon paint and were a little worried that going with a lesser expensive paint would affect quality.  We were pleasantly surprised as it far exceeded our expectations.  It went on easily, wasn&#x27;t messy and its reflective quality in the black lights was fantastic.  It is also compact and and has all the colors you need in a neat little packet making traveling with it a breeze.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend this product.It is very small (2.5&amp;#34;X2&amp;#34;) and hard to apply. I regret the purchase and ended up not using the product for my 5K Glow Run.</li>
    <li> This item arrived to me quickly but it was very difficult to apply on the skin and it did not look good. The texture of the paint was hard and couldn&#x27;t be put on a brush. Ended up using fingers.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright colors. They showed up nicely with both regular and UV light. I knew they had to be mixed with water to use well. But the application was still a bit trickier than I thought it would be. I had to scrape out the separate colors because they would bleed together. Then I had a hard time getting the right proportions to mix with the water. Too much and it was too watery, not enough and it stayed lumpy. I would say that this is difficult to apply with brushes. I saw another reviewer advising makeup sponges. I will try those next time and make sure I have them for each color.</li>
    <li> I give this product 5 stars because is does exactly what its suposed to do for the price.  It  is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Diamond FX. This rainbow cake is the favorite out of all the kiddos</li>
    <li> Several reviews here have complained that this product was too hard, didn&#x27;t go on well with fingers, etc. That&#x27;s because this is water-based face paint, folks! If you use water and a brush/sponge and get the paint to the correct (creamy) consistency, this product goes on like a dream. DFX neons are vibrant and easy to work with and rainbow cakes allow you to make complex designs with minimal strokes.</li>
    <li> I used this at several overnight events already (electric run, electric zoo...) and it looks amazing! I used it mostly on my face - no allergy or irritation whatsoever. Didn&#x27;t feel tight on my skin either. Since this is basically a water color, it is very easy to put on and washes off in 10 seconds without any soap. That said, I was pleasantly surprised that after 10 hours of jumping, dancing, and even being sprayed with water my &amp;#34;make-up&amp;#34; stayed put. I would recommend to paint yourself/your face, wait three minutes - and then you are good to go!&lt;br /&gt;I also tried to use it on my hair (I am blond). I ended up just doing a few highlights, because the color block is rather small and my hair is rather long. The color was vibrant until I decided to brush my hair - then it turned into powder and peeled off. On the good side - the color washes off right away without any hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitating - just buy it. It&#x27;s a fun addition to any overnight event and absolutely worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used various brands of face paint and Diamond Fx is one of the best. This Neon Rainbow is no exception. The colors are brilliant and it applies smoothly. It is a great addition to my kit.</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers I had a lot of trouble getting this product to a soft paint like consistency that could be applied easily. It took me a long time to apply (as I tried several different ways to get it to the right consistency).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also felt it was overpriced for the amount of product you got. It is so small that you are limited to using a very small detail brush or else the colors will get mixed up.</li>
    <li> Ordered it for her and she loved it. Showed up great in her blacklight. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes make-up.</li>
    <li> works good and go on good just a fvf vgf v  dd a little watter enjvedfetfdeg  dcvdfeyd cv x rvfgf egf</li>
    <li> I asked the kids from the party and they all say the bubbles were awesome they had lots of fun with them</li>
    <li> Worked great for a black light party. Daughter loves it.  All her friends asked to borrow it.  Went on easy.</li>
    <li> I typically apply this cake with a cut sponge or dauber with excellent results! Great for neon rainbow butterflies, kitty cat ears, neon tigers, birds, neon zebra, or as a base behind swirls and teardrops. I&#x27;ve also used it with a 3/4&amp;#34; flat brush or #7 round brush to make double/triple loaded neon flowers. Great split cake! I&#x27;ll be getting another one when this one runs out.</li>
    <li> Great! Not sure if it matters but mine came in a white tray rather than the blue one shown</li>
    <li> Used this for a black light party and photo shoot. The colors are nice and bright and stayed on all night.</li>
    <li> It was easy to put on- but definitely do a trial run just to get used to how much water to use, etc.  Best with a primer underneath.  A lot of fun, I got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Took this to burning man! It&#x27;s a little too thick for a brush and a little too thin to be used as a paste. I think a spongey aplicator works well. Go raid your local sephora and get the free lipstick sponges for applying this. Very cool just on the skin, but really amazing in Blacklight.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!! It is the most popular one I use. Everyone want it. I set out a black light and show them how it glows.</li>
    <li> The bright colors work great and I had fun in black light. However the violet blue and dark green was just meh.</li>
    <li> Great colors, right size</li>
    <li> Did not expect it to work so well. The kids couldn&#x27;t stop looking in the mirror. Made the black light party so much fun!</li>
    <li> I LOVE neon colors and these are neon! They don&#x27;t crease, and they stay vibrant. The application is a little tricky, but overall I love it</li>
    <li> this is the best dries fast doesn&#x27;t smudge  and when ready to wash off, easy!! you won&#x27;t regret it i promise.</li>
    <li> Worked great! Created butterfly wings in seconds</li>
    <li> I originally bought these because I thought they would glow in the dark, they don&#x27;t, but that was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Note that they only glow under a black light! They are very bright and beautiful though, even under normal light they are excellent quality paints, I have even slept in them and they look pretty much the same the next day, even dancing won&#x27;t melt them away easily.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for the electric run and I was not disapointed! I purchased decent paint brushes and applied with a little water. The colors looked just as good in regular light as they did in the black light! I could totally use these for a day time party/event. Worth money!</li>
    <li> I used this neon paint set for a black light photo shoot. It worked great. The colors are very vivid under black light</li>
    <li> This paint makes an awesome statement! Really brings the wow factor for butterfly&#x27;s &amp; face masks. Goes on easy &amp; really pops</li>
    <li> i got this product expecting the wow factor, but i found it was over priced for the size (a very small amount) and didn&#x27;t deliver results. im really disappointed. now i know it was too good to be true. if you want rave quality paint, don&#x27;t skimp because you get what you pay for.  WHAT A SCAM!</li>
    <li> I used this for a Black Light Birthday Party along with just a lipstick brush. Not only was the makeup was smooth going on, but it lasted all night and well into the next day but was easily washable. Super Glow under the black light. Love Love Love Loved it!! Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> the colors were really bright and lasted a long time. I actually didnt have the chance to test them under blacklight tho.</li>
    <li> This worked great and was a lot of fun.</li>
    <li> this paint is beautiful! use it with a sponge to make a perfect full spectrum rainbow or use paintbrushes to do some finer detail. i used this all weekend with my friends and neighbors at electric forest and everyone wanted some. it washes off super easily with water, but will last a long time on if you don&#x27;t sweat toooo much or smear it. it&#x27;s not glow in the dark, but looks super vibrant during the day and good black lights. i&#x27;d buy a brick of this stuff if i could :)</li>
    <li> The color is intense and shows up well under blacklight. My children and I love to do the 5k runs and whenever there is a blacklight run we dress up. I painted their faces with this really easy and quick. When it dries out I can clear up and mixed smudge marks with a piece of tissue.</li>
    <li> My daughter had a Glow party for her birthday and we wanted a paint that would really glow under black light. I did research on different ones and this one had good reviews. It worked like a charm. It looked so cool under black light. It may seem like a small amount, but we painted about 20 faces and hardly used any. A little goes a long way. It dries really fast too and is easily removed with a washcloth. I totally recommend this product. SO GLAD I FOUND IT!!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, works like a charm and shows up spectacularly under blacklight. Water-based paint is the only way to go.</li>
    <li> I ordered this prodcut to use in my face painting business, and it works great to give that WOW factor to my face paintings.  I love how it looks on butterflies or rainbow tigers.</li>
    <li> So, I basically had a black light party about a month ago. I was terrified of buying something that might not ACTUALLY glow in blacklight, but I put few black lights up and showed up painted, and the colors were super bright and super glowy. I&#x27;d easily recommend this for anyone wanting a small blacklight project that requires painting.</li>
    <li> Nicest product of all the ones I bought. Easy one stroke cake with bright colors.</li>
