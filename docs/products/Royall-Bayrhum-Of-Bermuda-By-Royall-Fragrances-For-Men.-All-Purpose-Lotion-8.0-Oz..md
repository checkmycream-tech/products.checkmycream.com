      <li>So if you want a good strong smelling Bay Rum on your face after shaving, this is it!</li>
      <li>AT ALL, but was concocted in the US under some kind of license agreement.</li>
      <li>It was a Christmas gift and my husband was thrilled.</li>
      <li>Has a really nice smell.</li>
      <li>I get some nice comments on it.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is quite nice</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything that either my wife or I liked.</li>
      <li>Now to be honest, the newer bottle is 8 oz.</li>
      <li>This product is a perfect all around fragrance, very soothing and aromatic.</li>

      <li>I have used and loved Bay Rhum for many years.</li>

      <li>I strongly recommend people find another bayrhum and please let me know of a good one.</li>
      <li>The fragrance was tangy and rich and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>It is a spicy lotion with a certain unctuousness that makes it a joy to use.</li>
      <li>It smelled more like rum than Bay Rhum, and felt like a chemical burn when applied.</li>
      <li>Now I need to try to find another Bay Rum(Rhum) product that is satisfying to my wife and me.</li>
      <li>My father always wore Bay Rum, he grew up on the Oregon Coast and I love the association of the sea and the forest and that is what the fragrance of Bay Rum reminds me of.</li>
      <li>more like a spicy clove kinda thing.</li>
      <li>They love that it</li>
      <li>Its a favorite of some of the men in my family.</li>
      <li>It is all I hoped for, and he is happy with it, and was delighted to finally have some Bay Rum!</li>
      <li>and I love it on my man.</li>
      <li>I love the smells of the outdoors, of nature</li>
      <li>Light scent and a nice feel when you splash it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased most all of the royall aftershaves.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several others but this is the best buy for your $$$</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>We were so pleased to find Royal Bayrhum since my husband ran out of it years ago.  </li>
      <li>which is hopefully of better quality than this.</li>
      <li>This is a bay rum that is more bay than spice.</li>
      <li>having bought this for many years from bermuda,it is now made in the u.s.a.</li>
      <li>the bay and clove scent is sexy and he loves using it as aftershave.</li>
      <li>There is no reason to write a review as I have purchsed this itam many times and have always been satified</li>
      <li>My wife used to love this.</li>
      <li>Refreshing and spicy aroma</li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband because I LOVE the smell-</li>
      <li>All of these products were outstanding, and all were made in Bermuda -- not the USA like this one.  </li>
      <li>My first bottle of Royall product was bought at Brooks Brothers in 2001, and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Extremely subtle and pleasant aroma, perfect for after shave or as a body splash.  </li>
      <li>That goes to show you how absolutely great the old stuff was!  </li>
      <li>The people who received it talked about how much they loved it.</li>
      <li>Too strong?</li>
      <li>If you like the sweet aroma of cloves, You&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
      <li>The replacement product was fine.</li>
      <li>This used to be the finest bayrhum available anywhere.</li>
      <li>and I must say that I really enjoy using it.</li>
      <li>We couldn&#x27;t find a store that sells it, but were fortunate to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available on Amazon for about $20/</li>
      <li>Last year, I purchased the product from Amazon (great service from Amazon, BTW).</li>
      <li>About a week, when I had free Prime 2-day shipping.</li>
      <li>This, in my humble, subjective opinion, is the best.</li>
      <li>Great scent and feels good on the skin but not long lasting.</li>
      <li>The product is now produced in the US-clearly inferior to the original.</li>
      <li>My first memory of the scent of Royall BayRhum aftershave was on my favorite uncle.</li>
      <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t have the aroma of the original, made in the island.</li>
      <li>The original Bay Rum is from the Virgin Islands.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazons service was excellent as usual.</li>
      <li>My husband has used Bay Rhum for most of the 58 years we have been married.  </li>
      <li>It is a clean, spicy smell that would never be mistaken for a perfume.</li>
      <li>I use the cologne as just a touch Good Stuff and traditional.</li>
      <li>I was able to find it here on Amazon at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>Not bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t come in the same bottle that I expected. Came in a Royall Lime looking bottle, which isn&#x27;t the same as Bayrhum. Still smells good</li>
    <li> To keep it short and sweet.  Out of all the Bay Rum products here on Amazon, this is the best.  It has the strongest smell out of several products on here.  So if you want a good strong smelling Bay Rum on your face after shaving, this is it!</li>
    <li> Bay Rum, Bay Rhum, . . . what ever you call it is still be most natural after shave there is yet you can barely find any.  It has a long lasting aroma and takes the red out of your beard after you shave.    This Royall product does all this it is suppose to and at a Great Price.</li>
    <li> For those who like Royall fragrances, this is a great product to purchase. The bottle is much larger than I expected it to be. The royal seal was on the outside of the fragrance box and reminded my Dad of  when he would purchase the fragrance at the Port Authority. The price is a VERY good price!</li>
    <li> Husband loves this fragrance above all others, and it&#x27;s less expensive here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> If you like the sweet aroma of cloves, You&#x27;ll love this.  Bay Rhum has been so difficult to find on the non-internet market.  I took a chance with Amazon and BIFF!.  There it was.  I used to use this in the &#x27;60s and it hasn&#x27;t changed a bit.</li>
    <li> Great product, got it for my fiance.&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was as described, wrapped in original packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Product lasts a long time, so grab it when you need it.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved Bay Rhum for many years. I first bought it while visiting Bermuda. It is a spicy lotion with a certain unctuousness that makes it a joy to use. The product is now produced in the US-clearly inferior to the original. It lacks body and has a dilute aroma. Furthermore, the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control measures are woefully lacking. Last year, I purchased the product from Amazon (great service from Amazon, BTW). The packaging was as I expected and the label on the bottle correctly represented what I thought I had purchased. When I opened the bottle, instead of the anticipated lovely, spicy aroma came a weak, fruity smell. When I looked more closely at the back of the bottle, I saw the raised lettering and image indicating the ingredients were Royall Lyme! Amazon graciously and quickly replaced the defective item. The replacement product was fine. I ran out and purchased another bottle. Guess what? The exact same packaging/labeling defect. Oy. The smell for the Lyme seems much worse and entirely intolerable. I have decided to look for a different product from a different manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is actually about the bottle I bought two years ago and should have reviewed then.  Let me start at the beginning. I first used Royall Bayrhum OF BERMUDA around 1970. Yeah, that&#x27;s over 40 years ago. I bought it on St. Thomas where it was a heck of a lot less expensive than here in the U.S. I loved that scent and used it off and on over the years.   Then I ordered a bottle from Amazon without realizing that it was no longer really Royall Bayrhum OF BERMUDA. It&#x27;s now made in the USA and the quality is horrid. All the flag waving and \\&quot;buy made in the USA\\&quot; campaigns and then we turn out poop like this. The Chinese could put together a better knockoff and charge about five bucks for it. I knew that something was wrong when I opened the bottle and the scent of bay leaves wasn&#x27;t there. You might just as well use rubbing alcohol for a buck a bottle instead of wasting your money on this. You can also walk into most large drug stores and pick up a bottle of cheap bay rum that has more of the essential oils than this does.   If you like to try new things, cut some plain alcohol with about 25% water and add a few dozen bay leaves. Let this sit in the sun for a week or two, giving it a shake once a day... you now have bay rum. If not strong enough, add more bay leaves and put back in the sun. Too strong? Add a little water. Now use the money you saved to buy something else made in the USA........which is hopefully of better quality than this.</li>
    <li> This is no longer the exhilarating, refreshing,superb smelling product it once was. No longer made in Bermuda. The USA licensee has massively watered down this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This used to be the finest bayrhum available anywhere. Now it is a weak shadow of it&#x27;s former self. I strongly recommend people find another bayrhum and please let me know of a good one. I certainly hope the new maker will return to the old formula which was so rich in essential oils and wonderfully masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazons service was excellent as usual.The new licensee needs to return to the brisk, refreshing lotion of the past. Not this watered down alcohol. Sigh.......</li>
    <li> I have used Royall Spyce &amp; Royall Lyme for over 40 years.  I bought from Amazon the pkg of 3 (Spyce, Lyme &amp; Royall Bayrhum), but discovered that the Bayrhum has NO aroma!  What do I do? Return it; go buy an oil to give it an aroma; or, toss it?  I am truly disappointed - almost disgusted.  Was this an error at the factory or what?</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion with a mild Bay Rum fragrance that could last a little longer.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband ever year... and we still LOVE it!  It smells so amazing!  He always gets compliments on it, and it&#x27;s not too overpowering.  I&#x27;m super sensitive to smell (frangrances and/or colognes) and this one doesn&#x27;t bother me at all!  LOVE IT!!!  (oh... and he does too!) ;-)</li>
    <li> My first bottle of Royall product was bought at Brooks Brothers in 2001, and I loved it.  Later, I happened upon a bottle at the military post exchange, and still later bought some in Bermuda while on a cruise.  All of these products were outstanding, and all were made in Bermuda -- not the USA like this one.  Since this is a review of the Bay Rum (Rhum), I&#x27;ll talk about this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost is the difference in smell.  The Made in Bermuda version was heavier, with less alcohol smell.  It was more complex.  This smells like cinnamon infused alcohol -- what happened to the bay scent?  When you poured the old stuff into your hand, it had a dark, almost tea color to it.  This is absolutely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other differences that have nothing to do with the smell itself.  The old stuff had a bay leaf in it, which is missing here.  The bottles from Bermuda are almost entirely handmade, and it shows.  And finally, the original had a solid medal cap with no insert.  This new USA version has a cheaper medal cap with a white plastic cap glued inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What kills me is that this stil isn&#x27;t a horrible aftershave, especially for the price.  That goes to show you how absolutely great the old stuff was!  I hope Royall gets the message on this product.  If you&#x27;re listening, you&#x27;ve made the best aftershave in the world for years, and your licensed US producer is killing it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, I use Royall bay rum every time I shave, I love the smell and it feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this very expensive product for years. This bottle has almost no scent. It smells like pure alcohol. This has never happened when I ordered this product from a small store. $50 literally down the drain!</li>
    <li> This has always been the best Bay Rhum ever made.</li>
    <li> This is a bay rum that is more bay than spice. The bay oil scent is not overpowering, and has a nice warm scent. Smells like Captain&#x27;s Choice bay rum. The glass bottle is great, plus has a pewter color metal &amp;#34;crown&amp;#34; cap. This is a nice scent bay rum that lasts maybe a couple of hours, and the price was great from Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again, as I think Ogallala bay rum has more of a punch (clove, cinnamon, bay oil, and almost a touch of vanilla), and lasts a lot longer. All in all, was worth the money, and I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived at my house,  I had a little bit left in my old bottle of Bay Rhum on my dresser, so when this new bottle arrived,  I did a side-by-side sniff test.  They smelled noticeably different.  Plus, my new bottle was in a Royall LYME bottle.  Whether it was Royall Lyme or not, the new bottle was smelled diluted and weak.  I wasted my money on this knock-off imitation.  Should have read the other negative reviews before I ordered.</li>
    <li> i just received my first bottle of this stuff today in the mail. It smells awesome! I&#x27;m a daily DE shaver, and I use a variety of aftershaves, but I think this will probably now be my &amp;#34;daily driver,&amp;#34; if you will. It does have much more of that aftershave &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; than many of my other ones, but that&#x27;s something I kinda enjoy....so take that as you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title says, it did take a while to get here. About a week, when I had free Prime 2-day shipping. Definitely not a deal-breaker in my opinion, but something I&#x27;ll keep in mind in the future, and not re-order at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer picture on here has a caption that is misleading. He shows the bottle and says it&#x27;s mislabeled, and that that is an indicator of poor quality control by the seller. This is not the case: all &amp;#34;Royall  _____&amp;#34; products come in a bottle marked &amp;#34;Royall Lyme&amp;#34; as that is the company&#x27;s name, not just the name of one of the scents. So, don&#x27;t let that picture dissuade you from buying this product, as it seems the person who took the photo was a little confused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.  It costs double the amount if purchased in a store.  Shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> Lets get this out of the way:  I&#x27;m an old guy (62).  Using Bay Rum brings back instant memories of old time barbers slapping this stuff on my neck when they were done.    This IS expensive and I tried a cheaper brand ($19).  My wife says no contest, it&#x27;s like comparing a lexus to a yugo.</li>
    <li> This is the one and only Bay Rhum; my sweetie loves it and so do I.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and find it to be long lasting with a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve used various manufacturers bay rums over the years, and the two best have been the Royall brand (from Bermuda) and St. John&#x27;s (from St. Thomas). Given that Royall is now half the price of St. John&#x27;s, it&#x27;s a no-brainer.</li>
    <li> Since Royal Doulton products are so difficult to find, I am always excited to find one and especially at a low price. Its a favorite of some of the men in my family.</li>
    <li> A real man&#x27;s aftershave.  Only to be used by the strong of heart. Sit back and watch the fireworks.</li>
    <li> These colognes are my husband&#x27;s favorite, great price on this site.</li>
    <li> Used Bay Rhum as an after shave lotion for years until I retired.  Twenty years later, my wife said she missed it.  We couldn&#x27;t find a store that sells it, but were fortunate to find it on Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon!</li>
    <li> This new bottle of Bayrhum is NOT like the old product.  It simply doesn&#x27;t have that strong Bayrhum fragrance.  Yesterday I finished my old bottle (it had a gold-colored cap) and today I tried the new bottle (it has a silver-colored cap).  What a difference!  I thought maybe I was imagining things, so I squeezed out a few last drops from the old bottle.  I wasn&#x27;t imagining.  It&#x27;s different and it&#x27;s a bad product.</li>
    <li> My first memory of the scent of Royall BayRhum aftershave was on my favorite uncle. He was a gentleman and it was his choice then as it is now, some sixty years later. It is a clean, spicy smell that would never be mistaken for a perfume. Royall BayRhum epitomizes what a manly, tropical aftershave should be.</li>
    <li> Love it! Wear it everyday!</li>
    <li> I have been using Royall Bayrhum for over 40 years. Never had a complaint. It is what they say it is.</li>
    <li> It was not the real product .I have been using  real product for years this was a copy. VERY UPSET.</li>
    <li> Great product, great pricing. My youngest daughter thinks it makes me smell like a Catholic. I guess that&#x27;s good...</li>
    <li> This Bayrhum smells good to me and my wife likes it.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last long and that can be good if I put on too much to begin with.</li>
    <li> It is different from previous bottles and doesn&#x27;t smell quite the same. Not bad I guess but I get an impression of smokiness and less of the spiciness. I still have some left in an old bottle and they smell similar and yet .....? Now to be honest, the newer bottle is 8 oz. and the older bottle is 4 oz.  So that may be the source of the difference. There has been a lot of talk that Royall is no longer made in Bermuda but I would like to think that is only talk and hasn&#x27;t affected the lotion. I still use it but switch out with Lyme and Clubman products. I guess a wait and see is in order.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful cologne and both my husband and son use this. It makes their faces smell so good....like nutmeg. It is never too strong or overpowering and I even notice that it makes my husband&#x27;s breath smell good too. They love that it</li>
    <li> My husband tried this for the first time at one of those fancy stores where the price was way too much.  The fragrance was tangy and rich and I loved it.  I was able to find it here on Amazon at a reasonable price.  It was a Christmas gift and my husband was thrilled.</li>
    <li> having bought this for many years from bermuda,it is now made in the u.s.a. it is a poor imatation ofwhat i have bought from bermuda.smells like medicine. i will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting this for YEARS, so I finally bought it, in spite of some of the negative reviews. We haven&#x27;t experienced the past product quality, so were pleasantly surprised with this. It is all I hoped for, and he is happy with it, and was delighted to finally have some Bay Rum! There are no negative remarks here! Perfectly happy with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is very nice.  Light scent and a nice feel when you splash it on. I get some nice comments on it.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of \\&quot;Royall Bay Rhum\\&quot; from my normal supplier last fall. I don&#x27;t go through a bottle but every few years. Evidently, it has been near six years since my last purchase, because the Bermuda people sold out six years ago, and now the marque is formulated in the USA by Royal Doulton.    This recent bottle is H2O and alcohol with a fraction of the oils of the Bermuda product. I had an e-mail conversation about my and my wife&#x27;s impressions with the Royall people in Bermuda. The Bermuda Royall contact stated that the ingredients are the same, but the US Customs somehow regulates how much of the key oils can be used in the US product.  I rather doubt the involvement of US Customs, when the more likely reason is that Royal Doulton is cheapening the product using less of the oils that used to give this Bay Rhum such a punch.    My wife used to love this. She noticed immediately that the new bottle has only a little of the impact of the fragrance and no depth. I have a bit of the old product, and she can tell the difference right away.    So, about $38 for a 4 oz. bottle for nothing.    I recommend not buying this product. You will find it now unsatisfying compared to what you bought several years ago.    Now I need to try to find another Bay Rum(Rhum) product that is satisfying to my wife and me. Unfortunately, the St.Thomas is a bit on the sweet side for my wife&#x27;s and my preferences, but all of the others I have tried are too weak and lack the kick of the old Royall, Bermuda product.    Bring back the old product, please, and it will sell nicely.  This new formulation will not succeed in the market.</li>
    <li> They have changed to mix of spices or the types of fragrances.  It does not come close to what I got years ago.  Even my wife remarked about the change!</li>
    <li> My husband has used Bay Rhum for most of the 58 years we have been married.  I like the fragrance, too.&lt;br /&gt;We were happy to find it at Amazon where we could order and have it delivered in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;It has become a routine birthday gift.  Marilyn Marcroft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Royall Bayrhum for over 40 years. I was introduced to this brand by a haberdashery where I purchased some of my clothing. I was hooked and have received many compliments for the subtle fragrence. Another reason is the clean feel of the body splash after a shower, less cost than the mens cologne.I use the cologne as just a touch Good Stuff and traditional. Captdoogie</li>
    <li> My wife likes this stuff on me but it is really expensive in the stores.  Buying it from Amazon keeps the price down for me and keeps her from paying a rediculous amount for it in the local stores.  At $50 for a small bottle in the local store I would think the salesman should be wearing a mask.</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion as a gift for Christmas. The people who received it talked about how much they loved it. I have used Royal Spies for years and like it today as much as I did back when I was in high school.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Reminds me of the fragrance of barber shops growing up</li>
    <li> Great scent and feels good on the skin but not long lasting.</li>
    <li> The made in America version is slightly different in aroma</li>
    <li> I recall the Bay Rhum I used in college - Royall Lyme brand I think (as opposed to Royal Doulton), but the Bay Rhum essence.  It had a distinctive aroma that i could smell for close to an hour (others I suspect longer) but I think it was cologne, rather than \\&quot;after shave cologne\\&quot;.  In any event, the aroma of this stuff is so weak to my olfactory apparatus that I asked my wife what she thought of it. Her reply was \\&quot;barely detectable\\&quot;.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to Tiffany for Men, Paloma Picasso&#x27;s Minotaur, and Caron&#x27;s Pour Homme in the future. To me, this stuff is no better than water. I may let half of the alcohol evaporate to see if the aroma gets any stronger. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll simply toss it.</li>
    <li> Refreshing and spicy aroma that&#x27;s great as an aftershave or body splash. Does not overpower.  May not be as long lasting as some but refreshing. But, remember, these types of products are subject to individual preferences.</li>
    <li> I am not a complainer. But I would have to agree with the reviewers who have stated this product is not what it used to be, It is  a poor imitation and I would definitely not buy it again.</li>
    <li> This all purpose lotion is great stuff. Has a really nice smell. My husband loves it and wishes there were an after shave balm to go with it.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Royall BayRhum and received a bottle with the BayRhum label, but it was actually Royall Lyme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you turn the bottle around it actually says &#x27;Royall Lyme&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are selling one thing and shipping another, but just switching the labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scam. Beware</li>
    <li> And I like it too.  We were so pleased to find Royal Bayrhum since my husband ran out of it years ago.  It&#x27;s refreshing and a little citrusy.</li>
    <li> The original Bay Rum is from the Virgin Islands.  It&#x27;s also available on Amazon for about $20/bottle more that this imitation from Bermuda.  The imitation has a very different aroma which I don&#x27;t find nearly as satisfying as the original.  I&#x27;ll use this up and spend the extra $&#x27;s for the original next time, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
    <li> The fragrance seemed a little sharp.&lt;br /&gt;My husband is using it but it is not his favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I think he was expecting a sweeter fragrance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased most all of the royall aftershaves.  Awesome , awesome, and awesome.  I like them all.  Each morning I look forward to putting them on.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite and only aftershave...a regular Christmas gift.  Excellent price and excellent shipping.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks.  Wrong color, doesn&#x27;t last, NOT at all like original my husband has worn for years.  Would never buy again.  We still have some original left in a bottle.......what a difference!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used bay rum for probably 35 years (taking time out for eating, of course), and have used maybe a dozen brands.  This, in my humble, subjective opinion, is the best. It has a &#x27;tang&#x27;, and a &#x27;bite&#x27; that other brands don&#x27;t have. Lasts longer on you as well. It also has a rather high level of menthol, although the scent is definatly NOT menthol....more like a spicy clove kinda thing. As an after shave, the cooling ability of this stuff is beyond compare. But it is not floral, for you metrosexuals out there. I was brought up old school, when a man smelled like sweat, tobacco, and bay rum. I know, I know....half of you are going eeww[...] the OTHER half is MINE! Nyuk nyuk-enjoy.  BTW, this retailer has the best price, and rather quick service, to boot.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s very little to say except this is the stuff.  Extremely subtle and pleasant aroma, perfect for after shave or as a body splash.  Understated, elegant, perfect in every way.</li>
    <li> I like bay rum. Such a classic, clean scent. I have never run into a bay rum that I didn&#x27;t like, until now. This stuff vaguely smells of bay rum, then quickly degenerates into something resembling the smell of cheap hairspray. Truly awful. While most bay rums tend to be on the short-lived side, not this stuff, no, you&#x27;ll reek of chemical waste all day (and then some).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this zero stars.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and I will buy it again !</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband because I LOVE the smell- the bay and clove scent is sexy and he loves using it as aftershave.</li>
    <li> I love the natural fragrance of bay rum. I don&#x27;t like the unnatural smell of perfumes. I love the smells of the outdoors, of nature and I love it on my man. My father always wore Bay Rum, he grew up on the Oregon Coast and I love the association of the sea and the forest and that is what the fragrance of Bay Rum reminds me of. The rain, wind, and salt air.</li>
    <li> Very nice subtle scent.&lt;br /&gt;using it now.</li>
    <li> There is no reason to write a review as I have purchsed this itam many times and have always been satified</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several others but this is the best buy for your $$$</li>
    <li> My wife bought my first bottle of Royall Bay Rhum for me back in 1969. It&#x27;s the only aftershave/cologne she has ever liked. I went through a period of a few years using other products, but she wanted me to go back to the Royall bay rum, so she bought a bottle. I used it sparingly, but eventually ran out. A few weeks ago, my sweet wife ordered another bottle, and was I ever surprised. It smelled more like rum than Bay Rhum, and felt like a chemical burn when applied. Some may call that bracing, but I&#x27;ll tell you, it&#x27;s not the same product I used in previous decades. The scent of the current product is very much weaker than the old original, and it is gone after 15 minutes. The old Royall product lasted for hours. I also recall that the old Royall Bay Rhum bottles had a bay leaf in each one. There was probably more bay laurel oil in it, and the leaf in the bottle helped it retain a distinctive scent to the very last drop. I&#x27;m actively looking for a better replacement product and won&#x27;t go back to Royall. They would do well to return to their old tried and true formula. If you like alcohol on your face after a shave and shower, I suggest buying a bottle of vodka or rum to rub down with. It&#x27;s cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an October 2012 update: After writing the above review, I squandered a lot of money trying different bay rum products, to no avail. I didn&#x27;t find anything that either my wife or I liked. If you do a web search you will find various formulae for creating your own bay rum after shave. I didn&#x27;t want to fiddle with finding hard-to-get and expensive bay leaves and soak them in booze, so I bought small bottles of all-spice and bay leaf oils. I used a dropper and put equal amounts in a new bottle of Royall Bay Rhum, shook it well to mix, and voila, I now have a product that smells and lasts like the old made in Bermuda Bay Rhum did. This adds to your cost, however. The bottles of oils run between $7.50 and $10.00 each on the web. I didn&#x27;t use a graduated dropper, but did it the old trial and error way. I would suggest using a little to start with and increase the quantity until you get what you want.</li>
    <li> I started using Royall products 30 years ago and somehow got away from them. There was nothing ever wrong, so I guess it was just a change for changes sake. At any rate I saw an ad for this bought a bottle. The fragrance is not what I remember, but that could just be my nose... The fragrance is quite nice and I must say that I really enjoy using it. It is rather different from other Bay Rum fragrances, but very nice. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Royall Bayrhum of Bermuda was NOT FROM BERMUDA AT ALL, but was concocted in the US under some kind of license agreement. I felt cheated when I read that on the delivery box. I am disappointed by this deception. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t have the aroma of the original, made in the island. This is clearly a scam.</li>
    <li> It was my grandfather only and my father&#x27;s favorite so naturally it has become mine.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find.  Thanks  Jamie Gallagher</li>
    <li> change of fragrance is so good</li>
    <li> Great price. Great fragrance. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this BayRhum.</li>
    <li> great, love it, very pleased, shipped on time</li>
    <li> To quote another review of this product by T. Campbell, &amp;#34;This recent bottle is H2O and alcohol with a fraction of the oils of the Bermuda product&amp;#34; and he goes on to describe a correspondence he had with the a Bermuda Royall contact. I really wish I had heeded his review and not wasted my money. This is nothing like I remember it being. There is no bay leaf in the bottle and the fragrance is weak and heavy on alcohol as the reviewer described. I gave it two rather than one star because the smell isn&#x27;t terrible... it vaguely familiar and brings me back to the original fragrance, but not original at all... watered down and diminished. Very unfortunate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and this brand is as good as it always has been. I know it isn&#x27;t made in Bermuda anymore, but I can&#x27;t detect any difference from the product now versus 20 years ago when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> This product is a perfect all around fragrance, very soothing and aromatic. I use it almost daily and get many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any one.</li>
