      <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try because I really LOVE this iron.</li>

      <li>I love everything, the product, the superfast delivery, the package...</li>
      <li>Also, MAKE SURE you use a heat protective spray.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping great price</li>
      <li>So I got this because i wanted more bang for my buck because this is a 3 in 1 styling tool.  </li>
      <li>you will need a good heat protector serum because it does get hot.</li>
      <li>I even did my co worker&#x27;s hair and her hair is fine and not as coarse as mine and her hair turned out cute!!!!!</li>
      <li>if I thought it was user friendly, it&#x27;s saying a lot!</li>
      <li>and it is an elegant, easy hair-do.</li>
      <li>Now I can have pretty waves, I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>works great on extensions and natural hair.</li>
      <li>I must say though, it was the best $80 I have spent.</li>
      <li>easy to use,</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s made well and it is easy to detach the waving part.</li>
      <li>I used the deep wave and it turned out beautifully.</li>
      <li>but it still works fine and</li>
      <li>Enjoy it if you have longer hair.</li>
      <li>but I love the versatility of looks I can get with this tool and it makes my hair very shiny which I love.</li>
      <li>When I was trying to use I noticed it does get very hot and can easily burn your fingers or skin.</li>
      <li>I love the dual wave option and it gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t feel like you are burning your hair.</li>
      <li>I think others who have more experience with different types of irons would probably like it even more.</li>
      <li>Overall good and fun tool.</li>
      <li>For better curl, just be sure to use smaller clumps of hair.</li>
      <li>I have shoulder length hair and this though I am a HUGE fan of Hot Tools products this one just does not work for me.</li>
      <li>Gets really hot!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s also very thick, I was able to style my hair rather quickly, and talk about the best bang for your buck, I haven&#x27;t used the soft wave side</li>
      <li>, they are fun to try.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely hard to curl and never seems to hold anything, so this is great.  </li>
      <li>so I hardly do my hair, but this doesn&#x27;t take all day &amp; looks great.</li>
      <li>are hot).</li>
      <li>It also got through the hair a lot more quickly than I&#x27;d expected it to.</li>
      <li>It gets super hot and stays hot so that you barely hold it onto your hair and it done.</li>
      <li>I think this tool would work great on black or white hair.</li>
      <li>Glad I took the plunge as this was money well spent</li>
      <li>Heats fast.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cute, but not what I expected.</li>
      <li>It probably was just too much for me.</li>
      <li>but wow it is worth it.</li>
      <li>The only option I didn&#x27;t try was using the double barrel on it&#x27;s own to create figure 8 curls</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite waver it heats up quick and can be used for deep waves or small crimp like waves and it comes with a booklet for ways to use the barrels for creative waves.</li>
      <li>but I really loved the smaller waves provided by the triple barrel and the bigger waves provided by the deep waver.</li>
      <li>I bought this tool from Ulta and actually paid the full price of $80.</li>
      <li>My hair is past my butt, so this is great for those who have long hair.</li>
      <li>Meh I have to agree that I had high hopes of enhancing my waves with this, but the waves somehow do end up looking &amp;#34;trashy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>My hair is kind of thick</li>
      <li>locks tight for easy storage and the heat protectant glove works well</li>
      <li>The only thing I would say is: careful with the hot plates, they keep very hot even a while after you turned it off (even the &amp;#34;cool tips&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The 3 in 1 makes it extremely versatile and changing between the triple barrel and deep waver was easy.</li>
      <li>and I can do my whole head in ten min.</li>
      <li>It gave me those loose pretty beach waves I was looking for.</li>

<li> The waves last a long time.</li>
<li> I also did my sisters hair whose is very long</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not very accomplished at using this tool.</li>
<li> I have long hair and trying to weave it in between the barrels is difficult considering they&#x27;re hot!  </li>
<li> I have very long hair (down to my hips)</li>
<li> This was a risky purchase for me as my hair  is extremely long, incredibly thick and somewhat coarse.</li>
<li> For reference, I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
<li> I have thick wavy hair and it only takes me about 10-15 minutes to do my hair.</li>
<li> If you don&#x27;t want it set to 430, you can adjust the temp down for finer hair.  </li>
<li> The reason I gave it four stars was because it made my hair a little frizzy at the bottom.</li>
<li> It is a little intimidating with the three prongs.  </li>
<li> It takes a little bit of time to curl all the hair</li>
<li> The bar portion of this iron was too thin and short, I have bra strap length hair that is thick, it would&#x27;ve taken too long to do all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Because of that crazy combination, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, as it&#x27;s so terribly heavy</li>
<li> It was a waste of money.</li>
<li> and I have thick hair!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> do it, not a good tool.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a real amateur when it comes to operating curling irons, so</li>
<li> I found it really difficult to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look like a poofy frizz ball I hate it. The waves are just ugly looking and unprofessional. Use the Revlon Jumbo Barels for a good Crimpler.</li>
    <li> My hair is past my butt, so this is great for those who have long hair. I used the deep wave and it turned out beautifully.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Gives you that beach wave you crave! My hair is kind of thick so I style it the night before and sleep on it to give it more if a tamed look.</li>
    <li> Love this. I&#x27;m a mom of 2 so I hardly do my hair, but this doesn&#x27;t take all day &amp; looks great.</li>
    <li> Liked this tool. I got the wavy hair I wanted. The reason I gave it four stars was because it made my hair a little frizzy at the bottom. Overall good and fun tool. As a note my hair is very fine and doesn&#x27;t hold curls well.</li>
    <li> great, affordable  here than almost everywhere else, styles hold, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I love the dual wave option and it gets really hot but doesn&#x27;t feel like you are burning your hair. I dropped it and the clip came off but it still works fine and that was my fault and not the manufacturer.  I would recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite waver it heats up quick and can be used for deep waves or small crimp like waves and it comes with a booklet for ways to use the barrels for creative waves. I have been using for over a month with no issues i would definintly recommend this waver</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair and this though I am a HUGE fan of Hot Tools products this one just does not work for me. I tried switching the plates in different directions and my hair is too short for this tool to create the curls that it is supposed to create. I love the concept and wish it worked but I ended up giving it away. When I was trying to use I noticed it does get very hot and can easily burn your fingers or skin. Definitely use the glove that comes with it. Enjoy it if you have longer hair.</li>
    <li> It looks more of a crimp then a curl. It&#x27;s cute, but not what I expected. Also, MAKE SURE you use a heat protective spray. You can truly smell you hair burning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item thinking it would be a great two in one but it was a bust. The bar portion of this iron was too thin and short, I have bra strap length hair that is thick, it would&#x27;ve taken too long to do all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the waver portion either, and sadly I passed the return time so now I&#x27;m stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it, not a good tool.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It takes a little bit of time to curl all the hair but wow it is worth it. The waves last a long time. I&#x27;m very pleased with it; very nice quality as well.</li>
    <li> This tool is going to be my new best friend this summer!  It gave me those loose pretty beach waves I was looking for. I think this tool would work great on black or white hair.</li>
    <li> Beach waves!  i was sucked in the beach wave hype - So I got this because i wanted more bang for my buck because this is a 3 in 1 styling tool.  Um it&#x27;s ok - it looked great for the first hour then it fizzes up so you have to have great hair product with it.</li>
    <li> I love everything, the product, the superfast delivery, the package... I&#x27;m all compliments! Now I can have pretty waves, I&#x27;m very satisfied. The only thing I would say is: careful with the hot plates, they keep very hot even a while after you turned it off (even the &amp;#34;cool tips&amp;#34; are hot).</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this styling tool. I found it really difficult to use. I have long hair and trying to weave it in between the barrels is difficult considering they&#x27;re hot!  I managed to get my hair done once and didn&#x27;t like the results. The wave was not the beach look I was hoping for. I won&#x27;t be using this product anymore. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This tool is awesome. I have very long hair (down to my hips) and it&#x27;s also very thick, I was able to style my hair rather quickly, and talk about the best bang for your buck, I haven&#x27;t used the soft wave side but I love the versatility of looks I can get with this tool and it makes my hair very shiny which I love. If you&#x27;ve been on the fence about getting this tool I&#x27;m telling you, you have to have this!!</li>
    <li> This was a risky purchase for me as my hair  is extremely long, incredibly thick and somewhat coarse. Because of that crazy combination, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well, as it&#x27;s so terribly heavy but I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a try because I really LOVE this iron. The 3 in 1 makes it extremely versatile and changing between the triple barrel and deep waver was easy. I&#x27;m a real amateur when it comes to operating curling irons, so if I thought it was user friendly, it&#x27;s saying a lot! It also got through the hair a lot more quickly than I&#x27;d expected it to. The only option I didn&#x27;t try was using the double barrel on it&#x27;s own to create figure 8 curls but I really loved the smaller waves provided by the triple barrel and the bigger waves provided by the deep waver. Glad I took the plunge as this was money well spent and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone considering it.</li>
    <li> This is a great waver!</li>
    <li> Love It!! Easy to use, great heating, good quality.</li>
    <li> Product was very easy to use and heated up fast!!!!!!!!!! This styling iron is a must have. I even did my co worker&#x27;s hair and her hair is fine and not as coarse as mine and her hair turned out cute!!!!! Then I did my hair and I did it in about 15 minutes and I have thick hair!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The iron was great. It works as described and you can use the barrels for your own creativities&lt;br /&gt;The temperature settings was a great olus and it ranges from 280ºF-430ºF&lt;br /&gt;and locks tight for easy storage and the heat protectant glove works well</li>
    <li> I bought this tool from Ulta and actually paid the full price of $80. I must say though, it was the best $80 I have spent. I have thick wavy hair and it only takes me about 10-15 minutes to do my hair. I also did my sisters hair whose is very long and it still only took me about 15 minutes. It gets super hot and stays hot so that you barely hold it onto your hair and it done. When finished you get the ultra beach wave and it is an elegant, easy hair-do. I use this too about 2-3 times a week and have had it for about 3 months and it&#x27;s the best 3-in-1 I&#x27;ve ever bought. It also comes with a heat protective glove which is a great thing to use if you need to use both hands.&lt;br /&gt;(Kayla-writing from Greg&#x27;s amazon page.)</li>
    <li> Purchased this based on reviews. works great on extensions and natural hair. you will need a good heat protector serum because it does get hot. easy to use, and I can do my whole head in ten min. Great product!!</li>
    <li> Meh I have to agree that I had high hopes of enhancing my waves with this, but the waves somehow do end up looking &amp;#34;trashy&amp;#34;. At the very top it also leaves a kink in my hair. For reference, I have thick, coarse, wavy hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Watch out though; if you accidentally touch your ear or shoulder with the iron you will regret it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not very accomplished at using this tool. It&#x27;s made well and it is easy to detach the waving part. It probably was just too much for me. I think others who have more experience with different types of irons would probably like it even more.</li>
    <li> Gets really hot!  My hair is extremely hard to curl and never seems to hold anything, so this is great.  I like that there are different options, they are fun to try. The glove works great and prevents burns.  Heats fast.  If you don&#x27;t want it set to 430, you can adjust the temp down for finer hair.  It is a little intimidating with the three prongs.  For better curl, just be sure to use smaller clumps of hair.</li>
