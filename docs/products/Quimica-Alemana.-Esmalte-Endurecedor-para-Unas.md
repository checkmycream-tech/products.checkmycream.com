<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have never in 50 plus years been able to grow fingernails Facebook friend of mine turned me on to this said that this product saved her life and she also now has nails be careful when applying it if you feel any warm or hot sensations immediately remove it however I have discovered that I can mix a quarter of it with another polish to have and get the protection and strength that I need and then as a final coat I can use its straight the trick she said is 2 apply once a day for 7 days...each day build a harder and stronger coat after 7 days then remove it and start over and repeat just remember if you feel heat....remove and use a base coat of something or 2 or simply mix SOMETHING into your favorite color I am amazed...my nails used to be so thin and would peel now they are finally protected and are growing out long and strong this is the only product I have ever used and that includes all the dietary pills supplements gelatin excetera I swear on my soul this works</li>
    <li> It is the best base i bought. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product been using it for over 4 years now. I only use on the tips of my nails and my nails grow very well. Keeps the tips white also.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for about a month . I can&#x27;t see a change in my nails so I will give it another month before I judge it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and I love it. Do not want to get caught without it</li>
    <li> I love this product,it work well for strengthening the nails. I have been sharing it with my friends..</li>
    <li> Super nail hardener. I heartily recommend to make soft, brittle nails behave and grow strong. There is nothing else like it.</li>
    <li> I have nails that bend like paper.  This nail hardener really works well.  My nails are rigid now and can take Shellac nail polish that stays on for 3 weeks. It&#x27;s too bad my nails grow so fast or it would last longer. Before this nail hardener, the shellac would crack off in two days.  Be careful to put it on thin or it causes pain. Test it on one nail first.  I just hope this product is safe since it is absorbed into the nail bed as well.</li>
    <li> I was a nail biter for many years and my nails are weak. Someone suggested this product to me and I bought it. The first time I used it I was amazed at how my nails looked incredible and how firm they were. I would and will and have told people about this product. AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> This stuff really does harden your nails after continued use for a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve never been able to grow nails until I started using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Down side: Only use until nails are hardened.  After that is caused my nails to have white spots.</li>
    <li> This product protects my nails from splitting and my nails are super long.  I never had problems growing my nails, but keeping them has become a problem.  Product is effective and cheaper to purchase online than in nail salons.</li>
    <li> Thought it would help my nails - it burns my skin if I touch my skin.  I can&#x27;t put it on by myself.</li>
    <li> I used to bite my nails...for 25 years. When I finally decided to allow them to grow, they grew flimsy and frail. I started using this product and within two weeks I noticed the difference. My nails were strong and stopped chipping. It was really great. Now that my nails are super long, I use this as my base coat under my nail polish. Always helps them stay stronger than any other base coat I have tried. Really great product just be careful to paint your cuticles...it will burn a little.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this product - I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  It is amazing in that it strengthens your nails and actually seems to make them grow faster. The price was reasonable and the shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> Great for a While....  I used this to help my nails get back in shape after a few years of acrylics.  It really helped in the beginning.  But by the second bottle it didn&#x27;t work anymore.  Could be that my nails just became accustomed to it and stopped responding, don&#x27;t know.  But would still recommend it to get started.</li>
    <li> This makes my fingertips hurt for a minute or two, but make my nails very hard. I love it.</li>
    <li> This product is the best nail hardener on the planet. I have \\&quot;teacher nails\\&quot; --and the paper I constantly handle makes my nails brittle, and I have a split on one finger.  If you follow the directions ; it is amazing.  My nails get so long and hard...it hurts to cut them. Get so many compliments on my natural nails. I am 65 and have beautiful healthy nails. It takes a good month to see results . Must  follow directions carefully and be patient, it is an overnight fix, but  then they stay fixed.User must be consistent  with usage.</li>
    <li> never had nails but now do, and long also! I have given bottles to family members and friends and  everyone had good results.  If you had acrylic nails recently, the product can burn but if you have your own nails and apply it to healthy nails , there is no burning.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! I have bought this several times. Love how fast my nails grow and how healthy they are.</li>
    <li> the first time i used your nail hardener I felt burning under my nails.  I removed the hardener, and tried again. the burning returned. over the past weeks, I tried a few more times.  alas. more burning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Some of my nails split and as long as I keep this hardener on my nails they never split or break. Two or three coats are best.</li>
    <li> Great product! My nails are growing long and strong with this nail hardener! I def recommend it. I ordered another bottle because I&#x27;ve seen great results!</li>
    <li> I have always had very weak nails. I would break nails everyday. My nails would grow at a pretty fast rate but because of the breakage they were always short. I have tried using other products with some success but as soon as I stop using the product my nails would go right back what they were. I have been using this product for a couple months now and the results are amazing. My nails are so hard. I was nervous about buying the product because people said it burned but I have had no issues with that. I did feel a very slight tingle but that was all. I will say that it you have on fake nails wait a week or two before using this product. Your nails will need time to heal or it will burn. The chemicals in this product have been known to cause problems. I would recommend wearing a mask as to not inhale the vapors. This product has done for me what other products have failed. This is a must BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the product. It works wonders, my nails hardened after just a couple of weeks of using it. A couple of my friends tried it and loved it as well.</li>
    <li> This really works well!!  Obviously it takes time (about two months) but my nails are stronger than they have ever been.</li>
    <li> makes my nails strong</li>
    <li> Beware buyers! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! The only reason I&#x27;d not give this product less than one star is because the seller sent me the product right away. I used this product recently and immediately my fingers were burning! I had to immediately remove it with nail polish remover and the pain lasted for two days. I checked the ingredients and this product has FARMMELGAHYDE.</li>
    <li> Very good product. In one month my nails looked strong and nice. I did not have such of nice looking nail for decades. My nails were brittle, thin, weak and ugly to look at. At first I did not follow the instructions from the label and my nails hurt so bad. I was going to discontinue using it but, after I red the label and applied according to the instructions I have no problem ever. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 3 weeks.  My nails are much stronger already. I am pleased with this product,</li>
    <li> Excellent nail hardener!  I have purchased many times!</li>
    <li> My manicurist recommended this nail hardener a couple of years after I had wraps removed.  My natural nails have never been stronger or healthier!  I&#x27;ll never go back to wraps.</li>
    <li> I have used Quimica Alemana for years it help my nails grow faster and stronger, it is an amazing product I love it.</li>
    <li> This really works!!! I applied to my nails and within the first week I noticed a difference . My nails felt stronger and thicker.</li>
    <li> For years I have been trying to get my soft peeling nails to grow, sore cracked cuticles, etc. and now they are so strong and long.  I love it.[[ASIN:B004WG4CQ6 Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener 0.47oz \\&quot;Pack of 2\\&quot;]]</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!!! Not only my nails are stronger, thicker, and healthier looking but they grow super fast. I used to get gel manicure every 2-3 weeks which made my nails brittle, weak, constantly breaking and now at my recent manicure appointment the lady said &amp;#34;you have beautiful nails!&amp;#34; I have never heard a comment like that regarding my nails. I have already recommended this product to several of my friends which were a little hesitant at first so to be a good friend as I am i bought this sweet deal &amp;#34;pack of 2&amp;#34; and gave out my one of my friends who is a hairdresser and her nails are in the constant contact with hair dyes and chemicals. After about two weeks she came over and her nails were longer and stronger. I am so glad I found this product and will probably never stop buying it! And I don&#x27;t even need gel or tips manicures anymore so I save bunch of money! Unlike other hardeners this product actually works and believe me I have tried everything. Being anemic, as I am, makes your nail weaker because your hands and feet are constantly cold since there is an iron deficiency. You have nothing to lose when trying this product so GO AHEAD. GO WILD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice for usage is to to start out with clean nail and apply only one stripe of hardener running through the middle  to the tip as it may cause a little burning sensation because your nails are not used to the awesomeness of this potion! Apply one stripe over the same spot every day for about 3 days, then  remove it and then you&#x27;re officially ready to start applying it on the entire nail. Apply it for three days then remove it again. Repeat the process once more unless your nail don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34;. Usually I apply one coat one day and another the next day and I stop. After few days i remove it and do it again...or you can leave it on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting a color on right away but maybe after a week or so.  I use it as a base coat and even take it with me to the nailsalon when I am getting a professional manicure done. The ladies never have a problem of using my base coat instead of theirs. Good luck!!</li>
    <li> Item was shipped and delivered very fast!!! Product is very effective. My nails are very hard and long. Use a nail/cuticle oil at bedtime to moisturize the nail and avoid breackage due to dryness. It is very important to read and follow the instructions to avoid side effects. So far no side effects for me.</li>
    <li> Works great, no problems at all with initial application.  I have very weak, brittle nails that split easily and this really helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past year and love it. Great price on amazon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many nail hardeners and none compare with this truly amazing product.  It protects and stays on the nail until you take it off. Before my nails would split and break but now they are long healthy and beautiful!!</li>
    <li> Love It So much. very good . my nails are growing long and strong.</li>
    <li> Really good ,works for me ;) it really makes the nail stronger and I can&#x27;t stop using it. Must have</li>
    <li> I love this product my mom and i have used it for years now, it makes your nails stronger, grow faster, they look very nice and white and healthy. If you have weak nails the first time you use it, it can  hurt so BE VERY CAREFUL!, when i first used it and it hurt i would take it off and try again a few days later, but in my opinion i really like this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every product out there. It stays on the longest and is the Best Nail Hardener ever!!</li>
    <li> The best nail hardener I have ever tried</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> The only product that give me 10 long nails.  You do have to follow directions and take it off every 3 days.</li>
    <li> This is good, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I wear it instead of nail polish.  It has a muted sheen and stays on most of the week.  My nails are much stronger now.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using this for the past 3 years and I do have the nails I always dreamed of. I can grow them as long as I want.... However, If I stop using the product for a couple of days my nails go back to being miserable and brittle.... In a nut-shell, you always have to have it on.... Yes, you may use it as a base coat, it hold your polish very well. The product makes your nail thicker by changing the structure of your nail top. which is why nails breaks without it. Overall, all my frneds and people I work with bought it... Please keep in mind that inn the beginning when you just start using the hardener, your nails may hurt..Because your nails are thin and brittle, the pain is reasonable, based on what I mentioned above...  I recommend it to anyone...</li>
    <li> This will harden your nails..BUT.. when you first use this, if you dont use it ultra sparingly, I mean a whisper of product, you will think that you are being tortured for past sins..it can feel like electrical shock currents running under your nails, and you suddenly understand why bamboo under fingernails is used as torture.&lt;br /&gt;after using this a few times I guess my nails become accustomed to the product, because I can glop it on thickly.&lt;br /&gt;it will help grow your nails, but beware in the first few uses to use ultra lightly</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My nails are strong and I have given it to friends who had problem nails forever, especially if they did gel or wraps.  We all think the product is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried ALL of the other &amp;#34;nail strengtheners&amp;#34; out there and time after time I realized I wasted money. This is the only product that I&#x27;ve ever felt actually working. If you&#x27;ve never used it before or if you&#x27;re really sensitive to things be prepared to feel an intense heat the first few times you use it. Afterwards you will have rock hard nails.</li>
    <li> this product is the only product I found that really keeps my nails hard and help them grow.  I must keep a bottle around the house at all times.</li>
    <li> My manicurist had used this on me previously and I did not notice any pain or discomfort with this product. I have problems with my nails breaking but they are NOT overly thin or brittle. Item was packaged well and came before the scheduled arrival. The price for 2 bottles even with shipping was a great deal. I definitely recommend this product - however I would suggest trying it if possible before buying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this nail hardener for a few months now. I use it 2X/week. I use it as a base coat when I get my weekly manicures and mid-week when I&#x27;m tired of the color, I just wear this until my next manicure. It&#x27;s saved my nails from the peeling and breaking to a minimum. I&#x27;m a person who suffers from Hypothyroidism and I also take Biotin in order to help my nails. This enhances my nails. I&#x27;m in love with this product and you will be too!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many other &amp;#34;nail hardeners&amp;#34; and nothing has ever worked.  I had given up all hope of having cute nails and &amp;#34;womanly&amp;#34; hands.  Then a co-worker told me about this and it has worked!  I wear nail polish colors and French manicures, my nails are long and very hard.  I use this twice a week as a base coat and a top coat.  It does help prevent chipping as a top coat too.  I swear by this stuff now!</li>
    <li> I have only started using this product so I can&#x27;t say how good it is at hardening the nails.  What I can say is that it is very painful to use.  I put on one coat yesterday and it hurt a little and just for maybe 20 minutes, but I put a second coat on today and it hurt badly and for hours.  I don&#x27;t know why it got worse.  The closest feeling I can describe is having all of your finger tips smashed in a drawer and then set on fire...obviously not as intense a pain as that, but the same type of pain if that makes sense.  Or, it is like when you have been out in the cold cold weather for so long that your hands are numb, but then you come inside and put them in warm water and it aches and burns all at the same time.  The pain was not enough for me to take the product off (maybe I would have if I had been at home and had remover available), but if I apply another coat and it starts to hurt that much again I will definitely take it off immediately and not use it again. The product does give the nails a beautiful, glossy, gel-like look and is very pretty as a clear polish, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.  Other reviewers mentioned some pain, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be a big deal...maybe some people are just more sensitive to the ingredients in it than others, but I have a pretty high pain tolerance and still found this to be painful, not just uncomfortable.  Seller was great though, package arrived early and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I had paper thin short nails before trying this.  I now have long and strong nails that look beautiful.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff!  My nails have never looked better - I use this for a great base coat and again as a top coat.</li>
    <li> Yes, your nails will &amp;#34;ache&amp;#34; when you use it initially. If you can get past that get ready for strong, long nails in the months to come. You must use the polish faithfully, or your nails will weaken. I now get comments from my manicurist about how strong my nails are; they used to be very thin and brittle, with lots of peeling. No more of that! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Hated this product. Twenty minutes after u put it on my nails, I had to remove it because it hurt so much. I threw it out. Totally wasted the money.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law introduced me to this product.  She&#x27;s been using it since hearing about it at a nail salon.  This product has done the most to help my soft nails that have gotten worse as I&#x27;ve aged.  Not the \\&quot;be all-end all\\&quot; I&#x27;d hoped for, but definitely the best Ive used.  No yellowing and adds substance to my thin nails. I ordered 4 bottles to share with family and friends.</li>
    <li> I finally have strong nails! I&#x27;m telling all my friends so this should be a popular item! I works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This is great for aftercare of natural nails after taking off artificial nails. My nails were so raw that it took 2 weeks for me to be able to put it on because it burned too badly to keep on. It is very good for soft, brittle nails also. I&#x27;ve used it previously as recommended by my nails professional and it works the best of anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m done with artificial nails. Just not worth the damage it does to your natural nail and the pain of recovery after!</li>
    <li> Found this out and returned it without even opening it. It was not written that it was part of the ingredients</li>
    <li> Ran across this stuff by chance after trying to find a product that strengthens and grows my nails quickly, will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> My Nail tech told me about this stuff. . . it&#x27;s fantastic!!  THE best nail hardener on the market right now!!  I would recommend this seller . . . competitively --&gt; best price I found &amp; I searched!! Shipped quickly . . and product was as promised!!</li>
    <li> Its okay, but the really glossy, more than most nail hardeners. I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails since I applied it, so I&#x27;m just waiting for the results.</li>
    <li> Great polish...have seen a difference in the strength and growth of the nails. Very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Quimica Nail Hardner is amazing, it really hardens the nail, stays on even when you put your hands in water. This is the 2nd bottle I have used and it is helping my nails a great deal!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because after I used it I had a very strong  pain inside all my nails. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
    <li> This is the most fantastic product I have ever tried for hardening my nails. I have followed the directions faithfully for about two years now and it has never failed. I have read other reviews regarding the stinging sensation if you get it on cuticles or skin and I simply don&#x27;t have that problem. I take it with me to the salon where I get my nails done and use it as the base coat. When I get home I usually apply one or two top coats and my manicure lasts for TWO WEEKS. I had the most horrible, weakest, splitting nails, prior to using this product, now I have strong nails that don&#x27;t break or split. For the price you MUST try this product.</li>
    <li> I recently had my gel nails removed (best thing I&#x27;ve ever done) but my real nails were in bad shape.  My manicurist used this on my nails in the salon, so I got some for myself. It&#x27;s okay but it doesn&#x27;t leave a nice finish on the nails.  I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps because it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me.  I finally have naile that I like to look at.  They don&#x27;t sliver and peel away, and it is nice not to hide my hands.</li>
    <li> Love this product it makes my nails hard and strong. I have not found anything better for my nails. Love it!</li>
    <li> excellent..but use it almost dailly.. to protect nails.</li>
    <li> u know the  cereal commercial if mikey likes its it great. I am a  manicurist and it worked on my client of 25 years that I have tried everything.  She know has long nails  use it right read the directions IT WORKS</li>
    <li> I use to bite my nails and had a had time getting ride off that horrible habit until i started using Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener. your nails will be thankful. they will grow faster and harder. I don&#x27;t even need nail polish</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a dozen nail hardeners and this is the only one that really works for me. No more artificial nails!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Makes your nails look SUPER shiny.  It lasts and lasts!  I&#x27;m a nurse and I literally wash my hands hundreds of times between nail care and my nails look WONDERFUL!</li>
    <li> The last time I purchased this from amazon it was amazing.  This time I don&#x27;t know if the bottles are old or not but the liquid is very thick and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> My soft nails are so much stronger now that I&#x27;ve been using this product.  Make sure to follow the directions, and you shouldn&#x27;t have problems with the burning</li>
    <li> My Husband is in the beauty business, and he loves this polish. He has his hands in water all day and this is great keeps his nails looking fantastic</li>
    <li> This caused pain in my fingers after a few days and I have stopped using it... a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wow !! This is the best product for make a beautiful and strong nail.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my nails getting any stronger.  The polish does last longer than regular brands. I have no problems with any burning or tingling that others have commented on.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome...works GREAT! My nails are as hard as if I were using gel polishes. I recommend it for women of all age groups</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it on everyday and I also recommend it to all my family and friends to try it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever tried! And I tried many!! For the first time in my life I have beautiful nails!</li>
    <li> This is my second dual purchase of this hardener. This polish is a bit thick so when applying as a base coat make sure you only use one thin coat and let it dry before applying your next color coat. If it gets on your skin it will burn, but it is nothing that a cold water hand dump won&#x27;t cure.</li>
    <li> Was introduced to this product by a co-worker. Love!!!!! My nails are so much stronger which makes it so much easier for my natural nail to grow. Burning sensation during thie first week or so of use. But hey... Its worth it. I&#x27;m Saving so much money by not having to go to the salon every two weeks for uv gel tips.</li>
    <li> Love the product itself and continue to purchase it.  However, the brush has come loose from the top several times, making it difficult to use.  Also the product becomes too thick to use with about one third left in the bottle.</li>
    <li> I had being using this product for 3 yrs and it never fells it just amazing! My nails are healthier, stronger and growing every week..</li>
    <li> This works! My nail can actually survive without constant salon upkeep!!</li>
    <li> I thinks this polish actual works. My nails are very thin and are easy to break. I have been using this for about a month and my nails are longer than they have ever been but the polish get really nasty after 4-5 days. It doesn&#x27;t help to thicken your nails but they will grow. Maybe I need to use it more than once a week to get them to get thicker not sure. It will be worse the money. I work in an office with 7 women and all of us use this product. All have had growth so it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly for me.  I am on week 3.  All my nails have grown.  The 3 nails that I had that were ALWAYS chipping are not anymore.  They have caught up in length to the other nails.  Product never burned me.  So I guess everyone is different.  I did not apply this until a few months after I had my acrylics removed.  I am sure that helped.</li>
    <li> The best base coat bar none!!  I&#x27;ve used them all and this as a base coat nail hardener is unbeatable. I have very oily nail beds, gel polish peels off of me in a matter of days. Using this and allowing it to dry prior to polish application regular polis stays on for a week at least!</li>
    <li> Not sure how to review this nail hardener, it works great. Like better than any nail hardener i have ever used! But I am totally freaked out because it has formaldehyde in it. I googled formaldehyde and cancer.gov confirms it is a carcinogen. But I guess most nail hardeners include this ingredient. Who cares how nice my nails are if I have the Big C?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It really hardens your nails and lets them grow. My nails are a wonderful length that I could never get before I tried this stuff!</li>
    <li> i have peeling nails and this did not help at all.  i would not re-order this product as it does not do what it promises.</li>
    <li> I found this product while searching for an at home way to get my nails stronger. It is a great product, will last a long time, and its the only thing I have found that actually helps my nails grow.</li>
    <li> This is the best hardener for the nails I have ever tried. I have always had terrible nails and especially in the winter but this really works. I tell everyone that has the same problem I have to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It did not give me any discomfort ever either as some people said.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product, but it will peel off if too thick a coat is used.</li>
    <li> To start, i normally get a regular manicure with clear polish, so using this as a clear polish is great.  The shine is good and it lasts longer than normal clear polishes before chipping.  BUT, i raced to buy this after a friend said her manicurist was using on her for a while and her nails were hard as cement.  I have incredible soft nails, that rip, split, tear and crack frequently.  they are super soft.  I was eager to try.  It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks, you have to use twice a week and i&#x27;ve been using only once a week, but there is a reduction on the random splits and cracks.  but i&#x27;m still able to bend each nail really easily.  I&#x27;ll stick with it for about 6-months and hopefully the improvements will enhance.</li>
    <li> Best nail product I have ever used.  Before using Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener my nails were weak and always breaking.  Now I&#x27;m proud to where my rings and show my hands.  My nails never looked better.</li>
    <li> This definitely smells like formaldehyde and turpentine and jet fuel rolled together but it works incredibly well. I use this as a base coat (it takes extra time to dry, FYI) or sometimes on its own between manicures and my forever flimsy nails are now hard and long. Results last, but use consistently; I find that nails soften again if I go more than several weeks between applications.&lt;br /&gt;Also, take caution if you have any cuts/hangnails because this will burn.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m somebody who generally uses organic/natural beauty products (ones that actually work) and tries to avoid unnecessary exposure to chemicals unless it&#x27;s REALLY worth it, and this stuff is so effective that for me, it is.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years.  I have paper-thin fingernails that bend and tear. I also have two nails where the nail cracks down the middle...ouch!  This nail hardener prevents almost all tearing and bending. It also serves as a basecoat that extends my manicure by several days.  I am able to keep my nails all at the same length because of this nail hardener.  NOT a natural solution, but it keeps my hands looking well-groomed and professional.  But if it touches my cuticle, it burns for nearly 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> This nail hardener is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.  I use the Quimica Nail Hardener in conjunction with the Top Coat and the Cuticle Conditioner and have experienced wonderful results!</li>
    <li> Seems to really work. I use it under other nail polish and it seems to adhere well and chip less.</li>
    <li> Great product! I used it before, but stopped because it has harsh chemicals. It really does work by making your nails stronger and longer. I only use it sparingly because of the chemicals listed. I would recommend it to ladies (or men) if you want your nails to have that stronger and longer look, but use it when needed.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that helped heal my split thumbnail.  I saw a dermatologist three times, over a two year period, and thought I would just have to live with the problem. A friend gave me a bottle of Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener for my birthday, and I was willing to give it a try.  I think this particular nail hardener is responsible for the positive fix, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to several family members and friends.  I&#x27;ve used this nail hardener on my finger nails as well as my toe nails, for over a year, and I&#x27;ll be a life-time fan!</li>
    <li> I just love this product, my nails have never been so strong and healthy ever before. My nails are growing at a speedy rate. I will recommend this product to all my loved ones .</li>
    <li> This is one of the best hardeners I have ever tried.  I have been wearing &#x27;natural&#x27; nails for a few years since using this product.  No more gels or wraps and my nails are the strongest they have ever been.  This normally sells in stores for $10 or more per bottle.</li>
    <li> BEST HARDENER EVER.  I had previously rated 4 stars for burning and black spots.  However when used as directed I have found that this is by far the best hardener ever!  Please use as directed and start with only a thin coat to half of your nail, eventually building up to 2 thin coats.  I have hard nails that I must cut every 2 weeks to keep at an appropriate length.  I use this also as a top coat and my polish lasts for days.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> really works i have the best nails ever and if you use Nina polish the polish stays on until you take it off no chipping or pealing</li>
    <li> My nails naturally split and chip for anything.. ever since I&#x27;ve started using Quimica Alemana, my nails are hard, strong and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This product has hardened and made my nails 100% stronger. Only problem is the ingredients are those that have been removed from nail polishes, I assume for safety concerns, like formaldehyde. I keep it covered with polish so hopefully it&#x27;s safe for me.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. My nails would tare and peel and felt super thin prior to use of this product. Now, People ask if my real nails are &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;--- Love it!</li>
    <li> Quimica Alemana is the best nail hardener I have ever tried.  Great price, great quality, and it last for two weeks or more.  I love it!  It is this or get gel nails.  It saves time, money and energy LOL!  I have been using it for a long time and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product really works. My nails have hardened and  I have far fewer split nails. Polish stays on longer with far fewer chips.</li>
    <li> My nails look great -within two weeks I saw the different. As of today my nails look beautiful,  harder then they ever been in years.  Bye bye to nail shop add on fake nails. You will love this product.</li>
    <li> The Quimica Alemana nail strengthener really works! At first i was a little skeptical and afraid of the pain. But it&#x27;s really not bad at all just feels a little cold on your fingertips and that&#x27;s it. And it really works, my nails got longer than they&#x27;ve ever been without breaking or bending!</li>
    <li> My nails have gotten much thicker after about a month of use.  They have always been thin and brittle.  This is amazing!!  I have never had such strong nails.</li>
    <li> My nails would peel and break. Now they are long and strong. This is a must buy and I will never be without it!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, great polish !</li>
    <li> Peels off within a day and leaves thin nails behind.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!!!! It&#x27;s amazing! My nails haven&#x27;t broke or chipped in two weeks. I&#x27;ve been able to grow then out again.</li>
    <li> Definitely works as intended. My nails wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as long as they are now without this product. I do have to admit however, that the danger of accidentally burning yourself is very real. You have to be sure to follow the instructions EXACTLY as they are written. Only one layer and make it as thin as humanly possible. On occasion, I put on a layer that is a bit thicker than it should be and I get some throbbing on the nail that I went too heavy on but if you watch your layer thickness and follow the instructions properly it definitely works beautifully!</li>
    <li> Good price, fast delivery , good product !</li>
    <li> Every women should use it....</li>
    <li> It really works, makes nails harder &amp; stronger</li>
    <li> This looks like it came out of the Cuban black market. It burns a little when you first start using it and the questionable ingredients make me feel like I&amp;#34;m harming myself in the long run but it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;ll have long and strong nails when I die. It works wonders, I stopped using it for a while and couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow out like when I was using this.</li>
    <li> It is the best nail strengthened that I have ever used.  My nails were splitting before I used this product.  I have used it now for about 4 months and I definitely see a big improvement, that is why I ordered more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick but it works wonder... I experienced some discomfort when I first started using it, but it passed after a few weeks. Love this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years.  My nails have never looked so great.  I now have long nails which is something I&#x27;ve never had in the past.  It adds strength &amp; helps protect your nail polish so you can go at least a week or two in-between manicures.&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased this when Hoda Kotb said it was one of her favorite things.  Thank you Hoda!</li>
    <li> Once it dries, it is the absolute best. I polish over it. It lasts for 2 weeks. Better than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> This nail hardener is amazing, I wasn&#x27;t able to have long nails for the last 4 years, now thanks to Quimica Alemana my&lt;br /&gt;nails are hard, long and beautiful. Thanks,</li>
    <li> This is the only product i have used that really keeps my nails from splitting and breaking. My sister-in-law recommended it and i have been using it ever since. Great product. Hardens nails- You can even feel the strenthening in your nails when you remove the hardener.</li>
    <li> After removing my acrylic nails, I was left with ragged, tissue paper nails. I had deep ridges and thought I would never have nice nails. My nails had never been naturally nice or long and I was looking for something to help. I fellow Mani-Diaries member told me about this product. She said to use this daily for a week, remove and switch to OPI Nail Envy for a week. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now and I actually have decent looking nails, it&#x27;s so strange to not see my nails bitten down into the meat....&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike...the color starts to turn yellowish after the second or third day. But it is worth it for the great results.</li>
    <li> my nails were peeling and i could never grow them, i always had to cut them extremely short or they would peel and break. My friend suggested quimica. even though there were people who said that they had burning/painful sensations when applying quimica i decided to go for it. it didn&#x27;t burn at all for me. i&#x27;ve been stripping and reapplying quimica about 1-2 times a week and now 2 months later my nails look beautiful.  they are no longer peeling and are much stronger so i can actually grow them longer.  the product makes the nails look shiny and look good even without applying a color nail polish.  i would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I never thought that I&#x27;d have &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; nails!  It was a long process, but now my nails are long and lovely and require only minimal care.  No more acrylics for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different nail hardeners and this one is definitely the best. A little smelly but worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mother whose nail technician suggested it.  Her nails have been as thin as onion skin for as long as I can remember so I figured why not give it a shot.  At her last appointment her nail tech had to cut her nails back as they had gotten too long.  It took a couple of months but the results are nothing less than amazing.  THANK YOU!!!  My mom loves you!!!</li>
    <li> Just best product  and price is so low - you have to try,nothing to lose  BEST PRODUCT . I love it.  :) :)</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has struggled to grow long pretty nails. I have only used this product for a couple of months and can see a difference. I love the fact that I actually have nails to paint now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this before.  I do like it (hence buying a double pack). Apply it fast as it dries fast (still smudges if yr not careful) I&#x27;ve never had a burning sensation. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is once it starts peeling off of the tip my nails break really easily if I don&#x27;t reply it again real quick. not necessarily fault of the polisher but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t actually hard in the nail it&#x27;s just hardening because of the polish.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I wish I had before pictures of my nails so I could show a before and after.  My nails have always been thin, weak and prone to peeling and breaking.  I started taking Biotin and using Lemony Flutter cuticle cream from Lush and there was some improvment to my nails, less peeling as they were better moisturized and seemed a bit thicker.  Then I started using the Quimica just over 3 months ago and now my nails are definitely thicker and harder while still being flexible and not brittle.  They don&#x27;t peel at all and don&#x27;t break unless something drastic happens.  They have grown longer and stayed long and healthy.  I believe the Quimica was the final piece in my nail care routine so that I finally achieved strong, healthy, beautiful nails. I have also noticed it is a fantastic base coat and really keeps my polish adhered to my nails. I didn&#x27;t have any sensations of burning or pain after applying, but I know some people have experienced that.  Not every product works well for everyone and allergies and sensitivities may keep this product from being right for everyone who tries it.  I will also mention I garden, do housework, type and craft regularly but my nails now hold up to all of that provided I wear gloves when needed and stick to my regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes the nails grow quickly and much stronger.  Shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Great product for your nails...it really works and strengthens your nails 100%.</li>
    <li> The only product that has ever hardened my peeling and fragile nails. I can finally grow long nails that don&#x27;t peel.</li>
    <li> Nothing makes my nails strong and resilient except for this product.  Don&#x27;t get it on your cuticles, but otherwise it is simply wonderful!!</li>
    <li> Hoping it does what it is advertised to do.  Have only used it twice so can&#x27;t really offer an opinion</li>
    <li> Great product for people who have weak nails.  Use this product a few times a week and your nails will become stronger and be able to grow longer.</li>
    <li> I love this product, worth every penny my nails have never been this long ever, and it last a pretty long time. intially it did take about 3 months for me to see my nails really grow but after that it consistently staid long. I love it, i have repurchased this product 3 times and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several year and my nails have never looked better or been stronger. Just use one coat.</li>
    <li> My nails had started splitting and breaking. Bought this product with the hopes of strengthening them. The first application was applied, and within 3 days I had broken 4 nails. Just thought this was coincidence. I applied it for the 2nd time yesterday and broke 2 nails already. I totally wasted my money on this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Since I began using this my nails rarely break and they grow more quickly.  It makes your nails very hard. I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling using it but if you have a small cut it makes it sting.</li>
    <li> Believe it or not my teen girl never had long nails before this product OMG she totaly have the most beautiful and stronger nails ever ..thank you i defetnetly recommended the seller and the product</li>
    <li> One day while watching the Today program, I heard Kathy Lee and Hoda talking about how much they like the \\&quot;little green bottle\\&quot;. Over the years, I have tried several nail hardeners and was never satisfied.  Since I have been pleased with other products they recommended, I decided to order the Quimica Alemana.  I am happy to report that I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Amazon sells good thing I am very happy except for the watch that I bought it faded in color cheaply made</li>
    <li> I had very soft and brittle nails but i heard so much about quimica and i thought i&#x27;d try it with the mavala scientifique they worked perfectly for a fe months but then my nails started to break again,,, don&#x27;t know why or from which of them but they just did,, also i noticed that when i remove the polish my nails are soft !!</li>
    <li> Made my fingertips and nails hurt.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for long while. I bring it to the salon when I have my nails manicured. My nails are much stronger now and rarely break. If you  have weak nails  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail hardeners, but my nails have never looked this good.  I am a beauty blogger focused on nail art, so my hands see a lot of acetone (I probably change my polish every day!) My nails are very prone to peeling and cracking.  Using this and a regimen of cuticle oil and hand cream, and my nails aren&#x27;t quite so nubby any more!</li>
    <li> Very nice.  Happy with my purchase.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My nails are very thin and I can never grow them out because they break off.  With this product, they are strong as &#x27;nails&#x27; and they look better now than ever before.....</li>
    <li> I gave that rate because Ilike it&amp;#62; is very good and I recommended.A friend recommended to me and I use every week. My nails are very strong and I use this product every week. I loveit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Really works!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nails grow real fast, and strong.&lt;br /&gt;No more problems with chipping, flaking or broken nails.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Works great.</li>
    <li> loved it!! really works</li>
    <li> Really works!! Don&#x27;t hesitate this product really works I have 10 perfect nails since I started using it in December.  Apply every day on seventh day remove all and start again applying 1 coat each day. Word of advice if you have a cut on your nail on on your skin and this product gets in it the throbbing pain is unbelievable!!!  So keep this product away from any cut!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of all the wonderful reviews and I needed a good product to harden my brittle nails. I followed the instructions, but it felt like I dipped my finger tips in acid. I removed the product immediately, but the burning continued for about 3 hours. I have used a lot of products but never one that burned my nails and surrounding skin like this.</li>
    <li> really works to strenghten weaker nails</li>
    <li> The best out.  I always had paper thin nails until I started  using this product.  I don&#x27;t fret anymore whenever I break a nail because I know it will grow back. The are nice and strong!</li>
    <li> Good product for hardening nails.</li>
    <li> My nail have never looked so good!</li>
    <li> This is a repeat purchase and review.  This item really works and is less expensive than many products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I had my nails like a paper before I started using it!!! Now they are stronger than tips. I use it for couple years already and I am buying it for all my friends and they are happy too. some of them had some pain, but only at the beginning of using it. Great product!!! I would love to find something as good for my hair...</li>
    <li> Very good nail strengthener &amp; base coat!</li>
    <li> this product is the only one I found that doesn&#x27;t peel off right away.  It lasts at least a week and my nails are much better.</li>
    <li> This product assists in growing my nails. I use it two to three times a week  easy to use and dries quickly</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a product that would keep my nail polish from chipping after a couple days, and this hardener does the trick. It also has protected my nails so they rarely break. I have to file them down because they get so long. I received the product on time and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I was supposed to receive two and only received one.</li>
    <li> This is the best.my nails are long and strong.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! I have had my nails done for years.  For the first time, my nails look like I had acrylics.  They no longer peel and crack.  Just make sure you use it as directed.  Only need a coat once or twice a week.  Do not put a coat on every day.  You will not need it.  I actually had to file my nails down because they were too long.  I am thrilled with the results!</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see great results.  My nails are paper thin.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It works for my nails.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail hardener ive used hands down. its the only thing to make my nails not chip and grow. ive been using it for about a month and started seeing a difference in growth within 2 weeks. you should only apply 1 thin layer...i made the mistake of putting 2 and my nails hurt really bad. i now put 1 new layer with nail polish on sunday and one new layer with top coat on wed. twice a week is all you need! ive never had my nails this long and i and thankful for this product. i am however going to give my nails a 2 week rest from this product just to let my nails breathe.</li>
    <li> i love this product it got here before indicated and its a must have for lifeeee&lt;br /&gt;i will deff buy it off here rather than the drug store where they go for $10 a bottle</li>
    <li> I bought this product again. It has kept my nails growing and healthier.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I was expecting. I did not see any improvement plus this thing takes for ever to dry. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> I just love how this thong WORKS.! I can say Its a miracle bottle. Totally recommend it if your looking to grow long nails</li>
    <li> Excellent product - delivered on time</li>
    <li> Great nail hardener!!!</li>
    <li> I have been use Quimica Alemanha for years. I love it and my nails is actually long and strong. It used to cause litle pain at the beginning but once you learn to avoid cuticles... no pain. Love it.  One more thing, make sure you use every week even though ur nails is long and strong they will get weak fast if you stop using it...</li>
    <li> I have finger nails past the end of my fingers for the first time in 30 years.  I love it, and I recomend to my friends.  Thank you</li>
    <li> It took about almost 6 months for me to see a differences in my nails</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice. I have never had long nails like I have with this product. Just don&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
    <li> It burned my nails ;( I gave it away and for some people the burning stopped after a few applications but if it burns like that then I dont need a few applications 1 is enough!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past few months and I see a big difference in my nails. They are growing and seem not to break as much as they had previously done. I even bought a bottle for my daughter to start using.</li>
    <li> stopped wearing wraps because of this product, nails rarely ever break.  love it, use it on toenails too, put on first, before polish</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Can no longer find it locally and is the only thing I have found that actually does what it says it will.  I have very pretty shaped nails but they are very soft and fexible.  For years I was known for my long beautiful nails......thanks to this product I now have them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have and will recommend this product to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> The very best nail hardener every  Nails have never been stronger!  Highly recommend....You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Apply as a base coat and later in about 5 days apply on top of your polish.</li>
    <li> It really works you must use this weekly. In about 3 months you will see a big difference in the strength of your nail and it length.</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever for growing my nails.  I have so much trouble with my weak nails and with this product they actually grow long enough for me to have to cut them.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> someone told me about this product when I was having trouble growing my nails.  Her dermatologist said it is fine to use and if you are allerigic to it, you will know right away.  I tried it and have now told everyone I know about it.  My nails are strong and healthy again.  Everyone I have told about it who has used it loves it too.  Way cheaper then fake nails that need to be done every 2 weeks.  I have been using it for about a year, of course only once every week or every 2 weeks now and I still LOVE it.</li>
    <li> This is the best nail hardener and growth formula you&#x27;ll ever use!!! I get so many compliments on my nails. Only put one coat or two thin ones per week. If you try to put a thick coat or several thick coats it will sting and hurt your nail bed.</li>
    <li> My nails are stronger after only using the product twice a week for a month.</li>
    <li> love it, best hardener</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  My nails have become strong in a short period of time. BUT, be very careful NOT to get it on your cuticles.  It throbs for awhile!</li>
    <li> It strengthens the weakest nails like no other product I have ever tried.  Simply unbelievable.  You have to try it.</li>
    <li> The directions clearly state to TEST the hardener on the tips for several weeks before applying to the whole nail. Those who feel no burning at the tips are told to go ahead and apply to the rest of the nail, but with caution, and in thin coats. I just took off acrylic nails a couple of months ago, and wanted to find a hardener to have them grow long (I&#x27;m a nail biter). I would condition my nails several times per day with vitamin E oil and Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter Cuticle Cream (also highly recommend). My nails were thickened a little bit, and once I put on this hardener AS DIRECTED, I felt no pain, and continued to apply it to all of my nails with no problem. My nails have grown considerably in the last several weeks, and I will continue to use this product as stated by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;READ THE DIRECTIONS, KIDS! Don&#x27;t ignore the \\&quot;use with caution\\&quot; statements then complain when you get burned (literally) for applying this product incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I have been using this nail hardener once a week under my gel polish for about a month now. I have natural nails that are not damaged, but I use my hands a lot and want to keep my nails from bending, cracking, and chipping. I have experienced no discomfort using this product. It does go on slightly yellow, but since I put colored polish on over it that does not matter to me. It does not appear to discolor the nail itself. My nails have gotten stronger and longer. They can take a lot more abuse now. The existing cracks and tears are growing out and I have not seen any new ones forming. I am glad that I purchased the the pack of 2 bottles as I intend to keep using this product. I apply it to my entire bare nail but I am careful to not get it on my cuticles. UPDATE: I have been using the nail hardener for several months now and I am very impressed by how strong and healthy my nails look now. I used to have a nail or two that appeared pulled up from the nail bed at my fingertip and was unsightly. Now all of my nails are uniform with a nice white half moon beyond the fingertip. I am very pleased with the results of using this product. It is definitely the best nail hardener that I have ever used. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best base coat i have found.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my nails healthy and sturdy.  Sometimes in between gel manicures my nails get too soft and split.  Quimica Alemana brings them back to life!</li>
    <li> no more cracking, peeling, chipping nails with this product.  Bring it with me to the nail salon as a base coat</li>
    <li> I have been using this product many years. It really works very well.I wash my hands many times a day due to my job, this product protects my nails. Thank you</li>
    <li> It works wonders for me! Although it does make my finger nails hurt for a little while. ouch ! !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple of weeks and I already notice a difference in my nails.  My nails feel stronger and have stopped splitting for the most part.</li>
    <li> This product is great for weak,peeling nails,makes them stronger,and looking good.Didn&#x27;t feel  any burning sensation or pain when  applied it.</li>
    <li> A few moments after application my fingers began to burn so I quickly removed. I would not recommend this product. It has a really strong smell and contains formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING !BEST NAIL HARDENER EVER !!!! BEST PRICE ALSO</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product, and it doesn&#x27;t seize to amaze me. 100% would recommend.</li>
    <li> My nails used to chip and split. I go for manicures about once every three weeks and I ask the manicurist to use this product as a base coat. Since I started with this stuff, I&#x27;ve noticed a big improvement. The nails rarely split and they seem much stronger.  They don&#x27;t seem to chip  as much as they used to.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This is one of the only nail hardeners that I have repurchased for myself. The bottles last a very long time so this is a good price for 2 bottles. This is a thicker polish which didn&#x27;t bother me but if it does, a little nail polish thinner goes a long way to helping that issue.</li>
    <li> If You want beutifull mails You mist ti buy this product. To Grow And Grow. I love it. I recomend 100%</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I’ve never had nails before until not.  There was little burning sensation at first(which lasted about a minute) but then I was fine. Yes, I would recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Cant live without it! No words to describe my love for this product. It is amazing. My nails grow beautiful and hard. Ive been using it for years non stop faithfully.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Makes nails strong and grow.  It really works if you stick to it.  Apply it every 3 days days depending on nail situation or once a week alone or as basecoat. Make sure you apply a thin layer as polish is very thick and will get bubbles if applied to thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Too thick gets lumpy after a while. Have to start a new bottle every time bottle is half way done. Takes a few mins to dry. Try to apply evenly and not do too many strokes. The thinner the coat the better. Some people might experience sensitivity. It also has a somewhat strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;But it definetly works! Good luck!</li>
    <li> this really works, best best best</li>
    <li> Works amazing!!! It works as a hardener but also keeps nail polish on for two weeks or more! My nails are longer &amp; stronger than they have ever been</li>
    <li> Your nails will grow.  I had terrible nails, now I have ok nails.  not a miracle worker but a product I buy over and over.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I found that works in strengthening my nails, highly recommend it. I wear it as a base under polish</li>
    <li> All I can say is it&#x27;s a miracle in a jar...I have recommended it to all my friends..cracked split nails heal within 2 weeks...nails look clean, healthier at the first use.</li>
    <li> point blank. period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;use this twice a week under your nail polish OR as is and see results in just about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my friends use this and her nails are SO LONG they look like they&#x27;ve been wrapped at the salon, her secret.... this nail hardener.&lt;br /&gt;the local nail salon sells one bottle for $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this right here is a steal.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; you wont regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES BURN THE FIRST FEW TIMES OF USE ON A COUPLE OF FINGERS.&lt;br /&gt;I ASSUME ITS PROBABLY BC THE NAILS ARENT STRONG ENOUGH TO TOLERATE THE CHEMICALS... BUT JUST DAP A LITTLE NAIL POLISH REMOVER ON IT TO COOL THE BURN OR PUT UNDER COLD WATER. THE BURN LASTS MAYBE 10 MINUTES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORTH THE BURN. :]</li>
    <li> I purchased this hardener for my teenage daughter and myself after reading several reviews.  Both of us experienced stinging and pain in our fingernails soon after application.  We googled to see if others had experienced this and found many who had.  One person went to the doctor with what he characterized as &amp;#34;chemical burns.&amp;#34;  I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever made my nails stronger and helped them to grow longer. Will continue to buy</li>
    <li> I have healthy but weak nails.  They just bend and crack at the sides so that I can&#x27;t grow them long.  This nail hardener helped.  No, I don&#x27;t now have rock hard nails, but I&#x27;d guess they are at least 50-80% harder and I can grow them long enough that they aren&#x27;t embarrassing any more.</li>
    <li> I had written a review a couple months back but now that I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6-7 months, I must revisit. This hardener is truly amazing. I realized that the longer you use it, the better it works. I just ordered two more bottles. I am constantly hitting and snagging my nails on all types of things and I&#x27;m afraid to look at the damage but when i look, to my surprise, my nail is still in tact! Not a chip, not a split, nothing! My nails are so hard, they are loud when i tap them on a hard surface. I do tons of housework, using Windex and washing dishes, moving furniture, etc, and still my nails are protected by Quimica Alemana....simply amazing product.</li>
    <li> The best nail hardener EVER! Almost 2wks before it starts to chip!!! Once you try this you&#x27;ll  never use another nail hardener!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price, and leave your nails HARD! No chipping. Last for weeks. Shiny! I&#x27;m in love with this nail polish and would love to spread the word on it. It&#x27;s a product from Colombia &amp; very exclusive! Makes your nails grow within one week!</li>
    <li> I am so happy with my purchase, this product really work, my nail was a mess, weak, spliting and couldn&#x27;t get them to grow, now I have beauitful nails with Ouimica Alemana Nail Hardener and I was able to order it and received it in just a few day. Thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> I paid $15 for one of these bottles at the salon. Thank goodness for these deals!! This stuff has saved my nails!!! They were like paper before. So thin, constant splitting. A dear friend suggested this stuff and my nails are stronger than ever. Absolutely no splitting. I&#x27;ve only broken one nail since I started using this (4 months ago). I use a light to medium layer of this magical stuff, then a base coat, then a color, then the top coat and my nails are wonderful for AT LEAST a week. This is the best stuff I could ever recommend. ND for two bottles,  you can&#x27;t beat this price. Shipping was very quick too!! I will be a repeat customer for sure!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME!!  It really works!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish.  It is so easy to destroy your nails, be it washing the dishes, painting, cooking, etc etc - I always find a way to break my weak nails.  This stuff has revolutionized my nail health!  I love the shiny, thick coat (which goes on so easily).  I usually do two coats and it lasts about 10 days (before I get paint or marker on them).  My nails are strong and healthy - and best of all is that it doesn&#x27;t leave them yellow!  I&#x27;d highly recommend this over anything you can buy in a drug store.  Even my nail salon uses it (for an extra $10)!</li>
    <li> Best best best nail hardener ever!!!! Made my nails grow the longest I&#x27;ve ever had them in my life. Usually my nails would break with a sudden movement such as lifting the cars door handel or a cabinet. This stuff hardens your nails so they can take some impact, you can see the difference if you have weak nails like me. Worth a shot for the price since it really does work.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery! I ordered the product late Friday night, &amp; today is Monday &amp; I just received my product! Now to see how well this works. I can grow beautiful nails but after they are long they break really easy. I&#x27;ve tried lots of nail hardeners &amp; they seem to work for bit my nails always end up breaking! I read lots of greats reviews on this product so I hope it works for me!</li>
    <li> My nails were impossible after removing acrylics I had for seven years. I have only used this product for a couple of monthsy, but had immediate results.  No more splitting or cracking. Love it.</li>
    <li> My nails would chip all the time and break off before they even have a chance to get a little longer. My manicurist recommended this base polish, and I really loved it. It dries really fast and makes your nails strong fast. However, you must use it all the time. Once I went on a work trip and didn&#x27;t have this nail polish with me. It did ruin my long nails (maybe the climate change, maybe all the luggages, and running around). So now I came back and started using it again: my nails are on the way to recovery :)</li>
    <li> Unbelievable, after I start to use this coat…after years of using wrap nails…my nails look amazingly healthy!!!&lt;br /&gt;they have a great promotion pack of 2</li>
    <li> The polish itself is great but I cannot open the second bottle.  I was going to try and find out who sent it/sold it and try and contact them.  I lost the first bottle on a trip and then tried to open the second bottle.  Have used wrench.....strong arms....everything but it will not open.  I want to return this.  What can I do.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Linda Markus</li>
    <li> I used to have nails that chipped very easily. I tried other nail hardeners to protect my nails, but this one is the best. I wear it under polish or alone and my nails have grown much stronger. The only reason that I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it has a very strong smell. Use a fan or open a window when you use it!</li>
    <li> I have lived by this product for years... 11 years ago i made the transition from fake nails to all natural and by just getting a simple manicure and using 2 coats of this polish by its self once a week.... my nails have never looked better. I cannot go a day without getting a complement or having someone stop me and ask how i get my nails to grow so long... I simply pull out the bottle and show them. This stuff really works. its going on 11 years now and i literally have to cut my nails every 3 to 4 months because they grow so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must warn you... especially if your are just transitioning to natural nails... THIS PRODUCT DOES BURN! In fact for the first few months of using this product i got bruises under my nail... But hey that&#x27;s a small price to pay and it only burns while your nails are thin and weak.  Once your nails become stronger, the burning goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 11 years later my nails are no longer dependent on the product so i no longer need to use the product as frequently.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I use it all the time!</li>
    <li> I have been using for 2 years.  My nails get so long I have to cut them back.  No splitting anymore...even my cuticles are better.  Use as base coat.  I do two coats.  Dries fast!  Then use your polish and top coat.  Sometimes I wear the two coats of Quimica alone without polish.  I have never had any tingling or pain as others have noted.  It is made with Formaldehyde, so it does not surprise me that some may have a different reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy 2 bottles, you will want them!  Halfway thru the bottle it gets too thick to use properly.</li>
    <li> I have always had soft nails and hade a hard time growing them out but have seen a remarkable difference after using this product. I apply it every other day and remove at the end of the week and start over. My nails have greatly improved and have grown in strength and hardness. I really recommend this product. I think part of the key is to keep a few coats on at all times and I also use gloves religiously when I am doing the dishes.</li>
    <li> anything this german company sells is great for your nails and they grow really fast  I have also purchased the nail hardener which is my favorite nails grow and never break hard as a rock I bought two at a time because I use it everytime i give myself a manicure</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by a friend who insisted her manicures last longer with this product. So far, my nails seem stronger.</li>
    <li> Best nail hardener ever used.  Had to put it on about twice a week</li>
    <li> Really great product. My nails are super strong after using for a few weeks. My nails usually get weak and peel during the winter.  Since using Quimica I have had fast and strong nail growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also a great base coat for polish. I have noticed little to no chipping when using this.</li>
    <li> If you aren&#x27;t allergic to the ingredients  and use it correctly (please read the other reviews outlining this) then it is magic! Yes there is formaldehyde in it, but chemically it&#x27;s truly the only thing that will make your nails strong. Do your research, see if it&#x27;s right for you. It really does work for the right people!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the worst weakest nails and in just 2 weeks I&#x27;ve seen major improvements. Start out with thin coats because you will feel tingling if you proceed to use like a regular nail polish. So glad I found after 30+ years of looking for something to harden and grow my nails</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this hardener a few times in the past. I have horrible thin,peeling nails and my grandmother who is in her 80&#x27;s is the one who said you have to try this. Works magic for me!</li>
    <li> Is&#x27;t really good for healty nails and strong .Im used every week this base in my manicure and i have  wonderfull  results.</li>
    <li> The only issue was that it looked like one of them wasn&#x27;t properly sealed and had started getting hard. Other than that, everything was ok.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> This product works wonders. The first time you do apply it, it does apply pressure to your nails which does hurt. At times, it was unbearable but no pain, no gain. After a few weeks, I noticed that my nails grew both long and strong. They do not chip as easy and I love that.</li>
    <li> Like this product very much</li>
    <li> I really like this one and totally recommend it. It worked for me.</li>
    <li> Nails seem fortified by this product. It is easy to apply &amp; stays on for a long time. It very cost effective.</li>
    <li> I used for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t see a difference.  I&#x27;m sure it works differently for everyone. I will try a different product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My nails have NEVER been so long and so strong. If you follow the directions, it is amazing.</li>
    <li> A friend brought me this product after a visit to her homeland of Colombia, South America.  She said that she always heard me complaining about my nails.  WOW!!!!  My nails look fantastic and my 82 year old Mom&#x27;s nails have never looked better.  And now I can purchase it online!  I received my order with no problems.  I am so pleased.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> If your giving your nails a break from gel manis or acrylic, this would be a bit sensitive in the beginning, but it will harden your nails and make them grow.  Make sure you do not apply polish to your cuticle. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and my nails are strong again and getting longer...thanks!!</li>
    <li> Fast and reliable service. Excellent purchase for the price. I will definitely purchase this item again in the future.  thanks</li>
    <li> My nails are growing like wildfire and are finally not chipping.  Polish leaves a super shiny finish.  Nail polish stays on a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Nails get longer and stronger within days.  Be careful not to overdo it because it can start to have a burning sensation on your skin around the nail.  Be careful applying.  Not suggested for girls under 18</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product in ALL my years of being on this earth that has worked to keep my nails long and strong.  I have never had long nails that stayed long for any length of time and then to have to cut them down because they are too long.  That only happened when using this product.  Be sure to only use one coat at a time, using any more may cause discomfort.</li>
    <li> Works just works as advertised. I&#x27;ve bought several.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately  I slacked on using it as instructions, but who recommended it loved it and for sure feels it made a difference on her nails.  So try it but follow instructions.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended by my cousin. I really like how this product looks on my nails and how I saw results with the first application. The only thing that I dislike about this product is that after applying it on my nails my fingers hurt a lot! I had to dip my finger in rubbing alcohol for a few minutes, it really help the pain go away :)</li>
    <li> my nail&#x27;s have always had problems, chipping, soft,peeling. Not anymore !!!! Now i have nice long nail, everyone ask me if there mine. Yes they are!! Hope i can always beable to get \\&quot;Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener\\&quot;. Love this hardener.</li>
    <li> Follow instructions. Look them up for details on facebook. Didn&#x27;t experience any true discomfort. Did experience some yellowing, but it does buff off easily. Nails have never been more beautiful. Purchase more than one bottle. You will love it and it becomes thick quickly making it harder to apply. It&#x27;s amazing!!!</li>
    <li> How many products have you tried that promised to prevent your nails from cracking and peeling? I know I have tried a lot, but unbelievably, Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener is the only product I have ever tried that actually works.</li>
    <li> My nails look great and are so strong .  Lasts and lasts.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I have recommended it to friends who also agree that their nails have grown better and gotten stronger.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this at my hair salon that is now closed.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is the best nail hardener I have ever used and really works!</li>
    <li> Best nail hardener ever.  Use as a base coat &amp; then use as a top coat one a week......My nails used to chip &amp; layer all the time but not anymore......This hardener is the bes ever......</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have found this product and the amazing work it does. I was also pleased that I do not have to drive to Miami to buy the product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I always buy two and share with my friend. Our nails have not been better. It is an excellent product and we take it to the nail salon and they use it as the base coat weekly.I have seem many others at the salon with the same green box. Highly recommended for nail strengthening.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about all nail hardeners, my long history of disappointment with similar products on my mind. I became a believer after 4 weeks of use. My nails are normally very brittle, bending under little to no pressure, but after using this product my nails are capable of opening a can of pop without flinching under the pressure. This product works!!!</li>
    <li> Only been a few days &amp; I haven&#x27;t seen my nails grow any longer. However,  this nail harderner give my nails a beautiful shine. I really do like how healthy my nails are starting to look.  I will keep using it and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Best nail polish ever! Keeps my nails strong and shiny, I use it as base and top and it keeps my nail polish on longer! Love it!</li>
    <li> IN 3 MONTHS MY NAILS WHERE BEAUTIFUL; AT 6 MONTHS THEY WERE TO DIE FOR,SMOOTH,HARD, WHITE TIPS AND CUTICLES WERE NICE NOT RAGED . LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> I have been biting my nails for over 10 years and couldn&#x27;t stop. Whenever I would try to grow my nails out and stop biting them, they would break and peel. I decided to try a this nail hardener in hopes of growing my nails. I use the product once a week- under manicures or on its own. The polish dries super fast and is smooth and clear. It does not wear off or peel like other hardeners...my nails look and feel bare with the product. I noticed a difference after a week of using the product. My nails were finally growing and they were stronger than ever. Its been about 7 weeks and my nails are grown past my fingers and have not broken...This has never happened before!! Everyone I show my nails to are so amazed. I am so happy with this product and would recommend this product to anyone who wants strong beautiful natural nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the product smells strong and stings at first use but it only lasts a minute. The results are definitely worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Greatly improves mail health, stopped my nails from peeling. Just put it on a little away from the cuticle or it burns.</li>
    <li> I must have it you can&#x27;t grow nails.</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff is amazing. My nails are chip and split very easily. I have tried to grow long nails my whole life without good results. I have tried many, many, many, nail hardness which all chip off within a day. This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that really works. I put it on 4 days ago and looks like it did the first day. Nails are stronger and have a beautiful shine. I will never be without this.</li>
    <li> I have always had thin, flexible nails that split or tear easily. I tried every type of nail hardener available and never really saw results. I finally resorted to acrylic nails, which looked great but were very high maintenance, so I decided to go natural again. Holy cow, my nails were really wrecked from the acrylic applications, and I was desperate. I did some research and found this product. I did not see any noticeable results for several weeks, and then as my nails grew out, I saw tremendous improvement. My nails are much harder and hardly ever split, tear, or peel any more. After two months of consistent use (applying a new coat weekly) I am amazed. Wish I&#x27;d found this before I had the acrylics done, it would have saved me a lot of time and money. Great stuff for bad nails.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly and you will have beautiful long nails.  I learned about this on the Today Show w/ Hoda and Kathie Lee.  They were right on here!</li>
    <li> My nails looks great. I find that from week to week, my polish stays on better, they never chip.  They do not look like I even need to change the polish. Plus my nails seem like they are getting stronger :) I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Quimica Alemana Nail Hardener 0.47oz \\&quot;Pack of 2\\&quot; is an amazing product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004WG4CQ6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
    <li> Makes your nails super strong. Will make them grow! Have been using this since 2009.  Really does work!!</li>
    <li> My nails are stronger and grow faster than ever before.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me. My nails did not grow they actually broke. I am going to try the process one more time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M AMAZED WHEN LOOKING AT MY NAILS.  THEY ARE GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> My nail tech uses this at the salon I go to.  It really does smooth out the nail and provides strength.  Does smell like formaldehyde.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s worked like I expected.</li>
    <li> No big changes with this product.  My nails are still thin and splitting.  I will keep searching for the right product.  Any suggestions?</li>
    <li> I used the product for about one week and my fingers surrounding the nails (not the cuticle) were hurting.  As soon as I stopped and started to use the Duri Rejuvacote it stopped hurting.  I would not use this product again. My sister in Florida told me all er friends were using it and loved it.  Not for me I guess</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products for nails that I have used, it makes it grow fast, and strong.</li>
    <li> Unbelievable nourishment and protection for your nails</li>
    <li> Amazing product helped my nails a lot first time in my life I have hard and long nails!! Third time buying this product.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective nail hardener. Yes, it contains chemicals, just like many nail care products on the market. I&#x27;ve read reviews that indicate that people have applied this to their entire nail after removing fake or acrylic nails. That&#x27;s when the nail and nail bed are damaged and nails are weakest and porous. Of course, your nails are going to be vulnerable to stinging if you apply a product like this to a &amp;#34;paper thin&amp;#34; nail or severely damaged nail beds. Use this with care. Let your nails grow out a bit. Apply as directed and stay away from the cuticle area. Try the product on ONE NAIL then see how it goes before applying it to all ten nails. If your nails are reasonably healthy and you use this product according to the directions, it is a superior treatment for protecting and hardening the nails to prevent splitting and breakage. Dries as quickly as nail polish. It has a noticeable chemical smell during application, but I don&#x27;t find it to be any worse than most nail polish or other hardeners I&#x27;ve used. Goes on a milky white and dries almost clear. I will continue to use this product to help grow my nails. I did not have fake nails prior to using it. I just had some peeling and weak nails. I noticed an improvement in the appearance and hardness of my nails right away.</li>
    <li> Love it and recommended to others! And I know quite a few people who ended up buying this product and also love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 with nails that were weak from years of biting and acrylics. Not to mention vertical ridges on some of them that would cause splitting.  This product has allowed me to grow beautiful strong nails. Some folks have talked about a burning sensation, but I had none of that.  Start off as it says and just use on the bottom of your nails for the first two weeks, then I went to full nail and they are really growing now and strong in just 4 weeks.  Use a thin coat and while it does appear to make your nails a little more yellowish, I address that by putting one or two coats of the light natural pink nail polish or use any color!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try because I will keep using my one coat once a week with my nail polish on top.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best nail hardner I have ever used.  It always keeps my nails strong and long.  I just have to remember to keep using it.  It seems to last long after the first coat is applied.</li>
    <li> It is the first product and the only one that helped my nail to grow. My friend introduced me to it, and I love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product for growing and protecting your fingernails.</li>
    <li> Bought it cause i saw a friend using it decided to give it a try. So far so good with the results</li>
    <li> It really works! Have tried various nail hardeners over past 30 years. This is the only one that really works.</li>
    <li> This product is strong and may burn the first times you use it, particulary after removing wraps, gel, acrylics or some kind of covering to keep your nails strong.  If you can be patient it&#x27;s worth using.  The product recommends two coats but for starters I would recommend a single coat or a single coat as a base before color.  The products does work really well.</li>
    <li> this is good for the price and it helps my nails haven&#x27;t seen any growth in them</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and always have 10 beautiful nails. Just don&#x27;t put it on the skin or cuticle around the nails. It is the best because I have used every nail hardener out there.</li>
    <li> This is the only nail polish ive used that actually makes my nails grow and strengthen them,i&#x27;ve tried soo many brands and none have worked like this one I&#x27;ve probably gone through 10 of these</li>
    <li> My nails haven&#x27;t broken once since I started using it &amp; I&#x27;m a mail carrier ......really hard on the fingernails!</li>
    <li> Only stuff that works!  It really does.</li>
    <li> This is the best product to keep your nails from breaking and plitting, also makes the polish last to up to 10 days, and thta&#x27;s for home mani!!</li>
    <li> I love it !!!! A +++++&lt;br /&gt;Super RECOMMEND !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good! My nails are strong now!! I recommend for sure!!! It is better than others I have tryed.</li>
    <li> This does have a high amount of formaldehyde which is not good for you, but boy does it work!!! It takes crumbling splitting nails &amp; makes them grow! I use it either as a base or if my nails are bad, I use it by itself &amp; just add a coat every day or 2 for 7-10 days.  HUGE difference at the end of 10 days &amp; believe me I have tried all the other things that promise this.  This one delivers.</li>
    <li> This nail hardener is amazing.  It not only strengthens my nails but helped my nails to grow longer and healthier bit out breaking.  I even received a compliment about my nails when I went to get a manicure.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Works great. You have to be diligent about it though.</li>
    <li> MY NAILS WERE SPLITTING AND BREAKING.  I ALWAYS HAD GREAT LOOKING NAILS AND CHALKED THE BREAKING THING TO AGING (I JUST HAD MY 80TH BIRTHDAY).  I WAS WATCHING HODA AND KATHY LEE ONE MORNING AND I THINK IT WAS SARA WHO TALKED ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL THE QUIMICA ALEMANA NAIL HARDENER WAS.  I PROMPTLY PLACED AN ORDER FROM AMAZON AND HAVE BEEN USING IT EVER SINCE.  MY NAILS ARE BACK TO LOOKING PRETTY DARN GOOD IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.  THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
    <li> This nail hardener is the best that I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s made my nails, which are usually very breakable, like steel!</li>
    <li> I am concerned about the chemicals in this, so  I have decided not to use it until I can do further research on the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great nail hardener.  It does have a strong odour but it does have a nice shine. xo</li>
    <li> Careful, this is just a clear polish.  It didn&#x27;t do anything for my nails that had been weakened by gel polish.  There was no difference other than putting a clear polish coat on.  Also, it is marked that one of the ingredients is Formaldehyde, which shouldn&#x27;t be put anywhere on your body.</li>
    <li> Love this  product so much that I have placed a second order.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my nails hard and they grow very well. I would not be with out it.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery, timing and product.</li>
    <li> I stopped putting acrylic on my nails and started using this product. This product has work like a magic. My nails a growing healthy and getting harder as I use the product. It really does burn the first few days but after a week of so it will stop burning as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to my friends and anyone who uses acrylic nails and wants to safe money and have healthy long nails.</li>
    <li> Will send for this again, soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It really goes on well and keeps my nails strong. I have the type of nail that cracks and peels, especially in winter. So far, so good! Loving it!</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this nail hardener for several years.  It is the only one I can use that protects my nails, while still being flexible enough not to chip off my soft, thin nails.  It helps my nails grow and stay healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product as far as how it makes my thin nails hard. However the twin pack came with one of the bottles half full and clear when the product is normally on the white side. I&#x27;m questioning wheather to order it again.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT WAS ON A BRIDAL WEBSITE.... AND I WAS EXCITING BECAUSE MY NAILS WERE ALWAYS BREAKING AND VERY WEAK.. WHEN I FIRST APPLIED IT ON MY NAIL IT DID DRY QUICK BUT AFTER LIKE 10-15 MINUTES MY FINGER TIP STARTING BURNING AND RAN ALL THE WAY DOWN MY HAND.. I WAS LIKE A BURNING SENSATION... A FEW WEEKS LATER I REAPPLIED THIS RODUCT AGAIN AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED..... I RATHER DEAL WITH WEAK NAILS BEFORE I APPLY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
    <li> Best nail hardener I&#x27;ve ever used!  Use twice a week without removing &amp; redo over weekends...Nails don&#x27;t split or break at skin line anymore!</li>
    <li> This is really works. I wore a acrillics for almost 17,18 years. I was advise by the manicurist on the salon where u work as a stylist, to use this while growing out my nails. It really helped alot.</li>
    <li> This polish not only looks great (nice and shiny) but hardens your nails which of course helps them not to break.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever for brittle nails</li>
    <li> This product has been such a help for me.  I wash my hands a lot in some of my work, and that tends to weaken the nail bed.  Some of the chemicals in this product (formaldehyde resin) are on the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for humans list. So I have measured the pros and cons of using a product with formaldehyde with the ability to be able to work with my hands without pain. Thus, for me, using it in a limited manner won out.  Without it, my nails would break so badly that they caused pain in my fingers.  Using it allows me to have no pain in my fingers from broken nails and I have no other nail problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it sparingly does makes it last a long time, so I get more than my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that each person check the ingredient list and carefully consider the risks of using a product with formaldehyde in it before they make the purchase.  The product does everything that it says it will and more.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this because the reviews were so mixed. I&#x27;m glad I decided to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a tremendous amount of gardening and general yard work, all with gloves of course, but nonetheless, my nails are shot. I also take certain medications that leave me with soft brittle nails. They grow fine, I just can&#x27;t keep them. I&#x27;ve been using this nail hardener for about 2-3 weeks now and after trimming my nails down to nothing 3 to 4 times to get rid of the damage, my nails are starting to look pretty darn nice. I have a permenant crack down the middle of my thumb nail and this stuff seals it up very well. This stuff is almost like a flexible gel and it has a very nice shine to it as well. It doesn&#x27;t make my nails rock hard which I like, otherwise they&#x27;d snap off if they got too long. Perhaps if I wore more than 2 coats it just might make my nails harder, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;ll have to try it. I use this with Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine, it helps it to last longer before I wear it off and really makes it shine even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the burning that people are talking about, I followed the directions exactly and it didn&#x27;t sting at all. But even after using it for the amount of time that I have, if I put it on too thick, it will sting for a few minutes. Nothing horrible though. When removing it, it doesn&#x27;t come off as easily as nail polish, so I just soak a cotton ball and hold it to each nail for a minute or two and then rub until it&#x27;s removed. It takes a little longer to remove it, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it until the 2 bottles I bought are gone. I&#x27;ll post an update to my review after that time.</li>
