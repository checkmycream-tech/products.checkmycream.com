<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling soft without feeling greasy. It also didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all. I highly&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I love how this shampoo makes my hair feel. It leaves my hair super soft and smooth, especially when I follow it with the conditioner. My hair looks terrific after using them. I absolutely notice a difference in the way my hair looks and feels after using the shampoo.I&#x27;d definitely recommend both products.</li>
    <li> I loved the Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo! It made my hair feel silky smooth and soft. The product smells good and feels good going on to your hair. My hair was easier to brush after my shower and seemed less knotted. The effect seemed to last all the way up until my next washing.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! WE HAVE ALL DIFFERENT HAIR TYPES IN MY HOUSEHOLD SO I TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND LOVE IT BECAUSE ITS PERFECT FOR EVERYONE! WE ALL LOVE IT! THE SMELL IS AMAZING AND BEST OF ALL IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SO SOFT, SMOOTH AND SHINY. IT DOES NOT FADE MY COLORED HAIR AND IT MAKES IT EASY TO COMB MY DAUGHTERS CURLY HAIR. WE WERE USING A DIFFERENT PRODUCT BEFORE AND I DONT THINK OUR HAIR HAS EVER FELT SO CLEAN! I LOVE THE PRICE AS WELL!! WAY TO GO VIDAL SASSOON! GREAT PRODUCT FOR A GREAT PRICE!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. It lathers well, leaves hair clean with a pleasant scent and feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from Influenster, and I was happy to try it out. However, I didn&#x27;t like it as much as the conditioner. It seemed like it took more than my usual shampoo to get my hair clean (to be fair, I have a LOT of hair), and rinsing it out too longer than usual. Maybe it&#x27;s just not meant for someone with super thick and curly hair?</li>
    <li> I love love love this shampoo/conditioner combo. It leaves my hair feeling so clean and soft. I love that even at the end of my day my hair smells so fresh and is still so soft. During the shampooing process it feels very effective. I feel like this brand has revamped itself. I&#x27;m am definitely going to keep purchasing these 2.</li>
    <li> I recieved this product in my voxbox from Influenster ... I love it! It makes my hair feel so clean and it smell so good!!! I would purchase this product &amp; I give it five stars!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how great this shampoo is.  I love Paul Mitchell however this could run a close second.  Especially price wise.  I would use this on a daily as it makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I was given a sample to try out for free through Influenster and loved it. It made my hair feel so smooth and light. It will definitely be the shampoo I switch to and use from now on.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells wonderful.  With my oily hair I tend to stay away from any shampoos that spout &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; in their title because well.. lets face it..I don&#x27;t want to be an oil slick by the end of said day!!  This was an actual great shampoo!  It left my hair smelling fabulous, feeling soft and not oily.. Product is up there with designer brands.  i will definately use this again!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo and conditioner from influencer to try. I was not impressed at all. The shampoo actually made my hair feel like it pulled all the moisture out and it felt like straw. just terrible!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product depending on your hair type. I have dreadlocks and I am wary of products that might leave any residue behind. I like the way my hair felt after use but found the scent to be a bit strong for my taste. I had to rinse longer than normal because it seemed as if the product was really clinging to my locs. I didn&#x27;t use the conditioner because the shampoo has conditioning properties.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I received through Influenster for testing. I have tried a lot of shampoos over the years. Some were not good for my hair at all, and others were stellar. This one falls somewhere in the middle. And it honestly probably has more to do with my hair being fine than anything else. The Moisture Lock shampoo didn&#x27;t make my hair feel moisturized before conditioning, but it also didn&#x27;t dry it out like others have in the past. It got my hair clean (which is always the point!), but I wasn&#x27;t in love with how my hair felt afterwards. It&#x27;s not a bad shampoo by any means, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
    <li> I used the moisturizing shampoo, conditioner, and hair repair. These are the best products on the market. They rival John Frieda and got2be hair products! After one week&#x27;s use, my hair has more volume, no frizz, and feels silky soft. I would definitely recommend the Vidal Sassoon products to anyone. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo in a sample size in a voxbox for testing purposes. I used this shampoo and it works very well. It does produce quite a lather and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I paired this with the conditioner that goes with it and I&#x27;d have to say the end result is that my hair was moisturized but not overly greasy. It looked GOOD! I think for the affordable price and the way it performs that it is a decent drugstore shampoo. I do however like more a scent but that&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
    <li> I love this VS product! Smells wonderful,, and works amazingly like high dollar salon products I&#x27;ve purchased, but for so much less! Great value! High Quality! Beautiful hair! Win-Win!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! left my dry damaged hair SOFT and manageable :) will definitely buy this again!&lt;br /&gt;*I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty damaged, I am a blonde and have a mix of grey and darker roots constantly growing in, so redying blonde all the time has left my hair pretty lifeless. When I got this for testing purposes thanks to influenster, I was excited, I have a hard time finding good shampoos for my hair. My hair felt much softer, and was easier to style. But I noticed that I lacked more volume than usual. But you really cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo that lathers good, rinses clean and smells great. will be making a switch.</li>
    <li> I was given this product to test for free. I&#x27;ve used every bit of the samples and I&#x27;ve bought the full size :)&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells. My hair is soft looks very healthy! :) Love it!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was great! I received a free sample to review from Influenster VoxBox and it left my hair feeling soft and really moisturized!  It does exactly as it claims.  A new must have for me!!</li>
    <li> This smells amazing!! I have Color treated hair and I found it made my hair shine, less dry looking and feel soft and shine. I&#x27;ve used a lot of products on my hair and none have worked as well. I tested this product for a week on my hair and definitely see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product free but this is my opinion.</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock line is amazing. This shampoo is so good. It smells great, lathers a lot and cleans my hair efficiently. I love the packaging. I also love the fact that my hair retains moisture after use. Great shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo for my review. I really like the way it clean and the smell was great. After being outside all day gardening and coming inside to was the dirt off, this shampoo cleaned my hair without stripping the moisture out. After I have dried my hair and slept on it, thee next morning my hair was still nice and not dried out.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo because the price is wonderful, it provides a lot of moisture to my dry &amp; damaged hair, and the scent is clean but not overpowering! One bonus thing is when I use this product I need very little frizz control serum!</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair.  A lot of shampoos and conditioners weigh my hair down and make my curls look flat.  This shampoo along with the Moisture Lock Conditioner has really done well for my hair.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and I am loving the results that it&#x27;s leaving.  It&#x27;s also great that the price is so low.  I can&#x27;t believe that you can get this for such a low price.  My other shampoos are almost $20 a bottle.  I would recommend this to anyone that is needing a boosy of moisture in their hair, especially curly hair.  Get the conditioner, too!</li>
    <li> My hair is long, straight, and fine. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo (with the conditioner and &amp;#34;heat and protect spray&amp;#34;) twice now and can already tell a difference in my hair... it&#x27;s very soft and I don&#x27;t have the static I normally do when I wear my hair down.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love the smell and it made my hair really shiny.  I have been a fan of VS since I was a kid and was thrilled to get this sample to try out.  I would definitely buy this product in the future.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good and cleaned my hair good. My hair felt moisturized and soft. Nice product Vidal Sassoon and thank you Influenster. I received this item from Influenster to try and I am very happy I was one of the lucky ones picked.</li>
    <li> Smells great, provides great shine and soft bounce. Definitely helped my hair stay healthy instead of dry. Also got rid of some frizz, which is awesome! Definitely recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I totally love this! my hair has never looked better! every woman should try this!</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo.  I color my hair, so it is important that I do whatever I can to prevent dryness and damage.  This shampoo is perfect for that, and completely affordable.  In just a few uses, I have seen a difference, and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a test bottle at no cost for the purposes of reviewing, and all opinions my own.</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo to try and assumed immediately that I wouldn&#x27;t like just because it didn&#x27;t have the normal description that most products I use have on them! It wasn&#x27;t formulated for curly hair or natural hair or corse hair! So I thought oh it won&#x27;t work for me. This is why I love trying a product in trial size because it worked great and I will totally add it to my current likes pile! I gave it four stars only cause of the smell isn&#x27;t might favorite but that goes away when I put my other products on top!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a shampoo snob, but this definitely works at a great value. Didn&#x27;t strip the color from my hair, added some moisture, great price.    I was given this product free to try.</li>
    <li> love this shampoo! I have very dry hair and accept all that can help add some moisture to it. I didn&#x27;t think that this would work any better than other &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; conditioners. Boy was I wrong! Combine the Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner gives me the right amount of moisture.  I was able to test the product at no cost to me but all opinions are my own.  Do you ask if I will purchase again? The answer is YES!</li>
    <li> My overall opinion of this product is that it is good, but not above average. I really like the scent! Very fresh and clean without being too feminine or \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot;. It does make my dry, highlighted hair soft and easy to style, but it tends to weigh it down a bit. But at this price, it&#x27;s a good product to add to my \\&quot;rotation\\&quot; of shampoos.</li>
    <li> I got to try this product as part of a Influester VoxBox campaign.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d like it since I&#x27;m pretty set in my haircsre routine but it made my hair nice and soft when used in conjunction with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been having trouble with dry and brittle hair since my daughter was born. As a result I have been switching shampoos and conditioners trying to find one that made my hair look less rough. I finally decided to go ahead and try Moisture lock Shampoo. I have to tell you I felt like my hair woke up! I really enjoyed the smell and the feel. My hair was soft and manageable, not hard to handle like it has been lately. I would really recommend this product! It is wonderful. Something I will continue to buy. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I really liked this conditioner. I have very fine hair and some conditioners weight my hair down and make it look very thin and fine. This conditioner did not do that. I loved the way it smelled too! It also did not make my haor look greasy the next day. I was very happy with the product. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> I have thin, short-layered hair, and an oily scalp so I have to wash everyday. And as winter is coming, have to blow dry everyday, so its a nightmare. Therefore, I stand with moisturizing shampoos or those ones for colored hair. I had been using the Dove Oxigen Moisture one and it is great but far too expensive, specially compared to this gem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how movable my hair is, and how it is not weighed down. which can be easy with the wrong shampoo. It smells good and leaves it clean. I have used the conditioner too and its as good as this one. I think I found my new go-to shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say I tested the products at no cost, the opinions are all mine, and since trying it I have purchased my own.</li>
    <li> Just another shampoo to me - nothing special. Going back to VO5.</li>
    <li> I have combo hair - seriously!  I have oily hair near my scalp and my ends are dry and frizzy.  I have been coloring my hair for years but I normally keep it short.  However, I have been growing my hair out long.  I have realized the longer my hair gets, the more my ends hate to be washed every day!  But I have to wash my hair because no dry shampoo really works for me!  I like the way that this shampoo  left my hair feeling soft and silky without leaving it oily or heavy with residue.  The scent isn&#x27;t anything special.  Just has that &#x27;clean&#x27; smell to it! I did receive this product to review at no cost to me.  This is my honest opinion and review of the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past month and I can honestly say that it has become a favorite. It has left my dreadlocks so soft after a shampoo and the smell is great. It&#x27;s easy to rinse out and it will leave your hair moisturized. You have gained a fan!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great. It made my hair clean and fixed my fly-away frizzled mess. It made my hair smell clean and fresh and I would recommend this and I received the as a product sample from influenster. Thanks Vidal Sassoon. I have already bought some more bottles.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I used this shampoo for a week and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have combination hair (oily scalp and dry ends) and I never know what to expect from moisturizing shampoo. Some shampoo&#x27;s leave my hair greasy after using it for a couple days in a row. Not this one. My hair feels fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone.  I was able to test this product at no cost to me, but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I remember using Vidal Sassoon shampoo many years ago, and had very high hopes when they relaunched it.  I gave it an honest go.  I used this product, along with the matching conditioner for several days to form my thoughts on it.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this shampoo wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my hair at all.  It felt soft, however, my ends felt very dry later during the day.  I also have flyaways and found it hard to style.  Next morning, my hair became very oily, and this is a problem I usually do not have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was sent to me at no cost by Influenster, and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair that is somewhat oily if I don&#x27;t wash it everyday or if I use the wrong product - I will admit that I was concerned that this moisture shampoo was going to leave my hair weighed down and oily looking. Nope - this one does the job and I don&#x27;t feel oily at all!  And another added plus is that this shampoo smells so fresh &amp; clean.  I used this product everyday for two weeks prior to writing this review and I love how soft and silky my hair feels and looks - this is my new go-to conditioner!    A true testament about this shampoo, is that I needed a haircut so bad before testing this item - and now after a couple weeks of using it, no one could ever tell!!!  Also, I liked it so much, I&#x27;ve already purchased more!!    As a member of Influenster, I received this product free to test and review. Even though I was part of a program that provided me the samples of this product for free - the above review is comprised solely of my opinions of the product.</li>
    <li> I had no luck with this product. My hair is really fine and straight, which is easily weighed down and gets greasy super fast. This shampoo and the conditioner did not work for me. However, my boyfriend did not mind the product. He actually said, &amp;#34;my hair feels softer,&amp;#34; and for that I am giving it three stars. If you must know, my boyfriend has curly normal hair. One more thing I did not like... the scent of it is too strong. Sorry Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock, I will not be buying you in the future. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, made my hair soft and silky, and did not give my scalp irritation, I am sensitive to shampoos, but this one seems to work well.</li>
    <li> It helps to keep moisture in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> not very effect as a shampoo... too mild</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and smells great.</li>
    <li> The smell is so sweet like a candy.</li>
    <li> This has a pleasant smell but as far as feeling or seeing a difference in my hair.. there&#x27;s been no improvement</li>
    <li> This shampoo has very rich consistency but does not leave residue. It does seem to nourish and hydrate my hair. It lathers very nicely. I would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this product. My hair is usually very dry and unmanageable. No products really get it to do what I want. This line is the best so far at controlling my frizz and dryness. I&#x27;m glad I was chosen by influenster to try this product for free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> this shampoo works great on my hair. Its just hard to wash out due to the water pressure in my shower. I do not like this formula of Vidal Sassoon as much as the ones I grew up with in the 80s and 90s. I think they not only changed the bottle color and type, but also what ever things they used to make the shampoo is not the same. But still its better then any other shampoo for my dry fine wavy curly frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Great item. Means the world to me as I work with volatile chemicals and biology. I appreciate good products and I like taking care of my self.</li>
    <li> I used a trial size of this product (received for free to test) in conjuction with the same \\&quot;moisture lock\\&quot; conditioner and heat protect.  I can&#x27;t say that it did anything for the moisture to my hair as I have some pretty dry hair.  It does have a nice scent that lingers on your hair but other than that I just don&#x27;t feel that after a week or more of use that it performed as it said.  Just not the product for me.</li>
    <li> I got this product from influenster to try out and when I think of the name Vidal Sassoon I think of a high quality product -Salon worthy so I was very excited to try it however I was very much let down the product has a nice build up that creates a nice lather however after the rinse it stills feel a tiny bit greasy and after its all washed out my hair felt like wire I was very disappointed but what kept me using it was the smell, it smells incredible and if I had to I would only use it because of the smell it lingers in your hair long after its dry.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo if you do not like scents. I also buy the moisture lock conditioner.</li>
    <li> Too greasy.. does not give you a feeling of really cleaning..</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. The smell is nice and leaves my hair silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> Still has that classic great smelling shampoo that I grew up on :) I do like this shampoo but without the conditioner it does leave my hair really dry. The shampoo and conditioner combo is good though, it left my hair smelling amazing, felt clean, and soft after the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I received these sample to review and test from Influester.com and it is a great product. It&#x27;s smells good and moisturizes my hair, leaving it clean.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was very impressed with how soft and weightless this shampoo made my hair. I also am very pleased with the pleasant smell it has. Other moisture shampoos make your hair greasy and leave your hair with a film, however this does not. Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> It was awhile that I had not use Vidal Sassoon and I can say that I like this shampoo after I used it my hair felt smooth and I could actually pass my fingers through my hair before putting on some conditioner. I am amazed.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon Pro Series - Moisture Lock System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial feeling on this product is Neutral because, I live in the PNW, WA area, with high moisture in the air continually. For this reason, I believe the reason the heat protector spray did not produce the desired results I hoped for. I followed the application instructions on the label &amp; styled as usual. However, the end result wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I have naturally curly/wavy (beginning to be a bit coarse - aging) and I was straighten my hair for a family event. The end result - after using the combined VS Moisture Lock Pro Series products- my hair was straight, but with very unusual puffiness (added volume) &amp; frizzy too the overall appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general quality of the product is good and the spray does have a pleasant fragrance, feels silky &amp; leaves little to no heavy product feeling. Even though this particular product did not work well in conjunction with the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner series, it works well as a heat protector for your everyday styling needs. I would recommend it to others. My overall rating is a 7. It would have been higher if the desired results were met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I received these products to test at no cost, and all opinions are my own after personally trying these items.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. I have very dry, very thick, frizzy colored hair. I used this shampoo every time I showered, for about a week, and it made my hair feel soft, and manageable. Even without conditioner! The frizz was gone!! It did not strip my color, and smelled so fresh and clean. I would definitely purchase this shampoo without a second thought.  ( I tested this product at no cost to me, but all opinions are my own )</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo for a good price.</li>
    <li> I received a sample if this product for free to test and review. The shampoo did a good job overall. It&#x27;s not overly scented, lathered and rinsed well, and left my hair feeling clean.</li>
    <li> For a value shampoo this works great, awesome scent and lather and provides good moisture for my super dry and frizzy hair</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo....it smells good and lathers well.  I think it would be better for average hair...My hair is frizzy and curly and while it left me feeling clean and smelling good, I would prefer something to help with the frizz.</li>
    <li> My hair was left so soft on the first application/use. I have damaged hair due to coloring and I am shedding a lot. This product claims to restore and give moisture to your hair. It is true</li>
    <li> I began using this shampoo just a week ago and couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works! Firstly the lather was very rich without having to use too much product which was great. Rinsed easily and left my hair smooth and silky. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I recently tried this product as my hair was dried out from the sun, swimming an just damage of summer. I was surprised to see how shiny, healthy looking my hair was. Definitely going to be my go to product.</li>
    <li> Great value for a good moisturizing shampoo!  I tried this along with the Moisture Lock conditioner and the Heat protect and shine spray and was very happy with the results.  My hair was super soft, shiny and healthy looking.  This formula is a little heavy for everyday use on my hair, but I would definitely purchase to use as a once a week treatment.</li>
    <li> Love this product! This is a great product, smells great leaves hair feeling great. I would recommend the product to everyone!</li>
    <li> This product is a really great shampoo, though it didn&#x27;t do a lot for my curly hair. It felt a bit dry afterwards, which is something I struggle with constantly. I had hoped that this being a \\&quot;moisture lock\\&quot; formula would make it a slam dunk for my hair, but I&#x27;ve learned that the only thing that REALLY keeps my hair moist is cleansing conditioners. If you&#x27;re someone who only has moderately dry/frizzy hair, I&#x27;d recommend this in a HEARTBEAT. It does leave your hair with added moisture (compared to other shampoos) and has a very nice scent, as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**please note that I was sent this product for consideration, but all views/opinions are my own!**</li>
    <li> I used tho shampoo yesterday on my hair and I think it&#x27;s fantastic . It lathered up quickly &amp; easily , it smells great an rinsed away with no residue feeling afterwards. Definite future usage for this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is long (I mean it come to my butt, long) and wavy and this shampoo left my hair so shiny, soft and clean. I am very picky when it comes to my hair but I am very happy with Vidal Sassoon Moister Lock Shampoo.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to sample and review. I usually use a salon brand shampoo and thought I would give it a whirl. I think it is a good product and an excellent value. While I am not totally ready to give up the salon shampoo, I am thinking that I will use both of them, alternating days.</li>
    <li> This shampoo worked well it cleansed my hair and made it squeaky clean. It had a lot of lather so a little goes a long way. The bottle says moisture lock but it worked on my hair more like a clarifying shampoo. I tested this shampoo at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s moisture lock shampoo. Not only did it leave my hair feeling moisturized but I did not get that weighed down feeling. my hair was light and full of life. My fly aways also improved. I still had some frizz but with my hair any improvement is a good thing especially with the air getting dryer. I would definitely purchase this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I grew up with the name Vidal Sassoon - it&#x27;s been a salon quality brand as long as I can remember. So why haven&#x27;t I been using their shampoos and conditioners? I really don&#x27;t know, but after trying this Moisture Lock Shampoo, I am a convert. I have fine hair, but it&#x27;s colored, so I have a double whammy of damage potential. Add to the the slow growth rate, and I have to be careful what I useproduct wise.. it&#x27;s a fine line between too much moisture that weighs me down and not enough so my hair turns damaged, dry and broken.  This shampoo walks that line. It smells good, it rinses clean, and it leaves my hair soft. I feel like my hair has moisture but it isn&#x27;t weighed down. The price on this product can&#x27;t be beat - it performs like a salon shampoo at drugstore prices. I am glad I had a chance to try a complimentary sample of this shampoo via Influenster. Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> I have very curly, frizzy hair and have been spending A LOT of money on high-end brands. I tried the VS Moisture Lock Shampoo and was highly impressed.  The shampoo has a clean, fresh scent. Not too perfumey and the fragrance lingered, but it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small amount - it lathers up really easily and covers a lot of your hair. I was really surprised that my hair didn&#x27;t feel like straw. My curls felt moisturized - like i didn&#x27;t need any conditioner.  As a black female, this is a great add!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are all my own AND I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that my hair is very course so this product may work better on other types of hair.  I tried Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock shampoo for the first time a couple of days ago. I felt that it didn&#x27;t lather well in my hair because of the thick, course hair that I  have. It&#x27;s like my hair drank it up.  I just had to use a little more than I  think I should need. Other than that, I think that it washed through my hair well and made my hair feel really clean and fresh. I would recommend it to others. I received a free sample from Influenster for testing purposes and the views expressed are solely my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this products for many years!!! I absolutely love the clean,soft, yummy smelling, shiny hair it gives me.  I wash my hair on daily basis, and this shampoo never dry&#x27;s out my hair like other products i have tried before. I always receive so many comments on how beautiful my hair is. I recommend Vidal Sassoon to all my friends. I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary sample recently which was wonderful because now i have a travel size container for my next road trip</li>
    <li> I have tried this shampoo along with the conditioner for eight days now and let me tell you it works. After using this shampoo my hair is so soft and shiny. My son told me today that my hair smells so good. I haven&#x27;t found many shampoos that actually do what they are intended to but Vidal Sassoon you have nailed it. I have already been telling my family and friends about this shampoo and I plan to tell more. I tested these products at no costs but these opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use items that say they add moisture to your hair because they typically leave my hair feeling oily but this shampoo didn&#x27;t!  It left my hair moisturized yet clean. Love it!</li>
    <li> Got this to try and didn&#x27;t know if I would like it since I don&#x27;t use Vidal Sassoon.  Boy was I missing out.  Took a shower and used the sample bottle to wash my hair not only did it smell amazing but it lathered up the first time and made my hair feel silky and smooth especially when used with the conditioner. I would so use this again.    I did test this product out for free but these opinions are most certainly my own.</li>
    <li> I have heat styled my hair to death.  I also use a lot of hair products and have dyed my hair more times than I care to remember.  I tried the Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo by Vidal Sassoon to see if I could add some moisture in during the cleansing process.  I usually find shampoos striping, but do not like the unclean feeling I get from conditioning shampoos.  What I loved about Moisture Lock was that it really left my hair clean, but did not feel like it had stripped my hair.  It rinsed cleanly, and there was no film or greasy feeling in hair afterwards.  This has a pretty apparent scent, like apples, that lasted quite a long time.  I used this shampoo and tried heat drying and air drying my hair.  Both methods yielded the same hair...much softer than I had before cleansing.  Am really excited to pick up another bottle of this soon.  I was sent the product free of cost, but opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the Vidal Sassoon products but as I have gotten older, it is harder to find products that help with the dryness of my hair without leaving it heavy.  The moisture lock shampoo cleans without drying and I love it!</li>
    <li> I received this shampoo for free to sample and let me just say, although I&#x27;ve never been a fan of VS, they have definatly stepped up their game with this line of products. I have very thick, coarse, wavy, frizzy hair. A nightmare pretty much. Usually after shampooing my hair feels totally dried out and almost straw like. Because of that, I use tons of conditioner. After rinsing this shampoo out, I could not believe how soft my hair still was. I seriously had to look at the bottle to make sure that it was shampoo that I just used. My mind was blown, on top of the softness, this shampoo lathered up so good, so a little will definitely go a long way. I was so impressed with this shampoo, that I went immediately and purchased it. I just can&#x27;t say enough about this incredible shampoo. The icing on this cake was the fact that the scent of this shampoo was so nice as well. All around 5 star product. I&#x27;d give more stars if I could.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product to try for free, all of the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo! It cleansed my scalp and hair without leaving my hair feeling stripped of all of it&#x27;s moisture. The shampoo did seem to be moisturizing to my hair. It has a rich lather and it does not take a lot of this shampoo to get a great lather. After rinsing the shampoo out my hair felt clean and soft. The also product had a pleasant smell. Overall, I really enjoyed using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive these products complimentary for the purpose of testing them; however, the above review are my own opinions based on what my experience was with this product.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and normally can go 3 days in between washes. After using this product, I noticed my hair was greasy quicker than usual. I don&#x27;t think there is anything bad about the product, just not good for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Smells great and definitely locks in moisture! After having a baby my hair has been crazy! First oily, then dry and frizzy. This product works on my unmanageable, dry, frizzy hair wonderfully. It smells great and rinses easily too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 5 days.  I love it! It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I have a hard time finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to be more oily than it normally is and this one does not leave my hair feeling weighted down or oily.  I have had several compliments stating that my hair looks like I just left the salon.  I would recommend to everyone! I received this free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
    <li> The smell is nice but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Some shampoos cause me to have a flaky scalp and this is one of them. The day after I used it my scalp was flaky and my roots were oily. For this reason I will not continue to use this shampoo.</li>
    <li> This product gets 5 stars from me!  I received a sample free from Influenster and was so thrilled at the results after 1 wash.  My hair is silky and smooth and smells Devine.  I have medium thickness wavy hair and it helps tame my frizz.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I have really been enjoying both the shampoo and conditioner. They both have a great smell and leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome and I definitely will buy it. It smells good and it made my hair feel so soft. I have natural curly hair which is also frizzy. So with the moisture lock it help tame some of the frizziness and make it smooth.</li>
    <li> I have had great experience with this product. I use a lot of hairspray on rainy and humid days and this product is the best at making my hair feel clean and manageable. It also leaves it soft and bouncy! The press is great and you can always find coupons for Vidal Sassoon products! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is awesome I have long thick dry coarse hair and after washing with this shampoo I felt a difference. It was soft and manageable defiently feels like the moisture is back in my hair for sure.</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my thick hair feel soft and smells great. I definitely will start using this going forward!</li>
    <li> I have very dry unmanageable hair. I know Vidal Sassoon is a great product for the price, so I tried their new Moisture Lock Shampoo. I love how soft &amp; manageable this made my hair. I didn&#x27;t even have to use as much conditioner as I usually do. It really does lock in the moisture &amp; it smells great too!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give some moisture but nothing special.  It doesn&#x27;t lather very well and it has that chemical &amp;#34;I just went to the salon&amp;#34; smell that stays with you for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my favorite of the VS line of shampoos but it will do in a pinch.</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo smells wonderful!  I received a free sample to try and it just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.  I have long, very fine and yet softly curly hair, so my hair is very picky.  Now, the scent is wonderful!  It cleans good, but it seems to still dry my hair out too much.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this shampoo and honestly in most cases I&#x27;m not impressed by them. The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series is amazing. My hair has been experiencing some undesirable changes. It has been dry and brittle. I have tried leave in conditioners, oils, etc. Nothing was working. My hair was only getting worse. This shampoo has finally made a difference in my hair. It is now baby soft, shiny, and it does not break off while brushing it. I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Usually shampoos dry out my hair and I can&#x27;t wait my hair can&#x27;t wait for the conditioner to bring back that moisture. This shampoo was moisturizing and left my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at how effective this shampoo was. As a woman who dyes (every few months) &amp; straightens her hair every day, after just one use, I immediately saw a difference. First of all, it smells amazing. Secondly my hair felt soft and shiny after just one use. After using if for awhile, I was starting to get compliments on my hair because others could see the difference too. I love how soft and shiny my hair is. it definitely puts the moisture back into my hair, and I love it! I got this as a tester for free, and I promise this is my actually opinion of it.</li>
    <li> It cleansed well and left no residue. This was the first item I used in my hair care routine. I followed with the Moisture Lock Condition by Vidal Sassoon. Wish it was formulated without sulfates and had a richer or more colorful fragrance. Very generic in regards to the smell.    this product was sent to me complimentary from influenster for testing and review purposes.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. It does what it says by adding moisture and tames the frizzy&#x27;s It makes my hair smell awesome too!! I was sent a sample to test the product at no cost, but these opinions are my own. I will definitely purchase this in the future!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has lived up to its name. The shampoo really does lock in the moisture. Now I wash my hair about 3 times a week, and the type of hair that I have can get pretty dry. I&#x27;m told that we as African Americans do not need to wash our hair as often. I do find that true in some ways, but I also like to have a clean and itch free head. I have been using this for a few weeks now and really notice a difference with my hair. My hair is not dry and feels soft to the touch. When drying my hair I notice that I have less frizz, and my hair can get pretty frizzy after a blow dry. I do not like to use alot of heat because I still want to keep my natural length. The smell of the shampoo is amazing, the scent would stick around for a few days. My hair seems to hold up better and stays softer longer. The shampoo I grew up to changed their formula, but I still buy I t because I do not know of any other shampoo other than what I&#x27;m use to using.  I&#x27;m glad that I was able to try this to find something new to add to the collection. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and a honest review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner for aver a week now and my hair looks and feels great. I have fine hair and this has given me a natural volume that I love. Great product. Will defiantly keep using it.</li>
    <li> The scent of this shampoo is so invigorating. It works up a really good lather as well. My only criticism it that it is not sulfate free. However, it did still work well with my colored hair. It is great paired with the moisture lock conditioner, and then i followed it with some other products, the root lift spray and the repair heat protectant spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided free for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> The pros : The smell was excellent.  Very fresh.  I also felt like my hair was very clean after use.    The con?  My hair did not feel moisturized.  At all.  Which is a big bummer, because I wanted to love it!  Maybe it&#x27;s just not for my hair type.  (Curly, thick.)    Note: I did receive a free sample of this product to test, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I had been eyeing this product at the store for some time and never pulled the trigger on buying it. I was really happy to learn I was selected for testing it by influenster. First off the smell is really nice, wish they would make a body wash! The formula of the shampoo and conditioner is perfect for my hair (fine hair with a medium amount of thickness, lower back length). It cleans well and moisturizes with out a heavy weighed down build up. The heat protectant spray is really good also. After my sample was done I went and bought the full size bottles I liked it so much. My boyfriend loves it also and he has a totally different type of hair than me (short course very textured).</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product.  Now that it&#x27;s winter, my hair needs all the moisture it can get.  Daily hair dryer abuse makes my hair full of static, frizzy and just uncontrollable.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few days using this shampoo, my hair is full of moisture, body and looks fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair from coloring it every 3 mos.  I received this Vidal Sassoon moisture shampoo from Influenster to test; I found my new go to shampoo!  This shampoo moisturizers my dry hair and leaves it feeling soft and smelling great.  Using the moisture conditioner following this shampoo just knocks it up another notch.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells so good!! I love this shampoo and the conditioner is awesome too!! Got a sample from influenster but went back for a full size bottle the second it was gone!</li>
    <li> We normally use Pantene but this is a decent alternative</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. Smells fantastic! The lather is great and my hair felt softer.</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. I&#x27;d not tried it before but was really pleased with it from smell--nice floral/fruity scent--to how it made my hair feel. Cost wise it was very much worth the product. My hair felt great and did seem more moist after using it just a couple times which was nice since dryness can be an issue especially when cold weather is hitting. My hair seemed to have a bit more volume as well and didn&#x27;t feel weighed now. So nice bonus there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample via Influenster VoxBox for review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty brand loyal since I have short, fine, color-treated hair and when I find a product I like I tend to stick with it. That said, I received these products from Influenster for review and was interested to see how they worked for me. I like this product a lot. It smells nice, lathers up well, and rinses out fairly easily. It also gives my hair a nice softness without making it limp and heavy like some other shampoos do.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about a week now and I have a few thoughts. First impressions? GREAT smelling product! Using the product? It makes my hair soft and shiny. When your hair is dry you often bounce between products trying to find one that not only gives you the right moisture, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy in the process! This does that! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I recently had the chance to try out the moisture lock shampoo by Vidal Sassoon and was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked. As a Florida girl my hair subjected to humidity and sun exposure. With Vidal Moisture lock I found my hair was capable of holding moisture. After several uses i am definitely replacing my other shampoo with Vidal.</li>
    <li> As a member of Influenster, I received this product free to test and review. I am also brutally honest, and will not give a review for a product that is not worthy of YOUR time.&lt;br /&gt;This, however, is awesome. I want to take the smell and carry it around with me in my pocket. It&#x27;s like they have taken the scent of rainbows, butterflies and glitter and put it in a bottle, placed it on the shelf for the average consumer and allowed you to take part of it. It&#x27;s for realsies THAT good. I&#x27;m a stay and home mom to five children, so that&#x27;s saying a lot because normally my hair smells like yesterday&#x27;s bacon and vomit... but with this product... the smell alone makes me feel less sad and depressed about making macaroni and cheese for dinner (again) because that&#x27;s the only thing everyone will eat. Xanax? No thanks! Vidal Sassoon? Yes please!&lt;br /&gt;To cover the greys in my hair, I&#x27;ve had to resort to chemical alterations. Shampoos usually dry out my hair like a desert summer. This, however, made my hair silky, smooth, and gave me control of at least ONE aspect of my life. It&#x27;s like Christmas up in this joint for this 37 year old mom. Whoop Whoop!  *and I&#x27;ll have you know, I haven&#x27;t whoop whooped for anything in YEARS*&lt;br /&gt;I also tested the Heat Protect and Shine spray. Did it&#x27;s job like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair smelling amazing? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Soft and smooth? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Product that&#x27;s affordable to SAHM&#x27;s? Check.&lt;br /&gt;Life in order? Negative.&lt;br /&gt;But this is at least a head start. Thank you, Vidal Sassoon!</li>
    <li> I love that I do not have to use a lot to feel clean. The smell is perfect, not too strong, just perfect!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times now, I usually wash my hair every 3 days. It took a couple of washes, but I really love it now. I have normal hair, my hair is so soft and so easy to style now. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> I received the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner for free for #influenster.  #vidalsassoon  My hair has never felt so soft.  I am an avid fan of this and will but it going forward.  It also works extremely well on my daughter&#x27;s hair who has a problem with dry hair.  Thank you @influenster #influenster &amp; @vidalsassoon #vidalsassoon</li>
    <li> I actually noticed a difference in this product from the very start. it smells terrific and the lather actually made me think &amp;#34;rich and creamy&amp;#34;. Afterward my hair was soft, yet not flat. I received a free sample to test, but you can rest assured that in no way influences what I think about the product, or what I tell you. After all, I&#x27;m putting my name on this. And I can honestly recommend this product. If you&#x27;re concerned about price, and aren&#x27;t we all, remember a little bit really does go a long way with this. It took me a few times to cut down to the least amount needed as I am use to putting a healthy amount on.</li>
    <li> I loved using Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo. It left my hair feeling very silky, shiny and gave me body and bounce.</li>
    <li> I was given a chance to try Vidal Sassoon moisture lock shampoo for free as a member of infleunster. I have very dry hair so I was excited to try it. It has abet nice creamy consistency and lathers well. It also has a great scent. After I rinsed out the shampoo my hair felt smooth and soft usually it still feels dry and I have to use a ton of conditioner.  I used the moisture lock conditioner with it and my hair was soft and smooth all day. Would recommend to any one with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I can remember using Vidal Sassoon shampoo and conditioner way back when, when it came in large dark brown bottles.  This new pro-series Moisture Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is a brand new way to treat your hair!  I have color treated, thick, short hair, so needless to say, certain brands just reak havoc on my hair causing it to be dry, dull and brittle, not Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Moisture Lock Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  I had the opportunity to try these incredible products, and I noticed a difference right away with how my hair felt and looked.  The texture of my hair is softer, silkier than before and it just feels so much better when I run my hand through it.  I would definitely recommend Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s pro-series moisture lock shampoo and conditioner, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo. I have very fine hair and some shampoos weigh my hair down and make it look very thin and fine. This product did not do that. I loved the way it smelled too! It also did not make my hair look greasy the next day. I was very happy. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to test this product out for a good month. As a shampoo it does a fantastic job of moisturizing and cleaning my hair. The smell is pretty neutral and great for the family. I have several family members that use my shower and non of them can agree on a shampoo. A few do not like floral scents, and typically this means I have just as many products as a salon. For once I&#x27;ve found something that they agree on. Now if I can get them to agree on body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to test this product at no cost and all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock from Influenster to try on my thin, dry hair and to review/provide feedback. I loved what it did for my hair. The moisture lasted all day without making my hair oily or stringy. I plan to buy the full size product because I liked it so much (and that does not always happen after I test a product).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several weeks now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  It cleans my hair well and leaves it feeling light and airy.  A lot of times after I wash my hair it feels heavy and like I didn&#x27;t even clean it.  This leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve just left the salon.  I have tested this product at no cost to me but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product to test and review and I love it. I loved the way it made my hair feel after washing. My hair didn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s a great value for the money also.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. Smells great!!! Left my hair feeling clean and soft. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using over time to see results.</li>
    <li> I received these products free to test and review from Influenster.com. I absolutely love the shampoo. Makes my hair feel super soft and not as frizzy. I will continute to buy this product!! Thanks so much influenster.com</li>
    <li> I received this with an influenster box. I absolutely love the smell! It lathers well so you do not have to use too much. I have fine hair and really enjoyed the way it made my hair feel smooth and full of moisture. I would highly recommend. Good value.</li>
    <li> I am not the biggest fan of this shampoo. It did not wash out well at all. I recieved this sample for free from influenster to try for free</li>
    <li> Really love the smell and the Moisture of my hair after using this shamppo. Never had a shampoo that made my hair feel soft before applying conditoner. All the others I have tried make my damge hair feel hard. It felt like I put silk in my hair. I will be buying this over and over again. Thank you for making a great proudct Vidal Sassoon.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this shampoo in my #infuenster #voxbox to try. I love it, it smells so pretty and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I am so glad I was able to try this! I am pretty brand loyal, and probably would have never thought to get something different than my usual-what&#x27;s even better is this is cheaper than my usual----I think I am switching!</li>
    <li> I recieved this with my Vox Box from Influenster and I am glad I did it has done great things with my hair. The smell is awesome and you don&#x27;t need a lot to go far. I will be buying this in the future.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does not dry out my hair and has been gentle on my color. The smell is lovely and for the price, it is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> Smells divine and did not  weigh my hair down. I have lots of frizz and it did not smooth it as much as others i have tried but this is definitely  on my acceptable  hair care  products list!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for a few days now, I love how it smells and makes my hair very fragrant. It has great lather, cleans the scalp really well and I don&#x27;t feel my hair likes it&#x27;s heavy. The only draw back are the many chemical ingredients it uses. I have gone to a no shampoo method (apple cider vinegar and baking soda) and this combo leaves my hair looking amazing. So I would like for VS to have a more natural line for ppl like myself that doesn&#x27;t want all those chemicals in my shampoo and or conditioners.</li>
    <li> Made my hair very shiney and appeared to have much more moisture! Would buy this again!</li>
    <li> I am glad I was able to try the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo.  It smells great on my hair even after I was out the whole day.  My hair feels soft and smooth together with the use of the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Conditioner and it protects my hair even when I use the iron.  The shampoo&#x27;s consistency is just right and gives a nice lather which makes me feel like it is really cleaning my hair from roots to tips and also gives my hair a nice shine and volume.  I love it.      I got to try the product for free from Influenster but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t use shampoo with sulfates, but every now and then I like to do a sulfate wash just to remove any build-up.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this shampoo did not leave my fine, naturally curly hair feeling stripped or dry.  Paired with the conditioner in this line, my hair was frizz-free with abundant curls.  I will definitely keep this in my shampoo line-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, but my opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I normally use volumizing shampoo because I have very fine hair. I gave this a shot and was pleasantly surprised! I noticed a difference from the first shampoo. My hair was noticeably smoother and soft. The great thing was that it moisturized my hair without weighing it down. The shampoo had a great scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to try this for free but the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great for natural hair... My hair was so soft and my natural curls look so bouncy.. What I really loved&lt;br /&gt;about this shampoo is it did not dry out my hair.. My hair was so moist and soft...  I combed my hair right after I washed the shampoo out and get this it was already detangle... I am so in love with shampoo... NEW CUSTOMER OF VIDAL SASSON!!!</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo. I have AA naturally curly hair and my hair did not feel stripped at all. It felt moisturized and didn&#x27;t tangle my hair either. The scent was pleasant and not overpowering in my opinion. I would purchase again but it would not be my go to shampoo. I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this shampoo out because I was using a moisture formula of a salon brand and I wanted to see how they compared. After the first wash my hair was extremely tangly and seemed to have a buildup on it. I tried the product a couple more times just to be sure, and my hair was even worse. I ended up having to use a clarifying shampoo and deep conditioner to get it back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some hair types this shampoo might be great, but it did not work at all for mine. I had to use more conditioner than normal to even attempt to get a pick through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very pleasant fragrance, but it is very strong, so beware if you are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shampoo at no cost from Influenster, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I have never received so much silkiness and shine from one product. This is in an incredible shampoo, making my hair feel soft to the touch and look so healthy. My hair was so shiny and not in a greasy way, but in a gorgeous, gotta have it way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot; Product smells great it also does add moisture to my hair. Very pleased! Thank you</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. Smells good! The lather is great and my hair felt softer. I already purchased it.</li>
    <li> this stuff works really well if you need added moisture. and its a great price for what you are getting. When i first got it i was a little concerned with the texture of the shampoo bc i found it to be a little watery. But i used it on my hair with plenty of water and it was a great lather. I really loved how clean it got my hair and the smell of the shampoo was pretty great. I think i will be using it again.  I have pretty healthy hair already so I didnt exactly need moisture. but i would totally use it again :)</li>
    <li> Even though my natural hair color is blonde, I do have very thick hair. It tends to get super dry at the ends. I have tested several shampoos so far, but the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo works best for me! It cleanses hair without making it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I received a sample size of this Vidal Sassoon shampoo from the Vidal Sassoon Voxbox from Influenster to try.&lt;br /&gt;It has lil of no scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is on the light side of lather.&lt;br /&gt;It was a good shampoo, not the best I have used,&lt;br /&gt;but good...my hair is nice an fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  I don&#x27;t know what I did before this, my scalp isn&#x27;t dry like other shampoos seem to leave it, and I love the way my hair is soft and manageable. I guess I found my new shampoo. This was a test on this product, I washed my hair 2 different times, and I could tell after the first time that it was softer, and had a lot more bounce to it.</li>
    <li> I have the most annoying hair in the world. Very long, very fine, with dry ends and an oily scalp. This shampoo takes care of all of that, and changes me from the Wicked Witch back to Rapunzel. The cost isn&#x27;t a killer, and my personal favorite aspect is that is has a great scent. I didn&#x27;t have any issues with it irritating my skin, which is fairly uncommon for me, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s mild as well. It&#x27;s completely worth giving it a whirl if you have problem hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received products from Influenster for testing and review purposes. My opinions and split ends are my own.</li>
    <li> Awesome  shampoo and conditioner!  I could feel the moisture already locking in after just the first wash. My hair has stayed soft and not frizzed for several days.  Thank you Influenster for picking me to test out these products.  I definitely recommend them!!!</li>
    <li> I received a small sample of this shampoo and when I opened it I was overwhelmed (in a good way) by the clean scent of the shampoo. I could not wait to use it. I love bath and body products that have a great scent. As I was using it, it foamed up nicely and easily covered all of my long hair. It was easy to wash out and my hair never felt greasy. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the VS moisture lock shampoo multiple times now and as a licensed Cosmetologist of 18 years, and it is a great shampoo if you are looking for added moisture.  This shampoo and conditioner do not weigh down the hair as a lot of moisture products tend to do.  My hair is left shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> This new line by Vidal Sassoon is AMAZING! I was sent a sample size shampoo compliments of Vidal Sassoon &amp; Influenster! The shampoo is so rich and creamy, leaving my hair &amp; scalp feeling super duper moisturized! I&#x27;m sometimes skeptical on trying new shampoos because they can be stripping and harsh on the hair, NOT this one it did the complete opposite. My hair was soft, bouncy, &amp; very hydrated! Not to mention the fragrance is very pleasant and long lasting. Thanx again for the introduction to my new found love!</li>
    <li> What an awesome product for those of us with fine, dry hair! The minute I tried it I loved the smell and the lather was rich.  Styled as usual with no greasy or weighed down feeling and not an ounce of static!  AND if that weren&#x27;t enough, the next day my hair looked like it was freshly washed!  Love this product and perfect for the dry winter months!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and have noticed a big difference on the texture of my hair.  It is much softer and more smooth now.  It lathers up well but does seem to take more time to rinse then other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.  Overall I am really liking this product!!</li>
    <li> received this product at no cost as part of a sampling program - i actually really enjoyed using it.&lt;br /&gt;the shampoo smells great (even day after!), i have only used a few times so far, so im not sure i see a huge improvement in my hair - however i did notice that day after my hair was less greasy/oily than usual. so thats a bonus in my book!</li>
    <li> really great product, finally a shampoo and conditioner that i like and dont weigh my hair down and leave it feeling like there is still shampoo and conditioner in it, still havent tried the spray yet but i am going to</li>
    <li> Good moisturizing shampoo.  I used this along with the Moisture Lock conditioner and my hair was super soft and smooth.  This formula is a little heavy for every day use on my hair as it did weigh it down a little, but would definitely use as a once a week &#x27;treatment&#x27;.</li>
    <li> works great looks awesome smells great</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have thick dry hair and I use hair strengthener after washing my hair. After using this shampoo, my hair turns out soft and shinny. Love it!</li>
    <li> I never used any Vidal Sassoon products before so I was a bit leery but pleasantly surprised. It worked really well and made my hair feel very smooth. I was able to tell the difference right away. I received this from Influenster to test and I really recommend it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> All though this shampoo smelled amazing and lathered great. It didn&#x27;t add much softness to my hair. Having African American processed hair, I need something that adds shine, softness and manageability and this product did not do a good job of making this happen.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this product! Normally, I don&#x27;t write reviews about hair products, but this one, I had to. I received a free sample from Influenster! I love the smell-it was a fresh and clean smell. I also love how soft it left my hair.My hair has been dyed, so it is kinda dry. This shampoo did not leave any residue in my hair, and I LOVED it.I cannot get enough of this product.I may have to purchase a full size! I have used the sample more than once, just to test it. I would rate the product 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Great product! Has a long lasting scent that smells great. Leaves your hair feeling soft through the whole day. Only downside is the hair felt &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;. I would recommend this to anyone with full thick hair!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, but soft, even before putting in conditioner.  My hair is thick, frizzy, and dry, but looks very smooth even without heat styling after this shampoo and conditioner!  I will definitely purchase this set of products again in the future.  I have frizz and flyaways in the dry months and saying that I don&#x27;t feel the need for a leave-in product after my shower really is saying something! I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are indeed my own.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  I have an oily scalp and dry hair, not a dry scalp, so it really didn&#x27;t do much more than any ordinary shampoo for me overall. I am sure for people with dry hair as well as dry scalps, it will work wonders. I received this complimentary for review from Influenster VoxBox.  For some reason, Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s products aren&#x27;t what they used to be.</li>
    <li> Great scent, used moisture shampoo and conditioner as well as repair spray and its fantastic! Shiny, manageable and received tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> so i received samples of vidal sassoon shampoo and conditioner from #influenster in my #voxbox. i have to say i am really enjoying the product. with the shampoo it lathers up really well and doesnt leave a residue after being rinsed out. i also noticed that with the moisture lock shampoo i dont have to condition everyday. this shampoo leaves my hair smooth and maintains my fly away&#x27;s. also i have noticed that being that my hair is treated my color is not fading as quickly as it has with some other brands... ala in all this is a great shampoo.</li>
    <li> Received this shampoo through Influenster and I was surprisingly happy with the smell (clean and lasting) and the feeling it left my hair with (tangle free). I have thick, most of the time unruly hair and with the humidity in south TX it can be almost impossible to have a good hair day! Love it, and will be buying in the future!</li>
    <li> I really love the moisture lock shampoo. I lack the moisture in my thin hair and I felt this shampoo really has helped with it.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy, oily or limp. Paired with the conditioner, my hair felt silky smooth when using the sample I received. I was able to curl my hair, have it last all day and never tangle up.  This is a huge feat for me as most moisture conditioners/shampoos weigh my thin hair down heavily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost, but all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the bottle I was surprised by the smell. I&#x27;m not a fan, but I pressed on. I used the shampoo for a week and didn&#x27;t like my results. It made my hair frizzy and heavy. I would not reccommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the product at no cost and the opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon?  Isn&#x27;t that the shampoo that used to be on the shelf next to white rain in the store when I was a teenager? Well, maybe, but this stuff has undergone a makeover!&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this shampoo smells amazing. It&#x27;s not overpowering and not overchemically (yes, totally a word) smelling like some shampoos can be.&lt;br /&gt;The lather is good, it feels really good on your hair and rinses nicely. Unlike some of those &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos that leave your hair with nasty buildup.&lt;br /&gt;I should tell you that my hair is extra fine and can tell the weather better than your local meteorologist. On a humid day it is frizzy and huge and on a dry day it is limp and sad looking. I tried the Vidal Sassoon moisture lock on both of these types of days.&lt;br /&gt;On the humid day, this stuff was simply amazing. Left my hair moisturized and shiny. On the dry day it left my hair reallly flat.&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re like me and have to switch up your products, just know that this stuff is really moisturizing, so you&#x27;ll want to use it on the days that your hair can handle it.&lt;br /&gt;I also followed this up with the moisture lock conditioner and the heat protectant spray, all from Vidal Sassoon and was happy with all of the products for taming my frizz head on the humid days.&lt;br /&gt;My usual hair care line is Nexxus, which is substantially more expensive than this line. I would highly recommend giving it a try!&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive these products for free, but my opinions are definitely from my own (no longer) frizzy head.</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair clean soft and manageable. I received this sample free from Influenster, this review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> The moisture lock shampoo leaves hair soft and clean without weighing it down.  A lot if times when a product says moisture it leaves hair feeling dirty or greasy.  Not the case with this shampoo.  And the scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> I really liked this shampoo! I haven&#x27;t tried a lot of VS products, but I will buy this one! I loved the scent and it left my hair feeling clean and smelling good! I will buy it when my sample runs out!!    I received a sample from Influenster, and these opinions are mine alone.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really good at giving you lots of moisture after the first use. It smells good and my hair felt good, but after several uses, my hair started to feel heavy and I could tell there was some buildup. I&#x27;ll continue to use it but only when I need extra moisture.i was compensated but all opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by this shampoo and can&#x27;t wait to try a full bottle. My hair can get oily but is also dry, so it gets hard to find the right product. I have long hair and this really helped eliminate tangles after shower. The conditioner was an added bonus! Definitely recommend trying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product at no charge, but the opinions stated are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this along with it&#x27;s partner conditioner! First off let me say that my hair is very damaged. It&#x27;s gone through much bleaching to get it white. It&#x27;s very fine, dry, frizzy and just all around not very nice to look at. I&#x27;ve been continually switching shampoos(and conditioners) for over a year now trying to find SOMETHING that my hair likes, that my wallet likes and that I like. This is pretty close to perfect for me! It makes my hair soft and it&#x27;s tangle free after washing. My hair normally dries &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;, which is gross... It doesn&#x27;t do that with this. It dries clean and soft, it&#x27;s fairly easy to brush too. The smell is great. It&#x27;s a fresh ozone type scent and I really like it. I also love that this stuff is cheap! It&#x27;s just a few bucks and it&#x27;s easy to find in store. I found it at two stores today when I was pricing it and it was under $4 at both stores! For me that&#x27;s a really good price for how nice this stuff is to my hair. When I run out of my travel size I&#x27;ll be picking up a full size bottle for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive a trial size bottle of this from Influenster, however all opinions are my own! I really do love it. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> My hair turns greasy in one or two days and the shampoo makes my scalp very itchy. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> i love this shampoo. it smells great and makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I have very thin, damaged, frizzy hair. I use heat styling products every day. I look for hair products with a lot of moisture in them. The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo really hydrates my hair. It also has a nice clean scent. This shampoo has left my hair feeling soft all day. I tested this product free of charge, but this is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the results after using new Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo and Conditioner. They left my hair feeling clean, soft, and smooth. As a bonus, it also got rid of my frizzies. Oh, and my 2 year old really loves the smell of my hair, su much that he stands behind me and smells my hair several times a day.</li>
    <li> I figured this shampoo would be like all the others, but the Moisture Lock made my hair feel super clean!  It lathered up in my hair really well and I really felt like my hair was clean.  But the best part was the amazing scent of the shampoo!  I was able to test the product at no cost, but all opinions are your own.</li>
    <li> no initial expectations but worth the small change for the try!</li>
    <li> My hair is very over processed to get it as light as I want, so sometimes, w/other shampoos, if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner it will leave my hair a frizzy, damaged mess. What I really love about this is that if I use it alone I don&#x27;t feel the need to HAVE to use a conditioner. It definitely moisturizes and tames my hair. It has a great scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering also! Now if they could make this where it&#x27;s moisturizing PLUS damage control it would be prefect!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is pretty good for the price. It made my hair feel soft and bouncy (well as bouncy as a pixie cut can be!) and it smells great. If you&#x27;re looking for frills in packaging though, this is not the product for you. I&#x27;ve come to terms with the fact that I have expensive taste, and I like pretty packaging, so I probably won&#x27;t continue to buy this. I prefer a sulfate free shampoo anyway. I tested this product at no cost to me, but the opinions here are completely my own!</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon moisture lock shampoo and conditioner and their spray heat protect &amp; shine really work and they smell great as well. All I can say is thank you Vidal Sassoon for making products that truly do what they say. Being that my hair is dry and damaged due to monthly colorings, I have tried a number of products on the market that claim to do something that they do not.  Nothing compares to the moisture lock from Vidal Sassoon. My hair immediately soaked it in and I know it was thanking me for the much needed moisture that it had been lacking. I am also an avid user of the blow dryer and the flat iron, both of which can cause havoc on our hair and with just the first use of their heat protect and shine product I could tell a big difference. My hair looked and felt the best it has in years after just the first use of all three products. I can honestly say I found my new shampoo, conditioner, and heat protector and it has already become a staple in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this shampoo from Influenster for testing purposes. I have thick and dry hair and I did not think that this product would leave my hair feeling soft. After using my sample, my hair felt clean and soft. This shampoo also has a very nice scent. I will be purchasing this shampoo and I recommend others to also purchase it along with the moisture lock conditioner.</li>
    <li> I liked the shampoo, it smells good, is creamy and it lef my hair smooth and clean without feeling greasy or heavy. The price is good compared to other brands, so I would say it is an average price (which is around $4.00) depending where you get it from. It helped keep my hair smooth and looking healthy even when I flat iron it every other day or my bangs, which I flat iron every day. With the heat protectant spray and the shampoo, the softness of my hair visiby improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wished the shampoo smelled a little bit better. I like my hair smelling good and fresh most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I received the products for free, all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I love a shampoo that does exactly what it says! Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Moisture Lock Shampoo not only moisturizes my scalp and hair, it also keeps my hair from getting dry and it smells fantastic. Win win! The shampoo itself is a thicker consistency than your typical shampoo; however, you can tell it coats your strands evenly versus lighter and looser shampoos. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking to replenish the moisture in their hair - you will come away from your shower with shiny, glossy, clean, and moisturized locks! Just wanted to mention that I tested this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I received this from influenster for me to review but this review is completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;With that said here goes, I have natural curly hair and as most of my curly girls I need moisture to maintain my curls. Now usely I use all natural products might for curly hair and has no sulfate in them. I also dont real use shampoo that offended,  I use cream shampoos , conditioning cleanser,  or vinegar raise.  So when I tried this I thought it was just like any other shampoo who cares right but as soon as I raised it out my hair DIDN&#x27;T feel dry which happens to me when useing other shampoos. Now if you use the conditioner too you are going to be in love. As for would I buy this yes I would buy both the shampoo and conditioner and will be added it to my run.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this shampoo, I really did! It smells nice, consistency is lovely, and I had high hopes for something called &amp;#34;Moisture Lock.&amp;#34;  That said, I was unimpressed.  It left my hair feeling clean but not squeaky-clean (which is great), but it didn&#x27;t seem to add any moisture to my curly hair or do anything to help frizz.  I didn&#x27;t dislike it, but I doubt I&#x27;d buy it.&lt;br /&gt;(Full disclosure: I tested this shampoo at no cost, but this is my very own opinion!)</li>
    <li> I really love that it only takes a little bit of shampoo to get a really nice lather going. It rinses out cleanly and leaves my hair smelling fantastic. Also, I have naturally curly hair and this made my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
    <li> Really Loved the smell of this product! Nice and light and refreshing! I also was happy with the look and feel of my hair after I used it!I received a small trial sized bottle of this to try out and I wanted to come here and give folks my personal opinion of the Shampoo!!</li>
    <li> The first thing that I do when I try a new shampoo, it to smell it!  A product has to smell nice before I will use it and I really do like the scent of the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo.  Not only does this product smell great but it works nicely too!  My hair is thin, dry and medium length so I need extra moisture to help my hair to look and feel its best.  The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy at all.  I would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;I have received a free sample of this product so that I may give my honest opinion on it. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love the way this shampoo makes my hair feel and it smells so good.</li>
    <li> My hair felt very clean after using this shampoo.  It has a great lather and smells great.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing poroduct!  I received my products from influenster.com for free!!&#x27;  My hair gets colored red and it dries it out.  This product kept my hair soft!  I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo and was very pleased with results. I am a naturally curly haired African American. I was impressed at how soft and lush my hair was after shampooing. Being natural, I am very careful on what products I use on my hair. My hair was soft, manageable, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that I dye and blow dry frequently so I am constantly struggling with dry hair. This shampoo has been a huge help! It&#x27;s super creamy and moisturizing and give my hair instant hydration. I love the softer, smoother look I get when I use this and blow dry my hair straight. It has really been a miracle worker for my dry hair especially now that it is winter!  I was fortune enough to be able to test this product for free however these are my true opinions and I will definitely be purchasing more! Highly recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> I love the smell! I use it to really cleanse my hair of build up from other shampoos.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Works great on my hair, smells great and feels good.  \\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Love the smell and love the way it made my hair look.  Can&#x27;t wait to get to the store and buy a bigger bottle</li>
    <li> The products work great for natural curly hair. Thank s to influenster. I was able to try these products free to test and review them and I must say the product is great.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I loved the smell of this shampoo and how much it lathers and cleanses the hair.</li>
    <li> Love the Shampoo my hair was bouncy and super shiny.</li>
    <li> I received a sample bottle of Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo to try out. I had been a Vidal Sassoon haircare user, but I drifted away a while ago. My hair was greasier than usual as I had used an Indian oil hair treatment a few days ago. I was amazed at how clean VS Moisture Lock Shampoo got my hair. Important to me, VS Moisture Lock Shampoo left my hair feeling very clean and my wet hair even made that squeak that I still like when I wash my hair. I used the product in conjunction with the Moisture Lock Conditioner and the Heat &amp; Protect Spray, and my hair looks and feels clean, silky and fabulous!</li>
    <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo. The shampoo was easy to work into my hair and left my hair feeling soft and smooth. I typically use another brand of moisture shampoo and conditioner but found the Vidal Sassoon brand to work just as well with a more pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how thick and creamy this shampoo was. I worried that it would leave my hair greasy-looking, as most conditioning shampoos do.  I was also concerned that it might be heavy, and weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;  As it happens, none of my fears were substantiated. This shampoo lathered nicely, rinsed clean, and left my hair feeling soft and silky. As an added bonus, it didn&#x27;t dry out my scalp, and it left my hair smelling FANTASTIC (like juicy green apples and a hint of wildflowers) until the next shampoo!</li>
    <li> I recently got this shampoo in a influnster box along with the conditioner and a heat protection spray. This shampoo is very moisturizing for my type of hair. I color my hair and use alot of different heating tools in my hair. And the shampoo made my hair soft and shiny and that is what I loved about this shampoo!! This is definitely a product that I plan on purchasing the full size of these products. And I&#x27;m also gonna try all of the products in the line :)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try a shampoo that says moisture lock. This product surprised me though! It not only made my hair feel super soft, but it also cleaned my very oily hair exceptionally well. I would recommend it to anyone nervous about using a shampoo with the word moisture on it. It definitely did the job without compromising cleanliness</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  I have dry hair and this shampoo leaves my hair feeling moisturized while also feeling clean.  Plus, as any good shampoo does - it smells awesome!  It doesn&#x27;t smell too fruity and isn&#x27;t overly flowery.  It is perfect.  I&#x27;m glad I got a sample of this because I will definitely be purchasing soon!</li>
    <li> Do You Love Vidal Sasson as much as I do this stuff happens to be amazing and makes my hair full of life and healthy after being thin and color damaged and heat damage and swimming pool water damage but this is what I take with me no matter where I do on vacation or the gym or in my home its something special!</li>
    <li> I was happy to get to try this out. I have always seen this shampoo on the shelves and seen the commercials but never tried it. I am glad I finally tried it, love it. It makes my hair soft and silky, the smell is great, and it lathers well. I tested this product with a free sample but the opinion of it is my own.</li>
    <li> Was a great product. Felt like it was not a cheap product. Left hair feeling silly soft</li>
    <li> So being a Mom of two and over 40, I have tried ever kind of hair product from dollar store to salons. I have to say I am impressed with the moisture lock shampoo. My hair goes through a lot of stress and normally is dry and frizzy. I have used this for a week now and combined with the conditioner, I am loving my hair! It feels silky and not as dry. I am also starting to be more choosy with my product selection and first thing I look for now a days is if it is made in the US.  First item on the label \\&quot;Made In USA of US and/or Imported ingredients.\\&quot; LOVE IT&gt;  I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product! Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and a noticeable change in hair!</li>
    <li> I have not used may Vidal Sassoon products in the past but I will from now on! I really like how this shampoo makes my hair feel! It&#x27;s so affordable and makes my hair feel light and clean. I like the shampoo more than the conditioner but together they do wonders for my hair. I have also been using the Vidal Sassoon repair spray before any heat treatments. These 3 products work so well together! Thank you Influenster for letting me try this!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing Shampoo. I loved this shampoo. It&#x27;s creamy, smells great, &amp; leaves your hair soft &amp; shiny. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I used many kinds of Shampoo, but this one is just I want.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was skeptical that this shampoo would be right for my hair, since a lot of products that claim to moisturize weigh my hair down and make it look oily by the end of the day. However, this shampoo does not weigh my hair down; it keeps it soft and manageable all day long.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the shampoo is great; it smells clean without smelling too flowery or strong. It lathers into a thick, rich lather on my hair and scalp and washes out quickly and cleanly; I don&#x27;t feel a film on my hair like with other moisturizing products.&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see myself buying more of this to use in the future! I am very pleased with my hair when using this product.</li>
    <li> made my hair soft, but wish it was free of chemicals. considering using once a month or so to restore some moisture to my hair. i am cautious of chemicals in my body products due to skin cancer in my family.</li>
    <li> I received the VIdal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock shampoo complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work for me because I have very fine, thin hair that is extremely dry. I was wrong! My hair ended up super soft and wasn&#x27;t weighed down by this product at all, It also did not make my hair greasy, which tends to happen with other shampoos It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and is very light, clean and refreshing. Give it a try.  You will be glad that you did!</li>
    <li> I tried the Moisture Lock Shampoo, because I have dry, frizzy hair that&#x27;s hard to manage. It kept my hair manageable for a couple of days, I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because I think it would have made my hair too moisturized.The shampoo smelled great, definitely has a nice odor, but if you are person who complains about strong smelling products it might not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;I could see sticking with this product, it&#x27;s great for the price. All in all a good value.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo in my influenster box.  It made my hair really heavy.  I&#x27;m mulatto and have naturally curly, dry hair, so this should have been nice.  However, it just weighed my hair down and made it greasy.  I&#x27;ll never purchase this.  It smells okay and it lathers well.</li>
    <li> I was sent samples of this shampoo, conditioner, and styling spray through influenster to try and I love it so much! My hair was so smooth and smelled great after using these products so I will definitely be buying the full size products! These opinions are my own as I was not paid to post a review but maybe it will help someone else that&#x27;s considering using this!</li>
    <li> The this Vidal Sassoon product worked really great for my extra-dry, hard to manage hair! My hair has never been more softer, moisturized, and shiny than it is since I have been using Vidal Sassoon!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo when I receive a sample from Influenster I was amazed by the smell, and it had my hair so straight. This will be my new shampoo that I will be using for now on</li>
    <li> This Product is Amazing. I never Try it before. I cant Believe how my hair is right now. So shine and soft. I would really recommend this product to every friend. I used this product today afternoon. First, I wet my hair and place a small amount in my fingers. The odor is amazing too. Incentivized. My testing experience is really good and I will buy it</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes your hair feel amazing!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo has made a difference in my hair. My hair is thin and colored..makes my hair soft and has helped with my split ends. I received a free sample from influenster to try and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this!!</li>
    <li> I love the way the shampoo gives you moisture in your hair, I just don&#x27;t like how much lather it has.</li>
    <li> works well, makes your hair looking moisturized.</li>
    <li> While this shampoo has a fairly strong scent, it is pleasant and it does the job. It lathers up easily and gets my thick hair clean quickly.</li>
    <li> Really worth every penny i spend on it. Really a nice product.Must recomended.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very gentle to my damaged hair, a lot of lather, nice delicate scent.</li>
    <li> As a member of Influenster, I received the Moisture Lock Shampoo for free to test and review. I won&#x27;t give a product a review that it doesn&#x27;t deserve it, but I loved this shampoo! I have long hair that I blow dry and flat iron daily. This moisture lock shampoo was moisturizing without being too greasy. I love the smell of the shampoo and it was a great rotation into my hair care.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells nice and lathers well. I have long thick Asian hair which has not been chemically treated but split ends are a constant issue for me. I love the feeling of a shampoo that smoothes my ends out between cuts. I also have a very dry itchy scalp that needs a conditioning shampoo as well as conditioner - I put it into my scalp in certain spots for the dryness - so I appreciate a product which doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;The moisture lock shampoo does keep my ends smooth very well but it only does an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; job of balancing my scalp moisture with heaviness. Anyway, the price is a solid value for the amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells nice and lathers well. I have medium length, fine, straight hair which has not been chemically treated but breakage is a constant issue for me. The moisture lock shampoo keeps my hair feeling clean as well as smooth. The price point for this shampoo is great, so I would definitely consider purchasing it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I love This product. My hair is damaged from drying and dying and is often very dry. Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock Shampoo has been very nice for my hair. It gives my hair the appearance of being healthier and shiny. I will be using this a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo on a day my hair was oily and I was worried that it might leave it oily and not feel as clean as my old shampoo.  It made my hair feel really clean and soft even before I used the conditioner.  I also like the smell of it.  I would recommend this for oily hair as well as dry.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.Love this shampoo! It has a great smell and doesnt weigh my hair down.Leaves your hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I  received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I liked this shampoo right away, it smells terrific and it shampoos up nice with good moisture. My hair is very dry &amp; color processed so this shampoo left my hair super shiny, soft and magaeable. but not weighed down. It has a very nice  light clean smell. I was very impressed with how well this worked on my color processed hair, I have already gone out and purchased more.</li>
    <li> I used a trial size I received for free from Influenster as part of their VoxBox program. The product is okay. I think other products that cost less do a just as good, if not a better, job especially ones that do not have sulfates in them. I have very fine hair and it seemed to weigh it down quite a bit and left it feeling dry despite the fact it&#x27;s &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I don&#x27;t get the weighed down greasy feeling at the end of the day that I am used to getting with my regular brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great shampoo.  The shampoo I had been using lately was not cleaning as well, and this was just what my hair needed for a pick me up! And my hair is so shiny!!</li>
    <li> Great product from Vidal! I love the scent and my hair feels so soft and clean after using it.  I combine with the conditioner of the same series and it works really well together.  My hair is starting to thin, but since I color it I need something moisturizing and this does the trick!</li>
    <li> This shampoo was conditioning and left my hair smoother and with no fly aways and my split ends seemed less obvious.</li>
    <li> I received this as an incentive. But I&#x27;m happy to report that I&#x27;m very impress with the quality of this product. The fragance is amazing. It cleans your hair throughly and leaves it smelling so good. The next day after I tried it my hair still looked shinny and the fragance was still noticeable. I have wavy hair and with this product I decided to leave off my frizz control serum and my hair doesn&#x27;t look like I will be needing it.</li>
    <li> It is a good product. I really like how it lathers and how it makes my hair feel clean right away. This shampoo along with its conditioner have helped my previously dry and dull hair come back to life. And for that, I am thankful. Even though I tested this product at no cost, this is my own opinion.</li>
    <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. At the time of receiving these products I had a protective style. Therefore I was thinking how was I going to use this product and write an review. Then I said why not try it on my son&#x27;s hair that&#x27;s curly. First of all the smell is amazing!  It smells as if you&#x27;ve just received services at a salon. My son (age 5) hair sucks up moisture no matter what. After trying this product his hair was not so dry looking. His curls seem to look healthier with a moisture look.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing. I recently received this shampoo for free to try out. WOW! this shampoo worked so well for me. i was super impressed at how my hair was so soft. Usually my hair is overly dry and coarse. I cannot believe the great quality that this shampoo provided. I don&#x27;t even get this much softness from salon shampoo. I highly recommend this shampoo, and will definitely be buying more of this whole line of VS.</li>
    <li> love love love this shampoo!  I love the smell (which is a huge factor in my Shampoo purchase).  It also lathers very well and my hair feels clean after washing.  I also feel like I could go an extra say without washing - and use a dry shampoo in its place.</li>
    <li> Works well for non-salon shampoo</li>
    <li> I tend to look for a few features in shampoo such as works well with long, medium thick hair, cleanse thoroughly, easy to wash away with no residue. This shampoo does just that and since it&#x27;s made from P&amp;G it is very consistent with their other shampoos. My hair is soft and shiny as a result of this shampoo. Though this shampoo reminds me most of Pantene. So if you like Pantene you would definitely like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I tested this shampoo at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> My hair is not always easy to tame. It is what I like to call environmental hair. It easily absorbs anything I expose it to and that is not always kind. It can leave it flat, limp, oily, and sometimes a shaggy mess. Needless to say I am always in search of great affordable hair care products. So when I had the opportunity to try the Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Moisture Lock line I had to try it. Affordable, easily accessible, and a brand I trust. So I tried it for a week now and my hair is looking shiny, healthy, and manageable. It literally creates a healthy barrier in my hair to create a smooth silky feel. No more dry fly-a-ways, tangle mess or flat hair days. It is simply my best hair every day. I love it. I got a chance to try it free but I can tell you with all honesty my voice is my own. And this voice can say with all honesty it is so worth the try. You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> This product provides great moisture to dry or damaged hair!  Don&#x27;t need a lot for great suds and my hair feels clean and smooth after I use this product both with and without the conditioner.  My hair feels soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t dry out!  I received a sample to test this product at no cost, but my opinions on this product are mine.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this shampoo. Many moisturizing shampoos leave your hair flat or greasy looking. This did neither. It left my hair smooth. No frizz or flyaways. The smell was very nice. No tangles when brushing either. I really enjoyed this shampoo. The conditioner was good as well, but the smell of it was bad.  I was able to test this product at no cost, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Normally, I am NOT a fan of things that say &amp;#34;Moisture&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Repair&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hydration&amp;#34;, or &amp;#34;to repair Dryness&amp;#34;- or any combination. I suffer from a super oily scalp, and still manage to have dry hair and split ends. Conditioner leaves me even worse off that shampoo! I was hesitant to try this, and was SHOCKED at the results. Currently, I am using a shampoo that MAY be endorsed my Heidi Klum, and my hair looks and feels greasy and dirty and gross every single day. So that is how often I have to wash my hair. This VS shampoo- and condition!- I tried and LOVE!! I am washing my hair every other day. Its a little thick- I have to get my hair wet, lather up, and then add a little more water to get it really foamy and happy- but I attribute that to the moisture formula. This Shampoo/conditioner combo makes me happy.</li>
    <li> I have color-treated curly hair, so my hair tends to dry out and frizz if not treated well.  Vidal Sassoon Moisture Lock Shampoo is fantastic!! It smells wonderful, lathers well, leaves my hair feeling clean and manageable.  It keeps the moisture in!  I received it as a sample through Influenster originally, but decided on purchasing a full size bottle.  It has an affordable price too, much cheaper than the big salon brands.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells so good! I&#x27;ve been proved it for two weeks and leaves my hair smooth and shine with a girly smell for all day. I think it have a good price and it&#x27;s a professional product that we can have in home.&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product at no cost, however all the opinions  are sincerely and based on my experience with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> price is good that&#x27;s why i bought this</li>
</ol>
