    <li> Large and good for travel as is all vinyl and will dry off with a towel and a shake. Keeps my hair dry but it is short and not long and heavy.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is the worst made product.  The stitching for the band is sloppy.  The elastic is not aligned properly.</li>
    <li> I WAS TSO GLAD TO GET A SHOWER CAP THAT IS EXTRA LARGE SO MY HAIR WILL NOT STICK OUT OF THE CAP.</li>
    <li> Mine came not attached tothe elastic completely a rip off</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice size. Not skimpy at all.  Very nice. Plan on purchasing another as a spare or as a gift.</li>
    <li> I always buy this product.  A+</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my big head! Love it:)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as great with keeping all water out but it&#x27;s a good size and a good price.</li>
    <li> Very nice. My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> This cap claims to be XL, but its no bigger than a regular one.  I have thick curly shoulder length hair and the cap can still afford to be bigger in my opinion.</li>
    <li> THE CAPS I ORDERED MEASURED ONLY 10\\&quot; IN DIAMETER. IT SEEMS THEY GET THE 21\\&quot; BY MEASURING THE ENTIRE CAP TOP PLUS BOTTOM. DID NOT ACCOMODATE MY MEDIUM LENGTH HAIR WITHOUT SOME GETTING WET. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT A LARGE CAP.</li>
    <li> its says shower cap but what i got in the mail were satin sleep caps this was very misleading and the were not XL they were just L</li>
    <li> Works, but cheaply made</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s an XL, it&#x27;s still too small and fits more like a m-l. I need it to fit over rollers but it just didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
    <li> My husband and have been looking for this shower caps at ever hair supply shops, we would find some but it just wasn&#x27;t the right ones. Finally I came across them on Amazon once more I can say Amazon safe the day. It&#x27;s great for guys with dreads and women with a lot of hairs that just can&#x27;t seem to find the right shower cap this is a perfect cap for you.I will be back for more for sure.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length dreads that are rather thick. This does a nice job and protects them from getting wet.</li>
    <li> Great for dreads but material&lt;br /&gt;Should be a little thicker</li>
    <li> love it thank u just what i was looking for perfect. i needed someting keep my hiar up after i was it my hair is super long. this very help ful.</li>
    <li> I purchased 5 of these shower caps and when I received these caps. I was so disappointed!  They are plastic caps. I was looking for a good shower cap that was lined with terry . This was just a vinyl material and they were not lined at all. I gave them two star because of fast shipping. Update: this company will not refund my money. Do not buy from them!!!&#x27;</li>
    <li> I have ordered several shower caps over the past year, and was excited when  read that this cap had a large diameter.  When I received it, not only was the cap the same size as other smaller caps, but the diameter on the paper advertising the cap was not what had been written in the ad.  I had ordered two caps in high hopes.  I returned them both but only was given credit for one (Maybe, i&#x27;m not sure if it has been credited or not), but was told that because I had opened one to try it on--and it was too small of course--it was not returnable.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is way too loose and my hair got wet every time I used it, not to mention that it kept falling down over my eyes.  I would not recommend this product and I had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Great product. Perfect size for my long locs to fit under and a good price.</li>
