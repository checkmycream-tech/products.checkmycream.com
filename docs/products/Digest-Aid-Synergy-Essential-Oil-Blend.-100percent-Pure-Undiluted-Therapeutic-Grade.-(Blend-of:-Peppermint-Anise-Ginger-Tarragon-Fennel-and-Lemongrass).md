      <li>I have not used it on myself to judge this better.</li>
      <li>I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils and the dilutions too.  </li>
      <li>It smells alot better.</li>
      <li>Truly magical.  </li>
      <li>It works really well and smells great</li>
      <li>I doubt I will :)</li>
      <li>eat extremely clean, yoga, drink as many ounces as my weight every day.</li>
      <li>I can not say for sure, but his fussiness subsided in the evenings, he was previously only happy</li>
      <li>This relieves the pain quickly :)</li>
      <li>First of all it smells great, even though it was HIGHLY diluted by me to massage onto his belly each  night.  </li>
      <li>The smell is not the best, but if you put a small amount on your lower abdomen it is not as noticeable.  </li>
      <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as Digestzen.</li>
      <li>and I love it, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was supposed to do- calm the stomach.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this product, the price alone makes it worth the try, even if it was the placebo effect.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m really pleased with every oil i have gotten from plant therapy thus far</li>
      <li>I thought it was worth the try.  </li>
      <li>but I have enjoyed plant therapy stuff so far.  </li>
      <li>but I must be doing something right as it is helping.</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really know if this product was going to be as good as Duttera&#x27;s Digestzen, but since there are only two ingredients missing and the reviews were all great and the price is so much cheaper</li>
      <li>so I am still learning, but I am glad I purchased this as I occasionally suffer digestive issues.</li>
      <li>I love Plant Therapy soaps, so decided to give their essential oils a try.</li>
      <li>It really seems to calm my tummy and makes me feel ready for bed.  </li>
      <li>and it really helps so much!</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Really helps.</li>
      <li>It really calms my stomach and soothes it when I have eaten out.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t see a real difference when I applied this to my belly when having a stomach ache.</li>
      <li>I have taken it multiple times since I bought this a couple of months ago, (in a capsule - about 5 drops) and it doesn&#x27;t have the powerful effect of easing my stomach like Digestzen, so I am going back to paying more for Digestzen.</li>
      <li>Stress goes straight to my stomach with indigestion and stomach aches.  </li>
      <li>The other blends I&#x27;ve purchased from Plant Therapy has worked well, so I&#x27;m sure this blend will as well.</li>
      <li>I seriously never leave home without it.</li>
      <li>Seemed more like just s peppermint oil really :/</li>
      <li>It has a few missing ingredients when comparing it to digestzen, but I mostly depend on the peppermint to ease my stomach aches, so I figured this would do fine.</li>
      <li>Prior, restaurant food would often leaving her feeling not so hot.  </li>
      <li>I want this stuff inside my stomach if I am going to have it relieve my discomfort, so i swallowed some - I&#x27;m still alive.</li>
      <li>I did not know that it needed to be mixed with another nuetral oil, (I called the company because there were no directions: reached a very helpful person) but we had some olive oil on hand.</li>
      <li>I read about other, much more expensive digestion oils and found this much more affordable alternative.  </li>
      <li>Essential oil use is new to me</li>
      <li>I have major digestive issues..</li>
      <li>Great bad belly buster.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo or really helps, but I have used this on my 7 year old daughter who frequently takes antibiotics and complains of tummy aches almost every day and it seems to ease her discomfort.  </li>
      <li>not sure if it is less potent.</li>
      <li>(Diluted due to his age and recommendations to never put straight essential oils on an infant.)</li>
      <li>I used those two items for myself and kids daily for the first few weeks on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the first few days especially after eating I would start to feel barfy and this helped a lot.  </li>

<li> In the first few days especially after eating I would start to feel barfy and this helped a lot.  </li>
<li> After a few weeks of this, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t having indigestion any more and the lumpy feeling in my throat has markedly decreased.  </li>
<li> I purchased this for my 4-5 month old due to stomach issues that make it hard for him to tolerate dairy and soy in my breast milk and silent reflux issues.  </li>
<li> My only concern is that it is less viscose, so</li>
<li> I simply mix a few drops with coconut oil and rub it on my abdomen and throat each night before going to bed.  </li>
<li> so when i saw Digest Aid by Plant Therapy at a way lower price, I was curious.</li>
<li> I mixed w/ an oil to rub on my stomach &amp; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it</li>
<li> Also, DoTerra&#x27;s Slim &amp; Sassy, which is supposed to be some sort of appetite suppressant but has ginger and other things in it that help with nausea.  </li>
<li> (2)  Don&#x27;t eat late in the evening, and if you have such an occasion, don&#x27;t lie down for a couple of hours.  </li>
<li> Every time, the have stopped the vomiting in less than 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Recently having issues with egg and dairy intolerance; bloating, gas, gurgles, constipation, terrible bowel movements, abdominal cramping, overall extreme discomfort consistently about an hour after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Rubbed it clockwise on their bellies and then a little on their feet.</li>
<li> I have been buying Digestzen by Doterra for a few years now</li>
<li> I rub a few drops of this oil on the palm of my hand and rub it all around my stomach</li>
<li> She took it and said she&#x27;s not sure if she likes it or</li>
<li> It has saved a few vacations!!</li>
<li> She was throwing up from 1 am to 3 am and was pretty miserable.  </li>
<li> My diarrhea has decreased since using it.</li>
<li> if it works but it does taste bad going down and burping it all day.</li>
<li> He has bad heartburn.</li>
<li> The Digest Aid prevented my dog from getting car sick</li>
<li> I received my order yesterday and it so happened my chocolate lab got sick from something she ate.  </li>
<li> It may not work for you, but it made all the difference for me...without ingesting medications with dangerous side-effects!</li>
<li> Also used after bad salmon and it worked wonders!  </li>
<li> About a year ago, I began having terrible problems with indigestion and all things associated with it, including the lumpy feeling in my throat from acid reflux.  </li>
<li> This smells too horrible for me to use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only giving this 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t had a need to use it yet. The other blends I&#x27;ve purchased from Plant Therapy has worked well, so I&#x27;m sure this blend will as well.</li>
    <li> I like this company. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because her stomach doesn&#x27;t work sometimes. She took it and said she&#x27;s not sure if she likes it or if it works but it does taste bad going down and burping it all day.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t go without this.  Recently having issues with egg and dairy intolerance; bloating, gas, gurgles, constipation, terrible bowel movements, abdominal cramping, overall extreme discomfort consistently about an hour after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this by rubbing two drops diluted in coconut oil on my stomach twice a day and taking two drops in a capsule internally once a day.  All of the symptoms have dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eat extremely clean, yoga, drink as many ounces as my weight every day. I am in the process of heading a leaky gut, and this seems to be making the biggest difference.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it actually is working, but I like the way it feels on my tummy when I use it.</li>
    <li> Has been working great</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really know if this product was going to be as good as Duttera&#x27;s Digestzen, but since there are only two ingredients missing and the reviews were all great and the price is so much cheaper I thought it was worth the try.  I received my order yesterday and it so happened my chocolate lab got sick from something she ate.  She was throwing up from 1 am to 3 am and was pretty miserable.  Tums didn&#x27;t work, so i finally tried Digest Aid oil.  I rubbed the oil on her belly and cannot believe that my dog relaxed instantly within a minute and finally went to sleep.  My husband and I could not believe it!  This oil works on animals too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a real difference when I applied this to my belly when having a stomach ache. I could tell some difference when I applied it yo my 3 year when she had a yummy ache. Seemed more like just s peppermint oil really :/</li>
    <li> The last 5 case of stomach flu that have hit my children, I have used this diluted in olive oil. Rubbed it clockwise on their bellies and then a little on their feet. Every time, the have stopped the vomiting in less than 30 minutes. I don&#x27;t leave home without it. It has saved a few vacations!!</li>
    <li> This smells too horrible for me to use. Something about the smell makes me want to throw up so I have only used it twice. I recommend Do Terra&#x27;s version. It smells alot better.</li>
    <li> About a year ago, I began having terrible problems with indigestion and all things associated with it, including the lumpy feeling in my throat from acid reflux.  A friend recommended that I try peppermint oil.  I began checking out the oil on Amazon and saw this.  It has changed my life dramatically.  I simply mix a few drops with coconut oil and rub it on my abdomen and throat each night before going to bed.  After a few weeks of this, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t having indigestion any more and the lumpy feeling in my throat has markedly decreased.  I am so grateful for this.  It may not work for you, but it made all the difference for me...without ingesting medications with dangerous side-effects! Two things I would suggest to help decrease the potential for indigestion: (1)  Figure out your &amp;#34;triggers&amp;#34; (one of mine is cooked tomatoes as in spaghetti sauce) and avoid them, especially in the evenings.  (2)  Don&#x27;t eat late in the evening, and if you have such an occasion, don&#x27;t lie down for a couple of hours.  You can always doze in the recliner for a couple of hours or so prior to actually going to bed!</li>
    <li> Use this all the time. It really calms my stomach and soothes it when I have eaten out. I have several food sensitivities and I keep this on hand. I have also used it for my children when they are feeling &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; in their bellies. Really helps.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent that comforts &amp; soothes my cranky tummy. Essential oil use is new to me so I am still learning, but I am glad I purchased this as I occasionally suffer digestive issues. I mixed w/ an oil to rub on my stomach &amp; I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m doing it right but I must be doing something right as it is helping. I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used it yet but I have enjoyed plant therapy stuff so far.  no real big complaints at all.</li>
    <li> I really love this blend! I found it to be better than a really expensive MLM blend I had been using.</li>
    <li> I love all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s oils and the dilutions too.  They all smell like they should, work well.  Great products!  The Digest Aid prevented my dog from getting car sick</li>
    <li> I suffer with constipation, sometimes only pooping once or twice a week, I&#x27;ve used this for three days now and have gone each day that I used it.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stomach issues, nausea, indigestion, pain, bloating, all a result of cancer and several surgeries of the abdomen 8 years ago.  This oil blend works!  I blend a few drops with a carrier oil and massage my stomach and in no time I feel so much relief.</li>
    <li> This oil works amazing on stomach bugs, digestive issues and tummy aches</li>
    <li> awesome stuff...I have major digestive issues..I put 1 drop in an 8 ounce glass of filtered water and drink about 1/4 cup of this before a meal...does a good job.  On my second bottle.</li>
    <li> this is comparable to DoTerra&#x27;s digestZen.  and, as you can imagine, way cheaper.  i&#x27;m really pleased with every oil i have gotten from plant therapy thus far</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a placebo or really helps, but I have used this on my 7 year old daughter who frequently takes antibiotics and complains of tummy aches almost every day and it seems to ease her discomfort.  The smell is not the best, but if you put a small amount on your lower abdomen it is not as noticeable.  As always, Plant Therapy provides a great product at a great cost and with fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Works well for me...Stress goes straight to my stomach with indigestion and stomach aches.  This relieves the pain quickly :)</li>
    <li> Fairly  effective substitute for the more costly DIGIZE . I purchased it to use  while on travel in Asia and it did what&lt;br /&gt;it was supposed to do- calm the stomach.  It is not as viscous  as YLO. Has a good smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  I know the company does not advertise to do this with their product, but I rub a drop on my gums at night when I&#x27;ve eaten a spicy meal.  It really seems to calm my tummy and makes me feel ready for bed.  I think it helps my belly not get rowdy, which it tends to do.  My diarrhea has decreased since using it.</li>
    <li> I love Plant Therapy soaps, so decided to give their essential oils a try. It is a lot cheaper than YL. My only concern is that it is less viscose, so not sure if it is less potent. I have not used it on myself to judge this better. Goes well on my son though.</li>
    <li> My stomach seems to feel unsettled a lot of times after eating. I rub a few drops of this oil on the palm of my hand and rub it all around my stomach and it really helps so much! I have not found a Plant Therapy oil that I do not like yet... I doubt I will :)</li>
    <li> Totally happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product helps me a lot with my digestion issues.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 4-5 month old due to stomach issues that make it hard for him to tolerate dairy and soy in my breast milk and silent reflux issues.  I read about other, much more expensive digestion oils and found this much more affordable alternative.  First of all it smells great, even though it was HIGHLY diluted by me to massage onto his belly each  night.  (Diluted due to his age and recommendations to never put straight essential oils on an infant.) I can not say for sure, but his fussiness subsided in the evenings, he was previously only happy while nursing for extended periods of time, this gave me a break from the marathon sessions. Again, we also did gripewater at the same time, but I do not discredit the oils.  I recommend this product, the price alone makes it worth the try, even if it was the placebo effect.</li>
    <li> We (my boyfriend who I bought this for) has tried it once with good results.  He has bad heartburn. I did not know that it needed to be mixed with another nuetral oil, (I called the company because there were no directions: reached a very helpful person) but we had some olive oil on hand. Will keep trying it. Smells great.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Digestzen by Doterra for a few years now and I love it, can&#x27;t live without it. so when i saw Digest Aid by Plant Therapy at a way lower price, I was curious. I just got it today and read the label; it doesn&#x27;t mention anything about taking it internally, why not? I want this stuff inside my stomach if I am going to have it relieve my discomfort, so i swallowed some - I&#x27;m still alive. It has a few missing ingredients when comparing it to digestzen, but I mostly depend on the peppermint to ease my stomach aches, so I figured this would do fine. So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as Digestzen. I have taken it multiple times since I bought this a couple of months ago, (in a capsule - about 5 drops) and it doesn&#x27;t have the powerful effect of easing my stomach like Digestzen, so I am going back to paying more for Digestzen.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Not for oral use&amp;#34; stated on the bottle. I had no idea.</li>
    <li> I Love this Digest Aid  It works really well and smells great so thats a plus ,  Will buy again !</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! Great bad belly buster.</li>
    <li> Works as well as DoTerra&#x27;s DigestZen but a lot cheaper.  Took it traveling and used after sketchy street meals and had no problems with stomach issues.  Also used after bad salmon and it worked wonders!  Woke up at 3am with the sweats and stomach cramps running to the loo.  Nothing came up so I reached for the Digest Aid while laying on the bathroom floor thinking I was still going to blow.  10 minutes later I was off to bed and woke up feeling 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had good luck with it on a cruise for queasy sea stomach.  In the first few days especially after eating I would start to feel barfy and this helped a lot.  Also, DoTerra&#x27;s Slim &amp; Sassy, which is supposed to be some sort of appetite suppressant but has ginger and other things in it that help with nausea.  I used those two items for myself and kids daily for the first few weeks on board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is gluten intolerant and she is never without a bottle of this stuff.  After any restaurant meal that may be contaminated, she just uses 2 or 3 drops and has had no issues since using this.  Prior, restaurant food would often leaving her feeling not so hot.  One bottle lasts her about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also AMAZING for gas!  Broccoli or beans on the menu?  Take this with you!  Truly magical.  Wish I&#x27;d had it when my babies were nursing and I ate things with onions.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it to them, but take it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stays in my purse and is always with me.  I seriously never leave home without it.</li>
