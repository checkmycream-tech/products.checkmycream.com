      <li>This one however works great, smells great and lasts longer than most.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a really good thing it fades</li>

      <li>and his fair skin is well protected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>, this had good coverage.  </li>
      <li>It is fairly water-resistant but doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel greasy.</li>
      <li>and I inherited her fair skin tone.</li>

      <li>If you have no olfactory sense at all, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave the fingers sticky or greasy, so that is a pleasant change from many sunscreen lotions.</li>
      <li>This is a very good sunscreen, and overall I have found Banana Boat to be a very good brand.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is as effective as any #30 product.</li>
      <li>Effective and seemingly grease-free.</li>
      <li>The bottle is a nice 8oz size</li>
      <li>The smell takes a minute to get use to and kind of reminds me of OFF.</li>
      <li>This provided superior coverage, stayed on better in the water, and the kids loved the cool feel as we applied it.</li>
      <li>That sure feels good on a hot summer day!</li>
      <li>I suppose on the merits of the fact that this sunscreen works, I should give it more stars.</li>
      <li>and it did its job of protecting our precious skin.  </li>
      <li>Unlike most sunscreens, however, it includes a component that makes it feel like it&#x27;s cooling your skin after you apply it, which can be refreshing.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something about theme parks that makes me burn more</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this product as a suncreen.</li>
      <li>My favorite sunblock.  </li>
      <li>I a pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try those too.</li>
      <li>Most sunscreens don&#x27;t come with putrid smells.</li>
      <li>The alcohol helps the sunscreen to be spread more easily and it evaporates, cooling off the skin.</li>
      <li>Best part is that in all activities it lasts hours longer that most other products.</li>
      <li>Sun protection is adequate for an SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container fits nicely in the hand and is easy to grip.</li>
      <li>What I liked about it is how easily it is absorbed.</li>
      <li>The cooling part is a bit novel and really would feel good if you&#x27;re reapplying after being out in the sun.</li>
      <li>They do dispense easily, but sometimes lotion can get in the lid and cake up.</li>
      <li>lotion applies easily.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s in an easy grip bottle so it doesn&#x27;t slide out your hand so easily.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; in Coolzone is apparently just the effect of alcohol evaporating out of the lotion on your skin, but it is fairly pleasant and refreshing.</li>
      <li>It has some stuff in it that makes you feel cool when you put it on, to encourage re-application when you&#x27;re out in the sun and need it most.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It works fine.</li>
      <li>- so I suppose it works just fine.</li>
      <li>It seems to get the job done just fine.</li>
      <li>as a sunscreen, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>I love the cooling effect as well, it is really refreshing on a hot day at  the beach.</li>
      <li>but my husband who insists on odor free products rejected this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice white sunscreen that goes on nicely and rubs in without a trace.</li>
      <li>This is no exception and seems to offer good protection on sunny days in and out of the water or while we are busy doing sweaty activities.</li>
      <li>I like this sunscreen, although the \\&quot;coolzone\\&quot; part of it didn&#x27;t seem significant.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a non-sunscreen smell that is more cheap cologne than anything, but I actually kind of like it, and I think prefer it to the standard sunscreen smell.  </li>
      <li>I recently reviewed the Banana Boat Protect &amp; Hydrate, and liked it, but I like this one even better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it has a clean smell, as staed ont he bottle.</li>
      <li>Fairly light and non-greasy, absorbs well, but is a bit sticky, especially in high humidity.</li>
      <li>This is so cool to the touch that the kids cannot wait to reapply</li>
      <li>The cool part comes from denatured alcohol and menthol in the lotion.</li>
      <li>This claims to instantly cool and refresh.  </li>
      <li>So far I have liked majority of all the sunscreen made by Banana Boat and this one was no exception.</li>
      <li>It goes on feeling cool and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes with sweat even if I&#x27;m mowing the lawn.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate sunscreen over this particular version, as it smells better and absorbs better.</li>
      <li>It has a cooling affect when you put it on your skin - almost like a menthol, but it fades quickly.  </li>
      <li>Once the alcoholh quickly evaporated, the scent was mildly \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; and I can&#x27;t say I noticed it at all once the lotion was dry.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes smoothly on the skin and moisturizes it (this product is a two-in-one deal), as well as provides a cooling effect in the hot sun.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Though, all sunscreen feels cool coming fresh out of the bottle to me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an effective sunscreen, in fact, I would say it&#x27;s good enough to not have to be re-applied as long as you&#x27;re not playing in the water.</li>
      <li>kind of reminds me of lineament mixed with an inexpensive cologne.</li>
      <li>It smells more like a cheap cologne mixed with bug spray.</li>
      <li>It feels cool on the skin when you first apply.  </li>
      <li>tried it on a hot day at the zoo, and notice a mild cooling effect.  </li>
      <li>Plus it smells good, unlike every other sunblock.</li>
      <li>Banana Boat Sport Coolzone Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 has a strong and not particularly pleasant odor but a pleasant lotion-like creaminess.</li>
      <li>like the bottle; it is easy to squeeze with a narrower center for easy handling.</li>
      <li>really, really like the fruity fragrance of this sunscreen!</li>
      <li>I got this one, and the first thing that gets you is the smell...</li>
      <li>However I didn&#x27;t think much of the claim of instantly cooling and refreshing as it is applied.</li>
      <li>I did reapply frequently, because I&#x27;m super cautious about burns, but it did the trick and worked well for my kids too.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and completely.</li>
      <li>I did not have any skin reactions (super sensitive skin too)</li>
      <li>Generally, I would prefer to use something more natural since skin absorbs so much onto itself.</li>
      <li>The scent of this can seem a little strong straight out of the bottle, fortunately it fades fast.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is reasonably priced, and it seems to do the job of protecting my skin from sunburn.  </li>
      <li>The product itself smoothes on and absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t too much to say here.  </li>
      <li>sunscreen is fairly cheap, but I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason why someone should have to settle for something as flawed as this product.</li>
      <li>Even though this product has an SPF of 30, this sport sunblock did really well -</li>
      <li>Otherwise, there isn&#x27;t much to suggest this over the non-cooling Banana Boat products.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a cooling sensation, but maybe you need to be sunburned?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a cooling sensation.  </li>
      <li>tried to use this, I really did, but the smell was too much.</li>
      <li>I really like it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if it was all in our minds, but it was enough to get my seven year old to enjoy putting on sunscreen, and frankly that by itself is worth the price.  </li>
      <li>thing was that this stung my eyes a bit, not as much as some products that seem to stream into your eyes, but just a bit when I adjusted my goggles at times.  </li>
      <li>this sunscreen does absorb fast.  </li>
      <li>It goes on with a light an cool feel, and even though I am not a heavy sweater, it manages to stay on when I work out or bike a little bit better than a regular sunscreen.</li>
      <li>The cooling effect is like a mild menthol salve and short</li>
      <li>This is a decent product that has the pluses of giving the skin a cooling sensation as well as being water proof for eighty minutes.</li>
      <li>The scent on this smells like lever 200 rain body wash, classic soap smell.</li>
      <li>No complaints, and big compliments for getting my daughter to put on sunscreen willingly!</li>
      <li>Although that&#x27;s not exactly the case, I do burn really easily and always apply SPF 35</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how smooth it went one and how long it lasted.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  My favorite sunblock.  It rubs in easily and does not give you that greasy feeling!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve trusted Banana Boat in the past and have been pleased with the product. This is no exception and seems to offer good protection on sunny days in and out of the water or while we are busy doing sweaty activities. We&#x27;ve used it quite a few times with no issues on adults and children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on evenly. The scent does have a slight alcohol smell but overall did not bother me especially after it was on for a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I suppose on the merits of the fact that this sunscreen works, I should give it more stars. I simply cannot. The smell of this sunscreen left much to be desired though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen did not leave me with any sunburn. Given my fair complexion I was impressed. The smell almost caused me to wish to take the risk though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is fairly cheap, but I can&#x27;t really think of a good reason why someone should have to settle for something as flawed as this product. Most sunscreens don&#x27;t come with putrid smells. Go buy one of those and don&#x27;t waste your time being nauseated by this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many Banana Boat products and have never been disappointed. As they continue to come out with new products I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try those too. This one however works great, smells great and lasts longer than most. The cool zone version adds a nice effect when working in the yard or out in the heat it seems to exaggerate small breezes slightly. Best part is that in all activities it lasts hours longer that most other products. Great for kids in the water. Highly recommend this and other Banana Boat products.</li>
    <li> This product was designed to be used for re-application. It has some stuff in it that makes you feel cool when you put it on, to encourage re-application when you&#x27;re out in the sun and need it most. It&#x27;s an effective sunscreen, in fact, I would say it&#x27;s good enough to not have to be re-applied as long as you&#x27;re not playing in the water. It doesn&#x27;t run off your forehead into your eyes if you sweat. Although the bottle is a bit small and a bit expensive, a little goes a long way so this bottle will last you longer than you might think. I would definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> It can be so hard to get kids to reapply sunscreen. This is so cool to the touch that the kids cannot wait to reapply and ooh and ahh over the cooling effect. This makes my job easier! I love the cooling effect as well, it is really refreshing on a hot day at  the beach. The sunscreen stayed on well when we were active and kept our skin looking the same as it did the moment we hit the beach.</li>
    <li> It feels cool on the skin when you first apply.  My kids didn&#x27;t mind the smell of the lotion, but I dind&#x27;t like it personally.  I don&#x27;t think it has a clean smell, as staed ont he bottle. We had it on entire day at the beach and it did its job of protecting our precious skin.  Anyways,</li>
    <li> I feel like this one is fairly typical as sunscreen goes. It seems to get the job done just fine. I haven&#x27;t unexpectedly burned or anything. The scent isn&#x27;t spectacular or horrible, and I&#x27;m not really quite sure what the cooling sensation is really supposed to achieve. Though, all sunscreen feels cool coming fresh out of the bottle to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works fine. It&#x27;ll do its job. I just didn&#x27;t think it stood out as something I&#x27;d go out of my way to pick over the company&#x27;s other options.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m white... as in my mama has red hair and I inherited her fair skin tone. I usually go with higher SPF, but I wanted to try 30 again. I was surprised at how smooth it went one and how long it lasted. I did reapply frequently, because I&#x27;m super cautious about burns, but it did the trick and worked well for my kids too.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty standard general-use sunscreen. Fairly light and non-greasy, absorbs well, but is a bit sticky, especially in high humidity. It has a &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scent, but it&#x27;s not too distracting, and at least it&#x27;s not that creepy chemical sunscreen smell. I didn&#x27;t really notice a cooling sensation, but maybe you need to be sunburned?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard sunscreen at a good price.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Sport Coolzone Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 has a strong and not particularly pleasant odor but a pleasant lotion-like creaminess. It is neither so thick that it is difficult to apply nor so thin that it runs and drips. It is fairly water-resistant but doesn&#x27;t make the skin feel greasy. It will burn the eyes if it gets in them. Sun protection is adequate for an SPF 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container fits nicely in the hand and is easy to grip. I don&#x27;t particularly like the upside-down design although I understand that it facilitates getting the last bit out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really don&#x27;t like is the very small six ounce size of the little bottle. I usually buy the No Ad brand and it is sixteen ounces and is in the same price range.</li>
    <li> So far I have liked majority of all the sunscreen made by Banana Boat and this one was no exception. The bottle is a nice 8oz size and I like that it&#x27;s in an easy grip bottle so it doesn&#x27;t slide out your hand so easily. The product itself smoothes on and absorbs very well. The smell takes a minute to get use to and kind of reminds me of OFF. It does provide a slight coolness but its not long lasting Overall the sunscreen does its job and has been a staple product for me and my kids this summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Banana Boat products. They work well and are usually non-greasy. Unfortunately I found this product to be greasier than other Banana Boat products and it has a very noticeable odor. Being a \\&quot;sport\\&quot; product my guess is they tried to make it smell \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; but in my opinion they missed the mark. It smells more like a cheap cologne mixed with bug spray. The greasiness dissipated after several minutes and the odor wasn&#x27;t overly offensive once I had finished applying the product but considering Banana Boat makes a wide range of products that don&#x27;t have either of these issues, I won&#x27;t be getting this one again.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is as effective as any #30 product. What I liked about it is how easily it is absorbed. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave the fingers sticky or greasy, so that is a pleasant change from many sunscreen lotions. However I didn&#x27;t think much of the claim of instantly cooling and refreshing as it is applied. Any feeling of coolness lasts about half a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of reviewers commented that the smell of this sunscreen was unpleasant. I didn&#x27;t mind it at all. The smell is slightly medicinal, but I prefer that to other sun lotion scents.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat&#x27;s \\&quot;Sport Coolzone\\&quot; sunscreen sells itself as being (1) cooling on a hot day and (2) water resistant enough to last for 80 minutes of swimming.  Currently, I think it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I can otherwise recommend it without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried it on a hot day at the zoo, and notice a mild cooling effect.  I can&#x27;t say if it was all in our minds, but it was enough to get my seven year old to enjoy putting on sunscreen, and frankly that by itself is worth the price.  It worked well and lasted during a sweaty day at the zoo.  The smell is mild and slightly \\&quot;sporty.\\&quot;  No complaints, and big compliments for getting my daughter to put on sunscreen willingly!</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t too much to say here.  It&#x27;s sunscreen, and it works.  Unlike most sunscreens, however, it includes a component that makes it feel like it&#x27;s cooling your skin after you apply it, which can be refreshing.  That said, fundamentally it&#x27;s sunscreen and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try if you think you need your sunscreen to provide a cooling effect for awhile after application.  Otherwise, there isn&#x27;t much to suggest this over the non-cooling Banana Boat products.</li>
    <li> A sunscreen lotion that \\&quot;instantly cools and refreshes\\&quot; is a novel idea, but I did not notice any difference from any other sunscreen products I have tried in the past.  But it does its job, and does it well.  One major drawback is the smell which has an almost a paste like smell.  And it is a strong, long lasting smell too.  I woke up the next morning after using it and could still smell it on me and was finally gone after jumping in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a very good sunscreen, and overall I have found Banana Boat to be a very good brand. This sunscreen is a little different than the usual, in that I find it has a lighter feel. It goes on with a light an cool feel, and even though I am not a heavy sweater, it manages to stay on when I work out or bike a little bit better than a regular sunscreen. I tend to burn on the back of my neck all the time and this has really protected me. The only thing I dont like is the smell is kind of strong and sharp, slightly like a cologne scent. I find this is true with a lot of active type products. Its nothing that would prevent me from purchasing it again. I a pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the use of sunscreen, and I generally like Banana Boat products. I got this one, and the first thing that gets you is the smell...it reminds me of the trucks that used to spray mosquito repellant in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use this, I really did, but the smell was too much. I handed it off to my husband, who uses it when he&#x27;s mowing the lawn and doing other stinky yard work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He doesn&#x27;t notice it (probably with all the other competing odors!) and his fair skin is well protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a sunscreen, it&#x27;s fine. If you have no olfactory sense at all, you&#x27;ll love it! Otherwise, keep looking.</li>
    <li> I recently reviewed the Banana Boat Protect &amp; Hydrate, and liked it, but I like this one even better. It goes on feeling cool and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes with sweat even if I&#x27;m mowing the lawn. Unlike the other one which is unscented, this lotion has a chemical sunscreen scent, but it&#x27;s not too unpleasant and reminds me of old-time Sea &amp; Ski sunscreen.</li>
    <li> We had been using a spray prior to this, and it just wasn&#x27;t working. This provided superior coverage, stayed on better in the water, and the kids loved the cool feel as we applied it. Also, a little seems to go a long way, so this was more than enough for a 10 day trip to Mexico for a family of four.</li>
    <li> I like this sunscreen, although the \\&quot;coolzone\\&quot; part of it didn&#x27;t seem significant.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a cooling sensation.  But afternoons at the high school pool this summer has had us in the sun much more than usual, and we didn&#x27;t get burnt.  (Actually my scalp did but that&#x27;s not the products fault, but mine!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing was that this stung my eyes a bit, not as much as some products that seem to stream into your eyes, but just a bit when I adjusted my goggles at times.  I think I had residue on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this had good coverage.  One bottle lasted about two weeks of daily use on two people.</li>
    <li> The scent of this can seem a little strong straight out of the bottle, fortunately it fades fast. It&#x27;s a semi-masculine scent and kind of reminds me of lineament mixed with an inexpensive cologne. So it&#x27;s a really good thing it fades fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feelings on these bottle types. They do dispense easily, but sometimes lotion can get in the lid and cake up. The bottles don&#x27;t leak or come open in a bag with normal use which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion applies easily. It doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as the Protect and Hydrate lotion, but it does absorb faster than a lot of other sunblocks my family has used. The cooling effect is like a mild menthol salve and short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer has been a sunny one in Anchorage, AK and while my family was trying out this lotion, nobody got a sunburn. So it does work fairly well. My family will use the last of the bottle, but after that we will probably not use it again because of the scent.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen cools the skin as you rub it in. That sure feels good on a hot summer day! It absorbs into the skin quickly and completely. It is non-greasy. I like that this sunscreen is water resistant (for up to 80 minutes). This makes it a great choice for outdoor sports in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really, really like the fruity fragrance of this sunscreen!</li>
    <li> this sunscreen does absorb fast.  after rubbing it in I did not feel the need to wipe my hands off somewhere.  My fingers while covered in the stuff did not feel greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and far from the traditional coconut smell typically found in sunscreen.  It is water resistant and so far does not appear to irritate my sensitive skin.  --  Will change the review if it does.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product that has the pluses of giving the skin a cooling sensation as well as being water proof for eighty minutes. The downside is it does have a rather strong odor which I do not find unpleasant myself but my husband who insists on odor free products rejected this sunscreen.  It does prevent burns and hopefully other sun damage for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale. In fact, I used to always joke that I can get burned in the moonlight. Although that&#x27;s not exactly the case, I do burn really easily and always apply SPF 35+ when I&#x27;m outside for a prolong period of time. I tested this sunscreen lotion at Six Flags. There&#x27;s something about theme parks that makes me burn more (perhaps it&#x27;s the reflective concrete or the missing tree cover). Even though this product has an SPF of 30, this sport sunblock did really well - in fact, I didn&#x27;t get burned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes smoothly on the skin and moisturizes it (this product is a two-in-one deal), as well as provides a cooling effect in the hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main concern I have about this sunblock is the list of toxic, or near toxic ingredients. Generally, I would prefer to use something more natural since skin absorbs so much onto itself. I have heard the phrase, \\&quot;if you wouldn&#x27;t eat it, don&#x27;t put it on your skin&#x27;, and I think it needs to apply to sunblock as well as moisturizers, and should be applied to this product because it is both.</li>
    <li> This claims to instantly cool and refresh.  Supposedly this is supposed to cool you down when you apply it, which I can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s my mind thinking it should, or it actually working.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to have anything besides aloe and other liquids that would actually make you feel cool (ie no secret icy hot or menthol in it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a non-sunscreen smell that is more cheap cologne than anything, but I actually kind of like it, and I think prefer it to the standard sunscreen smell.  As a sunscreen it holds up well for water proofing and ratings, and is a reputable brand, so can&#x27;t go wrong there.</li>
    <li> Effective and seemingly grease-free. Plus it smells good, unlike every other sunblock.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of sunscreens which left me with white flakey skin which rubbed off on clothes. I tried this one, went on smooth, not sticky or heavy, abosorbed into my skin. No buildup of white flakes or dirt on my skin,. was in the park in the sun for 1 hour, it worked I did not burn at all but I did tan. So if your looking to block out the sun entirely get a higher sunscreen, but I find the higher sunscreens are heavy and flakey. The scent on this smells like lever 200 rain body wash, classic soap smell. I really like it. most sunscreens ive used have the cocoa butter smell which I find disgusting if your not on the beach..</li>
    <li> This sunscreen worked well, I assume.  It has a cooling affect when you put it on your skin - almost like a menthol, but it fades quickly.  I did not have any skin reactions (super sensitive skin too) and I did not end up with sun burn - so I suppose it works just fine.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s hard for a consumer to really test the SPF of a sunscreen, I used it for a whole morning out in the sun at the zoo and didn&#x27;t see any tan lines. So in my experience, it did just what it&#x27;s supposed to do as a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on, I did in fact notice a cooling sensation - and an immediate smell of rubbing alcohol. The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; in Coolzone is apparently just the effect of alcohol evaporating out of the lotion on your skin, but it is fairly pleasant and refreshing. I can&#x27;t really testify whether it would sting on a bad burn, though, and I suspect it would be drying on dry skin. (My skin&#x27;s not dry and I had no issues.) Once the alcoholh quickly evaporated, the scent was mildly \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; and I can&#x27;t say I noticed it at all once the lotion was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fully satisfied with this product as a suncreen. The cooling part is a bit novel and really would feel good if you&#x27;re reapplying after being out in the sun.</li>
    <li> Banana Boat Coolzone sunscreen works. It stayed on and worked after an afternoon of strenuous, sweaty activity. The sunscreen did what it is supposed to do, protect my skin from getting sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slight difference with this sunscreen is the Coolzone. This is a nice white sunscreen that goes on nicely and rubs in without a trace. The cool part comes from denatured alcohol and menthol in the lotion. The alcohol helps the sunscreen to be spread more easily and it evaporates, cooling off the skin. This is a temporary thing and typically not a big thing I look for when applying sunscreen - I usually do that before I get outside and am hot. The menthol is a natural minty type smell that gives the impression of cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottle; it is easy to squeeze with a narrower center for easy handling. It will be impossible to get every last drop out of this container, for that reason I like tubes a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a basic standard sunscreen that works.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is reasonably priced, and it seems to do the job of protecting my skin from sunburn.  However, I think that it feels a bit greasy on my skin.  I do not like the smell of it, but my husband and son didn&#x27;t complain.  It smells a bit like rubbing alcohol. I much prefer the Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate sunscreen over this particular version, as it smells better and absorbs better.</li>
    <li> Thank You!  beach time !!!</li>
