      <li>amazing product !</li>

      <li>I love it because its a matte lipstick..</li>
      <li>Its okay</li>
      <li>I am sure it might be cheaper in the stores</li>
      <li>My favorite type of lipstick &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>their definitely pigmented and beautiful !</li>
      <li>but i didn&#x27;t choose the right color for myself, so it didn&#x27;t look good on me.</li>
      <li>So when I added gloss on top of it to stay smooth, it would \\&quot;cake\\&quot; up on my lips.  </li>
      <li>Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a tad bit lighter pink and is matte but looks great if you put a gloss on top too!</li>
      <li>I love this lipstick its very cute and nude unless ur more darker it looks like pink but still cute .thanks!</li>
      <li>love the color goes on smooth such a good deal and so cheap!  </li>
      <li>you can see fine lines in lips</li>
      <li>It is one of those lipsticks that settle into fine lines and cracks.</li>
      <li>so far their amazing but not for the price.</li>
      <li>True to product and color.</li>
      <li>but overall, i think its a good product to purchase</li>
      <li>one of my favorite lipsticks is definitely at the same quality level as M.A.C it stays throughly, has a beautiful matte finish.</li>
      <li>I heard numerous amazing reviews about this lipstick and it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>wet n wild lipsticks that even if you were to see them in person they look real nice</li>
      <li>Exfoliate your lips beforehand if you&#x27;re going to be wearing this because it&#x27;s very very drying.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a very dry matte finish nothing special.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s dry, so make sure you use a lip balm or primer with it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented</li>
      <li>this is a very flattering color.</li>
      <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>It has more of a pink tone than a peachy one when applied.</li>
      <li>I really like this matte lipstick.</li>
      <li>Its very matte finish.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m older &amp; I don&#x27;t use gloss over it.</li>
      <li>i love the formula on these wet N wild lipsticks.</li>
      <li>However it can be a little drying, but I just put a little lip balm on underneath &amp; I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
      <li>it has enough pop to be noticable but it isn&#x27;t a bold, in your face neon shade.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly, beautiful peach color, doesn&#x27;t last that long but again not all lipsticks last long.</li>
      <li>Looks great in the picture but up close definitely not my favorite Wet &amp; Wild product.</li>
      <li>The color is clear and matt ,but not buttery , i used gloss with it</li>
      <li>but once you try them on it&#x27;s a whole different enchilada.</li>
      <li>Pretty color, but made my lips dry, irritated and caky.</li>
      <li>It is a nice color, but it has a weird smell to it and that&#x27;s just not something I want to walk around smelling all day.</li>
      <li>Just make sure ur give  your lips a little scrub to remove the XS dead skin.</li>

<li> Egh, it&#x27;s very dry like myspace.</li>
<li> It is very dry and matte which i like sometimes.</li>
<li> The product was not what I expected to be.</li>
<li> I picked this up the other day.</li>
<li> A little dry because it&#x27;s so matte but</li>
<li> The absolute only bad thing I have to say about it</li>
<li> You can put a gloss over it and maybe you&#x27;ll get a little shine.</li>
<li> This was very dull and dry.</li>
<li> I hate wet n wild lipsticks they look like little kids claires crappy cakey lipstick</li>
<li> and the matte formula isn&#x27;t drying or too hard to apply either.</li>
<li> but for the price its ridiculous because their $2 at rite aid.</li>
<li> I do find that i need to be wearing a lip palm as a base, and if my lips need exfoliation, it makes it obvious.</li>
<li> I was not happy with this lipstick.  </li>
<li> The color looks horrible by itself must apply chapstick before and after application to make it look some what decent.  </li>
<li> Plus the packaging is really cheap and horrible, the lipstick has already broken away from the base and I&#x27;ve used it one time</li>
<li> Terrible, The stick came off the instant</li>
<li> The lipstick is dry, feels awful on my lips and does not stay on as advertised.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s what I hate about  </li>
<li> horrible, like crayon.</li>

    <li> It isn&#x27;t the color I was looking for so I mixed it with another pinkish/nude lip gloss and I love the combination together. The lipstick product itself is about a 3/5 I would say. Apply a chap stick before you apply this product, it isn&#x27;t moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My favorite type of lipstick &amp;#60;3 BUT it makes my lips chapped a lot i have to wear chapstick before and after I put it on. but lovw the color and texture an how it looks on me :*</li>
    <li> amazing product ! one of my favorite lipsticks is definitely at the same quality level as M.A.C it stays throughly, has a beautiful matte finish.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this color.!</li>
    <li> Egh, it&#x27;s very dry like myspace. That&#x27;s what I hate about  wet n wild lipsticks that even if you were to see them in person they look real nice but once you try them on it&#x27;s a whole different enchilada.</li>
    <li> LOVE this color! I do find that i need to be wearing a lip palm as a base, and if my lips need exfoliation, it makes it obvious. Just make sure ur give  your lips a little scrub to remove the XS dead skin. GORG colour</li>
    <li> horrible, like crayon. Threw it away</li>
    <li> I hate wet n wild lipsticks they look like little kids claires crappy cakey lipstick</li>
    <li> This cost $2.29 at Wallgreens. It is very dry and matte which i like sometimes. It does not last 4 hours,it fades,bleeds and smudges. It it creamy after you layer it on to get good color pay off and it doesn&#x27;t feather,no chemical smells or taste either. The color isn&#x27;t that peachy on my medium skin tone. It looks more coral nude peach on my skin. It&#x27;s okay for the money. I will say because it&#x27;s so matte you can see fine lines in lips and i don&#x27;t like that.</li>
    <li> Good Price, Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> i love the formula on these wet N wild lipsticks. their definitely pigmented and beautiful ! but for the price its ridiculous because their $2 at rite aid. my mistake for buying it online! so far their amazing but not for the price.</li>
    <li> Looks great in the picture but up close definitely not my favorite Wet &amp; Wild product. It&#x27;s more of a very dry matte finish nothing special. You can put a gloss over it and maybe you&#x27;ll get a little shine. Bottom line will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> The lipstick is dry, feels awful on my lips and does not stay on as advertised. I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick its very cute and nude unless ur more darker it looks like pink but still cute .thanks!</li>
    <li> I picked this up the other day. It is one of those lipsticks that settle into fine lines and cracks. It&#x27;s dry, so make sure you use a lip balm or primer with it. great color, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was going to be for me.  I will not do that again because it do not a thing for my lips.</li>
    <li> It has more of a pink tone than a peachy one when applied. The color looks horrible by itself must apply chapstick before and after application to make it look some what decent.  The product was not what I expected to be.</li>
    <li> Terrible, The stick came off the instant I opened it. It went into the bin finally.</li>
    <li> The color is clear and matt ,but not buttery , i used gloss with it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good lipstick for the amount you pay, but the texture was like clay and it turned out the color didn&#x27;t go well with my skin.</li>

    <li> love the color goes on smooth such a good deal and so cheap!  I am sure it might be cheaper in the stores but i was not about to go searching for it i saw it on pinterest and had to have it!</li>
    <li> Love this corally lipstick.  Great for summer.  True to product and color. I would order again from this company. Love Wearing it.</li>
    <li> this is a very flattering color. it has enough pop to be noticable but it isn&#x27;t a bold, in your face neon shade. it cute for in the office and for daytime activites. and the matte formula isn&#x27;t drying or too hard to apply either.</li>
    <li> I really like this matte lipstick. I&#x27;m older &amp; I don&#x27;t use gloss over it. It moisturizes my lips &amp; looks good.</li>
    <li> Exfoliate your lips beforehand if you&#x27;re going to be wearing this because it&#x27;s very very drying. I heard numerous amazing reviews about this lipstick and it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Plus the packaging is really cheap and horrible, the lipstick has already broken away from the base and I&#x27;ve used it one time and then it&#x27;s been in my vanity for the rest of the time...</li>
    <li> Another makeup artist on youtube used this and I really liked the way it looked on her.  I combine mine with a swipe of Chanel Twinkle lip gloss.  It is a very nice, nude lip.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly, beautiful peach color, doesn&#x27;t last that long but again not all lipsticks last long. It&#x27;s a beautiful shade though.</li>
    <li> this product is a great quality but i didn&#x27;t choose the right color for myself, so it didn&#x27;t look good on me. but overall, i think its a good product to purchase</li>
    <li> It is a nice color, but it has a weird smell to it and that&#x27;s just not something I want to walk around smelling all day.</li>
    <li> This is great lipstick! It&#x27;s very pigmented so it really doesn&#x27;t take much. I love it because its a matte lipstick.. However it can be a little drying, but I just put a little lip balm on underneath &amp; I&#x27;m good to go! I don&#x27;t have to reapply it at all.</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this lipstick! It&#x27;s the perfect almost nude color. It&#x27;s just a tad bit lighter pink and is matte but looks great if you put a gloss on top too! The absolute only bad thing I have to say about it is I don&#x27;t have more of it!! :)</li>
    <li> Its okay....you will have to end up retouching your makeup later during the day</li>
    <li> my favorite lipstick, wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with this lipstick.  Its very matte finish.  So when I added gloss on top of it to stay smooth, it would \\&quot;cake\\&quot; up on my lips.  Pretty color, but made my lips dry, irritated and caky.</li>
