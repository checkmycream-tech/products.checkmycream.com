      <li>I love that the ingredients are all natural and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin--</li>
      <li>Love Dr. Bronners soap, this one is great for my face it is less strong than some of the other scents.</li>
      <li>It does a good job of breaking down the grease and cleaning up.    </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not just because I used hot water either.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love this soap.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought the tea tree oil version as a face wash as part of an all natural skincare routine.</li>
      <li>I myself use this pretty much just for makeup removal and just as a face wash.</li>
      <li>I will say that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger long after washing and with a light moisturizer after my skin is glowing and wedding ready!!</li>
      <li>You can use them for so much.</li>
      <li>Very medicinal.</li>
      <li>This makes one feel better about using it rather than some other , but as far as cleaning I saw no difference.</li>
      <li>I had hoped this would have cleaned my skin a little better.</li>
      <li>My skin feels drier when I use it and, sadly, reacts to this by becoming even more oily.  </li>
      <li>If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents.</li>
      <li>It might work better if I diluted it even more, but so far it&#x27;s been disappointing as a face wash.    </li>
      <li>the smell is a little strong.  </li>
      <li>cause my skin to break out, products that are too &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; do not keep my pores clear.  </li>
      <li>Seems to have helped clear up his scalp and moisturize it when used in conjunction with jojoba or tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face is almost clear now and it always looking glowy.</li>
      <li>However, if you intend to use it for acne, at least in my case, you&#x27;d be better off trying something else.</li>
      <li>they will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Almost makes me wanna gag in the early morning shower.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough for my face, it&#x27;s just not enough for me to give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend the almond oil or peppermint before this as general use products.  </li>
      <li>in other uses, i really like it.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d use it for daily use because it seems to be a little more harsh than the almond oil and</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out &amp; it helps keep my hair soft &amp; shiny.  </li>

<li> This purchase has lasted a long time.</li>
<li> Lathers up well but will leave your skin kinda dry</li>

<li> I have to use a toner after washing, and the amount of dirt that comes off my face, neck, chest and back is surprising and disgusting.</li>
<li> My acne scars and pimples have cleared up immensely because, of this product I use this with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Black Soap and it has worked wonders for my dark spots.</li>
<li> I now wash my face with this twice daily and moisturize and have very few breakouts.</li>
<li> I have horrible acne on my face and extremely oily skin, and tea tree oil is supposed to be good for acne.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars because the smell is a little odd to me.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using for about six months now as a soap/shampoo, and it works extremely well, with very little needed.  </li>
<li> One of the relatively few products I do recommend.  </li>
<li> Products that are too harsh</li>
<li> No more dandruff, either.  </li>
<li> I recently came across some websites that said regular shampoo with sulfates is horrible for hair like mine, because it strips it of any possible moisture.  </li>
<li> I recommend people try the small bottle...</li>
<li> No more ingrown hairs or breakouts!</li>
<li> But as a face wash, I found that it did not completely wash my skin of oil and dirt, so it was slightly disappointing.</li>
<li> the smell is a little unpleasant.</li>
<li> it smells really bad.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the almond oil soap, but figured I&#x27;d try the tea tree oil soap to see what it was like.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d use it for daily use because it seems to be a little more harsh than the almond oil and the smell is a little strong.  My skin feels drier when I use it and, sadly, reacts to this by becoming even more oily.  It might work better if I diluted it even more, but so far it&#x27;s been disappointing as a face wash.    That said, it does work well when I&#x27;ve been working on the car and have grease and oil everywhere.  It does a good job of breaking down the grease and cleaning up.    I&#x27;d recommend the almond oil or peppermint before this as general use products.  This may be more limited in what it cleans best.</li>
    <li> i have tried using this product when hand washing dishes and i don&#x27;t know if i am sold when it comes to greasy dishes.  there still seems to be a film left on them.  in other uses, i really like it.  the smell is a little unpleasant.</li>
    <li> This purchase has lasted a long time. It has a nice scent but I still cannot find a Dr. Bronner product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy and tangled. It works for everything else though!</li>
    <li> I never smelled this before I bought it but I have used this soap before in another scent. The bottle is sturdy and held up just fine during shipping (which was fast). I&#x27;m leaving 4 stars because the smell is a little odd to me. I got the tea tree oil one. It just smells herbally and kind of strong. I do use this product daily and I do love it. This stuff is great for tough dirt after working hard (picture a welder with caked on oil, dirt and other junk. This stuff does work well for my soon to be husband.) I myself use this pretty much just for makeup removal and just as a face wash. It&#x27;s basic, non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It cleans my skin well, including black heads. I&#x27;ve also noticed when I go to squeeze out some black heads the come out a lot easier after I wash with this stuff and it&#x27;s not just because I used hot water either. I will say that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger long after washing and with a light moisturizer after my skin is glowing and wedding ready!! (Another reason why I grabbed this stuff for my face. I don&#x27;t want to have break outs or redness during the big day which is next month!)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry, course, kinky hair.  I recently came across some websites that said regular shampoo with sulfates is horrible for hair like mine, because it strips it of any possible moisture.  I struggled finding a shampoo that truly did not have any sulfates until I found this one.  It works beautifully!  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out &amp; it helps keep my hair soft &amp; shiny.  My scalp has never been healthier.  No more dandruff, either.  Thank you so much Dr. Bonner!!!</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Bronners soap, this one is great for my face it is less strong than some of the other scents.</li>
    <li> We use this soap in the wipe solution we use for cloth wipes. The natural antiseptic is perfect for cleaning our daughters bottom but yet super gentle on the skin!</li>
    <li> One of the relatively few products I do recommend.  I&#x27;ve been using for about six months now as a soap/shampoo, and it works extremely well, with very little needed.  I recommend people try the small bottle... they will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I use this as a foot scrub. I work 12 hour shifts So the tea tree is a must have. Love this stuff! Works amazing.</li>
    <li> Good for acne. Smells like an antique store, but whatevs.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, it cleans well. I also use it as a replacement for shaving cream. No more ingrown hairs or breakouts!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Dr Bronner&#x27;s tea tree soap to make homemade  cleaner.  It arrived in a timely fashion and for the quality, well, it&#x27;s Dr Bronner&#x27;s.  Always a good product.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and have to be very careful what I use on my skin.  Products that are too harsh cause my skin to break out, products that are too &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; do not keep my pores clear.  Enter Dr Bronner&#x27;s Organic Tea Tree soap.  I now wash my face with this twice daily and moisturize and have very few breakouts.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the tea tree oil version as a face wash as part of an all natural skincare routine. I have horrible acne on my face and extremely oily skin, and tea tree oil is supposed to be good for acne. The scent is strong, so if you&#x27;re not a tree tea oil fan, pass it by. But as a face wash, I found that it did not completely wash my skin of oil and dirt, so it was slightly disappointing. I have to use a toner after washing, and the amount of dirt that comes off my face, neck, chest and back is surprising and disgusting. I had hoped this would have cleaned my skin a little better. I love that the ingredients are all natural and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin-- it&#x27;s gentle enough for my face, it&#x27;s just not enough for me to give it 5 stars. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a different soap. On the plus side, a few drops goes a long way, and the 8 ounce bottle will last me a long time. I also bought the 8 ounce almond version for my daughter who has severe eczema. The almond version smells delicious. It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin at all which is fantastic, because most soaps cause her eczema to flare up. Overall, the Dr Bronners soaps are great for a gentle every day use as a face wash. However, if you intend to use it for acne, at least in my case, you&#x27;d be better off trying something else.</li>
    <li> Overall, I love this soap.  It does have a somewhat &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; smell, but I might add some mint to soften it.  If you are used to highly perfumed body wash, or if you aren&#x27;t familiar with the smell of tea tree, you might prefer to try one of the other DB scents.</li>
    <li> My acne scars and pimples have cleared up immensely because, of this product I use this with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Black Soap and it has worked wonders for my dark spots. My face is almost clear now and it always looking glowy.</li>
    <li> Lathers up well but will leave your skin kinda dry it smells earthy and leaves you feeling clean a refreshed</li>
    <li> this stuff leaves a residue. not for me.</li>
    <li> This makes one feel better about using it rather than some other , but as far as cleaning I saw no difference.</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use in those foaming-hand-soap dispensers. It lasts forever since you dilute it, half soap half water.</li>
    <li> I really love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps! You can use them for so much. We got this to use as a shampoo for my boyfriend&#x27;s very dry scalp. Seems to have helped clear up his scalp and moisturize it when used in conjunction with jojoba or tea tree oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because to me....it smells really bad. Very medicinal. Almost makes me wanna gag in the early morning shower. We prefer using the citrus, lavender, or peppermint for non hair/acne/dry skin related stuff.</li>
