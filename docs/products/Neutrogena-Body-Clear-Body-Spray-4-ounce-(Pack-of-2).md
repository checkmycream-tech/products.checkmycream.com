      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>When I first started using this product, i started to see results and it was great.</li>
      <li>The spray smells great, absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t sticky</li>
      <li>The product did okay in the beginning though, maybe I should wait a while before using it again.</li>
      <li>Smells better than the AcneFree version.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a difference right away and was so incredibly pleased!</li>
      <li>It really works love it !</li>
      <li>Plus leaves no sticky or strong smelling residues, totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Great product for chest and back acne.</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>I also like the fact that even though its being used, the contents are not finishing quickly.</li>
      <li>shower right after, and then spray my body again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find something that I can use consistently to address my back-ne.</li>
      <li>I still break out occasionally, but it&#x27;s under much better control because of this product.</li>
      <li>The first thing I tested was the directions it can spray at.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s one positive I can give.</li>
      <li>Be sure to let it dry before you get dressed.</li>
      <li>so one bottle has lasted about 2 months, but its so worth it to have clear skin again!</li>
      <li>This has really been the ticket for me.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
      <li>It is not so strong to where you cant use it everyday but it is strong enough.</li>
      <li>Not the sender&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s Neutrogena&#x27;s plastic top was not sealed tight enough..</li>
      <li>After just 3 days you will notice it clear up.</li>
      <li>I did see the results at first, but not for long.</li>
      <li>I have a few break outs every now and then while using this product, but it is mostly under control if applied regularly.</li>
      <li>When you spray the product it does dry fast and you can spray from all angles like it says.</li>
      <li>This keeps my chest and back clear.</li>
      <li>I usually apply right after shower.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> It really works love it !</li>
    <li> Great product for chest and back acne.</li>
    <li> The spray is ok at best. Didn&#x27;t see the results that I was looking for. The body scrub is a lot better!</li>
    <li> Every household with a teenager should have this.  Great product.</li>
    <li> edited after one month: After continuous use it didn&#x27;t keep my acne under control like I had wanted. I did see the results at first, but not for long. The spray smells great, absorbs fast and isn&#x27;t sticky that&#x27;s one positive I can give.</li>
    <li> When I first started using this product, i started to see results and it was great. However, after about a month or two, small bumps didn&#x27;t seem to leave and sometimes new breakouts occurred.  I don&#x27;t think the product caused them, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of them. The product did okay in the beginning though, maybe I should wait a while before using it again.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started working out a lot last year, my torso has broken out A TON due to sweating so much. I&#x27;d usually have a new zit after each workout! Horrible!! This product is absolutely amazing!!! I noticed a difference right away and was so incredibly pleased! I just spray before each workout, shower right after, and then spray my body again. I workout 5 days/week so one bottle has lasted about 2 months, but its so worth it to have clear skin again! A+++ product!!</li>
    <li> I exercise a lot and get all sweaty... I needed something to prevent the breakouts on my back. This does just that. After just 3 days you will notice it clear up. The bottle says that it can spray at all angles but it doesn&#x27;t, hence the 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I have bad, painful acne on my back and face. This did nothing and may as well have been water.</li>
    <li> this spray it&#x27;s amazing! It dries in less than a minute, prevents/helps fight pimples on the back &amp; shoulders. Plus leaves no sticky or strong smelling residues, totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I use the Neutrogena body spray after I work out from the gym and it helps my acne. it works faster than I thought but my acne is not that bad. When you spray the product it does dry fast and you can spray from all angles like it says. it does not have a bad smell and works within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product to someone.</li>
    <li> This keeps my chest and back clear.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my husband&#x27;s summer back breakouts and my pre teen sons breakouts. Great product at a great price!</li>
    <li> This is great to use either in the morning or just before bed.  I usually apply right after shower.  Smells great and works great.  It is not so strong to where you cant use it everyday but it is strong enough. Wish they made bigger sized bottles.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!  Smells better than the AcneFree version.  I can&#x27;t find this in all stores, usually only at Target and here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find something that I can use consistently to address my back-ne. This has really been the ticket for me. I get out of the shower, towel off, and then spray all over my back. Be sure to let it dry before you get dressed. I still break out occasionally, but it&#x27;s under much better control because of this product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this. The first thing I tested was the directions it can spray at. And it does spray upside down also. I also like the fact that even though its being used, the contents are not finishing quickly. Does it work? Yes! I have bad backne. I have used it consistantly for a week now, and all the roughness has smoothed out. So far so good</li>
    <li> DOes it&#x27;s duty as described on the label. I have a few break outs every now and then while using this product, but it is mostly under control if applied regularly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Especially since you can spray it ..while holding it upside down!!&lt;br /&gt;But one of the bottles was leaking...only a bit, but it was still a bit disappointing. Not the sender&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s Neutrogena&#x27;s plastic top was not sealed tight enough..</li>
