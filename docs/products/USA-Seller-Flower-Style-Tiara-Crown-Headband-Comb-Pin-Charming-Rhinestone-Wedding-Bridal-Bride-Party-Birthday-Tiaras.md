    <li> Beautiful.  Would recommend for Children ( ages 7 to adult ) due to band size.</li>
    <li> this is nice. good size for adult head. heavier than expected so not flimsy. shipped fast.</li>
    <li> This tiara is heavy duty.We purchased it for my daughter&#x27;s Halloween costume.She&#x27;s rough on her accessories( 4 yrs)and this one will stand up to the abuse of a preschooler. it&#x27;s meant for an adult so it&#x27;s kind of big,soI bent the band a little to make it work, the combs that hold it in place are solid. It&#x27;s more of a costume piece but is well made and doesn&#x27;t bend easily.Ive tried it on and it&#x27;s comfortable. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. Perfect for what we were looking for. I think this one will last awhile. I hope it doesn&#x27;t start losing the gems, like these things usually do. If it does I&#x27;ll update this review.:) had this for about a month now, and she&#x27;s used it several times. Overall a great purchase. It came quickly and had simple but adequate packaging. Would buy from this manufacturer again.</li>
    <li> This tiara is beautiful, but every time my daughter puts it in her hair is gets horribly stuck. We almost had to cut her hair once.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t leave me any tracking information, but that was okay. The product itself was a lot more durable than I was expecting for the price listed. Perfect for the use I decided!</li>
    <li> just what I expected.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect crown for a bachelorette party that I am throwing. It arrived safely and securely packed in a protective box. It&#x27;s a great size and very well made.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality for the money.</li>
    <li> There was a diamond lose. I had to super glue it back in place</li>
    <li> Wore this on my birthday, fit well and lookes stunning!</li>
    <li> A little big but that gives her a chance to grow into it. My Granddaughter just loves it. It will give her many years of dress up to  come</li>
