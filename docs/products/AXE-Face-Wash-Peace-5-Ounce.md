### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It does a real good job of cleaning your face with out extracting all the oils</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; brand makes perfect sense in this case.</li>

      <li>Despite my chromosomes, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be very impressed by a face wash.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>The Peace scent smells great.</li>
      <li>face wash is great for two reasons.</li>
      <li>This works great</li>
      <li>Another great scent by Axe.</li>
      <li>However, the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering and is rather pleasant,</li>
      <li>This face wash has done a good job in washing my face and that of my grandsons.</li>
      <li>face wash is actually good.</li>
      <li>so I could get a good idea of how it performed and write this review.</li>
      <li>It smells great which helps you make sure to use it in the shower.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best scent, and it&#x27;s pretty overpowering.</li>
      <li>It is merely pleasant and refreshing smelling.</li>
      <li>but I think it smells nice</li>
      <li>This gel has a nice texture and when combined with water on my face, produced a nice cleansing foam.</li>
      <li>I liked this product and its ease of use but will probably stick to using the face scrubs instead of just the face wash.  </li>
      <li>This provided a nice amount of glide and he likes the scent because it&#x27;s not over powering.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It lathers nicely.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; face wash when I selected it, and was certainly startled by the neon color, but found that washing my face with it was a very pleasant experience.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s okay because my husband doesn&#x27;t need a scrub so a gentle cleanser is perfect.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff, probably the best facial wash I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>I have reviewed many face washes, but out of them all, this one has my favorite scent!</li>
      <li>Axe Face Wash contains safe and effective ingredients (cleansing, ph, thickening agents, moisturizer, and preservatives).  </li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when the scent was revealed as a nicely dialed-down version of the original!</li>
      <li>It was pleasant to use and did a very good job of cleansing my skin after a long day.</li>
      <li>The product was easy to use, wasn&#x27;t gooey, and made a nice cleansing palate.  </li>
      <li>I love the fragrance but hubby likes the way it makes his face feel after washing and before his shave.  </li>
      <li>I doubt that will concern most men though.</li>
      <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and so do the ladies :-)</li>
      <li>More like Peace, bro.</li>
      <li>so I know it must be okay for him to say that.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many others.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter, I love the stuff</li>
      <li>Now to pass it on to the man in my life so he can enjoy it!  :)</li>
      <li>It was meant for men, for sure.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is probably my favorite of</li>
      <li>I think it is ok.  </li>
      <li>I also found that I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to feel nice and clean.</li>
      <li>This product does do a pretty good job of cleaning your face though.  </li>
      <li>He and more importantly his girlfriend like the scent of this.  </li>
      <li>The Axe face wash smells good and cleanses very well.</li>
      <li>Use with other Axe products and smell great!</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily.  </li>
      <li>gel (like most gels) cleans well and rinses clean without that feeling of residue and tightness</li>
      <li>This has a really strong scent of citrus to it.</li>
      <li>The Axe Peace Face Wash has a strong smell that is somewhere between the deodorant and cologne range.</li>
      <li>The product does sud up nicely, which requires slightly more rinsing than you would normally expect.  </li>
      <li>But it does it&#x27;s job and cleans fine.</li>
      <li>and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>amazing thing about this product is that it does a better job on a rash that I developed on my face that a dermatologist had prescribed a medicated face wash for...</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the Axe Peace Bodywash.</li>
      <li>Axe line is marketed to men, but women who prefer vetiver or sandalwood over floral scents will also enjoy this face wash.  </li>
      <li>As a woman I enjoy the scent</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer, a found the face wash to be great for pre-shaving, especially when I shave my head.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job of cleaning my face and smelling masculine.</li>
      <li>All in all, this is a decent, no scrub cleanser for men that has a nice fragrance, but is a tad drying.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this Axe product is well worth the money!</li>
      <li>While I enjoy many of those types of face washes, I can say that it wasn&#x27;t really missed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any tightness after using it, but I also followed it fairly quickly with a light</li>
      <li>It really does feel much cleaner and more refreshing to me than when I was just using water.  </li>
      <li>grandson said that he liked the gel and it appeals to his masculine side (the packaging and scent targets men).  </li>
      <li>I was surprised at how effective and unassuming the product was considering the Axe</li>
      <li>My face felt clean and fresh</li>
      <li>particular 5oz container looks respectable for men of all ages on the front.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I did not have a tremendous amount of hope for this face-wash.</li>
      <li>The lather is nice, loose, and rinses easily.  </li>
      <li>It feels &#x27;clean&#x27; and like has a pleasant, slightly citrus-y scent.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant but not overpowering like some of Ax&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The male tried this face wash and really liked it.</li>
      <li>but I did not find it particularly exciting</li>
      <li>It rinses quite easily and has a clean, masculine scent.  </li>
      <li>It cleans well and makes my skin feel fresh.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, basic face wash from Axe.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance is nice and light not overpowering like some other products.  </li>
      <li>It is refreshing, clean, and very relaxing, while having bright and subtle floral and musky notes.</li>
      <li>Also the scent is just right on this as it is not too overpowering.  </li>
      <li>alternative if the price is right ($1 an ounce is competitive).</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a very clean fragrance of slightly sweet cedar or sandalwood with a bit of generic citrus and just a hint of spice that fades</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the first things that I do, just to get that day&#x27;s worth of oils washed off.  </li>
      <li>The Axe Peace wash lathers up very nicely, even with a small dab of soap.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that when I requested it or first used</li>
      <li>It is a fresh, outdoorsy, woodsy scent that I really like.  </li>
      <li>I really like this stuff!  </li>
      <li>They recently finished using up the tube, and I asked both of them if they wanted me to purchase more.  </li>
      <li>After all, they&#x27;re pretty much just soap, right?  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling smooth, not tight.</li>
      <li>This face wash takes the clean to a whole new level.  </li>
      <li>It definitely has a scent that is more male oriented than female, but it&#x27;s nice and fresh smelling and Axe has a whole line of products with the Peace fragrance that go well together.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a yellow liquid soap that comes out easily.</li>
      <li>I personally don&#x27;t like the strong scent of the product.  </li>
      <li>Hubby said he would use this again if I got for him and he&#x27;s really picky</li>
      <li>This review won&#x27;t do that justice - I really like it.  </li>
      <li>It lathering really well</li>
      <li>The only goofy thing with this is that according to the instructions, between steps #2 and #3, a male and a female (with a pony tail) must bump foreheads :)</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the fragrance but hubby likes the way it makes his face feel after washing and before his shave.  You don&#x27;t need a ton of it either to do the job so a bit goes a ways.  The fragrance is nice and light not overpowering like some other products.  Hubby said he would use this again if I got for him and he&#x27;s really picky so I know it must be okay for him to say that.</li>
    <li> This is pretty big tube, a bit over 5 ounces.  It&#x27;s a yellow liquid soap that comes out easily. It would be a bit easier to control if it were a tad thicker. It&#x27;s not very thick, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  It smells definitely masculine, as it is supposed to.It&#x27;s rather woodsy, with citrus overtones that I can&#x27;t quite place.  I think it is ok.  As a woman I enjoy the scent but I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to use this product too often myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans well.  It leaves skin feeling smooth, not tight. It seems to tighten pores just a bit too, as if it is a bit astringent.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing abrasive about it- there&#x27;s no little plastic spheres to get in our lakes and oceans, it is just soapy.  The lather is nice, loose, and rinses easily.  I didn&#x27;t find it at all irritating, and neither have my 2 guys.  They both say it is fine, but being men, that&#x27;s all they can really manage to say about it, which is why I tried it nightly for a few days myself.  It does remove makeup well, and didn&#x27;t sting my eyes, though I used it around them.  I doubt that will concern most men though.</li>
    <li> I used this myself to see how it worked, and found it comparable with the face washes I&#x27;ve used in the past. Not much for suds, a nice clean skin feeling without my skin feeling dried out. Then I gave it to my husband to try- he likes it a lot. He does wet shaves in the shower using a mirror and a boar bristle brush. This provided a nice amount of glide and he likes the scent because it&#x27;s not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice,he likes it. Unlike some of the Axe scents, this one is masculine without anything to prove.</li>
    <li> The feedback from my 30-something-adult son is that this cleans well without irritating his skin. He and more importantly his girlfriend like the scent of this.  As a 50-ish woman I&#x27;m not all that sold on the scent but he likes it which I guess is the demographic Axe is marketed at.</li>
    <li> Another great scent by Axe. This works great, it didn’t leave skin dry, no issues with sensitivity. Go Axe yourself!</li>
    <li> This has a really strong scent of citrus to it. It&#x27;s not the best scent, and it&#x27;s pretty overpowering. But it does it&#x27;s job and cleans fine. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s any better than other face washes out there.</li>
    <li> Considering that this is an Axe product, and they&#x27;re not known for their subtlety, this isn&#x27;t a bad-smelling face wash. It&#x27;s a little bit spicy with a hint of pine. As far as consistency, it is a bit oily, which is a bit hard to reconcile when it&#x27;s supposed to be cleaning my face. It takes quite a bit for it to create a lather. It seems to work just as well as any other face wash that I&#x27;ve ever used. I did break out when I initially used this product and had some concern about that, but it seemed to be just a reaction to switching products, as it only happened once and cleared up relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> I received this Axe Face Wash through the Amazon Vine review program.  My husband and adult son used the product, and gave me their opinions on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men work outside, and their faces get quite dirty with both dirt and sometimes grease.  They both commented that the face wash worked well in conjunction with a wash cloth for cleansing the face.  My son commented that the product is quite thin, and it&#x27;s easy to dispense too much of it because of that.  I personally don&#x27;t like the strong scent of the product.  They recently finished using up the tube, and I asked both of them if they wanted me to purchase more.  Both declined, and commented that they prefer to use bath bar soap on their faces.</li>
    <li> Yes...this is for men and I&#x27;m a woman who used it.  I wanted to do so in order to do my review.  It was meant for men, for sure.  You can tell that by the scent.  However, the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering and is rather pleasant, something I&#x27;d like my husband to use on a regular basis.  The product was easy to use, wasn&#x27;t gooey, and made a nice cleansing palate.  My face felt clean and fresh afterward (too bad it&#x27;s for men!).  Now to pass it on to the man in my life so he can enjoy it!  :)</li>
    <li> I am used to Axe face Scrub, which provides exfoliation.  Compared, the Axe face Wash is very thin (runny).  Though I ultimately like the product, I would prefer a slightly thicker viscosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike my Axe Face Scrub, this product is simply a wash.  I personally found it better than soap as I prefer the smell and overall ease of use. Unlike many other Axe scents, the smell of the face wash is not overbearing.  The product does sud up nicely, which requires slightly more rinsing than you would normally expect.  Also, a little product is all you need (about pea size). Like another reviewer, a found the face wash to be great for pre-shaving, especially when I shave my head.  I seem to ge a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product a lot.  Just remember, this is not an exfoliator.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, probably the best facial wash I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried many others. It does a real good job of cleaning your face with out extracting all the oils so it does not try your face like soap does. If you have acne this will help. I&#x27;ve read other comments about the smell being too strong but I think it smells nice and so do the ladies :-) I&#x27;m on my third bottle and I&#x27;ll keep buying as long Axe doesn&#x27;t change it.One thing to be aware of is that it&#x27;s thin so it&#x27;s easy to over use, just be aware of that and just use a small amount and you will be fine.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; brand makes perfect sense in this case. This face wash has no scrubbing particles that some of the other ones have. While I enjoy many of those types of face washes, I can say that it wasn&#x27;t really missed here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash is great for two reasons. It smells great which helps you make sure to use it in the shower. I also found that I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to feel nice and clean. The five ounces will certainly last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably my favorite of the Axe face washes that I&#x27;ve tried over the years. I&#x27;ve been favoring gentler face washed lately and this is a top notch product.</li>
    <li> This face wash is for guys??  Uh-oh.  I didn&#x27;t realize that when I requested it or first used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely of the female gender.  Doesn&#x27;t matter, I love the stuff anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that seems to make this a male-oriented product is the scent.  It is a fresh, outdoorsy, woodsy scent that I really like.  So for a few minutes, I smell more like a forest than an orchid.  Big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers nicely.  It cleans well and makes my skin feel fresh.  It rinses off easily.  And, at current prices, it is less expensive than many of the products marketed for women.  Despite my chromosomes, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the concept of Peace is supposed to smell, but this is definitely not it. The Axe Peace Face Wash has a strong smell that is somewhere between the deodorant and cologne range. However, as far as I can tell, the smell does not stick with you. The smell may be helpful in booting up your senses in the morning. The smell did not bother me but I did not find it particularly exciting either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash is actually good. It is a yellow-tinted see-through gel with tiny bubbles. A small amount is good enough to get the job done. I have no complaints about its effectiveness. I was surprised at how effective and unassuming the product was considering the Axe marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular 5oz container looks respectable for men of all ages on the front. The back side has instructions on how to use it (standard instructions for face washes). The only goofy thing with this is that according to the instructions, between steps #2 and #3, a male and a female (with a pony tail) must bump foreheads :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it accidentally gets into your eyes, there is a 2-3 second noticeable ouch-sting. The ouch then goes away.</li>
    <li> This Axe Face Wash isn&#x27;t a bad product but it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me like I was expecting. It lathering really well and you only need small drop for your face, but afterward, I felt my skin was dried out. I had to use moisturizer to take away the dryness causes by this product, which doesn&#x27;t happen with other face washes I use. I don&#x27;t think I will seek out or use this face wash again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit it...I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be very impressed by a face wash.  After all, they&#x27;re pretty much just soap, right?  The ingredients look a lot like body wash or shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to say - I really like this stuff!  For years now, I&#x27;ve rinsed my face off with water every night after getting home from work.  It&#x27;s one of the first things that I do, just to get that day&#x27;s worth of oils washed off.  This face wash takes the clean to a whole new level.  It really does feel much cleaner and more refreshing to me than when I was just using water.  This review won&#x27;t do that justice - I really like it.  The scent is also pretty subtle, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like you just bathed in cologne.  I like the scent, but I also like that it&#x27;s not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it does sting my eyes unless I get every bit washed away before I open them.  I&#x27;m contemplating getting some baby shampoo and seeing how well that works.  Seriously.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stinging eyes aside, I highly recommend giving this stuff a try.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the Axe Peace Bodywash. The scent was crazy weird and overwhelming. Therefore, I did not have a tremendous amount of hope for this face-wash. Imagine my surprise when the scent was revealed as a nicely dialed-down version of the original! It is merely pleasant and refreshing smelling. Likewise, I really like how thoroughly this cleanses one&#x27;s face. I didn&#x27;t experience any tightness after using it, but I also followed it fairly quickly with a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the tube is somewhat small, it will last a LONG time. And, my very sensitive skin had no negative reaction to this product at all (which is rare and awesome).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this Axe product is well worth the money!</li>
    <li> This face wash has done a good job in washing my face and that of my grandsons. When they have spent the night at my house, they love to try out any new products I have and this has met their resounding approval.&lt;br /&gt;The amazing thing about this product is that it does a better job on a rash that I developed on my face that a dermatologist had prescribed a medicated face wash for...so seems like it works.</li>
    <li> Axe Face Wash contains safe and effective ingredients (cleansing, ph, thickening agents, moisturizer, and preservatives).  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering like some of Ax&#x27;s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandson said that he liked the gel and it appeals to his masculine side (the packaging and scent targets men).  Some of the other products I have given him appear either too feminine or too medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel (like most gels) cleans well and rinses clean without that feeling of residue and tightness that soaps leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good alternative if the price is right ($1 an ounce is competitive).</li>
    <li> Although this is a product designed for men, I had to try it before I passed it on to my husband so I could get a good idea of how it performed and write this review. It definitely has a scent that is more male oriented than female, but it&#x27;s nice and fresh smelling and Axe has a whole line of products with the Peace fragrance that go well together. This gel has a nice texture and when combined with water on my face, produced a nice cleansing foam. It was pleasant to use and did a very good job of cleansing my skin after a long day. My skin felt clean, but not dry afterward. My husband says he likes it and I can see why.</li>
    <li> I have reviewed many face washes, but out of them all, this one has my favorite scent! It is refreshing, clean, and very relaxing, while having bright and subtle floral and musky notes. It is gender neutral in smell, though as a woman, I prefer men&#x27;s soaps and face washes. My skin is sensitive, and this soap leaves it just a touch dry for my taste, but it&#x27;s still worth it for the smell. Great product! I wish it came in a perfume or body spray!</li>
    <li> My wife has been buying face wash for the shower from Trader Joes.  I guess I&#x27;m used to watery, non-foaming hippie wash and anything is an improvement.  The Axe Peace wash lathers up very nicely, even with a small dab of soap.  It feels &#x27;clean&#x27; and like has a pleasant, slightly citrus-y scent.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the theme.  Every time I pick up the bottle and see a giant peace symbol I cringe.  Weird marketing, but I like the overall product quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This is a face wash product produced by Axe.  It is not a scrub which I tend to like a little better as they seem to work a little better to me.  This product does do a pretty good job of cleaning your face though.  Also the scent is just right on this as it is not too overpowering.  I liked this product and its ease of use but will probably stick to using the face scrubs instead of just the face wash.  If you have sensitive skin though I would probably go with this.</li>
    <li> The male tried this face wash and really liked it. It is a lightweight face wash with a bit of scent. It is not overly harsh on the skin but he did say it was a bit drying and his skin felt a bit tight after using it.</li>
    <li> I have a few of the Axe face wash products. This one is fairly similar to the rest. It&#x27;s a more Musky than the other Axe face washes. Does a good job of cleaning my face and smelling masculine.</li>
    <li> Axe Face Wash is a moderately thick, intensely yellow gel that thoroughly cleans the skin, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling overly dry or taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very clean fragrance of slightly sweet cedar or sandalwood with a bit of generic citrus and just a hint of spice that fades very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Axe line is marketed to men, but women who prefer vetiver or sandalwood over floral scents will also enjoy this face wash.  I thought it was &amp;#34;peach&amp;#34; face wash when I selected it, and was certainly startled by the neon color, but found that washing my face with it was a very pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> My husband has used a few Axe products such as deodorant and body wash and has always liked this product brand. The Axe face wash smells good and cleanses very well. This cleanser doesn&#x27;t have a scrub to it but that&#x27;s okay because my husband doesn&#x27;t need a scrub so a gentle cleanser is perfect. I thought it dried his skin a bit though so I gave him moisturizer for after he uses it. All in all, this is a decent, no scrub cleanser for men that has a nice fragrance, but is a tad drying. A little goes a long way a well making it a good price for a long lasting tube. The Peace scent smells great.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, basic face wash from Axe.  It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate or do anything fancy--it&#x27;s simply for getting your face clean. It rinses quite easily and has a clean, masculine scent.  Use with other Axe products and smell great!</li>
    <li> Axe fash wash isn&#x27;t that bad, actually. It cleans well and also moisturizes. But the scent - ugh. Peace? More like Peace, bro.</li>
