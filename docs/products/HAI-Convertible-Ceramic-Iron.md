### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>This iron is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>The salon sold it for $125, but I was so happy when I found it online for $63!</li>
      <li>I jumped for joy!</li>
      <li>This is a great iron!</li>
      <li>I must say that it is the BEST!</li>
      <li>so the fact that I can adjust the temperature to 400 is a great feature</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy with the results I have achieved with this product, it is just like when I go to my hair stylist.</li>
      <li>and it was very good on fine, but damaged and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>To be completely honest, I can tell the GHD is a tad bit better, but not THAT much better, so the fact that the HAI iron is comparable but 3 times cheaper is great!</li>
      <li>I love my hair now!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love this hair straightener!</li>
      <li>This is a nice straightener.  </li>
      <li>I could not be more pleased, and the price was great.</li>
      <li>I own one of these irons already.  </li>
      <li>I thought that the products she used must have made an impact, but after the iron in my own home, I realized that it was in fact the straightener.  </li>
      <li>I decided to purchase my own HAI convertible ceramic iron.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, quick to heat up and works great.    </li>
      <li>My hairstylist used this straightener on my hair and I fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s better to go for quality over quantity.</li>
      <li>I always bought straighteners never spending more than $25 because I wanted to save money</li>
      <li>So ultimately, I am able to compare this HAI iron to the top of the line GHD, which costs a lot more, and I can say that the HAI can compete.</li>
      <li>I have owned this iron for many years.</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>I love the wheel that you can use to control the temperature.</li>
      <li>Meghan :-)</li>
      <li>I love this iron.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service.    </li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>how much the HAI cost until I looked it up on Amazon, and I was very happy to find out that it was much cheaper than the GHD iron.</li>
      <li>I recommend this very highly if you want a good, reliable hair straightener.</li>
      <li>I first got mine 6 years ago &amp; fell in love!</li>
      <li>My sister who is a hair stylist recommended it to me and it is extremely durable and straightens perfectly without any kinks.</li>
      <li>Prior to the HAI, I was happy with the results I got from my CHI, but I now know that there are irons that produce even better results.  </li>
      <li>Of course when CHI became the newest thing I had to buy one, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed &amp; ended up returning it &amp; buying another of this same exact model.</li>
      <li>This is the second HAI convertible iron that I have owned and it&#x27;s great.  </li>
      <li>Plus, it is really comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>With this one, I just have to go over it once, and everything is smooth, not fuzzy.  </li>
      <li>I was extra happy w/ the service.</li>
      <li>The result for the first time was pretty good.</li>
      <li>Very worth the buy.</li>
      <li>This is a great flat iron for the price.</li>
      <li>It came super fast and I am very happy with the entire transaction!</li>
      <li>In my opinion it works better than a chi,for half the price :) very satisfied</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel that any hair straightener should take more than one try to get my hair straight.</li>
      <li>I purchased this (HAI) after reading several good reviews.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a true HAI product or a knock-off), but because it was ordered from an \\&quot;unauthorized\\&quot; supplier HAI will not honor the 1-year warranty.  </li>
      <li>As much as I loved this straightener, I&#x27;ve decided to buy a different brand this time around.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a good flat iron, this one is it.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m looking to find and purchase a reliable, good quality flat iron for my fine,color damaged and frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>The HAI also allows me to adjust the temperature, lowering it when I just need a quick touch up or raising the temperature when ironing my hair after a shampoo, a feature my CHI does not have.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a GHD flat iron for many many years</li>
      <li>Also, a welcome difference is that the plate is 1/4 inch wider, which doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but actually makes a big difference.</li>
      <li>This iron was worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>The Chi was a much better flat iron compared to the Hot Tools one as I did not feel my hair was damaged as much and was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I was concerned at first that this might not be the exact model of mine once receiving it.....</li>
      <li>My hair stylist uses this exact same straightener and he wanted to sell it to me for much more money than what I paid for it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is my first HAI Ceramic Iron.</li>
      <li>If they were able to fix this problem, I would definitely recommend this straightener.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I remembered my friend from high school had a HAI</li>
      <li>It is well worth it to pay the extra money &amp; spend less than 10 minutes to have beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>I ordered the Hai Convertible Ceramic flat iron and I love it.</li>
      <li>One of my friend has had this flat iron for more than 5 years.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, hard-to-control spiral-curly hair that tends to damage easily, and the results I received from my HAI flat iron were actually better than with the CHI, although I had generally been happy with the CHI.  </li>
      <li>I just can&#x27;t believe how much better this item is compared to the cheap ones that only last 9-12 months.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, my happiness didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
      <li>I was so happy to find  my ideal flat iron after searching couple of months for a professional but not too expensive flat iron.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>She Absolutely</li>
      <li>Heats up really fast, has a variety of temperatures, and is lightweight.  </li>
      <li>So, given that this one is taking more time and effort than I would have expected, I would give it a 3 of 5.</li>
      <li>It is worth every cent to purchase professional quality products like this.</li>
      <li>I purchased my first HAI flat iron in November at the suggestion of my hair stylist, who has been happily using HAI products for the past three years.  </li>
      <li>It works better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I have thick curly hair and this straightener makes it easy for me to straighten and makes my hair look so smooth.</li>
      <li>With no product in my hair, my otherwise wiry, dry, semi-curly hair is silky smooth for days.  </li>
      <li>It also arrived in such quick time</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item to anyone who has unruly hair.</li>
      <li>Up until last weekend, I was extremely pleased with the flat iron.  </li>
      <li>Gets really hot, doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair and straightens in one pass - as good as a salon iron at less than half of the price.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair straight and soft.</li>
      <li>A new returning customer.</li>
      <li>And other people I know who use the same flat iron, have experienced the same problem.</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair; it is fine, but I still usually have to go over it a view times with other straighteners to get it smooth.  </li>
      <li>(The first one I had lasted several years.)  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested.</li>
      <li>I usually curly it at the ends to give my hair more style.  </li>
      <li>It makes my slightly kinky asian hair smooth and straight.  </li>
      <li>(the GHD is at a fixed temperature around 370 I believe).</li>
      <li>I also saved over $20 buying it through Amazon than directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that stays hot and gets your hair straight every single time...then look no further.</li>
      <li>This flat iron heats up 400 degrees &amp; makes my hair straight, shiny &amp; manageable.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and can be used to curl or flat your hair.  </li>
      <li>Although this flat iron does straighten my hair, I feel that I need to go over the same area twice to get it very straight.</li>
      <li>NOT true, it is my exact model!</li>
      <li>I wanted to replace my flat iron right away since I wear my hair straight everyday, but I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this hair straightener! My hair stylist uses this exact same straightener and he wanted to sell it to me for much more money than what I paid for it here on Amazon. I have thick curly hair and this straightener makes it easy for me to straighten and makes my hair look so smooth. I would recommend this product any day!</li>
    <li> I am used to purchasing con-air or revlon straiteners because it is what I can afford at the time. I have what I refer to as \\&quot;lumpy\\&quot; hair, &amp; it is very thick. This flat iron heats up 400 degrees &amp; makes my hair straight, shiny &amp; manageable. It stays like that all day too. It is well worth it to pay the extra money &amp; spend less than 10 minutes to have beautiful hair. I highly recommend this item to anyone who has unruly hair. thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I have previously used a Chi hair straightener and a Hot Tools one.  The Chi was a much better flat iron compared to the Hot Tools one as I did not feel my hair was damaged as much and was very easy to use. I purchased this (HAI) after reading several good reviews. Although this flat iron does straighten my hair, I feel that I need to go over the same area twice to get it very straight. I have thick hair, which is naturally almost straight but has a slight wave. I don&#x27;t feel that any hair straightener should take more than one try to get my hair straight. So, given that this one is taking more time and effort than I would have expected, I would give it a 3 of 5.</li>
    <li> This is a nice straightener.  I already have straight hair but use it for getting rid of frizzies (I live in humidity)or to flatten out my bangs if they stick out a little bit.  It does the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself.  Love it.  Has a lot of settings to choose from.  It doesn&#x27;t take \\&quot;forever\\&quot; to flat-iron my hair.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first HAI flat iron in November at the suggestion of my hair stylist, who has been happily using HAI products for the past three years.  I had been using a CHI iron for the past several years, but because of its age became nervous that it would finally \\&quot;bite the dust\\&quot;, which as of this writing it still has not done.  I ordered the HAI from Amazon.com because it was at a MUCH lower price point than at any other location.  Up until last weekend, I was extremely pleased with the flat iron.  I have very thick, hard-to-control spiral-curly hair that tends to damage easily, and the results I received from my HAI flat iron were actually better than with the CHI, although I had generally been happy with the CHI.  My hair stays straight after use with both irons, even in very humid southeastern U.S. summer days or in the rain, getting frizzy and curly again only after actually getting wet--but is a little flatter, thinner and shinier with the HAI than with the CHI.  The HAI also allows me to adjust the temperature, lowering it when I just need a quick touch up or raising the temperature when ironing my hair after a shampoo, a feature my CHI does not have.  Now for my recent dissatisfaction.  I was dismayed last weekend to notice that the ceramic coating on the HAI&#x27;s iron plates has begun to wear off, especially since I have had the iron only six months and have taken efforts to protect it from any type of damage.  It was sourced by Amazon.com from Discount Jungle, which I have now learned has been accused of selling knock-off products from time to time.  My iron, packaging, and all paperwork included with it appears to be legitimate (but in fairness to HAI I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a true HAI product or a knock-off), but because it was ordered from an \\&quot;unauthorized\\&quot; supplier HAI will not honor the 1-year warranty.  So I am now on the hunt again for another flat iron.  Prior to the HAI, I was happy with the results I got from my CHI, but I now know that there are irons that produce even better results.  After doing my research, I have decided to buy a Solia iron this time.  Hope I&#x27;m making the right decision as replacing flat irons after only six months of use gets expensive.</li>
    <li> This iron was worth every penny.  I love it!  It heats up fast and can be used to curl or flat your hair.  I also saved over $20 buying it through Amazon than directly from the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  If you are looking for a good flat iron, this one is it.</li>
    <li> This is a great flat iron for the price. In my opinion it works better than a chi,for half the price :) very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the second HAI convertible iron that I have owned and it&#x27;s great.  (The first one I had lasted several years.)  Gets really hot, doesn&#x27;t tug on your hair and straightens in one pass - as good as a salon iron at less than half of the price.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this flat iron. It works better than any other one I&#x27;ve ever used. But it always breaks! I&#x27;m on my fourth one and its starting to stop working. And other people I know who use the same flat iron, have experienced the same problem. As much as I loved this straightener, I&#x27;ve decided to buy a different brand this time around. I just can&#x27;t keep spending money on something that only lasts about a year to a year and a half. If they were able to fix this problem, I would definitely recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> This is my first HAI Ceramic Iron. I love this iron. It leaves my hair straight and soft. Very worth the buy. This will be my only iron from now on.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this straightener on my hair and I fell in love with it.  I thought that the products she used must have made an impact, but after the iron in my own home, I realized that it was in fact the straightener.  With no product in my hair, my otherwise wiry, dry, semi-curly hair is silky smooth for days.  The salon sold it for $125, but I was so happy when I found it online for $63!</li>
    <li> I own one of these irons already.  I purchased this as a gift for my friend.  It came super fast and I am very happy with the entire transaction!</li>
    <li> This straightener is fantastic.  I have very curly hair; it is fine, but I still usually have to go over it a view times with other straighteners to get it smooth.  With this one, I just have to go over it once, and everything is smooth, not fuzzy.  Heats up really fast, has a variety of temperatures, and is lightweight.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair at all using it almost every day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for over 7 years and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.  It makes my slightly kinky asian hair smooth and straight.  I usually curly it at the ends to give my hair more style.  I love the wheel that you can use to control the temperature.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and have shoulder length silver hair that has a tendency to have flyaways and become a bit frizzy. The flattening iron I used at home worked okay but not like when my hair stylist would style my hair. I did a lot of research online about which iron to purchase and finally selected this brand. I am extremely happy with the results I have achieved with this product, it is just like when I go to my hair stylist. It is worth every cent to purchase professional quality products like this.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair so it is very difficult for me to ever straighten my hair to get that sleek look. I always bought straighteners never spending more than $25 because I wanted to save money I suppose, but I could never achieve the sleek look. It would still look puffy. It wasn&#x27;t until my hairdresser recommended this that I decided to splurge a little and, believe me, it was money well spent! I love my hair now! Sometimes it&#x27;s better to go for quality over quantity.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron at the recommendation of my hairstylist, and she uses the same on in her salon. I must say that it is the BEST! I was using a Chi before this, and I always had to touch up my hair the next day.  With this flat iron, the smoothness and softness holds, even when you only wash, dry, and iron your hair every other day.  I could not be more pleased, and the price was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a GHD flat iron for many many years and recently it broke probably because I wrapped the cord around the flat iron to store it (won&#x27;t be doing that again). I wanted to replace my flat iron right away since I wear my hair straight everyday, but I didn&#x27;t want to break the bank (GHDs are well over 100 dollars--at Sephora they&#x27;re priced at 185). Luckily, I remembered my friend from high school had a HAI and it worked well for her and for me whenever I would borrow it. I had no idea how much the HAI cost until I looked it up on Amazon, and I was very happy to find out that it was much cheaper than the GHD iron. Long story short, for the price this flat iron works very well, perhaps just as well as my GHD iron. I have really thick and coarse hair so the fact that I can adjust the temperature to 400 is a great feature (the GHD is at a fixed temperature around 370 I believe). Also, a welcome difference is that the plate is 1/4 inch wider, which doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but actually makes a big difference. So ultimately, I am able to compare this HAI iron to the top of the line GHD, which costs a lot more, and I can say that the HAI can compete. To be completely honest, I can tell the GHD is a tad bit better, but not THAT much better, so the fact that the HAI iron is comparable but 3 times cheaper is great!</li>
    <li> I have owned this iron for many years. I have curly hair &amp; the with the least amount of humidity exposure...POOF. But NOT with this iron! I first got mine 6 years ago &amp; fell in love! Of course when CHI became the newest thing I had to buy one, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed &amp; ended up returning it &amp; buying another of this same exact model. I the past 6 years I have bought 3 of these (one of them because it was stolen out of my car). They are non-damaging to your hair &amp; with on stroke you get your desired style. I either wear mine straight or loose wavy curls (I know I have curly hair why make them, it&#x27;s a curly hair person thing). I must also mention that these are quite a deal on here, I have bought all my other&#x27;s from a high end beauty supply which cost me $150 each time. I was concerned at first that this might not be the exact model of mine once receiving it.....NOT true, it is my exact model! I jumped for joy! It also arrived in such quick time I was extra happy w/ the service. A new returning customer. Meghan :-)</li>
    <li> One of my friend has had this flat iron for more than 5 years. I tried that and it was very good on fine, but damaged and frizzy hair. I decided to purchase my own HAI convertible ceramic iron. I went to a beauty shop and ask the seller for that. She Absolutely and Definitely warned me of buying this product. She explained that formerly it has been manufactured in Korea, but since 2-3 years ago, the factory has moved to China. As she told me,after this moving and changing, the quality of the product has declined.     By the way, I didn&#x27;t listen to her warning, and bought this iron online from Amazon. I received it on-time,in a well packaged form. It seemed that it was made of a lighter material (in comparison to my friend&#x27;s HAI). I couldn&#x27;t wait to test it on my hair.The result for the first time was pretty good. I was so happy to find  my ideal flat iron after searching couple of months for a professional but not too expensive flat iron. Unfortunately, my happiness didn&#x27;t last too long. After just 2 times of use, it stopped working and never turned on again! I couldn&#x27;t find the problem, so I returned it to Amazon.  Although, choosing this flat iron was not a good experience for me,but I was satisfied with the way Amazon handled my order and the return process.      Now, I&#x27;m looking to find and purchase a reliable, good quality flat iron for my fine,color damaged and frizzy hair. Anybody has suggestions?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of hair straighteners in my life.  I have very thick naturally curly hair that also frizzes a lot.    This iron is the best one I&#x27;ve used.  I can make it totally straight with a slight turn in on the ends to frame my face.  It&#x27;s easy to use, quick to heat up and works great.    I bought one about 6 years ago when they were around $100 and just recently bought another one for my daughter.    I recommend this very highly if you want a good, reliable hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hai Convertible Ceramic flat iron and I love it. I got in within 2 days of ordering and I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better service.    I recommend the flat iron to anyone and buying from this seller too.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair or leave it fried like other flatirons. Plus, it is really comfortable to hold and it lets me wave and curl my hair also. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested.</li>
    <li> My sisters and I have been using this product for years. My sister who is a hair stylist recommended it to me and it is extremely durable and straightens perfectly without any kinks. With some straighteners, I have to go back over the same piece over and over to get it straight...but not with this one. It does the job on the first pass and cuts my hair prep time in half!  We finally had to replace our last one and was very excited to find it on Amazon for $40 cheaper than I&#x27;ve paid for it in the past.  If you&#x27;re looking for a straightener that stays hot and gets your hair straight every single time...then look no further. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t believe how much better this item is compared to the cheap ones that only last 9-12 months. This item has been working now for years without a complaint. Great product!</li>
