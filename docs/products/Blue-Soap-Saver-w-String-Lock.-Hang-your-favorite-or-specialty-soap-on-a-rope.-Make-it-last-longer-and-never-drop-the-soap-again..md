    <li> i got this product to help my kids stop dropping the soap in the bathtub. I like it. It is good quality. I was expecting it to be a little bit of a softer mesh (its kinda scratchy for kids) but they actually don&#x27;t seem to mind and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It works! Provides a place to put perfectly good slivers of soap so they can be used until they &amp;#34;disappear&amp;#34;!!! I know; it&#x27;s always been one of my obsessions!</li>
    <li> If I could give more stars I would! Keeps shower clean, the soap lasts so long with the product because the soap dries.</li>
    <li> Blue Soap Saver soap on a rope makes bar soap less messy &amp; last longer. I use it haging from the shoer neck, with a bath &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34;, Example - http://www.amazon.com/Bulk-Buys-Nylon-Bath-Scrubbies%252c/dp/B00G8FA32Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1393198596&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;washcloth+scrubby it works great, also use liquid soap just nice to use the unusual scents availible as bars soaps too! Also no soap scum!</li>
    <li> This was so cheap, I&#x27;m not sure I will even use it. I bought it for a gift, but couldn&#x27;t send it because it just wasn&#x27;t &#x27;gift&#x27; quality.  A better fabric quality would have been nice.</li>
    <li> Much better than I imagined! A great method for utilizing all of the bar soap product. Provides a generous amount of lather every time.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 for gifts. my mom didn&#x27;t like it &amp; gave hers to me. i haven&#x27;t tried it yet...i will when what i&#x27;m currently using wears out. my sister said she loved it, but she might of said that just trying to be nice ~ not wanting to hurt my feelings.</li>
    <li> Works fine. A little too rough to use on the face.  Seemed flimsy at first, but has held up well.</li>
    <li> This works well - easy to pick soap up when it falls and b/c of net bag is less apt to slip out of hand.  Net bag acts like a loofah!</li>
    <li> It was just storage bag. Not a wash cloth,would not recomend for a wash cloth, not whati needed.just storage bag</li>
    <li> This bag does exactly what it is designed to do.It serves as a collection bag for all of the little leftover bits of soap and smaller bars my family collects in our infrequent stays at hotels, etc..My experience is that it is a bit rough to use on the skin, but works fine in combination with a bath scrubby. It does hold an awful lot of soap, which actually decreases the lathering effect. I recently removed about half of what I had in the bag (Yes, I saved the other half) and have since gotten more lather. The bag itself is well constructed and will likely last a long time. It&#x27;s a great solution to a long-standing problem. I highly recommend it and will buy another when and if this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Thank you.  Quick service.</li>
    <li> I have a feeling this thing is homemade but that does NOT take away from its usefulness!  My soap stays high and dry every shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had such a problem with my bar soap getting all mushy and wasted before I bought this bag. I live in a household of 10 and we all have to share the same shower so needless to say there is constantly water running in that shower. The days of ruined soap bars are over since i bought this though! I just loop it over the shower bar and it hangs there nice and dry until I come back to use it. Soap lasts me a month now where before i&#x27;d be lucky if it lasted 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> good replacement for my old one</li>
    <li> This is a handy little bag for those of us who hate to throw away soap when the bars get small and start breaking. I just dump them in the bag and leave it hanging in the shower and use it similarly to a washcloth while bathing. The porous design produces plenty of soap bubbles for washing and also allows it to drip dry quickly. The only thing about this to note is that underneath where the bag drips dry you will get a bit of soapy residue on the shower floor- be careful since this might be slippery. The material is fairly soft and does not hurt my skin (don&#x27;t use it on my face, however).&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this!</li>
    <li> We use these Soap Savers all over the house:  no more liquid soap for us, and no more messy bars on the side of the sink.  And in the shower, we can easily tell his soap from mine.  I&#x27;m hoping more colors will become available.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  I&#x27;m super economical (cheap?) and hate throwing away little pieces of soap.  Now I &amp;#34;bag &#x27;em&amp;#34; and get every last bubble of soap I paid for!  I like that I can hang it in my shower, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a history of droping items picked up. The most trouble was in the shower when  I droped the bar of soap. Wet and slick it was hard to get a grip with my fingers. No problem now,,,,,the Soap Saver on Rope is the greatest thing. The rope ties anywhere and the soap will never drop again.</li>
