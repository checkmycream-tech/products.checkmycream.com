      <li>When the unit works, it works great.  </li>
      <li>Does a good job for me.</li>
      <li>looks and acts like it might be a good one.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good purchase with a budget in mind.</li>
      <li>Keeps charge well, and does a good job of trimming and detail.</li>
      <li>For establishing fine lines on sideburns or the bottom line of a mustache it is very good.  </li>
      <li>This guy is great for fine work.  </li>
      <li>the price was nice</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it cuts really good easy to use</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t really cut hair good!</li>
      <li>Nice size easy to use and attachments</li>
      <li>Love this item.</li>
      <li>I most surely recommend this product.</li>
      <li>but so much better than the wahl.</li>
      <li>used it on a thursday evening, then on friday morning i used it after showering and the head flew off and smoke came out of the top.</li>
      <li>After 45 days the trimmer stopped holding a charge and would not work for more than 5 seconds even when plugged in.</li>
      <li>Please don&#x27;t force your customers to write more than they want just to fill a word quota.</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Loved the last one: perfect for quick trimming.</li>
      <li>So easy and stress-free compared to shaving.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But I strongly suggest avoiding Conair if you can.  </li>
      <li>works for about 4-5 months fine</li>
      <li>The conair guard has the one guard (plus an edge attachment), I found the correct adjustment and keeping my beard trimmed is quick and easy now, so I use it more often and look civilized all of the time.  </li>
      <li>Charge light is on but will not run.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take long to charge, it&#x27;s lightweight, and it trims great.</li>
      <li>edit: wrote original review at Nov 30 2012.</li>
      <li>at first i wasent sure i would like it</li>
      <li>charge it and then see what difference there is with a full charge.  </li>
      <li>I have not had this problem, but don&#x27;t really expect it to be the most sturdy thing I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
      <li>This would be one of the cheapest models you can buy, and for us, I guess the saying rings true, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking of just getting another one, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works much better than my old battery powered one</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t cut worth a darn.</li>
      <li>The trim guard is perfect for the way I trim my beard, other trimmers have too many attachment and its hard to find the correct setting.</li>
      <li>And it came on time very fast</li>
      <li>The first time I used it a couple of teeth fell off and man did it pull and hurt.</li>
      <li>I used it for a while but finally had enough and picked this unit up because price was so good.</li>
      <li>but comments I put on the camera cord was right on for this product.&lt;br /&gt;The high rating can give which is A Number One.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
      <li>Nice little trimmer for the price.</li>
      <li>this product so very much.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still love it though, just have to be a bit careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say too much on this.  </li>
      <li>but i like it works really</li>
      <li>He likes it so much</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud, almost like true hair clippers, and the shortest setting does not trim as short as I would have preferred.</li>
      <li>Bring back that Red Corded Conair GMT8RCS product which was way better with a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I bought these as a replacement for an older version</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Not really for use on anything super thick, but gets the job done in most cases.</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace one that was 14 years old.  </li>
      <li>My 17 year old Son stays well groomed with this.  </li>
      <li>after i used this one than i piched my old one it in the garbage</li>
      <li>Although a bit loud it does its job and does not pull out hairs</li>
      <li>Accidently replaced my old Conair unit with a Wahl.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;i keept my old one for about a month&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
      <li>course if you drop this a far distance it will break.</li>
      <li>So I purchased this to replace an old Conair trimmer whose internal battery was not holding a charge.  </li>
      <li>Thinking about sending them back but not sure their worth the postage to do that.</li>

<li> So I purchased this to replace an old Conair trimmer whose internal battery was not holding a charge.  </li>
<li> Thinking about sending them back but not sure their worth the postage to do that.</li>
<li> Long battery life.</li>
<li> I like the adjustable setting which lets you decide the how long you want your hair to be.</li>
<li> I had a much more expensive one that died, but this baby is doing well!</li>
<li> However, it is sharp enough to do the job.  </li>
<li> Honestly I&#x27;m not sure what they changed except for the fact that this one is blue, I only bought the newer one because I needed an extra and this one was cheaper.</li>
<li> With other trimmers it was such a hassle</li>
<li> After occasional use since then, this trimmer has slowed down considerably - after a few times of it not turning on at all.</li>
<li> /&gt;Works just as good as the previous model: [[ASIN:</li>
<li> i bought this for a trip to alaska, needed something quick and reliable which i was sadly mistaken.</li>
<li> Just what I expected.</li>
<li> /&gt;SO, it has only been a few days since receiving the replacement so I am not sure if this one will last.  </li>
<li> The guide is very hard to adjust and does not trim very well if you want a little closer to the skin beard.  </li>
<li> well Sharp but not to sharp</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to get into a thick beard with it, but, just like the tools in our shop, everything has specific application.  </li>
<li> I may try to find a way to cut down the comb to make it lower.</li>
<li> This unit was a close match.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly less than 30 days from the time of purchase, the AC adapter that charges the unit died.  </li>
<li> I had these in the corded version (which I did like) for about a year and a half before they shorted out and couldn&#x27;t be used.</li>
<li> but it has now died after less than 2 months.</li>
<li> so I wound up looking like sasquatch (scared little children).  </li>
<li> that is the only thing i will give it, but the quality seems to be quite poor.</li>
<li> im sorry, but i can only give one star due to this.</li>
<li> It cuts unbelievable well.</li>
<li> : /</li>
<li> I Spoke to a supervisor at Conair and they were ridiculous.  </li>
<li> shaves the hair without cutting the skin.</li>
<li> They are just plain terrible!!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with this trimmer, and have been using it sparingly over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> What a piece of crap.</li>
<li> It is very annoying.</li>
<li> Their customer service is terrible.</li>
<li> The worst product ever made.</li>

    <li> Water destroys this. Even Basic cleaning made it rust.  : /</li>
    <li> The trim guard is perfect for the way I trim my beard, other trimmers have too many attachment and its hard to find the correct setting. The conair guard has the one guard (plus an edge attachment), I found the correct adjustment and keeping my beard trimmed is quick and easy now, so I use it more often and look civilized all of the time.

    <li> Excellent product and arrival time!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT!!!!!  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> at first i wasent sure i would like it&lt;br /&gt;but i love it&lt;br /&gt;it works much better than my old battery powered one&lt;br /&gt;it cuts really good easy to use&lt;br /&gt;i keept my old one for about a month&lt;br /&gt;but after i used this one than i piched my old one it in the garbage</li>
    <li> but comments I put on the camera cord was right on for this product.&lt;br /&gt;The high rating can give which is A Number One.&lt;br /&gt;Like this product so very much.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I most surely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> We bought this and plugged it in to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We removed it from the charger after charging overnight and it had no power. We read the directions and it says it MUST charge for 16 hours before using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus we placed it back on the charger and let it go for the remainder of the day and into the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried to turn this on again, and it never turned on. We must have gotten a defective unit. I returned it and got a different model in it&#x27;s place. It does come with 2 attachments. This would be one of the cheapest models you can buy, and for us, I guess the saying rings true, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> shaves the hair without cutting the skin. Long battery life. I like the adjustable setting which lets you decide the how long you want your hair to be.</li>
    <li> So I purchased this to replace an old Conair trimmer whose internal battery was not holding a charge.  This unit was a close match.&lt;br /&gt;Slightly less than 30 days from the time of purchase, the AC adapter that charges the unit died.  So I contacted Conair to get a replacement.  They told me that I would need to send it to Conair for replacement AND pay a $5 charge to cover shipping and handling to send the replacement.  SO I would have to pay to send the faulty unit AND pay a fee for them to send me a replacement.  What a JOKE !.  I Spoke to a supervisor at Conair and they were ridiculous.  They simply state the facts but did nothing to preserve customer satisfaction.  The unit was not even a month old.&lt;br /&gt;LUCKILY, the unit was purchased within 30 days of purchase and I discovered I could return it to Amazon.  Amazon paid for the postage back and sent me a replacement.  Amazon is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, it has only been a few days since receiving the replacement so I am not sure if this one will last.  When the unit works, it works great.  I just am hoping the charger will not die again.  But I strongly suggest avoiding Conair if you can.  Their customer service is terrible.</li>
    <li> My 17 year old Son stays well groomed with this.  He likes it so much I order another one for him to leave at his Father&#x27;s house.</li>
    <li> I bought these as a replacement for an older version and I guess I made a mistake.  The guide is very hard to adjust and does not trim very well if you want a little closer to the skin beard.  I’m looking at alternative mustache and beard clippers as we speak.  They are just plain terrible!!</li>
    <li> Battery cannot hold charge.....this is after a month. I have been using Conair so I wanted to continue with the same brand......surprise!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t really cut hair good!</li>
    <li> Although a bit loud it does its job and does not pull out hairs</li>
    <li> Accidently replaced my old Conair unit with a Wahl. What a piece of crap. The first time I used it a couple of teeth fell off and man did it pull and hurt. I used it for a while but finally had enough and picked this unit up because price was so good. It cuts unbelievable well. Not the best at trimming up close like around lips etc but so much better than the wahl. For the price I have no complaints. Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> From time to time my customers will ask my advice concerning trimmers for beards and mustaches.  This guy is great for fine work.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to get into a thick beard with it, but, just like the tools in our shop, everything has specific application.  For establishing fine lines on sideburns or the bottom line of a mustache it is very good.  For &amp;#34; bigger &amp;#34; stuff you should consult your stylist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RgN&lt;br /&gt;Pennsylvania</li>
    <li> The worst product ever made. Bring back that Red Corded Conair GMT8RCS product which was way better with a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I do hair for a living.They don&#x27;t cut worth a darn. I had these in the corded version (which I did like) for about a year and a half before they shorted out and couldn&#x27;t be used. Thinking about sending them back but not sure their worth the postage to do that.</li>
    <li> works for about 4-5 months fine then battery fails to hold more than an hours charge</li>
    <li> Does a good job for me. I had a much more expensive one that died, but this baby is doing well! Thanks</li>
    <li> Not only did it not work well...would not give a close trim...but it has now died after less than 2 months. Probably used it a total of 3 times. Charge light is on but will not run. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> i bought this for a trip to alaska, needed something quick and reliable which i was sadly mistaken. used it on a thursday evening, then on friday morning i used it after showering and the head flew off and smoke came out of the top. was in a bit of a pickle. the price was nice that is the only thing i will give it, but the quality seems to be quite poor. im sorry, but i can only give one star due to this.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace one that was 14 years old.  looks and acts like it might be a good one.  Hopefully it will last like my last one.  Arrived on time.  Very happy with packaging and all.</li>
    <li> I wish the lowest setting was even lower. But well made and sturdy. I may try to find a way to cut down the comb to make it lower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s battery died within weeks and would not take a charge even though I charged as directed. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say too much on this.  You have to charge it 16 hours before using and they say the battery is fully charged after 3 charges from total dead-16 hours.  I think the power should be stronger but that may be because I have only charged it once.  I think I might let it run--drain it-charge it--let it run--drain it--charge it and then see what difference there is with a full charge.  However, it is sharp enough to do the job.  I just trim the mustache and ends of the sideburns with it.</li>
    <li> junk must charge for 12 hrs to use maybe 10min will not hold a charge</li>
    <li> edit: wrote original review at Nov 30 2012. It&#x27;s now Sept 25 2013. After occasional use since then, this trimmer has slowed down considerably - after a few times of it not turning on at all. I&#x27;m thinking of just getting another one, it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works just as good as the previous model: [[ASIN:B003Q6TAPG Conair GMT10CS Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer, Black]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the last one: perfect for quick trimming. Here&#x27;s my review from that page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This trimmer simply works. Doesn&#x27;t take long to charge, it&#x27;s lightweight, and it trims great. Not really for use on anything super thick, but gets the job done in most cases. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed with this trimmer, and have been using it sparingly over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course if you drop this a far distance it will break. I have not had this problem, but don&#x27;t really expect it to be the most sturdy thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. It&#x27;s not meant to be. I still love it though, just have to be a bit careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would (and will if necessary) purchase this again. So easy and stress-free compared to shaving.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works just the same. Honestly I&#x27;m not sure what they changed except for the fact that this one is blue, I only bought the newer one because I needed an extra and this one was cheaper.</li>
    <li> Love this item. Please don&#x27;t force your customers to write more than they want just to fill a word quota. It is very annoying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud, almost like true hair clippers, and the shortest setting does not trim as short as I would have preferred.</li>
    <li> my husband likes this alot !!! wish it came with a holder or bag to put it in !!!</li>
    <li> Nice size easy to use and attachments</li>
    <li> just what you would expect</li>
    <li> Nice little trimmer for the price. Keeps charge well, and does a good job of trimming and detail. It&#x27;s a good purchase with a budget in mind.</li>
    <li> Excellent tool, works great.</li>
    <li> After 45 days the trimmer stopped holding a charge and would not work for more than 5 seconds even when plugged in.</li>
    <li> Only just got it but i like it works really well Sharp but not to sharp And it came on time very fast</li>
    <li> Just what I expected. works great. I would recommend to a friend</li>
