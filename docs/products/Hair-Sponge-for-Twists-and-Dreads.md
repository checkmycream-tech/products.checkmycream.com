      <li>fast arrival as described</li>
      <li>it really works...</li>

      <li>Well I only had about 2 1/2 inches of hair on my head and it had fun tugging at the bit of hair I had.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s twisted the hair good in certain places</li>
      <li>We already have to order a new one</li>
      <li>the product does exactly what is expected, my teenage son loves it!</li>
      <li>I wish the top of the sponge wasn&#x27;t a cut out After a couple of week&#x27;s of use the sponge started to crumble, leaving behind tiny pieces of the material in my hair.</li>

<li> I am very disappointed in this product</li>
<li> It&#x27;s horrible!</li>
