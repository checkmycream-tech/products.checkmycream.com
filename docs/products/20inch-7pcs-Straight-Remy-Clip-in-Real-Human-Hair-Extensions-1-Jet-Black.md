<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It looks nice!!! The only thing is that is only little be hair but for the price I thinknis OK...</li>
    <li> Its way to skinny. Bti maybe if you buy 3 packs it would actually cover your head</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product before and it came perfectly, Now im ordering for a second time and not letting reviews bother me. Alot of the complaints are that its thin, it&#x27;s only 70g not 100-200g so just buy two.</li>
    <li> Horrible !! Completely disappointed w this product!! I can&#x27;t curl it !! Isn&#x27;t real hair!!!!!</li>
    <li> This hair was terrible and a waste of money. I could not straighten them and they were not real hair.</li>
    <li> worst set ive purchased! hair is way to thin</li>
    <li> You will not receive what you think your paying for.</li>
    <li> they were awful! i was very displeased! i would not revoment buying them again! i wish i ha not bought them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had hair extensions before, but these are the best so far.  I can&#x27;t believe how silky smooth they feel and shiny!  They blend in perfectly with my dyed black hair.  Only think I did was trim the ends a bit to make them look even healthier.</li>
    <li> Not enough hair! if u decide to buy this product u should buy at least 2 and even then it might not be enough. The texture of the hair is nice, not that bad but i was expecting more hair.</li>
    <li> 7 pieces and the hair can&#x27;t even cover one side of the head!! Waste of money! i do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> By far the worst hair extensions ive had. My last beforw these were luxy hair extensions and i should have jus bought a new pair instead of wasting my money on these because they were cheap. You really do get what you pay for ! The completely lied and said they chuld be colored straightened and curled with iron but everytime i try my hair whould burn! I was so excited when i had received them after the almost 2 momths wait just to be disappointed and upset ! DO NOT waste your money I forgot to return them because after i attempted to do up my extensions i just threw them back in the bag and in the closet and forgot about them becaus of how much of a waste it was the ONLY good thing about it was how longgggg they were i loved that !</li>
    <li> They didn&#x27;t impress me at all. They are very thin and the hair falls off the tracks easily. I&#x27;m returning them. Also they don&#x27;t hold a curl well and that&#x27;s kind of the reason I got them.</li>
    <li> My extensions arrived way earlier then I expected. Real human hair, may look thin but curling them will look perfect.  I love my long hair. So happy I got them for $20.</li>
    <li> having never used extensions in my life i was a bit cautious but it was incredibly realistic and i was very pleased with the product! thank you</li>
    <li> Very thin, and small pieces. Would need at least 4 sets to make it look decent. I feel like it was a waste of money!</li>
    <li> WORST PACKAGE I&#x27;VE EVER GOTTEN. Hair is by no means QUALITY OR 20 INCHES AS IF THIS WEREN&#x27;T ENOUGH THE HAIR IS CUT UNEVENLY. This was by far the most regrettable purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on amazon.</li>
    <li> I was happy with the extensions. I got 8peices but I would&#x27;ve liked them to be thicker. Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> Ive had these extensions a month now and theyre still in great condition. I was worried before i recieved them because of all the negative reviews. I was very satisfied though, yes they are pretty thin but what do you expect for $20? other than being thin theyre the best extensions ive ever had, ive been buying 18\\&quot; extensions from other stores for about 8 years and these have been great especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Awesome and with no delay.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t come with any clips attached.</li>
    <li> They are soooo thin and stringy about 16 inches in reality so don&#x27;t expect Kim K hair because this will not be it</li>
    <li> Not the real deal. As soon as I begin to straighten my extensions they melted. Don&#x27;t waste your money on them because they suck.</li>
    <li> They looked and feeled like human hair. But when i tryed to straighten them the hair started melting!!! Do not buy. Synthetic.</li>
    <li> This item is horrible !!! It is real hair but the ends are THiNNER than paper!!! It came with no clips and it was tangled to hell. DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> there verry thin ??? i geuss there good if you want u head fuller but if u have thick hair i would not buy ???</li>
    <li> Worst buy ever. Hair extensions are extremely thin and contrary to seller description they are not real. I was unsatisfied and decided to return them. They granted the return but won&#x27;t pay for return shipping which just so happens to be nearly the price you pay to begin with (if in U.S.). Although they seem like a great deal, they&#x27;re really not worth the hassle. Trust me, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> I just received this item today and it was everything it said it was i love it the color is perfect it all fit nicely i am sooo excited that everything stated was true and it came on time. Thanks so much</li>
    <li> Everything that was described is exactly what I got. Perfect length, texture, and it&#x27;s real human hair! I&#x27;m very very pleased with my extentions that I got and the price was amazing too! :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy very crappy!!!! Seriously lasted 2weeks then started to fall apart !! Waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> These extensions are very amazing I love them and I wear them al the time!!!! I recommend them, they&#x27;re great!!!</li>
    <li> it was very thin.  need much more hair.  hair was too thin to use,  kept loosing strands of hair.  would send it back if I could.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality, the hair extensions are REALLY thin can&#x27;t even tell the difference I do not recommend this to ANYONE! Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Worse extensions I&#x27;ve ever had. Even though there are seven pieces the hair is super thin and you would need two or three packs to blend in with your hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> They are very thin, I have thin hair so it worked out for me! I recommend buying two sets......I mean they are cheap extensions but I feel like I got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t stay in place and had to reso on clips the texture of hair was nice but other than that didn&#x27;t really care for them</li>
    <li> its not real human hair. its fake. i thought i was going to get real human hair that felt nice</li>
    <li> The quality was very nice when I received it, which was quick shipping. After awhile, my boyfriend and I noticed the hair started to shed tremendously around the room and anywhere else. It was pretty embarrassing. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this hair</li>
    <li> Very thin, although long just not much to them really.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price they are so thin the hair falls off the track and looks bald. I have bought better hair for the same price at sallys so save your money...... I&#x27;m never buying from this seller again. I can&#x27;t believe they have 5 stars when the product is not as described !</li>
    <li> you get what you pay for they are a little thin but the clips are durable I enjoyed them I would buy more</li>
    <li> This really was a disappointment for me as I was expecting muuch more hair than what was given to me. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my $$</li>
    <li> They make my hair longer and I love them! They are WONDERFUL quality! I couldn&#x27;t have found a more great price for real hair too.</li>
    <li> the get briitle one spray of detangler and there ruind the shrunk and there so fake and ugly and thin like your not eve there</li>
    <li> This hair was nothing like the description.  It wasn&#x27;t real human hair as stated in the sale title. The hair tangles, it doesn&#x27;t curl and heat seems to make it hard. The only truth about this product is that it&#x27;s was 20 inches and jet black.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely love it. She loves how quick and easy it is to put it in.  I&#x27;ll definitely by more from this seller!!</li>
    <li> Hair was ok was kinda upset it didn&#x27;t have clips had to get those separately</li>
    <li> Not real human hair as advertised. Decent, but not good for coloring or styling if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> At first I thought these extensions were not very good so I purchased a set from hairextentionsale.com for $50.00 (I paid $21.00 for these) after receiving the ones for $50 I realized the ones I got from Amazon were actually a lot nicer and longer than the more expensive ones. And after I washed these they looked even nicer.  These extensions are thin but they are only 70grams of hair and my hair is very thin to begin with so I didn&#x27;t want a real thick extension that would look to noticeable. After using these for a while I am very happy with them and I am actually going to buy another set for my daughter, you have to remember you are only paying $21.00 for these and I feel for the price you are getting a good product, plus it was free shipping and they were here in a coupe days.</li>
    <li> No clips! Not even close to enough to do anything with. The pictures and description are definitely very misleading! Very very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I received my extensions yesterday and yes they did get to me fairly quick but the packaging was just awful!! i ordered 2 packs of these extensions and the came in a little yellow envelope and inside were the two packs. They were tightly rolled into uh ball, so when i took them out they were crazy looking! Didn&#x27;t want to straighten them soo soon but unfortunately i did. Other then that the hair was decent for the price.</li>
    <li> when ordering this product order 2! just because one isn&#x27;t enough its great but two always works better! affordable and stylish.</li>
    <li> The hair is not real, if it is it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen! I would not ever buy this hair or from this company again!!</li>
    <li> Clips aren&#x27;t very Strong. They weren&#x27;t properly installed.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a bit more hair, maybe i did not understand the amount and i got very few hair...thanks anyway</li>
    <li> I use these almost every day I curl, wave, straighten.. they look just like my own natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are amazing!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very upset when I received them and they were synthetic hair and not human hair like y&#x27;all said it would be in the title.</li>
    <li> The pictures look like full pieces. They are so super thin. They have Kim Khardasian as the model with a full head of hair. it is trying to say that those clips can do a full head but it cant even do a partial. They are so thin that you can see through them. Never again!!!!!</li>
    <li> These were not &amp;#34;real human hair&amp;#34; extensions, I could tell they were fake as soon as I pulled them out of the package. They won&#x27;t even curl they just stay straight.</li>
    <li> Great product but look is deceiving the hair was very lightweight but otherwise good product order 2 bundles for thicker effect.</li>
    <li> I thought they would be a lot thicker than they were. I had to buy a second pair and glue them together in order to make them thicker. But they were still extremely thin! It gave off a really bad smell when I tried to straighten them so I gave up. Rather waste a few more bucks and get good quality ones. I guess you get what you pay for right?</li>
    <li> I do not like glue and sew in.  I need to thicken my hair and this is perfect and simple way to do it.  It is real.</li>
    <li> the hair came on time, but i was disappointed to see how thin it was. there&#x27;s like 10 strands of hair on each clip and they were not even black.</li>
    <li> They look so good on the pictures but once I received these they were ridiculously THIN and shed so much. I have not been able to even wear them because of that.</li>
    <li> I bought them. And I shouldve went to sallys in the first place. Way too thin hair pieces.</li>
    <li> The hair is not real like promised, and that&#x27;s the reason I bought it. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed in myself for falling for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these since May because i wanted to wear my hair long for prom! and they look great!!! i wear mine every day and i still have them, although i think its about time i order a new pair. wayyy worth the price i paid. i curl and straighten them and i sometimes go swimming with them. clips in perfect and i am extremely satisfied.</li>
    <li> great item.  exactly as described</li>
    <li> Looks good and easy to use</li>
    <li> Gross spaghetti like and not even thick. It&#x27;s so thin but I guess I give it props for actually curling with a curling iron. Other than that..don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> It was a good shopping experience, delivery was at the right time, good product quality, I like the hair texture, the color, the perfect length, my only criticism is that the hair is not abundant and that is a point I did not like .. !</li>
    <li> Horrible Buy &amp;#62;.&amp;#60; Not Real hair it was a waste of my Money. Had to trhow them away the second day I received them because I tried brushing them out and it tangled up.&lt;br /&gt;Really upset.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as advertised. Probably should have ordered two sets to make it look full and natural.  Other than that, the hair is very good quality, it can be curled and styled as you would your own hair.  Looks very natural and it&#x27;s easy to clip in.</li>
    <li> I want my money back they are syn hair not real human hair like the description said false advertisement do not buy from this suppler</li>
    <li> One of the clips was broken</li>
    <li> Good product. Great for the price.  I buy a new set every couple months.However,  Remy is th ONLY brand I reccomend.</li>
    <li> Some of the clips were damaged but it may have been due to being shipping but all else looks great</li>
    <li> Great, can get them straight and curly 😁😁😁</li>
    <li> I love these hair extensions for the price! They are a little thin and tangle easy...but it&#x27;s synthetic hair sooo what can you expect? I wore these everyday before I got my hair chopped off :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend this!</li>
    <li> SUPER soft and better than the 200$ pair I bought from a salon.</li>
    <li> Cute cute , but unfortunately I took a hair straightener to mine an ruined them I had no idea I couldn&#x27;t do that to them....;(</li>
    <li> Great product. Great service. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is not real human hair. As stated in the title &amp;#34;real human hair&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This product took over a month to deliver, once arrived there were kinks in it.&lt;br /&gt;In the description it states you can curl straighten or wash this item, so I went ahead and clipped them in and proceeded to straighten them, they instantly melted, the ends are ruined on one piece. I wanted to see if they would curl as well, and that also melted them (I used the lowest heat setting) I am highly dissatisfied with this product. I will go to sally&#x27;s and purchase the real ones.&lt;br /&gt;I advise against this product. I am very upset!</li>
    <li> These extensions are NOT what I thought they were.. First off, they were really cheaply made. When I got them, I could physically see the bunches of hair that were sewn together... which is not supposed to happen. Second, it says they&#x27;re thick..... they&#x27;re nothing close to being thick. They are very stringy and thin. Horrible quality. I would never spend money on these ever again. I suggest if you have medium to thick hair... not to buy these. Go to a professional place like sally&#x27;s and buy them there. More expensive, but so much better.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully packaged came right on time very beautiful extensions my daughter really enjoys them they blend right in with her own hair and make a perfect match would highly recommend at this price</li>
    <li> I have this a 5 because the hair is well made and the right amount of pieces and its thickness is just right too!&lt;br /&gt;Yoy cant beat the price either!</li>
    <li> The extension where to thin did not like them at all hate them. .. do not get them waist of money</li>
    <li> Do not buy this hair. It is NOT real hair. It burns when you straighten it . Ridiculously thin for what you pay for. I bought two sets and it still wasn&#x27;t enough for a full head to look normal . Do not waste your money .</li>
    <li> makes her hair look so cute and long. very pretty color. would order some for myself but dont have any hair</li>
    <li> I love these clips ,this hair is very easy to manager!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this item.  People thought it was my real hair</li>
    <li> Its really nice. Odd smell when I got it wet and a few gray hairs but I like them 😁</li>
    <li> good product I have nin type of complaint, I am satisfied recommend this seller and product</li>
    <li> The price of these extensions was almost too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;When I received them they were very sparse.&lt;br /&gt;Only a few hairs reached the full 20 inches.&lt;br /&gt;And the seem up by the metal clips looked like someone crappily sewed them on.&lt;br /&gt;Im not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Please ladies, save your money and invest in some nice extensions.</li>
    <li> These are very cheap and smaller than what they say in the title. DO NOT BUY!!!! Not worth it at all!</li>
    <li> I love my hair &amp; it got to me really fast ! The only is I would have to die my own hair jet black just to blend in with my extensions , other than that I love it</li>
    <li> These are the worst extensions I have ever recieved.&lt;br /&gt; They cant not go in a straightener, when you comb them they knot up at the ends, I can&#x27;t wear them for more than 10 minutes without them knotting, and the ends split alot. If you comb it hard then the strands fall out.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend them! Waste of my money!!! I dnt usually write reviews but I had to for this one because it was bad quality.</li>
    <li> By far the worst extensions I&#x27;ve ever bought. I mean I want expecting top quality when I bought them because of the price but they&#x27;re so unbelievably thin I can&#x27;t even put them in my hair and it look natural. I am extremely dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> These extensions are great! They aren&#x27;t too thin or too thick; they&#x27;re just right! If your black hair has a brown tint to it then these will look natural. Really enjoy these!!!</li>
    <li> I received my hair extensions today. I was very pleased with the amount of hair and quality of it but I was a little disappointed with all the grey hairs in it but that&#x27;s a easy fix with some hair dye.overall for 25 dollars you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Horrible quality, you can&#x27;t straighten it and it smelled horrible.</li>
    <li> They are not CLIP INS! I bought CLIP in extenstions. And track came instead. Fix the advertising.</li>
    <li> I got her today! I absolutely love her! She is beautiful, straight, long, silky and thin.  I absolutely love the hair!  Except I recommend buying another set of hairs to complete the whole look! Im defenetly purchasing another ASAP! I recommend these hairs! And they feel and look natural. Love it!</li>
    <li> Quick and easy and looks like real hair. They are thin but that works for me because of my hair type.</li>
    <li> Very nice extensions to add volume (and length) to your hair.  I trimmed them down slightly.  Great for the price.</li>
    <li> This was just fake hair....I&#x27;m so mad ...... I can&#x27;t even put a dam iron in them don&#x27;t buy them</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t actually feel real it melts when I try to curl it not as good as the last ones</li>
    <li> I loved these, they were really good! I strongly suggest buying them! They were awesome, worth the money! Very much so!</li>
    <li> The hair was very thin not very good quality</li>
    <li> is a good product and was received at the time indicated, the process was easy for purchase..  thanks for your good service</li>
    <li> The hair extensions are great--they perform ust like my real hair, curl, straighten, and help with styling great dos. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> This product isnt too bad. The extensions feel soft and they come with string,extra clips and a needle just incase you need to reattach the hair to a clip and it blends nicely with my hair..id recomend it! (:</li>
    <li> If you are going for a scene look with the more poofy hair on top, these are perfect. That is what I used them for. They are quite thin so if you want a fuller effect get two packages. but all in all i am happy.</li>
    <li> Perfect! I&#x27;ve not had a single issue with these. I would recommend. :)</li>
    <li> As a professional hair stylist, my opinion of the quality of this hair was decent, the individual wefts are extremely thin, if you want natural looking and feeling, I would definitely buy 2 sets. As a person that has medium density, these particular extensions were too thin. My natural hair is roughly 18 inches long, and you can tell that the clip ins are too thin and fake, either save your money to buy a better quality, or purchase two sets.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed they are very thin and clip pieces were very small you would need 3 to 5 7 piece packs to make it look somewhat natural</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not real hair.. like it says.. but they add volume and they&#x27;re fun for just a special occasion or just taking pictures</li>
    <li> Human hair, arrived well before the date given. Very pleased, surpassed my expectations. Although, the hair is thin, there are some grey hairs, and the ends frizz, but that can be easily fixed will leave in conditioner(:</li>
    <li> Eh. They are thin at the bottom but they work well.</li>
    <li> they are too thin, will have to order one or two others just to make it look real. didn&#x27;t like them at all</li>
    <li> So I haven&#x27;t bought this exact item, but I wear 20 inch black hair extensions everyday, I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s anything wrong with the material or anything, but it is not as long as the picture. Those are probably 24 inch.</li>
    <li> They are better then I expected from reading other reviews and look great. Love them, but wish they were a bit less stringy looking at the ends,but nothing a good trim wont fix. :)</li>
    <li> theyre nice as long as you dont try to curl them they fry and almost melt with even a little heat. but if you only want straight ones they are good.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product. Its a good product it seems real, looks real, but isnt real.&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday i tried bleaching the extensions so i can dye the tips of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;I left the bleach in for about an hour, nothing happened whats so ever.&lt;br /&gt;i would like to receive some sort of refund or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
    <li> Ordered this product for my daughter. Thought the extensions were very thin and I would not order this same product for the money. Just was not worth the cost. I thought I was purchasing better quality extensions as well as more full considering the price. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible product. Almost all the clips fell off after using a few times. Hair is very thin and looks like string.</li>
    <li> Well the hair got here on time which was a plus but I&#x27;ve ordered a lotttt of hair and never had hair as tangley as these. You can&#x27;t even move without a knot and to get them out you just pull the hair out. Not happy with these.</li>
    <li> I love them! They are exactly what I was looking for at a great price. They style with my curling iron too! There perfect :)</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re guys product sucked as a cosmetology student they were poorly made meaning not enough hair. If u guys are looking for long term use I don&#x27;t recommend these you would have to replace them every  3 months/ I have pretty thick hair and order 2</li>
    <li> WTF , WROST EVER DID WEAR ONCE THOUGH BUT TRASH !</li>
    <li> This hair is fake i hate it from when i opened it n it didnt come with a damn return label so i wasted my money</li>
    <li> I think it is natural hair, I put the plate just shrugged and smelled like plastic. As the bag is folded hair also doubled and I could not take the mark.</li>
    <li> Sucked!!! Too&lt;br /&gt;Thin! Hardly any hair the material was cheap&lt;br /&gt;And it was not what I expected very unhappy &#x27;</li>
    <li> I really like this product because at first I was excited about being shipped in and just having various of different styles to do since it is 20 in long. At first my eyes were amazed because Remy is expensive in my town and the results were astonishing !!! Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> It came broke and thin</li>
    <li> I FINALLY got mine in today. I contacted the seller because my package was so late but it was actually amazons fault because they \\&quot;lost my package.\\&quot; But the seller was BEYOND sweet! They are thin but I have this hair so it didn&#x27;t bother me a bit. I am pretty much obsessed already!</li>
    <li> Snaggles to much - mom</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, I bought this product, but when my package arrived, it was not human hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really protect screen but is cute!</li>
    <li> They look very nice, but they&#x27;re too thin so i bought two sets at once. I got the color i ordered which is black</li>
    <li> DOES NOT EVEN LOOK LIKE EXTENSION IS MORE OF EXTRA HAIR FOR BALD PEOPLE THIS REALLY SUCKS EXPENSIVE FOR NOTHING</li>
    <li> I now I have not got them yet but I&#x27;m very excited for them to come I need them for my bridal shower coming up and my save a date picture&#x27;s so hopefully they are everything I want thank you</li>
    <li> This is a scam, this is not human hair extensions. Dont buy it!!!</li>
    <li> for a co-worker, not an account d eamazon and desired product, liked it a lot.</li>
    <li> Gurls dont buy this its horrible it come very little hair and has alot of hair falling down very dissaponted but I guess you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Returned this. If you want to buy extensions, please do not make the choice to buy cheap.</li>
    <li> It is not what you&#x27;d expect.  A complete waste of money</li>
    <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for my 18 year old granddaughter, she loved them.  In fact I ordered 2 of the same a few days apart, the other for my grandson&#x27;s girlfriend.</li>
    <li> I just recieved mine last week and I love them!&lt;br /&gt;very nice I would recommend them to anyone wanting good quality extensions</li>
    <li> For the price I would&#x27;ve expected thicker wefts. Its good hair, just not as much as other company&#x27;s use per weft. Also the ends are so thin you have to cut at least 2 inches off for it not to look like a buch of dead ends. A big NO NO because I wanted the lenghth.</li>
    <li> Its perfect!!!!!! I love it! 23$ cant beat it! I bought this and then i read the reviews and i thought to myself... oh no.. and then i got it... i opened it and was very disappointed but then i opened it completely and i was so happy its real hair and i love it. The only this is it is thin for every piece but it fits my hair so i love it.</li>
    <li> I wish I read the reviews before buying this. Such a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> thanks, this s*** wont dye. thanks alot. and it smelled horrible when i got them, and dyed them. good quality..</li>
