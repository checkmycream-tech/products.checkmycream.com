      <li>It is a great price and the cheapest shaving razors I have seen.</li>
      <li>These were just what I needed and at a really great price.  </li>
      <li>For the money a great buy.  </li>
      <li>Love them !!</li>
      <li>The product is a good buy.</li>
      <li>good for the price--</li>
      <li>makes a good throw away</li>
      <li>They have two blades and are not the best quality razors, but they are the cheapest and overall good!</li>
      <li>I get three great shaves and 1 pretty good shave on one blade.</li>
      <li>I AM ALL ABOUT CHEAP AND GOOD.</li>
      <li>Great Product and the company is a very fast shipper.</li>
      <li>I think after some extended use, I&#x27;ll get more accustomed to them.</li>
      <li>I question the wisdom of buying so many at one time, but it comes to about 8 cents a razor, and no one can beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>6 plus years of razors for such a great price!</li>
      <li>will take the money :)</li>
      <li>like the squared plastic handles which make it easier to orientate the razor, and the protective covers come off more easily than with the BIC, which I appreciate.</li>
      <li>Great price and good quality for a disposable double blade its no fusion but not bad</li>
      <li>Also easy to pack in gallon zip lock bags.</li>
      <li>these blades are fine, you can get two shaves out of them normaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We are a food pantry that distributes personal items as well as food and we are always looking for a great deal to serve our clients.</li>
      <li>These are great for anyone who wants to shave as cheap as possible.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for Blessing Bags for the homeless or any other community event.</li>
      <li>ESPECIALLY WITH RAZORS THAT IS USED EVERYDAY,  AMAZON DID GREAT IN RESOLVING SOME ISSUES BUT OVERALL EXCELLENT BUY.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more after!</li>
      <li>I rarely get cut with the BIC razors.</li>
      <li>You be the judge, bargain value or slightly more frequent cuts.</li>
      <li>favorite razor is the BIC disposable for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Very cheep and do a clean job.</li>
      <li>Almost a full year of shaving for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>small handles but for the price very nice.</li>
      <li>We got exactly what we wanted in a very reasonable time.</li>
      <li>First things first.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s something about the blade geometry that make these blades more likely to cut.</li>
      <li>Unlike the BIC, these razors are double bladed and look slightly more aggressive in their mounting angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>this is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>Great price, but not great quality.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the one with  the orange handle, and white blade head.&lt;br /&gt;Close, comfortable, no complaints there.</li>
      <li>ready for zombie apocolypse</li>
      <li>Not the most comfortable shave, but for the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re tired of spending a fortune on razors.</li>
      <li>Normal speed shipping, packaged well, shave fine, and I saved money on future razors.</li>
      <li>Perhaps with more practice I&#x27;ll cut down on the combat wounds.</li>
      <li>In use, these razors feel much like the BIC but a little more aggressive where the blade and skin contact.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After shaving with a brand new razor in the shower, I noticed blood all over my nice (formerly) white bath towels as I tried to dry off.</li>
      <li>#34;When is a razor blade worth $3.95?&amp;#34; or some such thing.</li>
      <li>Clogs quick and need multiple passes vs other disposable products.</li>
      <li>They just are not sharp enough - About as sharp new as a three week old Mach3 razor.</li>
      <li>I believe the razors are acceptable if you shave slowly, taking special care around the nostrils and upper lip.</li>

    <li> 6 plus years of razors for such a great price!</li>
    <li> Great deal!! I get three great shaves and 1 pretty good shave on one blade. These will last for years.</li>
    <li> makes a good throw away</li>
    <li> ready for zombie apocolypse</li>
    <li> good for the price-- as expected&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
    <li> I AM ALL ABOUT CHEAP AND GOOD. ESPECIALLY WITH RAZORS THAT IS USED EVERYDAY,  AMAZON DID GREAT IN RESOLVING SOME ISSUES BUT OVERALL EXCELLENT BUY.  I DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW LONG 300 RAZORS WILL LAST BUT I WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you were trying to find an inexpensive bulk replacement for your Bic double edge razors. Well, THIS AINT IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving with a brand new razor in the shower, I noticed blood all over my nice (formerly) white bath towels as I tried to dry off. My face was bleeding quite a bit. My wife had the same problem when she tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless your skin is very tough, don&#x27;t waste your time. I just shipped them back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price and good quality for a disposable double blade its no fusion but not bad and now im set on buying razers for the next 7 years or so.</li>
    <li> this is exactly what I ordered. Took a little longer than expected to receive but that&#x27;s the only down side.</li>
    <li> They just are not sharp enough - About as sharp new as a three week old Mach3 razor.</li>
    <li> Razors work just as well as much more expensive razors. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for Blessing Bags for the homeless or any other community event. Also easy to pack in gallon zip lock bags.</li>
    <li> Great Product and the company is a very fast shipper. We are a food pantry that distributes personal items as well as food and we are always looking for a great deal to serve our clients. Would recommend other non-profits to consider.</li>
    <li> Blades terrible. I returned product at my expense for shipping.</li>
    <li> these blades are fine, you can get two shaves out of them normaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price per blade $ 0.12, use 3 a week for a year $ 18.72 for the year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or buy something local for about $ 1.25, use 3 a week $ 190.32 for the year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will take the money :)</li>
    <li> First things first. These razors are a bargain. I bought a 50-pack for $10. I now see that Amazon is selling the same razors in a 300-pack for about $36. I question the wisdom of buying so many at one time, but it comes to about 8 cents a razor, and no one can beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite razor is the BIC disposable for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s the one with  the orange handle, and white blade head.&lt;br /&gt;Close, comfortable, no complaints there. But, it can be hard to find at a modest price. Razor prices are going insane. No doubt you&#x27;ve seen the recent hype-machine promoting &amp;#34;Harry&#x27;s Razors&amp;#34;. The ads are everywhere. I&#x27;ve seen captions read: &amp;#34;When is a razor blade worth $3.95?&amp;#34; or some such thing. It smells like a racket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the ad for this product, I couldn&#x27;t resist the bargain price. So how do these razors stack up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the razors twice now, and in both cases I managed to cut myself. I rarely get cut with the BIC razors. There&#x27;s something about the blade geometry that make these blades more likely to cut. I believe the razors are acceptable if you shave slowly, taking special care around the nostrils and upper lip. Unlike the BIC, these razors are double bladed and look slightly more aggressive in their mounting angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the squared plastic handles which make it easier to orientate the razor, and the protective covers come off more easily than with the BIC, which I appreciate. In use, these razors feel much like the BIC but a little more aggressive where the blade and skin contact. Perhaps with more practice I&#x27;ll cut down on the combat wounds. I still think these razors are a great buy but I do wish the maker would study what the BIC people did and emulate it&#x27;s geometry. You be the judge, bargain value or slightly more frequent cuts. A tough call.</li>
    <li> These are great for anyone who wants to shave as cheap as possible. This product comes with 300 shaving razors and I use each one twice before disposing so I could shave for almost two year at about 10 cents per razor at the time I bought! $32.86 for almost two years of shaving at the rate I shave! I will definitely buy more after! It is a great price and the cheapest shaving razors I have seen. They have two blades and are not the best quality razors, but they are the cheapest and overall good!</li>
    <li> The product was as described in Amazon and has performed well.  The life has been within expectations.  The product is a good buy.</li>
    <li> Very cheep and do a clean job. For the money a great buy.  I would recommend  to any one.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Dozer</li>
    <li> Great price, but not great quality. Clogs quick and need multiple passes vs other disposable products. Again, great price.</li>
    <li> Normal speed shipping, packaged well, shave fine, and I saved money on future razors. Use once and toss, no need to stretch these. Almost a full year of shaving for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Not the most comfortable shave, but for the price I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it if you&#x27;re tired of spending a fortune on razors. I think after some extended use, I&#x27;ll get more accustomed to them. If so, I&#x27;ll update and give 4 stars.</li>
    <li> We got exactly what we wanted in a very reasonable time. Will definitely shop here again.</li>
    <li> small handles but for the price very nice.</li>
    <li> These were just what I needed and at a really great price.  Love them !!</li>
    <li> Great buy for price.  Have ordered these several times!!!</li>
    <li> Great for tattoo shops..</li>
