      <li>Even though I had limited time in town the shipment arrived perfectly on time.</li>
      <li>yourself clean smelling many</li>
      <li>In 5-10 minutes, Love Chloe starts to show her true</li>

      <li>This perfume was announced to the public the day my favorite German Shepherd (Chloe) died.  </li>
      <li>This is my new signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>I smelled like an old librarian... for about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Chloe is a soft, powdery scent composed of purple flowers.</li>
      <li>Yet its a sweet soft smell nothing that will nock dead the neighborhood</li>
      <li>I could not find it in-stock at a major retail outlet (Macy&#x27;s, Sephora) for sampling.</li>
      <li>the real thing and for half the retail price.</li>

<li> Highly addictive and long lasting.</li>
<li> Chloe wears close to the skin but is relatively long lasting.</li>
<li> It strikes me as a young, but not innocent, fragrance that could be worn by women of any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get the experience that the other people got.  </li>
<li> price was just about half price of the malls.&lt;br /&gt;The service was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It smells like a old librarian, sorry.  </li>
<li> but it is much less expensive at other online stores.</li>
<li> but of course it&#x27;s been discontinued :(  </li>
<li> There also is something a tad animalistic in the base - just a tad.</li>
<li> Given the nasty opening, I imagine that this fragrance might be passed over at the beauty counter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great price packaged well excellent shipping time perfect for a gift or for yourself clean smelling many have asked me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing since my purchase</li>
    <li> This perfume I bought before even knowing what it smelled like. I was not disappointed. It smells lovely. Nice clean just had a shower scent. I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> I was on a biz trip to Idaho and wanted to buy this item as a gift for my wife. Even though I had limited time in town the shipment arrived perfectly on time. I contacted the reseller to check the status of the delivery and they responded in avery prompt and friendly way.</li>
    <li> Given the nasty opening, I imagine that this fragrance might be passed over at the beauty counter. What a mistake that would be! Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t scrub and waited patiently. In 5-10 minutes, Love Chloe starts to show her true self.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Chloe is a soft, powdery scent composed of purple flowers. I primarily get iris but I also get sweet (not green) violet. I sense a bit of rose, although it is not a listed note. Sometimes it seems a bit more soapy than powdery. There also is something a tad animalistic in the base - just a tad. Is it musk or something else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Chloe wears close to the skin but is relatively long lasting. In my opinion, it&#x27;s suitable for any season. It strikes me as a young, but not innocent, fragrance that could be worn by women of any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Love Chloe a bit of a marketing disaster? I could not find it in-stock at a major retail outlet (Macy&#x27;s, Sephora) for sampling. Of course, Amazon carries it but it is much less expensive at other online stores.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the perfume. We got item quickly. She uses the perfume all the time. I must admit that it does smell very good on her.</li>
    <li> The product, Love by Chloe,  is the only one my wife likes because it isn&#x27;t over powering..&lt;br /&gt;The price was just about half price of the malls.&lt;br /&gt;The service was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon...always with an unconditional guarantee</li>
    <li> The spray button on the bottle doesn&#x27;t work. Now I&#x27;ll have to figure out how I can transfer the parfum into something else.</li>
    <li> This is my new signature fragrance. Each time I wear this no matter where I go I&#x27;m being told how amazing this smells. Body chemistry aside--this is  an all occasion fragrance!</li>
    <li> I am simply obsess with this perfume. Highly addictive and long lasting. People always notice when I have it on. Yet its a sweet soft smell nothing that will nock dead the neighborhood</li>
    <li> I never ever write reviews but I love, love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though when I first sprayed it on me, I was so upset. The smell was horrid. I smelled like an old librarian... for about 20 minutes. After that, what was left was this gorgeous powdery, sexy, sultry but somehow sweet fragrance that got even better throughout the day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Def give this one a try! Don&#x27;t let the first impression fool you :)</li>
    <li> When I found out this perfume was discontinued I was devastated. However finding the product on Amazon was a gamble, but it it definitely the real thing and for half the retail price. Worth the purchase you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
    <li> Really good  smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful smell so floral and feminine. Not too &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smelling as another reviewer said, I&#x27;m 22 and I wear it all the time. Love it love it</li>
    <li> This is some grrrrrrrrrrreat perfume it makes me smell. Wonderfuuuuuuuul. Everyone tells me how. Grrrrrrrrrreat I smell and want to know what it is.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!!</li>
    <li> my favorite perfume but of course it&#x27;s been discontinued :(  wear this almost daily over top a body oil of the same scent  love it! will keep purchasing this online as i can no longer find it in stores</li>
    <li> What can I say ?  This perfume was announced to the public the day my favorite German Shepherd (Chloe) died.  I had to try it and I love the scent!!!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell that great to me....I didn&#x27;t get the experience that the other people got.  It smells like a old librarian, sorry.  the seller promise me to send a return slip, they never did, these sellers are crooks, don&#x27;t do business with them.....</li>
