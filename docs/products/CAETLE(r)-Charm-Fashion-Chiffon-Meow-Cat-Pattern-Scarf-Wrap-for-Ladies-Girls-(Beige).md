      <li>I figured for such a good price I could try it out</li>
      <li>Great scarf at a great price, shipping took a bit-but worth the wait, just plan the get it a little later</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a cute scarf but very short</li>
      <li>The scarf itself is lovely, but it is PINK, not beige nor ecru.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long enough to wrap like a real scarf which is nice.</li>
      <li>i adore this scarf its so soft !!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a really light and delicate scarf that looks just as good if not better than the picture!</li>
      <li>Could be an issue with messing up the cloth, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>The fabric is amazingly soft and billowy... and has cats on it.</li>
      <li>For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong, the pattern and fabric is nice and soft, but the seam on the outside is kind of sewn poorly.</li>
      <li>I fell in love with this scarf, with the little black cats on it.  </li>
      <li>Sadly, it marred the cat pattern slightly on one side, but overall it still is a really good product.</li>

<li> The material is a bit thin...</li>
<li> Would buy again even with how delicate it is!!</li>
<li> Since we&#x27;ve been having a lot of snow and cold weather, I had to wear my winter jacket, and the Velcro on the jacket snagged the fabric of the scarf and pulled out a thread.</li>
