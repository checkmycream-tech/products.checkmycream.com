### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Not the best &amp;#34;just</li>
      <li>Bought it for my boyfriend for his nose hairs, does the job, didn&#x27;t need anything fancy, great for the price!</li>
      <li>This trimmer works great!</li>
      <li>Wahl makes very good hair clippers and sideburn cutters, but nothing beats Panasonic for nose clippers.  </li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>This was a very good product and will buy it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been happy with Wahl products but this product should not even be sold.</li>
      <li>Works Great.  </li>
      <li>It feels good in your hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Honestly at that price, what more could you ask for?</li>
      <li>My boyfriend uses this trimmer occasionally we bought this item for a great price and it is a great item.</li>
      <li>so I almost look civilized!</li>
      <li>but I suggest you spend a bit more on a lower maintenance model.</li>
      <li>Sometimes it cuts the hair, but for the most part it doesn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>i bought 2 cuts nose hair pretty good</li>
      <li>he put the lid on and then realized that it was stuck....which caused the whole top to be pulled off with it, and it took a good 10-15 minutes to seperate the two.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This trimmer works fine for me.  </li>
      <li>There are better built by this manufacture and by Pasnasonic but for once a week/month use, this is worth it.</li>
      <li>It was good quality and very well worth my money.</li>
      <li>I imagine I&#x27;ll need to clean this often, and it does work</li>
      <li>It is water resistant and works adequately.</li>
      <li>oh well, it&#x27;s not expensive!</li>
      <li>The first time my dad used it ....</li>
      <li>This is his first time using one of these.</li>
      <li>My recommendation is to pay the extra $6 or $7 and get a better quality product.</li>
      <li>After about two months it seemed to take longer to complete the job and the \\&quot;engine\\&quot; started to sound funny.  </li>
      <li>After being tickled by nosehairs from my somewhat hairy-nosed boyfriend for long enough, I shipped this to his house and after using it, he absolutely loved it.  </li>
      <li>Works better than expected.  </li>
      <li>This nose and ear trimmer works very well</li>
      <li>This thing ended up buzzing in drawer the whole time.</li>
      <li>Being a member of the troglodytes I frequently need to trim the fuzz growing in my ears and nostrils.</li>
      <li>This product was a complete flop.  </li>
      <li>Not due to shipping, it was after it turned on -- lasted just about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>The product was never used in wet conditions and was treated very well.  </li>
      <li>My old trimmer had a rubberised feel to it and after several years the rubber felt gummy and sticky.</li>
      <li>I prefer my old generic trimmer to the Wahl.</li>
      <li>the first few times that I used it,</li>
      <li>it does okay for ear and brow, but should have a round blade like in the past.</li>
      <li>Weak, but does the trick...not sure if it&#x27;s going to last very long, already dying on me...</li>

    <li> Wahl makes very good hair clippers and sideburn cutters, but nothing beats Panasonic for nose clippers.  These just do NOT do the job due to the ancient technology that Wahl uses in these trimmers.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works, portable, and does the job. Can&#x27;t beat the price at $5.99 w/free ship. Quiet running and does not pull on nose hairs. It might not be heary duty but I may only use it once a month. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works fine for me.  I like it. Easy to use. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> This trimmer works great! Being a member of the troglodytes I frequently need to trim the fuzz growing in my ears and nostrils. This little buzzer cleans me up so I almost look civilized!</li>
    <li> Works Great.  It is from Wahl.  What do you expect?  QUALITY!  will recommend</li>
    <li> The first time my dad used it ....he put the lid on and then realized that it was stuck....which caused the whole top to be pulled off with it, and it took a good 10-15 minutes to seperate the two.</li>
    <li> After the 3rd use the blade jammed, so I twisted off the head and was able to pull the blade out to blow debris off of it. I imagine I&#x27;ll need to clean this often, and it does work but I suggest you spend a bit more on a lower maintenance model. I had a Remington nose trimmer that was $12 and lasted me 6 years with no such maintenance.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product and will buy it again. It was good quality and very well worth my money.</li>
    <li> should not be advertised as &amp;#34;nose hair&amp;#34; trimmer. it does okay for ear and brow, but should have a round blade like in the past. not happy with product.</li>
    <li> The item works as advertised and for under $6.00, what can you say. There are better built by this manufacture and by Pasnasonic but for once a week/month use, this is worth it.</li>
    <li> This product was a complete flop.  It never worked!  After changing the battery twice to get it to work I gave up and now that I have missed the return window it is in the trash.    Won&#x27;t be buying any Wahl products again.</li>
    <li> This does not seem to do the job.  Sometimes it cuts the hair, but for the most part it doesn&#x27;t and I am back to scissors.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected.  Does not pull on hair.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this trimmer occasionally we bought this item for a great price and it is a great item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using 4 different batteries. Nothing happened. I should have tried it before giving it to my father as a present.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> Bought it for my boyfriend for his nose hairs, does the job, didn&#x27;t need anything fancy, great for the price!</li>
    <li> My son loves his, got it for him as a gift. This is his first time using one of these.</li>
    <li> The blades are not very sharp and the Wahl tripper doesn&#x27;t remove hair like other products I&#x27;ve owned. I prefer my old generic trimmer to the Wahl.</li>
    <li> Weak, but does the trick...not sure if it&#x27;s going to last very long, already dying on me...oh well, it&#x27;s not expensive!</li>
    <li> None of my nose hairs fell out.</li>
    <li> I have had this now for about 6 months and I&#x27;m not too fond of it.  It seemed to work alright the first few times that I used it, but that&#x27;s it.  After about two months it seemed to take longer to complete the job and the \\&quot;engine\\&quot; started to sound funny.  At this point it sounds very bad to the point where I don&#x27;t want to use it anymore.  The product was never used in wet conditions and was treated very well.  I ordered another brand and am waiting for it to arrive.  My recommendation is to pay the extra $6 or $7 and get a better quality product.</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. But the sliding switch is a bit loose. One time I left in bathroom drawer and other things must have pushed against the switch. This thing ended up buzzing in drawer the whole time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and it&#x27;s still working with the same batteries. I only use it once a week btw.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Only problem, battery compartment cover does not fit as well as it should. I like the cutting head cover provided, an improvement over Wahl&#x27;s prior offering.</li>
    <li> After being tickled by nosehairs from my somewhat hairy-nosed boyfriend for long enough, I shipped this to his house and after using it, he absolutely loved it.  Not the best &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift but it did it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> This nose and ear trimmer works very well, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs. It feels good in your hand. My old trimmer had a rubberised feel to it and after several years the rubber felt gummy and sticky.</li>
    <li> i bought 2 cuts nose hair pretty good and it does the job and for its price cant complain, i would buy again!!!</li>
    <li> cheapest found get one for nose hairs</li>
    <li> This trimmer costs less than $6. It is water resistant and works adequately. Honestly at that price, what more could you ask for?</li>
    <li> This was broken when we received it.  Not due to shipping, it was after it turned on -- lasted just about 1 minute.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic trimmer is slightly more expensive but there isn&#x27;t a comparison in terms of usability. I&#x27;ve always been happy with Wahl products but this product should not even be sold.</li>
