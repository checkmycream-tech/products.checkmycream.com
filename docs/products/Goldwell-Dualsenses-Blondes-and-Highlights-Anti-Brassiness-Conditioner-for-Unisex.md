      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but this is a better price for the product.  </li>
      <li>SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ULTRA SHIMMER LIGHTS SHAMPOO...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products to rid my daughter&#x27;s hair (age 6) of the greenish tint from the chlorine in our swimming pool.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful product, My hair color maintains its blonde highlighs and color even after many shampoos.</li>
      <li>Good price and economical quantity.  </li>
      <li>Most of the time the conditioners for anti-brassiness shampoos are....lackluster, but this one should be used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A FANTASTIC FINE</li>
      <li>Happy to find this blonde shampoo on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN REAL SOON!!!</li>
      <li>The Blondes and Highlights line from Goldwell is amazing, it makes my hair shiny, soft and healthy and does well with removing golden tones</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product, but also its the first purple/blue shampoo I ever used.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!</li>
      <li>I recomend it to help prevent brassiness.and keep a rich color.</li>
      <li>My color and highlights stay true.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>This is a nice nourishing shampoo, but did nothing to protect the blonde in my hair from brassiness.</li>
      <li>So far so good, my light brown hair is not faint, still has a rich light brown to it after dying it a few months ago.</li>
      <li>Smells beautiful and does the job of keeping blonde blonde!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge color payoff, but its enough if you are doing maintenance and not trying to repair a huge brassiness issue.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>My daughter is (a natural) blonde and she needed a more smooth look and she loves this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It helps with shine and really does make my hair squeaky</li>
      <li>Thank you very much greatly appreciated</li>
      <li>Amazon continues to have the lowest price by far!!!</li>
      <li>The real test will be when I go blonde in a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>You want to use enough to really suds up.  </li>

<li> actually doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair either like a lot of purple shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair like some other blonde shampoos.</li>
<li> Her hair color is blonde with some dark undertones.  </li>
<li> Then I use a shower cap to let it actually sit for a few minutes.  </li>
<li> I go between this and one other.</li>
<li> Not only has it kept the green away, her hair has never looked healthier!  </li>
<li> Think this is lightening my hair :/</li>
<li> The purple color is def weird but works well</li>

    <li> Best purple shampoo I have ever used. Actually noticeably brightens your hair and takes out all the brassy tones.</li>
    <li> Do not see any benefit from this shampoo</li>
    <li> Smells great and gets a he brassy out</li>
    <li> My daughter is (a natural) blonde and she needed a more smooth look and she loves this shampoo.  The purple color is def weird but works well so we are happy to have found it.</li>

    <li> THIS IS THE TOP OF THE LINE SHAMPOO FOR BLONDES!!!  WHEN YOU HAVE SULFER &amp; IRON WATER TO DEAL WITH ON BLONDE HIGHLIGHTED HAIR SUCH A FANTASTIC FINE THIS WORKS FOR ME SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE ULTRA SHIMMER LIGHTS SHAMPOO...WILL BE PURCHASING AGAIN REAL SOON!!!</li>
    <li> Think this is lightening my hair :/</li>
    <li> This product like all Goldwell Products does what it says it will. It cuts brassiness. It adds shine and cuts tangles, smooths my hair and cleans well. What else can I say. It is great. Love it.</li>
    <li> great product!!!! Used by my hairdresser but this is a better price for the product.  Thank you very much greatly appreciated</li>
    <li> Makes my platinum blonde hair even brighter than before. Well worth the price! Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to rid my daughter&#x27;s hair (age 6) of the greenish tint from the chlorine in our swimming pool.  I stumbled upon this in desperation and we couldn&#x27;t be happier! Not only has it kept the green away, her hair has never looked healthier!  Her hair color is blonde with some dark undertones.  We use both the shampoo and conditioner.  Amazon continues to have the lowest price by far!!!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! The Blondes and Highlights line from Goldwell is amazing, it makes my hair shiny, soft and healthy and does well with removing golden tones</li>

    <li> This is one of the BEST toning shampoos.  I go between this and one other. This isn&#x27;t a huge color payoff, but its enough if you are doing maintenance and not trying to repair a huge brassiness issue. Use with the conditioner. Most of the time the conditioners for anti-brassiness shampoos are....lackluster, but this one should be used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair either like a lot of purple shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It helps with shine and really does make my hair squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And remember, you DO want to put quite a bit on, as you are depositing color.  You don&#x27;t want to just use a dime.  You want to use enough to really suds up.  Then I use a shower cap to let it actually sit for a few minutes.  I&#x27;ll leave it and the conditioner on for up to ten minutes a piece.</li>
    <li> Happy to find this blonde shampoo on Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my hair like some other blonde shampoos.</li>
