      <li>I love this shampoo, it smells so amazing</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light with a lovely scent that&#x27;s not overly perfumed at all.  </li>
      <li>But for someone who washes once weekly or more infrequent than that will need something stronger to cleanse the hair with.</li>
      <li>/&gt;and love it.  </li>
      <li>Always pleased to find this product.</li>
      <li>and I love that it comes from Italy.</li>
      <li>Love this product line.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Davines for years and its my favorite brand of hair care products.</li>
      <li>I was able to find it on line after introduction in pricey salon.</li>
      <li>and I seriously love all their products.</li>
      <li>Wish they would have specified that I needed to buy a pump for this, as I thought I could otherwise use this easily at home...</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t clean as well as some cheaper brands that I&#x27;ve used, but I really love the scent though.  </li>
      <li>Smells clean and sexy and lil goes along way</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>Davines is such a great company</li>
      <li>I was made aware of this shampoo by a very fine hairstylist  in Chicago.  </li>
      <li>It is a very fresh almost cactusy scent.  </li>
      <li>I love the simple packaging, and the scent is amazing.  </li>
      <li>She is allergic to certain ingredients in most shampoos and breaks out from them.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
      <li>Smells like a mild cough syrup with a hint of cactus.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to get this because I had tried the shampoo at the Loews hotel in Hollywood</li>
      <li>Well worth</li>
      <li>We alternate this with head and shoulders for our long Rapunzel hair and it is great and makes us shiny and strong with no allergic reactions.  </li>
      <li>Gentle, moisturizing, earth friendly...</li>
      <li>EXACTLY</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t care if I could buy it a Wal-Mart, because I really like it.  </li>
      <li>this product wokrs really well.</li>
      <li>but not enough better to justify the extra expense.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair perfectly clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m not an expert on shampoos, but I have a pretty good nose - to me, this is an inferior product than what I had at the Loews hotel, so</li>
      <li>This is ok for someone who has money to burn and wash their hair almost everyday.  </li>
      <li>My first time buying this but won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
      <li>nothing the REAL product-it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly, color-treated hair and it kept my hair frizz-free and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>What she found was that the shampoo this time seems to be a bit runny and required almost twice as much shampoo as compared to the last bottle I bought her.  </li>
      <li>Due to having fine dry hair  </li>
      <li>I find that it cleans very well even when I only use a tiny bit of shampoo and it never dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>I use this and alternate with the Davines Natural Tech Purifying Shampoo 1-2 times a week, and have had no issues.  </li>

    <li> I bought a second (from amazon) one of these for my girlfriend for christmas because she loves this shampoo.  What she found was that the shampoo this time seems to be a bit runny and required almost twice as much shampoo as compared to the last bottle I bought her.  I&#x27;m not sure if this was just a fluke or if they might have changed the formula.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me some samples of this shampoo and I loved it!  It&#x27;s very light with a lovely scent that&#x27;s not overly perfumed at all.  I, too, balk at the price but will definitely purchase it.  I have naturally curly, color-treated hair and it kept my hair frizz-free and bouncy.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo, it smells so amazing and I love that it comes from Italy. Davines is such a great company and I seriously love all their products. Since using their Momo line, I don&#x27;t ever need a keratin treatment again!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft, supple and shiny-  Great scent!  Extremely impressed with the lightening fast customer service to rectify a problem!!!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE ON THIS SHAMPOO. EXACTLY WHAT YOU BUY AT AN EXPENSIVE SALON. SAVED LOTS OF $. GREAT PRODUCT FOR HIGHLIGTHED HAIR.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for some time at an exclusive store in Boston, and now my tony salon carries it.  I wouldn&#x27;t care if I could buy it a Wal-Mart, because I really like it.  I love the simple packaging, and the scent is amazing.  If I shower in the morning, I can still pick up the scent of it on my hair at night.  I&#x27;m a man, and the scent is not perfumy at all.</li>
    <li> This is a little too pricey for me.  This doesn&#x27;t clean as well as some cheaper brands that I&#x27;ve used, but I really love the scent though.  It is a very fresh almost cactusy scent.  I heard about this at this salon I used to go to who also recommended Bumble and Bumble products which are nice as well. This is ok for someone who has money to burn and wash their hair almost everyday.  But for someone who washes once weekly or more infrequent than that will need something stronger to cleanse the hair with.</li>
    <li> I know others have commented on the smell being pleasant but I just don&#x27;t get it. Smells like a mild cough syrup with a hint of cactus.  It cleans the hair well but not enough better to justify the extra expense. Will not buy again because it just is too pricey for getting an average shampoo. I will go back to Biolage Ultra-Hydrating Shampoo and it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is relatively expensive, but the big bottle lasts months and months.  I transfer it into a smaller bottle for use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I was not happy with the order that didn&#x27;t have a pump with it or at least offer us to buy it if wasn&#x27;t for free.  How do you pour a 33.8oz shampoo when using.  I guess for over $40  a bottle you would at least get a pump.</li>
    <li> Wish they would have specified that I needed to buy a pump for this, as I thought I could otherwise use this easily at home...</li>
    <li> I was able to find it on line after introduction in pricey salon. Gentle, moisturizing, earth friendly...what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Well worth it even thought it&#x27;s a little pricey. My first time buying this but won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
    <li> FAKE PROdUCT-DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> My daughter has been using this shampoo for years.  She is allergic to certain ingredients in most shampoos and breaks out from them.  Love this shampoo!</li>
    <li> We alternate this with head and shoulders for our long Rapunzel hair and it is great and makes us shiny and strong with no allergic reactions.  We are sensitive to a lot of other shampoos in our family.</li>

    <li> My hairstylist recommended this for my hair, and its been awesome.  Love this product line.  If you can believe it, I used to use Head &amp; Shoulders because I thought I had a dandruff issue.  Turns out my hair (and my scalp) are just dry.  I use this and alternate with the Davines Natural Tech Purifying Shampoo 1-2 times a week, and have had no issues.  Worth the price, this one smells great.</li>
    <li> Good product but price should be lower, that&#x27;s why I rated it 4 stars vs. 5.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product.</li>
    <li> I was pretty excited to get this because I had tried the shampoo at the Loews hotel in Hollywood and I really liked the smell. I liked it so much I kept a bottle of it so I could remember to get it when I got home. Well, to my disappointment this is not the same stuff - the real stuff has a smell that is almost addictive, it is very very distinct; this just smells like cactus shampoo mixed with some other stuff. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m not an expert on shampoos, but I have a pretty good nose - to me, this is an inferior product than what I had at the Loews hotel, so I have to give it only 2 stars.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair perfectly clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it. It is a salon-size bottle with wide neck so you&#x27;ll need a smaller container for your home use.</li>
    <li> Great product line. Always pleased to find this product.</li>
    <li> nothing the REAL product-it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same. A reproduction</li>
    <li> oh yes sex for my hair. Smells clean and sexy and lil goes along way</li>
    <li> I was made aware of this shampoo by a very fine hairstylist  in Chicago.  I have used this product over 3 yeas&lt;br /&gt;and love it.  It makes my hair soft and manageable.  Due to having fine dry hair  this product wokrs really well.</li>
