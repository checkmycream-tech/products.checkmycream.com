<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> argh i wanted to like it, but it really pasty white.  i accidentally got some on my car door, and it doesn&#x27;t come off. also i think i&#x27;m allergic to something in it. made my skin really itchy!!</li>
    <li> I love this sun screen! I am very fair and my skin is sensitive and burns easily, but this left my skin feeling smooth and i didn&#x27;t break out. The scent is nice and mild, and it last a long time without having to reapply, i couldn&#x27;t ask for better sun protection.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great!  It isn&#x27;t too greasy, does a good job of disappearing when you rub it on the skin and only contains natural products.  I feel great knowing that I&#x27;m protecting my daughter from the sun and unnecessary chemicals.</li>
    <li> Product works good.  Does make my skin appear whiter.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb fast into skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m confident it is working.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this sunscreen on ourselves and our children for the past month and can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. We have had no sunburns and we feel good knowing that the ingredients aren&#x27;t going to harm our children.</li>
    <li> As others have said...I really wanted to like this but, after two tries, we all burned. I did reapply - expecially on the second try. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this before going on vacation. Also, it stained my daughter&#x27;s shirt. One drip left a grey mark that won&#x27;t come out. I can&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> the following comes to mind when i put this spf on: very fluid, greasy, white, and peanut butter.  some people said this was not greasy.  if this lotion is not greasy, then i don&#x27;t know what is.  or i got a defective bottle.  but this was definitely greasy.  it also leaves this white residue behind that makes me look like i have foundation that is 10x too light for my skin.  i now also have the white residue on my steering wheet and car door and everything i touched.  if the direction on the bottle even say to make sure you rub and rub and rub into the skin to avoid the white residue, you KNOW there&#x27;s going to be some white crap left on your skin.  no matter how hard or long i rubbed it, the whiteness was still there.  what&#x27;s the point of spf when you end up not wanting to go out to anywhere because you look like a ghost?  2 stars for the ingridient list, and i&#x27;ll use this for when i hang out by the pool on my own but when i&#x27;m done with this bottle, i won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My wife and I bought this product after researching sunscreens recommended by the Environmental Working Group.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well.  We applied a heavy amount to all exposed extremities 30 min before venturing out in the sun and we reapplied countless times during our all day beach excursion.  We even brought an umbrella which we stayed under most of the time.  As others have said the product is greasy, never rubs in, gets all over your car and clothes, cakes in every crack and crevice on your skin, comes off almost immediately in the ocean and makes you look like a member of the Blue Man Group.  We met some people while at the beach who initially thought we had some kind of bizarre purple skin disease.  Trust us... keep looking and don&#x27;t buy.  We bought after seeing all the positive reviews but after actually using it and each getting a nice sunburn we don&#x27;t understand the high marks.</li>
    <li> I like that this product is not hazardous to my health and is scored well with EWG. There are no perfumes in it to add unknown ingredients to it.  The price is in line with similar products.  What I do not care about is that it leaves a ghostly shadow on my skin. Is is possible to be safe yet fairly invisible!</li>
    <li> I found out about this sunscreen from EWG website, and LOVE it!!!  It is safe, goes on easily, and protects my daughter&#x27;s skin without potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
    <li> My kids are not a fan of this product because it smells like crackers to them.  Also, once you apply it, it really stays white on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t rub in well - makes it easier to see where you missed, but after hours with it on, you still look somewhat ghost like. But this got good safety ratings, so that was why I tried it. I wish it had worked out better.  Maybe if you really need some good protection and its no big deal that you look a bit pasty.  The smell does go away and I didn&#x27;t think it was all that bad. My kids refuse to use it again.  Would be great for babies - they don&#x27;t care!</li>
    <li> I searched online and asked friends for suggestions on a safe and effective sunscreen for my baby and found Loving Naturals. It rated high on EWG as a safe, organic sunscreen so I tried it on my baby. It&#x27;s a little thicker than normal sunscreen, but that&#x27;s great because you can easily see where you missed and it stays on for hours even in water.   I love that it&#x27;s safe for sensitive baby skin and we&#x27;ve been using it all summer and my kid&#x27;s skin is nice and protected.</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have found a sunscreen that is safe for my child and myself to use. We are sensitive to the sun and burn easily. Loving Naturals sunscreen is safe and well priced compared to other sunscreens. I like how it is not greasy on my skin. It is important to reapply. I have reapplied every two hours and have not been burnt while using it. Also be careful to shut the cap tight or try to keep it in a position so the cap is up because the lotion can easily leak out of the bottle. I like the sunscreen, feel safe using it, and will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I found this product to be more oily than I was led to believe based on other reviews. The \\&quot;food\\&quot; smell someone else referred to was probably the sunflower oil in the product, which does give it an odor, but it&#x27;s better than a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell. The sunscreen is a greyish/oatmeal color and makes my skin look lighter unless I only put a very thin layer on. Even then, I still have to wash my hands after applying because it leaves a lot of oil on my hands.</li>
    <li> We used this product on our 5 month old and 4 year old grandchildren they each had an ugly rash after applying the product. These are VERY fair skinned children. Discontinued it&#x27;s use and went back to regular sunscreen which didn&#x27;t cause any rash on either child.</li>
    <li> Loving Naturals is at the top of the charts [...] for UVB &amp; UVA protection/balance, sunscreen stability, environmental responsibility, and safety. My own experience, as a gardener in the sun for up to 4 hrs. a day, is that it DOES prevent sunburn and does NOT run in my eyes when I sweat! The only downside I would mention is that the zinc oxide stays chalky-looking, even with vigorous rubbing. That&#x27;s fine for me working in the privacy of my own acreage; it may be a consideration for those wearing it in public. A little (plant-based) coloring in the formula would be an improvement. But this sunscreen is good for all that really matters--protection from the dangers of sunburn without any risk to the environment or personal health.</li>
    <li> This was my first \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreen, and I&#x27;ve since realized there are better options out there.  Although it claims to not be greasy, it is really greasy.  It makes my skin super shiny, requiring a lot of powder.    The other complaint I think a lot of people have is the whiteness.  I rubbed it in a lot and you could still tell it was on, although it wasn&#x27;t clown-like.  It was hard to notice in natural and incandescent light, but more prominent in fluorescent.  I found that dusting my face with tinted powder did away with this concern for the most part.      I can&#x27;t comment on its efficacy in preventing sunburn, which I realize is the main reason most people probably use it.  I use it for walking to class and running errands, which normally wouldn&#x27;t cause sunburn anyway, so I&#x27;m probably only outside for a few hours in small chunks each day.  I don&#x27;t know how this would fare at the beach all day, but if I find out either way, I&#x27;ll update the review.    If you use this, I&#x27;d recommend tinted powder to get rid of shininess and/or whiteness.  However, I think the only reason to buy this is the price - there are other natural sunscreens out there that look and feel way better - specifically I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B002ES6Z0K Baby Sweet Kisses Sun&#x27;n&#x27;Fun Organic Baby Sunscreen SPF 30+, with Antioxidants, Marshmallow and Chocolate]] or [[ASIN:B003RKIGWY Sun&#x27;n&#x27;Berry Fun Organic Baby Sunscreen SPF 50+, with Antioxidants &amp; Superberries 3.5oz]].  While they&#x27;re definitely more expensive, they also don&#x27;t feel greasy, don&#x27;t leave you white, and smell great.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, especially since I spent a couple hours reading reviews of all sorts of sunscreens and finally chose this one.  Big mistake.  Yes, I shook the bottle thoroughly, as one reviewer advised.  Yes, I massaged it into the skin (which makes me wonder how good can it be to rub your face for several minutes, trying to get something to absorb).  It has a nice smell, but the greasiness was just way beyond anything I&#x27;ve ever encountered in a product meant for the skin.  I won&#x27;t go into the details of how the greasiness got onto my hair,  my clothes, and everything else this sunscreen came into secondhand contact with, but for the first time in my life I&#x27;m writing a critical review to save someone else the trouble of dealing with this mess.  By the way, I have normal skin, in case that makes a difference to anyone reading this and trying to decide whether to buy or not.  I&#x27;m going back to Healthy Defense by Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I wanted a zinc based sunscreen for active children. This is not the one.  Very greasy, looks like Kabuki makeup. Applied every two hours as directed but that did not prevent sunburn.  If it was cost effective to do so, I would return it.  Solbar is infinitely better.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take on a trip to Costa Rica.  it is thicker than regular sunscreens, so you don&#x27;t have to put too much on, just make sure you rub it in good, a little goes a long way.  Other sunscreens leave me felling oily, this does not.  I used the spf 30 on the beach and i applied only once, it stayed on.  i was on the beach for about 4 hours and i did get a little red, however my husband who used a regular sunscreen at SPF 55 ended up much more red and slightly burned.  it stayed on so well that after the beach in the shower i had to rinse and rerinse with soap and water to get it all off.  i will buy again.</li>
    <li> I loved that it was very natural and had no harmful substances.  However, when I put it on I looked white as a ghost.  I rubbed and rubbed until it hurt and I was still white from it.  I reapplied every two hours (or right after swimming) and still got a mild burn.  I guess it is ok for use in your own back yard where no one can see you but if you are on vacation you might get some weird looks.</li>
    <li> A little bit thick so I get my hands wet before I rub it on. It also lasts longer if you wet your hands. I haven&#x27;t noticed less sun protection by diluting it. I am so glad there are people who make this kind of stuff!</li>
    <li> Sticky, greasy, blotchy, thick, inconvenient to put on, smells like peanut butter and makes me look like a geisha, leaves semi-permanent white marks on my bathing suit.  But it does protect from sunburn.  Can&#x27;t tell weather it&#x27;s being kind to my endocrine system or not, but I hope it is.</li>
    <li> This natural mineral sunscreen has everything I was looking for: natural &amp; safe, can be used on baby and on faces, water resistant, and good reviews! So I ordered 3 bottles for our beach vacation. It worked well to protect us from sunburn (including 6 month old baby), but it felt so nasty on my skin that it actually hindered my enjoyment of our vacation. All day I could not wait to shower it off and each morning I dreaded putting this sticky paste all over everyone in our family. It is also time consuming to apply and care must be taken to cover all exposed skin since it is so sticky and kinda thick. Also, it is not easy to wash out if any gets in your hair and it makes your hair feel even worse than your skin. It leaves a whitish film and an uncomfortable pastey feeling on skin.</li>
    <li> I did not get a sunburn wherever I applied this lotion.  When I rolled up my capri pant legs and forgot to put on lotion, my skin was red as a tomato in one hour.  My grandniece did not want to use it because she said it left a white film.  Also, I did not get any fever blisters on my lips when using the stick.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I had several different outcomes with this product. I read up on a lot of Safer? sunscreens and somewhat knew what to expect. I first tried it in small sections on my shoulder so see how well it rubbed in and reacted to sweating. The first time it didn&#x27;t seem to rub in that well and once I started sweating it came back to the suface. Once on the surface it was easilly rubbed off either accidentally or on purpose. The second time I did the same thing and it seemed to absorb better. I always let it absorb for about 30 minutes. Still unsure I tried it out on vacation. The firs time I tried putting it on my entire body was frustrating. It didn&#x27;t absorb well in many spots. My shoulders and back seemed to absorb better than other areas. My forarms and especially my face were ghosty white. no matter how much rubbing it wouldn&#x27;t go in. Sometimes some of the oils seemed to start comming out on my skin. The next time I tried applying it overall I made sure I showered first to dry my skin out (which isn&#x27;t difficult for me) in hopes that it would absorb better. It seemed to but once I got in the water it came right back to the surface. It was difficult not to leave my white marks from the sunscreen wherever I was. It did seem to stay on during some water contact but any physical touch would wipe it off. So, as long as nothing touched me and I didn&#x27;t touch myself when the product came to the surface of my skin it was effective. I used it once more back at home working outside. With heavy perspiration and mosquitoes and biting flies to contest with I ended up getting a splochy sunburn on my back where I inadvertently wiped the product off my skin. This seemed to be the safest product on the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen review for the best price but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t matter how safe it is if it doesn&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;ve ordered some blue lizzard, which is extremely tough to come by even on-line, since it seems to be quite safe and a little more of a traditionaly sunscreen without as many nasty&#x27;s as all of the other big manufactures.</li>
    <li> We used this product in the Caribbean for 3 weeks and it made a believer out of my skeptical husband!  It worked so well - THANK YOU for making it!  I am a firm believer in allowing my kids ample Vit D time in the sun, but when I absolutely needed sunscreen, it was awesome to use a product I knew was good for my kids.     I bought two bottles - would refrigeration extend the shelf life?</li>
    <li> As a mother of four, I&#x27;ve purchased and slathered many, many sunscreens. Sprays, lotions, pumps, etc.  After reading articles this summer about chemicals in sunscreens, I became concerned and wanted to try the safer options.  Loving Naturals was on the list of the the best products. My youngest is 2 and very fair. I applied this to him and sent him into the baby pool. It does leave a slight visible film but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. After about 30  minutes, I could see the water beading on him so you know it&#x27;s still on. We stayed out for about 2 hours and did not reapply.  He had no redness at all! Very impressive! With the sprays and traditional lotions, I would have had to reapply at least every hour and he would still have had a pinkness to him.  My girls who are 8 and 10, don&#x27;t like the smell of it. One of them burns so badly that I made her use it anyway. After using it and coming home with intact unburned skin, she decided to tolerate the smell. I just have her use something else on her face.  We&#x27;ve been using it all summer and the bottle is almost gone.  I balked at the price but the bottle has last as long as we&#x27;ve needed it.  Would absolutely recommend and repurchase.</li>
    <li> My kids hate this sunscreen. It smells awful. It goes on like a thick paste and doesn&#x27;t rub in. Will not buy this sunscreen even if it has a very low toxicity level. There are many other safe brands that we have used that are far better in every way.  [...]</li>
    <li> As a California Baby and Badger sunscreen user, I have to rate this a 2. The ingredient list was great (hence the 2 stars) and the price seemed better than some, so I gave this a try. I used it once but did not like the texture or smell at all. It was gummy/pasty so I tried to shake it to mix it up but that didn&#x27;t work. Maybe it was just me or I am used to the other two we use, but I didn&#x27;t use it again and ended up throwing it out. :( I really wanted to like it!</li>
    <li> This is the best all natural sun screen. I LOVE it. I love how you can spread it on smooth- unlike the badger which I had a heck of a time smoothing on. It is zinc oxide so yes leaves a white residue but seriously, this is the best- LOVE Loving Naturals stuff!!!</li>
    <li> This sun screen simply does not work. My wife was in the sun for 3 hours today, applied it twice during that time and she ended up burnt. Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is not greasy, or smelly, or full of crap that no one needs all over the largest organ of their bodies (their skin). I love it especially for my 11 month old daughter. It works wonderfully and I can feel secure knowing that her skin is not absorbiing a bunch of chemicals.     I put Water Babies on her once and she broke out into a head to toe rash. I felt terrible. With this sunscreen that has never happend!</li>
    <li> Despite the fact that the label states \\&quot;non-greasy,\\&quot; this product is very greasy.  It is like putting Crisco on your face.  Unless you have extremely dry skin, you will not like this product.  I bought it from the Absolute Yogi website and would have returned it but returning it would have cost me as much as the product cost.</li>
    <li> This is a great natural sunscreen, I am working on my first bottle and love it so far.  It isn&#x27;t quite beach weather yet, but so far no burns and no allergic breakouts on any of my children which is a miracle as they all have sensitive skin!  A little does go a long way! A warning to those who are not familiar with products that are of natural origins: this does not smell like perfume(which is a good thing) and it does go on whiter than commercial brands, but once it is rubbed in you hardly notice...if that is the trade off for going all natural, I find it is well worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I recently switched to all natural, toxic free cosmetics (and everything else!) and this sunscreen is a wonderful addition for sun protection.  I used it for the first time in Florida when the temperatures were in the 90s each day (at a local theme park).  My husband and I both applied it before leaving each morning and we returned each night (yes, only applied ONCE!) without any sunburns.  My husband always burns too, so this product is amazing!  It does leave your skin a little white/grayish but this fades as you rub it in more.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, so you don&#x27;t walk smelling like a coconut all day!  I would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in a natural, non toxic sunscreen.   Just do a little research on the chemicals in commercial sunscreens...you won&#x27;t be sorry you switched!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is by far the best I have found that is safe and effective.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product, especially after seeing some of the reviews on here. I&#x27;m sad to say that this stuff is terrible. I have used chemical free sunblocks for a few years now and this has to be the worst. It is super greasy in spite of its claims to be otherwise. It seems like it never dries or absorbs into the skin. Anytime we use it it ends up on everything- furniture, clothes, car seat. I have yet to figure out how to get it to actually stay on our skin. Also, I know natural sunscreens have a tendency to leave a bit of a white sheen, but this makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing clown make-up. I will definitely not be buying this product again and wish I would have stuck to Badger or California Baby.</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is SO important ESPECIALLY for babies and children! Why buy generic sunscreen that has a bunch of chemicals in it when you can get something natural and organic! What you put on your babies skin is so important! This is a great sunscreen for all ages with NO chemicals!!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s not smelly and is easy to apply (aside from reeling in a wriggling baby ;-) ).  It works great.  We tried it out in Ohio when  it was in the upper 80&#x27;s and very sunny.  My husband actually burned himself the day before and we all used it after that and my daughter and I stayed burn-free and my husband was able to return to the sun.  We have now returned to our home in Sweden (which has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world due to so many people not protecting themselves in the sun) and are confident our daughter will be protected when wearing loving naturals out in the sun.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because it was one of the cheaper sunscreens that were rated really well by the EWG, however it is still the most expensive sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I bought it to use exclusively on my infant son because it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other sunscreens do.  After using it for a few weeks, my son has not gotten burnt and is developing a little bit of a tan (however we are never in the sun for more then 1-1.5 hours at a time).  It goes on well, but leaves a visible white tint to his skin.  It smells like sesame or sunflower oil, not bad, but definitely different.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase, but I may still keep looking for something a little less expensive for my son.</li>
    <li> It seems to work. I haven&#x27;t really used it out in sun for long term use.  The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it can leave a white residue. It also smells wierd, but its not a strong odor.  However, I&#x27;d buy it again. I&#x27;d perfer something more natural vs. your typical chemical-based sunscreen and this is completely made of natural products.</li>
    <li> Before I had children, I never gave much thought to what was in the sunscreen I used.  I figured as long as I was using something I was fine, right?  So wrong.  After the recent EWG 2010 Sunscreen Guidelines came out, I was shocked to find out there are HUGE differences in various sunscreens types (physical block vs. chemical block) and in the ingredients.    I don&#x27;t exactly remember how I stumbled upon Loving Naturals, but I am so glad that I did!  I visited their website was so pleased to hear that they research all of their ingredients, they use no animal testing or by-products, and that it is a small company started by parents just like me.    Needless to say, I ordered both their sunscreen and their natural bug repellant and had pretty high expectations.  As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a pleasant smell to the sunscreen.  Kind of like peanut butter cookies.  (In fact, our dog tried to lick my son head to toe after the first application!)  The only downside to the nut oils in the product is that my son can&#x27;t wear it when he plays with a friend of his who has pretty severe nut allergies.    The lotion is a bit thinner than expected and can get pretty messy when trying to apply to a squirmy toddler (who wants to do it himself of course), but it rubs in quickyl and easily.  As with all physical (non chemical) sunblocks, there is a thin whitish film that it left behind.  Frankly, that&#x27;s the trade-off for not putting harmful hormone-like chemicals all over your body&#x27;s largest organ.  At any rate, the white does fade over several hours, which I thought meant that the sunscreen had worn off, but neither myself nor my 3 year old have ever gotten a sunburn within hours of application (and we&#x27;re pretty fair people).    I have since tried several other brands of all natural, physical (zinc oxide) sunscreens and did not like them nearly as well as the Loving Naturals.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more for the rest of the summer!    PS -- Their all natural bugrepellant is fabulous as well!  It has a pleasant smell and really does work.  I am still amazed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m love this sunblock! It is one of the highest rated on the skin deep website for the safest, which is really important to me. My family and I are in the sun alot and have tried many sunblocks this one is not too oilly and has a really nice scent. It does leave a white tint, but I find that helpful when applying to make sure I didn&#x27;t miss anything. My oldest son has sensitive skin and has broken out in a rash with all children&#x27;s sunblocks that I&#x27;ve tried. He doesn&#x27;t break out in a rash with this one! This is sunblock that we can all use, as well as feel safe doing it!</li>
    <li> I saw this had good reviews over the other low rated natural sunscreen on EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide.  It was rated 1, which was the lowest rating that I saw for a sunscreen. I was able to find a   5oz bottle for $9 online.  It works great on my kids. It actually has a watery consistency compared   with other sunscreens, so application is easy. My kids have had no problems with it, and have had no burns.  I think it is a great product and would highly recommend it. My friend bought Badger but  she did not like it, it was too sticky and her kids got burned.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen DOES hold up in the water. That was my biggest concern when trying this sunscreen, but it worked better than conventional (toxic laden) sunscreens that claim to be waterproof! The other big plus is that it is gentle on the skin (did not cause burning sensation on my little nieces sensitive faces). It quickly became the popular sunscreen that all 11 cousins were using on our family vacation to the lake this summer. It was the ONLY sunscreen that kept the kids from sun-burning, stayed on great in the water, and kept their faces from hurting upon application. It can leave you a bit whitish if you put a lot on, but what a small price to pay for a sunscreen that is so effective and non toxic. It is even safe for babies! Thank you Loving Naturals! Also, it is not greasy and it has a great nut smell.</li>
    <li> Loving Naturals is too white for me to use under most circumstances.  If you really rub it in and spread it thin you will only be a whiter shade of pale.  I&#x27;ll wear it for a mountain bike ride, but not where I&#x27;m really going to be around people. It is easier to spread and not as white as Think Baby, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this one again.</li>
    <li> The zinc oxide leaves you very white, but is also effective.    I tried this after reading about the toxicity of chemicals in other sun screens.  I may get a little pinker from lower UVB protection, but supposedly I&#x27;m better protected from the long term damage of UVA...    The original price had to be inflated ($40, really?) but sale price of $10 was reasonable even for smaller bottles of sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Ive researched alot on sunscreen and I found this to be nice stuff and reasonably priced as far as mineral sunscreen goes.  It was not near as thick as far as other mineral sunscreens.  It went on fairly well and had a nutty scent.  Not the best scent in the world but not bad.  My kids did not mind it.  We bought it for a trip to Hawaii.  I have red heads and it did a pretty good job keeping them protected.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this sunscreen and highly recommend it.  It works better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.  And, it&#x27;s safe and natural - I&#x27;m not putting toxics or chemicals on my skin to be absorbed into my body.  It last a long time, it&#x27;s mild, and not greasy.  Excellent product!  A litle goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> Now that I have a baby I think twice about everything I use, especially everything I buy for him.  I couldn&#x27;t believe all the toxins in regular sunscreen!  When I found this I knew I needed to try it.  We haven&#x27;t been to the beach yet (the ultimate test in my opinion) but he&#x27;s been outside plenty and we&#x27;ve had great results.  I don&#x27;t like perfumed things so I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all.  Actually I think it is rather pleasant.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I use Loving Naturals for my face and the cheaper brands on my body. Both have approx 24% zinc oxide for sun protection. This was rated #1 on Environmental Work Group&#x27;s [...] for sun protection and low toxicity. I rate this product highly because it smells really nice and leaves little white residue, altho you need to rub it in. I have also tried Heiko Kids SPF 40 which smells mediciney and is really hard to spread but is cheaper and the container isn&#x27;t as cheap.</li>
    <li> Nice product so far.  I hope it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.  Time will tell.</li>
    <li> I read about this sunscreen in the EWG sunscreen review. I had decided to throw all of my other sunscreens away and start from scratch, so I ordered several different brands from the EWG top ten. This is the one I like the best. I must say, I do not care how white I look in the sun - I am only interested in the UV protection. This one definitely looks white, and while you can rub some of it in, my skin still looks light colored. This sunscreen definitely protected me. We were at the pool all afternoon, and I had no red afterwards - and I have very fair skin. I did re-apply twice. The thing I REALLY liked is that I did not have the urge to get in the shower and wash this sunscreen off. Usually I hate the way sunscreens feel and smell, and especially hate how they taste if I happen to get any in m my mouth. This one was just lovely - the natural oils just absorbed into my skin as the evening went on, and I did not feel bad going to bed with the sunscreen still on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of sunscreens with multiple strange chemicals that make me feel so nasty I&#x27;d rather be burned.  Luckily, I found Loving Naturals which not only works brilliantly but feels better on my skin than a massage from a supermodel...ha!  The customer service from Loving Naturals is spectacular, the product amazing, and I feel great knowing my family is using the best.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  It goes on smooth and really protects.  My daughter is a very fair skinned and fair haired little girl who needs sunscreen whenever we leave the house to go out into the sun.  This product works great without being too greasy and does it all for a great price. It goes on a little white which helps you see where you are applying and which areas could use a little more attention, but quickly absorbs and leaves no white behind. It also doesn&#x27;t contain all of those nasty chemicals that all those other sunscreens contain. This is definitely going to be the sunscreen that I send all of my friends and family to use.  I have been trying to get many of them to switch to a more natural sunscreen, but the prices always turned them off.  This is the best of both worlds...great prices for a GREAT product.  Check out the cosmetics database and you will see why you should use this sunscreen.  It is the only sunscreen we will keep in our house in the future.  Works great for kids and adults alike!!</li>
    <li> Throw out your chemically overloaded sunscreen!  Save yourself from having those yucky chemicals absorbed into your skin (if you can&#x27;t eat it, why would you lather it on your skin?).    Recent studies have shown potential cancer connections between chemically created sunscreens.  Check out [...]  Type in some of the ingredients found in \\&quot;off the shelf\\&quot; sunscreen.  For example, oxybenzone (found in many sunscreens, including BABY sunscreens).  Yikes!!    See how well Loving Naturals is rated at:  [...]    Loving Naturals uses NON-NANO zinc oxide, which is way better than most other sunscreen products on the market.  You can read more about Non-nano particles on their website too.    used this sunscreen while on vacation in Hawaii (no sunburn..yay!).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to cut out some of the chemicals in my families lives and decided after reading reviews to give this sunscreen a try. We love it! It&#x27;s so nice to know it&#x27;s not packed full of dangerous chemicals. You only need a tiny bit to cover a descent sized area too. I wish it was a little less expensive but you do really get what you pay for sometimes!</li>
    <li> Purchased this due to it&#x27;s rating on cosmeticdatabase.com, and the reviews here that said it wasn&#x27;t greasy. HOW is it not greasy? It was SO greasy that it didn&#x27;t soak in for a good 4 hours. It left a VERY white film that actually sorfot pooled in the creases of my arms. Disgusting. And the smell! It smells like clay! The baby I nanny for uses California Baby.. I&#x27;ll be using that for myself from now on.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it was recommended on [...] as one of the safest (yet effective) sunscreens out there. It does leave a white residue and takes a bit to get absorbed in the skin so you have to apply it at least 30 minutes before going out.</li>
    <li> After the birth of my son I started looking for an all-natural version of sunscreen, and decided to give Loving Naturals a try based on all the favorable reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did: now my entire family uses it! I love the fact that I can pronounce all ingredients, the sunscreen feels light and not sticky. It smells good, too! And it&#x27;s safe for my baby!! We&#x27;ll be using this for years to come :)</li>
    <li> MY SHORT ADVICE:  BUY THIS!!  YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!!  Want to know why?  Here you go:  My family of seven goes through lots of sunscreen -- especially during summer.  I&#x27;ve been using Badger brand but only because I hadn&#x27;t found anything else yet.  Badger was thick, weird smell, turned my skin really white, and very pricey.  Yes, they have lots of good reviews, but I tell you ignore them.  Loving Naturals is far superior!!  I LOVE THIS STUFF!!  I stumbled upon Loving Naturals on Amazon, price was great, and EWG ratings were excellent.  I bought it, anxiously waited for my UPS guy to arrive, tore open the package, and squeezed some out.  Bad idea.  Texas summer heat + late evening delivery &#x3D; very hot &amp; liquidy sunscreen.  I had to wait until the next day to try it, but so worth it!!  It is thinner consistency, but makes it easier to rub in. I expected to turn a pasty white since it has almost 25% zinc oxide, but surprisingly the tinge was slight, barely noticeable (but I&#x27;m pale already), &amp; soaked in after about 15 minutes.  Smells little bit like almond cookies, peanut butter, shortbread.  Hard to describe.  Best part is the stuff works &amp; my skin doesn&#x27;t burn -- as in no sunburn and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin feel like it&#x27;s on fire when it&#x27;s applied. After a week of using, I ordered another bottle.  My family usually fusses at me for \\&quot;going natural,\\&quot; but they actually like this stuff.  So, I&#x27;m back to order another two bottles.  When I purchased my first bottle, there were hardly any reviews.  The price was very good for natural product &amp; looks like the news got out.  There are over 100 reviews as I write mine.  So happy about that because I want others to buy this &amp; keep this company around for a long time!  BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> What a great product, I found this product on [...] I was looking for something natural for my 1 year old. It got great ratings on the cosmetics data base so I decided to try it. This sunscreen lived up to its reviews .. I love it! Not only does my little daughter us it but now the whole family does too! So thankful for loving naturals. -yes it dose make you a little pale.. but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> My 2 year old seems to be allergic to other sunscreens. He gets big red sploches all over his face and his eyes swell up if we used it. Our pediatrician told us to keep trying different brands until we found one that worked and hopefully he will grow out of it eventually. We tried 8 other brands with no luck over about a year span. Then we tried Loving Naturals. IT WORKED. No reactions, no sunburn! It was a real lifesaver for us. The lotion is very white, and doesn&#x27;t rub in easily leaving him looking a little pale. But it is so worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I ordered this all natural sunscreen.  It doesn&#x27;t have any of the products which are said to cause cancer (which most sunscreens do have) which is why I bought it.  It has a great texture and great coverage for my kids.</li>
    <li> Pros: Exellent rating from EWG&#x27;s sunscreen guide, good ingredients, subtle smell.  Cons: Gritty, does not absorb well.     Unfortunately, the grittiness trumps all of the positive qualities of this sunscreen - I just can&#x27;t fathom putting this on again and subjecting my skin to what feels like a sunscreen made of fine sand. A pity, because I really wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> Very good sunscreen for all over body, but i don&#x27;t reccommend this product on darker skin tones like my brother..he tried some on and it left white residue on his skin, but i am light skin so its okay it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or anything and its natural ^^.</li>
    <li> I ordered this sunscreen based on EWG reviews and safety concerns. When applied it goes on thick, white and paste-like. It stayed on so well it took 2 days and 4 baths to feel clean again. Strange odor as well. Will not buy again!</li>
    <li> I am currently really enjoying this product. I love knowing that this is coming from a family run business. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Best of the top sunscreens on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s sunscreen test list.  No question.    Check the feedback for the other top-ranked sunscreens.  This stuff is not super oily (unlike most of the others).  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad (unlike most of the others).  It actually rubs in completely (without excessive effort) so you don&#x27;t look like a ghost and get white junk all over your clothes (unlike most of the others).  It doesn&#x27;t use nano-particles (unlike many of the others).    And, unlike many of the others, it&#x27;s available in semi-reasonable quantities (5 oz, here) and for less-absurd pricing. (Unlike most of the others.)    Check for yourself and see.  I&#x27;m completely sold, personally.</li>
    <li> This product gives you great sunscreen protection without the concern of toxic ingredients.  It goes on a little thick at first, but seems to absorb well after a few minutes without a greasy residue.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it can leave a whitish tint on your skin from the Zinc Oxide.  It&#x27;s only a faint tint, however.  It could be that I am not rubbing it into my skin efficiently enough, due to arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews here, I ordered two bottles.  I think it IS greasy and takes too long to rub in and then leaves a whitish coating on my skin.  I will keep this for the beach after I&#x27;m already in my swimsuit because it does get on your clothes very easily and that&#x27;s not very attractive.    I mainly purchased it because of the UVA protection but I think on my face I&#x27;ll use a high SPF baby sunscreen.  At least I don&#x27;t have to wait 30 minutes to put on makeup (which goes on top of the grease!!!)</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this sunscreen after reading reviews.  However, when we opened the bottle and applied it, it had a strange rancid nut oil smell.  If you read the list of ingredients, you will find there are indeed nut oils in this product.  Although it was easy to apply, it did also collect in creases and impart a white sheen.  We&#x27;re not fans of this product.  California Baby is so much nicer to use (and smells great, too).</li>
    <li> I managed to use this for about 3 months on my face and neck before I just realized, &#x27;I can&#x27;t do it anymore.&#x27;      The reason being it was causing these little bumps and blackheads on my cheeks and neck.  I noticed them at the very beginning of my use but since it was so expensive ([...] bucks when I bought it) and it had been so hard for me to find a safe and natural sunscreen to wear every day, the optimistic me said that maybe it would get better.  Well, 3 months later and the bumps seemed to be increasing.  I realized I had to do something when I neglected to put it on for a few days and my skin seemed to dramatically improve in texture.  Added to that the ashen white cast it leaves on your face (I dreaded putting it on for that white cast) and its oiliness, and I realized it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.    At the time I bought this I was searching for a natural sunscreen that was rated highly by the Cosmetic Database and spf 30 because I&#x27;ve seen that recommended.      I&#x27;ll keep using the Loving Naturals for the rest of my body, since I&#x27;ve had no problems with it on my arms, and it seemed to protect me adequately.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;m a mom I am much more aware of what I am putting on my body as well as my sons. When I read on the EWG&#x27;s website that some of the sunscreens I&#x27;ve been using may have actually been speeding up cancer - I was freaked out. Loving Naturals was rated very high on the EWG&#x27;s list of safe sunscreens so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. It&#x27;s definitely more expensive than that bottle of Coppertone I&#x27;ve been using, but totally worth the peace of mind. So far I really like it. It does take a little longer to apply since it has the zinc oxide and it&#x27;s pretty white but at least you know what areas are covered and what still needs to be! Definitely recommend this product - especially if you have children.</li>
    <li> We adopted a sensitive skin child, and each brand we have tried has sent her into extreme welts and hives...with 2 ER visits.  We tried this brand, after looking at the Deep Skin website.....we love it....it works &amp; no allergic reaction!!</li>
    <li> This product is probably very effective, and I certainly appreciate the all-natural attributes. But it goes on pasty white and stays that way; no amount of rubbing will make it blend into your skin, I and I have fair skin.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t smell particularly bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell particularly good, either.  Glad to have the protection, but I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
    <li> This is the worst sun screen lotion I have ever used. It is sticky. Not absorbed by the skin. It stained everything I came into contact with. And, it did not protect me or my husband from the sun at the beach. After using it twice (the second time only to corroborate my first impression) I threw away the remaining product. Will never, ever buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Not poisonous but not as effective at its intended purpose as some other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> My family has a history of skin cancer, so while I love to be in the sun, and have olive skin, I still have to be careful. This sunscreen is one of EWG&#x27;s top sunscreens, scoring a \\&quot;1\\&quot;, which is the best score. Also, ounce for ounce, it is one of the least inexpensive, and has all natural eco and animal friendly ingredients. If you want a sunscreen that truly does work and is not harmful, you will need a natural one that contains zinc oxide. Yes, this does turn your skin white, but I&#x27;ve found a simple way around that. When I use it on my face, I put a small amount of my regular facial moisturizer in my hand, and then an even smaller amount of Loving Naturals sunscreen in my hand, as a little goes a very long way. I then mix a small amount into my body lotion so I can use it all over, and mixing like this tends to take the whitish hue down quite a bit while I apply it, and then it fades away as it&#x27;s drying. It also helps spread the lotion out more evenly, as it is very thick and hard to spread by itself. It took an entire summer for me to go through this 5 ounce bottle using this method, and since I was working outdoors and at high altitude, that&#x27;s really saying a lot. I HIGHLY recommend this sunscreen, as well as this method.</li>
    <li> Found this to be one of a very small list of non toxic sunscreens. On the other hand it&#x27;s very effective. Only wish it came in a little bigger container.</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of this sunscreen (loving naturals), slathered my exposed skin with it, and spent much of the day in the sun.  Result: sun burn.  This product may be environmentally friendly but it seems to NOT do a very good job in protecting one from the damaging rays of the sun.  I recommend against purchasing or using this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen may be sensitive and be natural, but it takes a very long time to dry after application and leaves white stains on leather.  I would apply to my son about 20-30 min before we left the house and if he touched any leather furniture or the leather in my car, there would be a white stain on it.  I have a whole bottle, so instead of throwing it away, I use another sunscreen to apply before leaving the house and then use this for reapplication when we are at the park or beach and not going back in the car for a couple of hours.  By then it is usually dry enough to not leave any marks.  I found other natural sunscreens that dry in a couple of minutes and provide protection without ruining my leather.</li>
    <li> An excellent product with great non-nano ingredients. You know it is a great product when your 3 year old wants to put it on by themself, and they want to eat the Coco butter!</li>
    <li> If you have a lot of time to devote to sunscreening 3 kids and yourself then this stuff isn&#x27;t the absolute worst. It takes a very long time to rub in and even after rubbing in, everyone looks like a ghost. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the stuff since it works okay (not great) and my husband is already very patient with all my hippy purchases. So I instead spent more money on long sleeved swim tops and boy&#x27;s swim trunks for both the girls and boy. That way, all I need to do is rub into 3 faces and 6 bottom halves of legs. I got better at putting it on by dotting the sunscreen like chicken pox and then rubbing it in but I can&#x27;t wait till I&#x27;m done with the tube.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen at the start of the summer because my very fair skinned 3-year-old son tends to break out in rashes when regular sunscreen is applied.  It has far surpassed my expectations and is now the only sunscreen I keep in the house.  The summer is almost over and my little guy has not burned once.  We were even at the zoo for 5 hours on a very sunny day and reapplied once with no tan or burn.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried this sunscreen because it ranks #1 on EWG&#x27;s website. I was very pleased with it! I did need to shake it up before using it because the oils would separate, but it goes on smoothly, has a very mild nutty scent that I didn&#x27;t notice even after applying to my face. Works great in the sun and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing. I&#x27;m comfortable using this on everyone in my family. I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I decided to start using natural products so I bought this since it was #1 on the EWG site and there were so many glowing reviews.  I put this on my eight year old son today - he hated the smell but agreed to keep it on.  He came back from his baseball game red as a beet!  Good thing only his face and arms were exposed.  This junk is going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This product is quite odd.  It gets an A for effort- organic, earth and person friendly ingredients- but it it smells like sesame oil and has another quality similar to sesame oil...  it is super oily.  Neither my husband nor I can hug the kids after applying it unless we want oily spots on our clothes.  I can&#x27;t decide whether to love it or hate it (my husband falls into the latter camp).</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever put on our kids. It keeps them from burning without any of the harsh ingredients other sunscreens contain. A bottle really lasts a long time too! No fake scent, no greasy residue. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> In general, we like this product. My daughter, who has very pale skin, said it is the best sunblock ever. It is not very greasy, but you have to be careful not to put too much on any one place since it does leave your face/skin quite white if you do. We have not yet had it on for any extended period in the sun, so it is difficult to comment on its effectiveness against sunburn. However, we are hoping it will work well, particularly if we do not apply it thickly due to the \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; factor.</li>
    <li> After reviewing all of the current sunscreen information from [...] as well as the oxybenzone situation...we decided to try top rated Loving Naturals sunscreen on our 2.5 y/o and 9 month old kids.  We were so happy to see that 1) No sunburns at all and 2) the zinc oxide absorbed very well into the skin.  We were so happy we made this purchase and will continue to use this product from now on.</li>
    <li> I ordered both, sunscreen and insect repellant a little while ago, and like them a lot.  Both not only are made from  real natural ingredients, but also work very well.  I live in a tick friendly area, and my boys and I are outside creatures.... so far no ticks found on them...  My older child has a very sensitive skin, and he haven&#x27;t had any allergie to the sunscreen so far.    I just order more...</li>
    <li> I started looking for a CHEMICAL FREE, NO NANO PARTICLES, NO FRAGRANCE SUNSCREEN for the beach and extended walking about 5 years ago. I used the information on [...] (evironmental working group)as a guide. Back then, only a few sunscreens matched that criteria. Today there are many more. After reading many positive reviews,I randomly chose Loving Naturals and am VERY PLEASED with this product! I love that it&#x27;s ORGANIC. It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. The abundance of natural oils in this sunscreen ACTUALLY MOISTERIZES MY SKIN. The zinc oxide provides EXCELLENT PROTECTION and doesn&#x27;t move into my blood stream. I don&#x27;t use Loving Naturals on my FACE because I have a mild case of rosecea. Instead I use a very pure and simple,zinc oxide suncreen from Real Purity with a SPF 15 and wear a hat. THIS PRODUCT IS A BARGAIN FOR WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN! All in all, I feel very good and very smart about using Loving Naturals.</li>
    <li> Have to apply this frequently which is the only negative.   Works well-  thick zinc oxide base that protects against the sun.</li>
    <li> This product is garbage!  I used it once and threw it away.   It turns your skin white and instead of a normal sweat that you may have, you sweat in beads all over your skin.   This is a horrible product, don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!</li>
    <li> this product has been presented as a high quality sunscreen, and I think that it is ... but getting it on is not fun. It&#x27;s greasy and difficult to rub in. And then after you finally get it rubbed in, you still leave greasy marks where ever you touch.  Sorry ... I hope they can improve on this one with all the touting it gets.</li>
    <li> The smell is light, and pleasant.  The formula seems to be free of chemicals.  After using it for a few days, my daughter has not gotten burnt and is developing a little bit of a tan (however we are never in the sun for more then 1-1.5 hours at a time). It goes on well, but leaves a visible white tint to his skin. It smells like sesame or sunflower oil, not bad, but definitely different. Overall I am pleased with my purchase, but I may still keep looking for something a little less expensive for my daughter. I bought this sunscreen because it was one of the cheaper sunscreens that were rated really well by the rating measurement, however it is still the most expensive sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I bought it to use exclusively on my infant son because it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that other sunscreens do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of the top rated sunscreens on EWG, and this is my favorite.  It has a high zinc oxide content, spreads easily and stays on great.  It is also less expensive than most of those sunscreens.  It has a clay like scent, but the kids don&#x27;t complain about it too much.</li>
    <li> I got this since it was highly rated on Skin Deep (EWG rating 1) and was less expensive than many of the other top-rated sunscreens. I was hoping to use it on myself and my toddler. I am using it, but I don&#x27;t really like it. It&#x27;s very thin and sort of chalky. It doesn&#x27;t rub in or stick easily so it sort of sits on the skin all smeary for a while after application, which is a big problem with an active toddler (it rubs off on me, her clothes, and everything else). I really don&#x27;t care for the feel of it on my face, but I can imagine it&#x27;d be fine if you put foundation or minerals over it--I just don&#x27;t wear an all-over makeup so it feels yucky to me.    For my daughter I will be going back to California Baby (EWG rating 1) despite the hefty price tag. For myself I may try Badger (EWG rating 1) or go with something slightly less safe like Water Babies Sensitive (EWG rating 3).</li>
    <li> *Updated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Loving Natural Sunscreen is a much much better option than most sunscreen, but it is not the best option. I have high standards and I always buy products that use 100% natural ingredientes (and organic if possible). If you have standards like me then this is not the sunscreen for you, if you are more flexible then this sunscreen is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know why this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t meet my standards, here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It contains Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides:&lt;br /&gt;Caprylic Capric Triglycerides are produced by the esterification of glycerol (plant sugars) with mixtures of caprylic (C:8) and capric (C:10) fatty acids from coconut or palm kernel oils. [ingredientstodiefor(dot)com].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EWG - Skindeep Chemical Database: Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride is a mixed triester of glycerin and caprylic and capric acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides: A mixed triester derived from coconut oil and glycerin. [truthinaging(dot)com].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ingrediente is often mistaken for Fractionated Coconut Oil, which is in fact natural:&lt;br /&gt;Fractionated Coconut oil: is coconut oil that has been distilled to filter out and contain only the medium chain triglycerides of coconut oil. [aromaweb(dot)com].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this ingredient is not \\&quot;bad\\&quot; but it is not natural either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It contains Soy Wax&lt;br /&gt;Soy Wax is a hydrogenated form of soybean oil. Hydrogenation is not a natural process. For example the USDA Organic Program doesn&#x27;t allow hydrogenation because it is not considered natural [organicconsumers(dot)org].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the production of soy is really bad for the environment. Soy production has already destroyed 21 million hectares of forest in Brazil, and 80 million hectares, including portions of the Amazon basin. (worldinfo(dot)com). This sunscreen has no certification so I can&#x27;t be sure that the soy they use is sustainable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review in 2010, now in 2012, Loving Naturalhas change the formula: Ingredients: Active Ingredient: Non-Nano Zinc Oxide - 24.7% Ingredients: Grape Seed Oil, Organic Sunflower Oil, Caprylic/Capric Triglycerides (from Coconut Oil), Organic Beeswax, Stearic Acid (from Palm Oil), Organic Honey, Sea Salt, Purified Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t use Soy Wax anymore but use Stearic Acid instead. The process to obtain Stearic Acid uses hydrogenation. Plus I don&#x27;t buy any product that uses Palm Oil unless it has a certification that it is sustainable. This is because tropical forest are being destroyed to plant Palm. [wwf(dot)panda(dot)org]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first wrote my review I send and email to Loving Naturals asking about the use of not so natural ingredientes and claiming they were \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. They never answered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still want to use this sunscreen:&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a white film unless you have fair skin. I have fair skin so it wasn&#x27;t a problem for me (my face was white but just a little). My husband has a more olive skin, and this sunscreen left his face totally white. He used it once and never again.&lt;br /&gt;It does protect, I used it a couple of time and no sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use Badger Sunscreen and I really really like it, totally natural, most ingredients are organic, it doesn&#x27;t leave a white film (husband approved) and it protects really good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell but that is ok (you can read my review).</li>
    <li> This is a good product. It helps protect you from UV rays and helps keep chemicals out of your body and the environment.  It is really hard to rub in and will leave your face white, but I do not really care about my image so this did not bother me that much.  It did its job and that is all I can ask for! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> After doing quite a bit of research I bought this sunscreen as an alternative to what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an AWFUL product.  It is very heavy and thick, goes on like zinc oxide.  I always put sunscreen on a minimum of half an hour before going outside.  This product leaves a white layer on your face no matter how you try to rub it in.  last time I was gone 3 hours, and when I got home and looked in the mirror I could still clearly see the white \\&quot;mask\\&quot; it left on my face and hands.  It is also thick enough to be unwearable in the humid weather here in Missouri.  I will use up what I have on my hands and return to other sunscreens which feel more breathable.  I have tried many sunscreens over this years and this rates among the worst as far as texture, breathability and plain thickness.  I am sure it blocks the sun but too unconfortable for my use.  Although I need the protection, not enough to use this one.  What a shame - I really wanted to support this company.</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was given a 1 on EWG site. Well its very oily and white and hard to rub in which I expected. Last year I used Jason Naturals Earths Best baby and that was hard to rub in but it was way better than this gunk. Plus it didn&#x27;t even keep my kids from burning and they were outside for an hour. I&#x27;m going to look for another sunscreen for this summer.</li>
    <li> I tried this sunscreen after reading an article about the dangers of chemicals in a lot of sunscreens, and read good reviews on it.  However, I found it to be terrible!  When I put it on, it gives my skin a very pale lavendar tint, and wipes off on everything.  I used it out on our boat last weekend, and definitely burned, even with reapplying it, and I have not burned all summer (while using other sunscreens).  It kept wiping off on the seats of the boat, and would not rub in or absorb into the skin in a lot of places.  I used Badger sunscreen a month ago out on the boat and did not even get an ounce of color (buy Badger; it works infinitely better!).  Badger has a better consistency too - still thick, but not as oily and odd smelling as the Loving Naturals.  Also, when this bottle of sunscreen is left out in the heat, it turns incredibly runny and oily, which makes it very messy to try to reapply, since it just runs right out of the bottle.  As soon as I got home, I threw this in the trash!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was highly effective. After 5 days in the hot desert sun, I never burned and only had to reapply once a day. You can tell when you  out it on how fresh and natural the ingredients are. It smells like natural oils, and cocoa. It comes out looking white when you first apply it, but the color wears off pretty quickly. Did not block the pores on my face, I didnt break out at all. Very good stuff.</li>
    <li> Works great. Leaves a white protective sheen on the skin when applying that lasts. So its easy to be sure all areas are covered. Goes on thick so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it thus saving money. Best of all, its free from all the carcinogenic ingredients that most sunscreens contain, even the better known and pricier names.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> This has been a lifesaver for my entire family during the Florida beach this summer. My daughter stayed on the sun all day long with this sunscreen on and she was fine. I&#x27;m especially concerned about the ingredients in the sunscreen and try to stay \\&quot;organic\\&quot; as much as I can and this cream is definitelly what I look for in the products : mostly organic, non-nano (does not penetrate into bloodstream as much as nano-particles) Zinc oxide Active ingredient makes it a dream sunscreen!! 5 Oz is quite a long-lasting volume especially because it yields a lot of coverage in each doze. Great product, Loving Natural! Keep it up!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with high hopes that it would be the perfect sunscreen.. both to have little or no chemicals in it and also to prevent too much sun exposure.  I was wrong.  I am sunscreen crazy and read that this on was a #1 on the ewg sunscreen list as far as being very good mineral screen and no nasty chemicals..which maybe true but the pasty white goop would not ever rub into our skin and on top of looking like casper the ghost all day ...we all got sun burned.. and after 2 showers the product would not come off of my sun burnt skin.. total waste of money!!.. I am trying the badger sunsreen like I should have in the first place.. trying to save a dollar was in this case a huge waste of money...   Good luck  It does not deserve 1 star..but I had to mark at least one in order to write a review..</li>
    <li> I appreciate any organic type product but this one is a little too runny.  It also smells like vegetable oil and leaves a white residue on your face.  You have to rub the heck out of it to make it go away, which makes me worried about pimples to be honest.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen gives good, noticeable, topical coverage, but the feel is greasy long after application, and gets on clothing, such as sleeve cuffs.  I use it on my legs when I&#x27;m wearing shorts, so it won&#x27;t have contact with cloth, much.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work for me, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It sucks the moisture from my skin, smells like wax and clay - refuses to wash off with soap, after several latherings in the shower there were still grey streaks in places and short of rubbing the skin raw would not come off.  My feet put up with it, but looked like leather &amp; the rest of my body thought it was a moisture sucking layer of yuck. Seriously it feels weird.&lt;br /&gt;My husband also did not like it, same results - icky, smelly, won&#x27;t wash off and made pimples break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive, sure it&#x27;s natural but that doesn&#x27;t mean all ingredients will be tolerable by everyone and I highly suggest anyone do a test patch rather than layering it on thick. I had hopes for a safe sunscreen - safe for m, safe for the environment, and safe for the kids - I think not..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff because it is made with all natural organic ingredients plus it&#x27;s vegan!!!! I think it works pretty well considering I work outside all day on a farm and I always forget to reapply. Probably would work even better if I reapplied, but even so I still hardly get burned. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in anything bigger then a 5oz. Bottle because I have to put this stuff on my whole body everyday and it goes faster than if I was just using for regular outdoor activities.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been testing sunscreens for the past 6 months (total of 5 so far) and I would not buy this one again. I can&#x27;t attest to how it works as a sunblock, but is very greasy and does not smell good. I could live with it, but i am trying to find something for my college-aged sons to use and i don&#x27;t even dare give them this one to test. I would lose all credibility.</li>
    <li> Works very well at blocking uv rays. It does however leave a noticeable white film on the skin. No amount of rubbing it in will get rid of the white film. This is the normal for any natural sun block I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> ordered Dec first, received a few days later, item was manufactured on July 1st and expired on Jan 1.... so, when I got the product, it only had 1 month of life according to the expiration.    Would have given it fewer stars based on the somewhat dishonest selling of old product; but likely, the product (when not almost expired) is just fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it has less chemicals than most commercial brands and was less expensive than other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; alternatives. I like the concept of this product, it just does not rub onto skin well at all. It has no fragrance, so the smell is not exactly appealing, but it is not repulsive either. Of course, this can be expected of any natural product since fragrance equals chemicals. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not only was this sunscreen incredibly chalky and smelly -- it also contains a common allergen as one of its ingredients (nut oil). As someone with a severe nut allergy, I found the lack of information of a warning either in the product info on Amazon and on the packaging to be a grievous oversight on the part of the manufacturer; had I not removed the price tag to reread the full list of ingredients, I could have been in serious trouble (as it warm I broke out into hives after having it come in contact with my skin. Bottom Line - I will never purchase any item from the Loving Naturals line again.</li>
    <li> Super greasy, leave white mask on the face - people ask if I&#x27;m wearing clown make-up..   Feels terrible on the skin..Oil and actives are separated - small amount on the palm looks like a bird&#x27;s poop..  Unpleasant smell - made from the cheapest sunflower oil..  Such a nasty product!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a little less than a week, and it seems like a very good product. First I like it because it&#x27;s natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals, and so it won&#x27;t do harm on my skin. The whitening effect was not that serious, I feel normal after I applied it to my skin twice,and it&#x27;s very easy to rub in also. It&#x27;s a little bit oily though, I think because it contains natural essential oil, but it won&#x27;t let your skin squeeze more oil during the day. I feel moisturized soft on my skin.   The sun is not that harsh yet here, so I have to wait and see how it functions with the sunlight. Hope it works well. BTW, my skin is oily and acne prone, and the product didn&#x27;t make my acne worse or break out. I think I made a good choice on this one.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of looking for a sunscreen without chemicals, I considered Loving Naturals, but since it contains soy, I am concerned about rubbing the estrogens from the soy into my skin. Since soy can cause estrogen receptor breast cancer in post-menopausal women, thryoid problems, and other health problems,  I avoid eating soy in foods, so I don&#x27;t want to rub the soy in Loving Naturals into my system via my skin.  I read that more than half of organic skin creams that were tested for hormones, contained estrogens that WERE NOT LISTED on the label, so I make my own skin cream. I hope I can find a sunscreen without estrogens and without chemicals, otherwise I&#x27;ll have to make my own sunscreen also.</li>
    <li> [...]    This is quite remarkable, since the EWG only rated 8% of sunscreens as safe. Many sunscreens (especially the cheaper ones) don&#x27;t even work as well (as they don&#x27;t cover low-energy UV rays) and also contain retinyl palmitate, which is actually a possible carcinogen. This product doesn&#x27;t have these concerns.</li>
    <li> i like how spreadable this lotion is. easy to apply due to its thinner, less-viscous consistency. and it goes on completely clear. great for the whole body, but i&#x27;m afraid that i&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quickly... the thinner consistency means i&#x27;m using more for each application than i would with a thicker creme. which means that restocking it as our primary summer sublock could be too costly. overall, i just love how nontoxic this is.</li>
    <li> The scent is mild and unobtrusive. Reminds one of sesame seed oil /sunflower seed oil.  But no matter how much effort I put into rubbing it in,it adds a ghostly pink/white cast to my skin.  Therefore, I would not use it if \\&quot;going out\\&quot;, but only at home when gardening and doing lawn work.  Very thin and an initial greasy feel that does dissipate.  Love that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals, but going to find something else that works, is not harmful and I can wear in public.  Will use all of it as I hate to waste and it is a good product, but will not buy again.</li>
    <li> We purchased this before going on a cruise. I only had to apply in the morning and it lasted all day. Very impressed!!!</li>
    <li> Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen is a pretty great sunscreen. I can wear it with confidence in knowing I&#x27;m not slathering myself with a boatload of nasty chemicals in order to protect my skin from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays. The consistency is somewhat runny, but once you apply the sunscreen it leaves your skin feeling pretty dry unlike a lot of greasy name brand sunscreens. You DEFINITELY have to apply this more than once though if you are spending a day at the pool or beach. Every two hours or so you have to reapply, which is kind of a drag, but I&#x27;d rather do that than put tons of chemicals on my skin in other sunscreens. This is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> I have purchased dozens of products from Amazon, and this is only the second product  for which I felt compelled to write a review.    The stuff is oily, even when you \\&quot;shake\\&quot; the bottle,  It comes out like chalk, goes on like chalk, and looks like chalk.  It would be better to get sunburned than use this stuff.    Probably not worth shipping it back, but it is horrible.</li>
    <li> The long and short of it is, my kids slathered up with this stuff, spent an hour in the sun, and came home looking like lobsters.  They burnt worse using it than they would have with nothing on because it is so oily!  I don&#x27;t know why EWG endorses this product, it just plain doesn&#x27;t work.  Buy Badger, it works fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been out all weekend in the hot sun &amp; put some of this one, to my surprise I did not burn at all. It works great, smells something like almonds though. This lotion did leave my skin with a white film &amp; oily feeling. The oily part I just wiped at &amp; that went away. I&#x27;ve been using this on my face as well. It leaves my skin nice like a primer to where I don&#x27;t have to use too much makeup. A little bit for me goes a long way. I do enjoy this product, it works well even though the greasy feel &amp; white film stays on all day. I guess its worth looking a little pasty though.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product is so greasy and gross that I thought I would warn other people.  Product separates out so when you open the bottle to squirt it out, you get oil only and no sunscreen.  The product is too thick to shake and try to get the oil mixed back in.  Once on your skin it does not rub in so you look like a clown.  It is extemely heavy on your skin and does not allow your skin to breathe.  Whatever you touch with your body you leave a white grease trail behind.  Does wonders on leather couches and car interiors.  Clothes stick to your body from the heavy oily mess.    I&#x27;m a cheapskate and usually use whatever I buy rather than throwing it away, but not with this product.  Sorry for being so negative but thought you should know.  AVOID!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it for my body when I&#x27;m gonna be outside a while. It feels a little greasy when you put it on, but it goes away once it soaks in. It looks pasty white when you first apply it. After rubbing it in good though, it is not noticeable. I love this stuff because it does its job, yet it&#x27;s all natural so you can stop worrying about harmful ingredients. It&#x27;s actually good for your skin. I would definitely recommend to those of you who are health-conscious.</li>
    <li> As a new mother, I am always on the search for the safest products available. It is a fact that we absorb a very large amount of the products we put onto our skin and I am amazed at the ingredients found in childrens sunscreen!! Our children come into this world pure, and it is our job as parents to keep them that way. Question the products you feed, bath, and expose your little ones to!    After COUNTLESS hours of investigation on my part, non-micronized zinc oxide wins my vote. Do your research, and then chose Loving Naturals. You can not find a safer sunscreen on the market.                                          ~Breastfeeding, co-sleeping, organic feeding Momma to Jack Patrick.</li>
    <li> This is an effective sunscreen without scary ingredients. I feel comfortable using it on my toddler. Unlike many mineral sunscreens, it is not difficult to apply. It is more of a lotion than a pasty cream. Although it does leave a whitish sheen on the skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave you looking like a ghost.</li>
    <li> I suffered a deep abrasion on one arm . The skin is still healing and highly sensitive. The mild, organic ingredients in this product make me feel comfortable that I am not risking my health by exposure to chemicals while helping it by limiting my exposure to the sun. The lotion is not runny and goes on smoothly. There is a light odor that I find pleasant. I do not do so, but was told that you can minimize the whiteness by rubbing the product in more completely. It stays on well. My requests would be to make a stick version, higher SPF, and hopefully the price can come down as it gains popularity. Bonus points to the company for a good dispenser, not tested on animals, free shipping and being caring people you can contact.</li>
    <li> I was expecting something thicker like a lotion, but this is a thinner consistency. This is an advantage as it is easy to apply and absorbs well. I did not find it greasy, though it does contain a number of oils.     I am very fair and it leaves my skin looking a bit more pale, but I&#x27;ve found that adding just a tiny bit of my makeup foundation balances out the color. Frankly, I think it makes me look younger, as another reviewer pointed out.     (Edited on Dec 3. 2010: A little bit goes a long, long way! Start with a little bit, no bigger than a dime. Rub your hands together then rub onto your skin. If you need more, you can add it. I no longer add any makeup to balance the color. I use only the smallest amount and find that my skin looks great with no make-up - and not white! I find that the protection has not decreased.)    I suffer from acne and rosacea, am on a topical medicine that makes me more sensitive to the sun and my skin is naturally sensitive. Unlike other products, this doesn&#x27;t burn or sting and I am confident that my skin is protected. I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts or other problems.    The smell is yummy, a food/cookie type smell. It has a &#x27;Born On&#x27; date only 10 days before I placed my order. I really liked that it was fresh and hadn&#x27;t been sitting in a warehouse for months.     Excellent protection from the sun and unnecessary chemicals.</li>
    <li> Cap broke on the first day (which you never want to happen) and it was so hard to smooth on... especially if you are on the beach.  If you have any sand on your skin and try to rub this in, you are really just exfoliating your skin.  :)</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen (and paid a lot!) after reading that it was #1 rated by EWG.  My daughter was burned after spending very little time in the sun, despite a thick application.  The instructions to reapply every hour make this very hard to use -- who wants to reapply lotion 4 times during an afternoon at the park?</li>
    <li> Every so often you find a product that really makes your day and you want to scream about it from the rooftops. Well, I LOVE LOVING NATURALS SPF 30 SUNSCREEN!   My search for a natural sunscreen was brought on by my brand new baby. I had read about what harm conventional sunscreens cause and vowed to never put one on his precious skin. Since we were off to Spain to visit family I knew that I&#x27;d have to find a way to protect him (even though we weren&#x27;t going to intentionally place him in the sun). Luckily I found this product and after using it during our trip I am definitely a happy customer. Despite being under the hot Spanish sun my son (where you can easily burn underneath an umbrella) never experienced any discomfort. The sunscreen goes on easily and the rich oils used to make it feel good on the skin. I also like that it is unscented.  I WILL be recommending it to anyone I see using an unsafe sunscreen, especially on children.  [[ASIN:B002C0CZEU Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen Zinc Oxide 5 Oz. UVA/UVB Vegan]]</li>
    <li> We originally got this product for and used it during our trip to Disneyland in June, and we thought it worked really well.  The sunscreen goes on smoothly and creates a white sheen, as others have mentioned.  However it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of rubbing in to get rid of the whiteness.  Considering it&#x27;s almost 25% non-nano zinc, I think buyers should expect it to cause a white appearance and that it will take a little work to get it all rubed in (try others with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and you&#x27;ll find the same results).  You don&#x27;t need to use a ton of it, either, as it spreads really well.  This minimized the need for extra rubbing.  It smells a little chocolatey -- odd, but pleasant.  :)  Our only complaint would be that our older daughter said it smelled and felt greasy, which she didn&#x27;t like.  It definitely felt greasy (the reason for the 4 stars), but after about 5-10 minutes it seems to dry up.  None of us got a sunburn while using Loving Naturals, except when the user (me) forgot to put it on her neck/collarbone.  You could definitely tell where I hadn&#x27;t used the sunscreen!    We have since used it during pool time (3-5 p.m.) and playdates (10 a.m.-12 p.m.) and have had great results.  Of course, we do our best to reapply every couple of hours, which is what the directions tell you to do anyway!  We liked this sunscreen and have even ordered a second batch for more summer fun!!!</li>
    <li> When looking for a sunscreen for my newborn daughter, I noticed that lots of so called \\&quot;organic\\&quot; sunscreens had all kinds of horrible crap in them...some of it cancer causing (isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to avoid by using the sunscreen in the first place??) I found Loving Naturals on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and ordered it. I love it! My daughter, my husband and I all use it and it smells great and works wonderfully! I&#x27;m so excited to have found a product that I feel good about putting on myself and my family!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it very much. It seems it dries out the skin, leaves a white stain that is hard to remove and I even got a little burnt swimming for 50 min. even though I applied it 1/2 h before sun exposure and I was already tan. I live in the desert but still. I can live with it because it has good ingredients but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I have heard that Soleo Organics is a good product which doesn&#x27;t leave a white stain. I&#x27;ll try that next.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen in a effort to find a safe, effective, and reliable sunblock for my children.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  It isn&#x27;t heavily scented, goes on easily, works wonderfully (even on the most sensitive baby skin), is long lasting, and is all natural/non-toxic/free of chemicals.</li>
    <li> I have only used this sunscreen once and it seemed to work fine.  I will use it again, but my hesitation is it&#x27;s thick consistency and the slight white film it leaves on your skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! High level of sun protection without all the unnecessary chemicals. This is the only stuff I would use on my kids. Goes on easily and stays put. Used this on the beach in Florida and it stayed on perfectly, even in the water. I highly recommend this sunscreen over any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I picked this all organic sunscreen from a long list after I found out that my other sunscreens had oxybenzone, a chemical linked to cancer.  Really, I wanted to like this stuff. I bought 3 bottles of it, sight unseen.  Well, here&#x27;s what I found out:    1. When you first use it, only oil comes out.  The oil and oxide separates.  Even after shaking (who ever heard of having to shake a sunscreen?), it came out with variable consistency.  My left arm was much less white than my right arm.  2. So there you have it.  You turn white. My legs and arms turned white, even after a lot of rubbing, per the directions.  My face looked like a death mask.  3. The oil gets on everything, my glass table needs Windex and my dark glasses got so oily that I couldn&#x27;t rub it off using my cotton T-shirt.  That might be a safety issue.  4. Try getting it off when the day is over.  It takes a lot of soap and 3 times the normal shower time to get all the oil off your body.  5. It didn&#x27;t work very well.  My nose now looks like Rudolf&#x27;s and my arms and legs, though not burnt, are much darker color than normal.  6. It has a short shelf life.  It was manufactured 2 months before I received it and I have only 4 more months before it expires.  Two of my three bottles would get thrown in the trash by my wife, but I&#x27;m going to store them in the fridge like an organic oil until next summer.  $40 is $40.  7. It clogged my face pores and I got a pimple on the end of my nose.  That never happened with my other oxybenzone filled sunscreens.    Use it in good health, but know the shortcomings.</li>
    <li> This product is much thinner than other natural sunscreens, this makes rubbing the product into the skin much easier! I am going to try the face stick made by this company next time I order my sunscreen!</li>
    <li> My husband had been hearing bad things about sunscreens and asked me to do the research.  He is a surfer and depends on his sunscreen.  I did the research finding out that a lot of sunscreens have hormone disrupters in them.  The scale went from a #1 being the healthiest sunscreen to a #7 being the worst.  Loving Naturals was one of the #1 sunscreens.  I read all the reviews of all the #1 sunscreens and it seemed to me that Loving Naturals came out on top.  Consequently I ordered two 5 oz containers of it.  It rubs in very well.  When I tried it my husband thought I had make-up on but didn&#x27;t think I looked white like some natural sunscreens.  With a little mineral dust make-up on top I look totally normal.  One of his surfer buddies decided he wanted to get some too when my husband shared his on one of their surfing trips.  It is nice to have something that takes just a bit, rubs in well, and smells good.  There is no stinging sensation at all.  We are thrilled!</li>
    <li> The smell of this sunscreen is so awful and strong that it makes me want to puke! And I didn&#x27;t even apply much, only enough to cover my hands. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t use this during my beach vacation. What a waste of money.</li>
    <li> One of EWG&#x27;s top picks.  This sunscreen did the job, held up well when the kids were in the pool, spread well.  It had a nice light scent (not fragrance, just from the ingredients).</li>
    <li> I love the fact that this product contains some organic ingredients, is very effective, and all natural. Furthermore, for all its benefits, its price is so reasonable! Even though it makes my skin look whitish, i will still reorder it, because like someone else mentioned, just using a little of my mineral foundation over my face after the sunscreen takes care of the whitish look :)</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading the rather favorable online reviews. I specifically wanted a lotion that contained zinc to provide physical protection in addition to the chemical protections provided. My dermatologist also recommends a sunscreen containing zinc. Other zinc-based sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried have been more fluid, and I was able to rub them in, leaving little or no \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; look. This sunscreen is extremely thick, and even if applied in small quantities, it is hard to rub in to eliminate the white ghost look. It also has a somewhat objectionable earthy smell. Thus, I would recommend to those who buy this to mix it 50-50 with a non-zinc sunscreen to make it possible to have the product&#x27;s zinc protection, and to allow the user to rub it in better.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product because I am pregnant and was looking for a non-toxic sunscreen to use on vacation.  This sunscreen is pretty thick and you need to rub it in pretty well to avoid looking like a ghost.  That&#x27;s to be expected with a physical sunscreen, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of because it takes a lot longer to apply than the usual stuff you might buy.  Overall, this worked pretty well for me and I was happy to be using something that wouldn&#x27;t leach toxic chemicals into my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work for someone who has a lot of body hair.  I would think it would be very hard to rub down into the skin.</li>
    <li> Not wild about this sunscreen that I purchased in place of California Baby because of the price difference. It has a weird grey color and is a bit gritty. We found that our toddler&#x27;s skin was quite red after a short period of time compared to the CB sunscreen which lasts longer and offers better protection. If your child has sensitive pale skin like ours stick to a sunscreen like California Baby or Soleo.</li>
    <li> Wow, based on a lot of good reviews here, I had high hopes for this sunscreen!  However, it is EXTREMELY oily (the 1st &amp; 2nd ingredients are grapeseed oil and sunflower oil!), and the ratio of minerals to oil is small so that it is very runny and drippy coming out of the bottle and when trying to put it on.  Plus (and I know this is always a drawback with mineral sunscreens) it&#x27;s white colored on your skin and stays that way.  It was so greasy that it looked like I&#x27;d smeared my face in white butter after I put it on!  I realize that it&#x27;s all natural and that&#x27;s what some people are looking for, but as a sunscreen, this is lousy and would work better for frying food.</li>
    <li> This product was horrible!  I used it once and got burnt on my shoulders after being in the sun for about 30 minutes.  This is the worst sunscreen I have ever used and I am an avid suncreen wearer!  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t put this on my son- who knows how burnt his delicate baby skin would have gotten.  I purchased this on Amazon after reading all the great reviews and wanted a more natural sunscreen for my 6-month old, but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all!  Plus I found it to be rather sticky feeling.</li>
    <li> I have been using non-chemical sunscreens (zinc oxide or titanium oxide as the active ingredient) for several years, and this is my favorite of the half dozen brands I&#x27;ve tried.  Some of them are way too thick and some are made with the nano-size oxides, which are more likely to be absorbed through the skin.  This sunscreen is the best in terms of safety, effectiveness and ease of application.  It has the consistency of a lotion and goes on easily.  When I apply it to my face, it looks white at first, so I wait a couple of minutes, then rub it in a little bit and blot with a tissue before applying foundation.  It&#x27;s moisturizing without being greasy and does not cause my sensitive skin to react.  It has a subtle and pleasing scent, but there is no added fragrance.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that would do 3 things. First I wanted to be confident it had good UVA coverage. Second I wanted it to stop my family and myself from getting sun burn. Last I wanted to avoid putting potentially harmful chemicals on our skin and be able to apply the sunscreen without the eczema on my hands going red and sore. Loving Naturals Sunscreen did not disappoint! I found this product in the EWG list of top sunscreens and am happy with their results for UVA protection. We used it all last summer at beaches and parks and we only had one case of sunburn when I forgot to reapply it to myself after towel drying. That was my fault not the product. It is unrealistic to expect any sunblock to last all day while in and out of the water -- just reapply as needed. As for my hands, well this is the first effective sunblock that I have tried which does not irritate my eczema. That must be thanks to the natural ingredients. Yes it does go on white and for that I am grateful since I know I won&#x27;t miss a spot. Once it is rubbed in you just look a bit lighter and shiny from the oils -- you see lots of people like that in the summer and nobody said we looked odd. I am happy for us all to be one shade lighter for the benefits this product brings.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this product I was on my way out the door. I used it on my arms and rubbed and rubbed but I still had a whitish tint on my skin. I read such great reviews on this product, but now I am disappointed with the results. I need an all natural sun block and thought I did enough research. I actually went to a website that listed many brands of sunscreen. Gave reviews good and bad about each product. They highly recommended this one-but I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It rates a 1 on [...] which is GREAT and it works well. You look like a mime for awhile but it ultimately becomes practically transparent once you&#x27;re out in the sun. It&#x27;s easy to wash off and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Great stuff for the price!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this purchase. I wanted something both chemical and cruelty free, and this was perfect. I got a little red laying out at the beach despite reapplying liberally, but I think that&#x27;s to be expected of only SPF 30, so I&#x27;d say it held its own fairly well! And it&#x27;s worked perfectly during less intense exposures. I gave it four stars because of the slight difficulty I experienced trying to get the white streaks to disappear, but they&#x27;re pretty much par for the course with natural sunblocks, I guess, and they weren&#x27;t really as bad as I expected they&#x27;d be.</li>
    <li> This is always one of the highest rated on the EWG&#x27;s sunscreen list and it is quite effective. However, it&#x27;s greasier than other brands of similar products, so it&#x27;s hard to rub in at times and takes a while to absorb. I would recommend it but not for the summer time...In the winter, the extra oil can probably help moisturize the skin better. Good value though. This tube lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I found this on EWG&#x27;s website as the #1 recommended sunscreen, so I went ahead and ordered it online. I just received it and tried it on. The reviews I read online praised about how natural this product is, but none mentioned that it leaves a white residue. I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena&#x27;s Dry-touch sunscreen which made me break out, for this reason I ordered this all natural sunscreen. The only complaint I have is that it leaves a white residue which I had to cover up with make-up. Is there any other natural sunscreen that goes on without leaving a white residue?</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I need a daily sunscreen and wanted to get away from the chemicals in regular sunscreens. I chose this for that reason &amp; that it states it&#x27;s not greasy. I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the ingredients, it&#x27;s mostly oil. I don&#x27;t know how the product &amp; other reviewers can say it&#x27;s not greasy when it&#x27;s full of oil. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have already oily skin, but I just can&#x27;t use this. Maybe it would work better for people who have dry skin, but it made me feel like an oil slick.</li>
    <li> I hope that it deliver what it say it does. I just noticed that the area where I applied to my arm, got some tanning. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s ok or not (if it has sun blocking agent, that mean I should not get any tanning (supposedly) ). But I hope they are honest of they &#x27;re saying, since I don&#x27;t have any way to verify it</li>
    <li> This is a very appealing product and SMELLS so good I had to restrain myself from actually tasting a little! It doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume; it smells like, hmm, potato chips? If a sunblock looks fine on my arms, I then try it on my face. This one, unfortunately, looked pink/white on my arm, to the extent that I didn&#x27;t want to go outside with it on even once and washed it off instead. Given that, I&#x27;m not going to try it on my face and ergo this will not be the one for me, but if how it looks isn&#x27;t a consideration and you want to avoid slathering yourself or your child with chemicals, this could be just the thing.</li>
    <li> I have searched to find sunscreens that are low risk and highly effective for my 7 year old daughter.  Last year I bought and love Soleo organics...this year was looking for something a bit cheaper and just as safe.  I bought two tubes of loving organics and have been disappointed.  I have had to screw off the cap multiple times to get it to dispense, it leaves a bright white film on our skin, and the oils in the sunscreen have dissolved the inks on the label leaving our hands and clothes stained with ink.....what a mess.  I will go back to buying Soleo organics.  DO NOT BUY LOVING NATURALS.</li>
    <li> I read a large article about sun products before purchasing this one. I was looking for a natural sunscreen option for my entire family (I have two small children, age 3 and 9 months). When this product arrived I was excited. That was before I actually started using it. First, no matter what the label says, it is hard to apply and it leaves your skin greasy. It is very white and pasty, and hard to rub in. Still, I would use it and not complain, if it actually worked! My family went on a trip to a farm, we were in the sun for about 3 hours. I applied a generous layer of this sunscreen on all of us, and we all got badly sunburnt! My poor baby had it the worst. His little arms were bright red and he could not sleep all night. Now we are all peeling, for the first time in years (and a first time for the kids!) This is an experience I do not care to repeat. So, by all means, use this product when you&#x27;re mostly in the shade, but think long and hard before trusting it in the sun.</li>
    <li> this sunblock works well but is very pasty. its hard to put on and leaves a whitish layer.  but on the plus side, it protects well and is highly rated on EWG.</li>
    <li> THis worked very well on my kids! lOVe, love, love.  And I like that there is no chemicals! Would buy more and also budget friendly!</li>
    <li> I also really wanted to like this sunscreen.  Unfortunately I used it on my 4 year old yesterday at the pool and she got really sunburned!  And I did reapply!  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers that yes, this sunscreen works very well -- my husband and I spent a week in the Caribbean in June and neither of us burned (we&#x27;re both fair). HOWEVER: this sunscreen absolutely is greasy, it doesn&#x27;t rub in well, which gave both of us a crazy, ghost-like sheen, it smells funky and worst of all, it stained both of our swimsuits around the edges. My husband&#x27;s black trunks are now white; my white bathing suit turned brown -- I had to wash everything twice to get the color out. I bought this because it&#x27;s received such amazing reviews and great ratings, but I think I&#x27;ll take my chances with the far less expensive drugstore sunscreen from now on!</li>
    <li> First of all, I love the organic ingredients...that&#x27;s what drew me to this product. I have always used organic sunscreens, but my son would eventually start getting rashes from every one I tried. I think he was allergic to the titanium dioxide. This one only uses zinc oxide and he doesn&#x27;t react at all to it. It goes on slightly white, but if you keep rubbing you can get rid of the white tint for the most part. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird at all either. We love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading about the harmful chemicals that can be in baby sunscreens. I chose to go the natural route and I put this on my baby when he is in the sun. He has never had a sunburn and the product works great. It&#x27;s a little greasy after applying but that&#x27;s a fair price to pay for a safe, chemical free product. I would highly recommend it to a friend (and I have).</li>
    <li> I was not at all happy with this product.  I have sensitive skin and have had skin cancer.  The first  (and only) time I used this product it caused a mild burning sensation on my face  - not any where else.  I also talked my adult son into trying it since it came so highly recommended.  We were in a group of 5  participating in a canoe adventure and the others all used popular bands that cost less and easily available at any drug or grocery store.  My son and I were the only ones to get sunburned.  I have used other zinc and titanium sunscreens for years and haven&#x27;t had a sunburn in years.  I don&#x27;t have a clue why a product so highly regarded by others did not work for us.  My son was irritated with me because he hadn&#x27;t had a sunburn in years either....</li>
    <li> The product leaves a white residue but goes away in moments. It goes away with sweat within a few seconds. Light and long lasting. No sticky feeling or oily sensation. Apply thickly for max protection.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is not all the hype it has been getting! I will be completely honest with you. It does make you look like a ghost no matter how much you rub it on. After having it on for a while you will feel a tingle on your skin, which can get on your nerve&#x27;s. It is great that this sunblock has all natural ingredients, but having peanut oil in it can cause those allergic to peanuts, big problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost two months now and I really like it.  I am trusting EWG rating when it says it is a safe sunscreen to use.  I&#x27;ve used it on all three of my kids during outside play and swimming.  When applied as directed and reapplied as directed, I have not have any of my children burn.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to regular sunscreen. I have purchased a few different kinds of natural sunscreens and this is by far one of my favorites. It rubs in well, smells good, is not too greasy and lasts a long time. It is very gentle. Try it!</li>
    <li> trying out safer sunscreens.  this was one of our firsts.  it&#x27;s ok.  weird smell.  very \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; look and greasy feel.  applied several times a day on carribbean vacation and never did burn.  hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> This was bought after reading all the \\&quot;good\\&quot; reviews.  I applied it on my 19mth old and off we went to the water park.  She got baked, this item should be sold as a tanning lotion. I am going back to buying Clarins although it leaves that white film on you at least it protects. Do not waste your money on this VEGAN product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after researching many sunscreens. My 4 yr old son is highly allergic peanuts/tree nuts.  This product is not suitable for anyone with these allergies.  It is listed on the back of the sunscreen as a WARNING however this should be part of the product description so people with these allergies do not purchase it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago. It is a great product!!! Use sparingly. It get a great rating on EWG too!!! I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> One of the safer products on the market but found it to be VERY greasey and stickey. Ordered 4 bottles but returned 3 because it was just not easy to use.</li>
    <li> I would say this is an effective sunscreen. I like how it is organic with high UVA/UVB protection. However, if you are tanned, you WILL have a strong white cast on your skin.</li>
    <li> I usually use Blue Lizard&#x27;s Sensitive but because I ran out, I ventured to Loving Naturals. It&#x27;s very important that you shake this sunscreen before each use because the oils tend to separate very quickly.The formula comes out smelling like crushed walnut shells and sand.    My complexion is mildly pale (lighter than NW 20) but even for me I have to be very careful not to over apply. It leaves a very noticeable white cast if you only apply it to one part of your body (ex. applying on face but not on neck), but if you apply it evenly everywhere skin is visible, it does make you look naturally paler and it almost seems to brighten the skin. It is, however, very difficult to rub in. I&#x27;ve tried it on my face and my body, but it takes half an hour (if not more) to rub everything in properly. I would not recommend this to those with darker skin tones.    The consistency is very greasy (as expected for a mineral sunscreen), but what puts me off about this suncreen/sunblock is that it rubs off and transfers VERY easily. If you touch anything with any part of you body covered in this sunscreen, it will leave an slight oily film on the other object. It has left white marks on some of my shirts, my laptop, and especially all over my glasses.    You also need to apply a lot in order for this to be the most effective. Unfortunately, this makes you so white that if you apply any more than a thin layer, you&#x27;ll end up looking like you slathered diluted white paint over yourself. And, if you over-apply or you don&#x27;t rub it in properly, the sunscreen won&#x27;t sink into your skin and will transfer a substantial bit of oil and whiteness to everything else around you.     If you have sensitive skin I would not recommend using this product for a long amount of time on your face because I&#x27;ve noticed that if not properly removed after 8 hours or so, it can cause your pores to be clogged and it can break you out. I have normal skin myself and I find that I can&#x27;t wear this on my face for more than 11 or 12 hours (less if I sweat a lot that day) without risking a breakout.</li>
    <li> I did my research and it is supposed to much better than other similar sunscreen. It is quite thick so I guess a little bit goes a long way. I am just disappointed that I bought it in September 2010 and the expire date is at the end of January 2011.</li>
    <li> This is, by far, the worst sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used... and I&#x27;m an esthetician so I know products! The formulation is ALL WRONG -- it sits on top of your skin like a greasy, white slick which inevitably gets on everything you touch. The aroma is funky too -- smells like something you&#x27;d eat in a chinese restaurant, basically roasted sesame oil. Do not waste your money like I did. It might be \\&quot;natural\\&quot; but it sure isn&#x27;t \\&quot;loving\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen. We use it on the kids as well as ourselves. There is no other organic sunscreen that comes close to loving naturals! It applies nicely and has a lot of coverage for those who have a fair complexion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was less expensive than the Devita face moisturizer and you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m sure it has a lot of zinc in it and will block the sun but, its no fun to put on.  It feels drying, is hard to rub in and separates in the bottle.  I&#x27;m going to try to con my kids into using it.  Good luck with that!</li>
    <li> I have a light dark skin and I was looking for a sunscreen which would prevent me from the effects of the sun and which doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.   My recommendation, plan to rub your skin with the product 15 minutes prior to go to the sun if you don&#x27;t want to look like Snow White.:)</li>
    <li> I have been using this sunscreen throughout the summer, and really love it so much that I make sure to put it on daily, although its the fall already its such a great sunscreen, and so light.  You must try it!</li>
    <li> I wanted to order natural sunscreen for our trip to Hawaii.  I ordered this product based on price and product reviews.  As far as coverage goes, the sunscreen worked great.  Unfortunately it stained and stripped color off 2 of my suits.  I normally hand wash swimwear but couldn&#x27;t get the stain out so tried machine washing.  Even that didn&#x27;t take the sunblock out of my suits!  I actually returned the 2 extra bottles I had purchased and will not buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted in a sunscreen. It contains no dangerous chemicals and provides enough sun-protection to make me and my pallor feel ok about going out in the sun. It leaves a white residue for about 30 minutes, but that&#x27;s not a big deal and can be avoided if you&#x27;re careful. A little goes a LONG way. I use a Q-tip to apply tiny amounts to different areas of my face and then rub them in. Highly recommended. Thank you Loving Naturals for making safe but effective cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it was highly rated by EWG for safety.  However, it&#x27;s not for me because it can&#x27;t be completely rubbed in.  It wiped off on my clothing and the chair even after I waited 30 minutes to go put on my shirt and go outside.  Sounds good but in theory but too messy for me in practice.</li>
    <li> this lotion is great!  All natural ingredients make me confident putting this on my kids- especially my 7 month old.  I know you can&#x27;t have it all so I&#x27;m okay with this making my kids look like a ghost if it is going to be healthy/safe and recommended by EWG.  It spreads easily and does okay in the water but you will have to reapply (like everything else) after 40 min of water use.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen after reading about the harmful chemicals that can be in baby sunscreens. In general, we like this product. My daughter, who has very pale skin, said it is the best sunblock ever. It is not very greasy, but you have to be careful not to put too much on any one place since it does leave your face/skin quite white if you do. We have not yet had it on for any extended period in the sun, so it is difficult to comment on its effectiveness against sunburn. However, we are hoping it will work well, particularly if we do not apply it thickly due to the \\&quot;whiteness\\&quot; factor. I would highly recommend it to a friend (and I have).</li>
    <li> While this product has a great sunblock (zinc oxide), and a good amount of it (24.8%), it is unusable for a couple of reasons.  The lotion doesn&#x27;t stay blended.  It&#x27;s kind of like buying the natural peanut butter that you have to stir a million times to incorporate the oil that has settled out, but no amount of shaking the bottle will mix this stuff back up.  It results in an oily mess spewing out each time you use it.  The actual lotion is grainy looking and very much unmixed.  Once you get past this, no amount of rubbing your skin will get this product to absorb.  It stays on the surface of your skin, giving pale complexions a ghostly white appearance, and darker skin appears with a purplish hew.  I bought two bottles of this for myself and my children because of all the great reviews.  I have no idea what those people were talking about because this product is horrible.  I threw it away because it is truly UNUSABLE!</li>
    <li> Sunblock works well on my 22 month old. It is a little oily but soaks into his skin pretty quickly making this not too big of an issue.</li>
    <li> This is great for sensitive skin and it does prevent burning.  I will not be ordering it again because it does not soak in and it remains white so it accentuated my lines and wrinkles.  It would be great for kids at the pool or beach.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this sunblock and even bought 4 tubes in anticipation of it being our \\&quot;new\\&quot; healthy sunscreen.  Other reviews have probably said it all already...thin and greasy, very white, strong nutty odor (which i personally like but if you care about that kind of thing, be aware of it).  I could have dealt with ALL of those things if it had only worked.  My husband, daughter and i ALL burned, badly, using this on the beach. I reapplied it several times but no luck.  Very disappointed, especially since my poor 6yr old now has her 1st sunburn :(  Should have stuck with Aubrey.  EWG should reexamine this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this when I was looking for a healthier sunscreen option. I am very fair, burn easily and have family members who have had skin cancer...so sunscreen is very important to me. I chose this product after doing some research on Amazon (user reviews) and consulting the EWG&#x27;s website.     I&#x27;ve only used it once since owning it, but so far I&#x27;m pleased. It is fairly thin/liquid-y, so it went on easily and covered well. I do not feel as though it left my skin looking whiter after I applied it as other reviewers have mentioned (I think it was absorbed well). I enjoyed the nutty smell that it has (especially opposed to the smells of traditional chemically sunscreens). I do feel it was a little greasy, but WAY less greasy than traditional sunscreens. The day I used it I was out walking in the sun for about 2 hours and no burns! I will definitely buy this again when I run out.</li>
    <li> WHAT were you thinking...a tree nut in a sunscreen! You need to put this ont the front of the bottle so a child/ adult does not DIE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this sunscreen by Loving Naturals and I love it!!  I believe this is perfect for applying and lasts before having to reapply. I have found others to be too thick. I used on my infant and felt safe with the protection this sunscreen provided. Nice natural scent and not too thick or greasy. This is by far the best sunscreen I have found to use on my children.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great! I have used it on my infant with no problems at all. Best of all I know it is safe for my little one. Unlike other Zinc Oxide sunscreens this one does not leave them or me greasy or looking like a pale ghost. It leaves a slight white sheen that is more of a glow in the sun. Do your homework on Titanium Dioxide, this stuff is bad, bad, bad. Stay away and use Zinc Oxide sunscreen only, especially on the little ones. I will definitely be back for more! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Non-greasy? On what planet? This stuff is OIL and zinc oxide. It is a horrible runny awful looking mess. I can&#x27;t use it anywhere but the beach and I will never repurchase. This crap will smear onto EVERYTHING you touch. I hope you want oil and zinc on your car, your keyboard, your bicycle and all of your clothes.     Badger is slightly better, but I will stick with Burnout.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, great ingredients and many uses when mixed with oil it makes a great moisturizer, lip balm, and deodorant too..</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen last year, using it on myself and my kids simply b/c of the amount of money I spent on it.  This product is AWFUL!  Why:  1.  It stains clothing. (if you accidentally get it on the carpet or on clothing while rubbing it in--it leaves a stubborn oil stain)  2.  It take a REALLY, REALLY long time to rub in...and even after rubbing and rubbing it still doesn&#x27;t quite rub in all the way, leaving a white residue in certain places.  Really frustrating to apply to kids!!  3.  It leaves a very GREASY feeling, like you&#x27;ve just slathered yourself in cooking oil.  Take a good scrub in hot water and with soap to even get the grease off your hands.  4.  It does not smell good--it smells like a cooking product.  STINKY!    I highly recommend Blue Lizard lotion instead, rated very safe on EWG&#x27;s website.  I have used Blue Lizard several times in the past...but bought Loving Naturals when amazon had it on sale--hoping to save a little money and chancing something new.  I am now back to Blue Lizard&#x3D;money well spent!</li>
    <li> This is the strangest sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. After rubbing this in thoroughly on my child, her skin looks lavender and she&#x27;s SO greasy. I could maybe get over the \\&quot;looks\\&quot; of it if it worked, but it doesn&#x27;t. My daughter gets red every time.</li>
    <li> I need UVA protection. And this stuff does the trick. Here&#x27;s the bad thing though. And it makes it worth a bad review.       1.It goes on Whiteish. And stays whitish.     I don&#x27;t no of some of those views or fake, but who wants to look like a ghost?    I admit, its good for what it does, but the white you will be will have ppl staring at you left and right. Used it once and never used it again. I don&#x27;t give a crap about promoting or stufflike that because I don&#x27;t care, but for YOUR guys sake I suggest Neutrogena with Helioplex. It block uva rays and lasts 5 hours and is dirt cheap :). That&#x27;s it review over</li>
    <li> This product has VERY HIGH zinc oxide content-close to 25%, but, BOY! is it white, runny, gritty, and oily! First, the oil and the white lotion came out separately, one has to shake the container to mix them, then the runny opaque white lotion does not vanish or dry completely, and stains everything on contact, hours after application. My neck and arms look ghostly white, as if covered w/ a thin calamine lotion, and still show white streaks at the end of day. The grittiness is unpleasant and similar to that of natural peanut butter.When lotion is applied, there is a warm sensation on skin which feels as if it cannot breathe. The smell is similar to that of stale natural almond butter.   TUBE DESIGN FLAW: In time, to close tube, you need to use both hands, look very closely to make sure that the little plastic knob at the center of CAP fit into the tiny hole at center of tube! Frustrating!  How do some reviewers get to state that it is too thick? Was I mailed a decade old tube? I don&#x27;t recommend it. TruKid Sunny Days still ranks top on my list.</li>
    <li> Best and safest sunscreen ever.</li>
    <li> I did not like this sunscreen at all.  It is horribly greasy, even AFTER shaking the bottle. It feels greasy and looks greasy when applying.  You also have a white haze for awhile.  Overall it appeared to absorb into my skin ok -EXCEPT- I can&#x27;t put it around my neck or my hair will feel gross.  I tried keeping my hair up for a bit after applying, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I guess the protection is ok since I didn&#x27;t get sunburn while wearing it.  But I can&#x27;t get past the greasiness and the whole \\&quot;I can&#x27;t wear my hair down\\&quot; while using it.</li>
    <li> This is my second summer of using Loving Naturals sunscreen.  It works well, no heavy smells, all natural ingredients and absorbs into your skin well so you don&#x27;t feel it -unlike other sunscreens that are sticky or feel heavy.  I have very pale skin and this works well.  On application it goes on white but as you rub it into your skin the white disappears. Great product and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> To everyone who is reading these reviews, whatever you do DO NOT buy this crap!! It does not work at all and will get you, your kids and your dog sunburned. It also will leave you as white as an albino cavefish no matter how much you try to rub it in. At $18 for 4 oz. it&#x27;s also way overpriced and is a complete sham of a sunscreen. I applied it before golfing, generously and before heading out into the sun, and still got a burn. I have been using Coppertone Sport sunblocks in the EXACT same manner and did not burn at all, and of course will be going back to those great sunblocks immediately. I e-mailed Loving Natural and said I want my money back immediately; we&#x27;ll see if they do the right thing and give it to me or if I will have to contact the BBB and Attorney General to open a consumer complaint to get it back.     STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!</li>
    <li> I got burnt using this sunscreen, i applied it half an hr before being at the beach and i literally got burnt and i actually have reasonably tanned skin. I will have to try it again, but i am not sure i beleive any reviews of how great it is yet... it is also hard to rub in...</li>
    <li> This was rated #1 on Environmental Work Group&#x27;s [...] for sun protection and low toxicity.  I rate this product highly because it smells really nice and leaves little white residue, altho you need to rub it in.  I have also tried Heiko Kids SPF 40 which smells mediciney and is really hard to spread but is cheaper and the container isn&#x27;t as cheap.  So I use Loving Naturals for my face and the cheaper Heiko Kids on my body.  Both have approx 25% zinc oxide for sun protection.</li>
    <li> I reviewed the scientific literature and government assessments for common sunscreen chemicals&#x27; efficacy and toxicity. Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are known as \\&quot;mineral sunscreens\\&quot; or \\&quot;physical blockers\\&quot; since they reflect and scatter UV rays. The other actives are called \\&quot;chemical blockers\\&quot; because they absorb and disperse UV rays.     Studies show that unlike other common sunscreen chemicals, little to no zinc and titanium absorb through the skin, and they provide stable UVA protection relative to the other ingredients.       I love Loving Naturals&#x27;s products and philosophy, and I use this product regularly. Thanks for supplying my family with a safe alternative.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 4 fair skinned children and myself.  I have previously used California Baby and Badger, and like them both,(especially Badger), but was searching for an equally safe sunscreen at a cheaper price point.   This sunscreen is VERY runny...no matter how much you shake the bottle, it leaks right out.  It has leaked out onto my carpet many times already, in just one short week!  While you *seem* to get more for your money with this sunscreen, it is so incredibly thin and runny, I think it is actually more expensive per usable ounce.  On the plus side, my children have not burned while using this.  I will not buy this again.  Because I have to lotion up four children almost every day, this lotion is way too much of a hassle to keep using.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen after reading the EWG&#x27;s list of best sunscreens.  I have been pretty impressed with the product.  It is not oily or dense or thick, but it goes on fairly opaque, so you only need about the size of a dime for an area you used to use a palm-ful.  I find that I apply it first (the area will have a slightly white tinge), and then after applying to all other areas, I go back and re-rub in each area, and then it does not look white.  We have not gotten burned since using this product, and I like that it contains natural ingredients.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Ever since I got savvy to the reality of the chemicals we surround ourselves with, I&#x27;ve been a label reading diva.  I thoroughly research products before I switch over to them.  And based on my research, I wanted to like Loving Naturals sunscreen. It had a great ingredient list, good reviews, a high score on the EWG database....      But alas.  Loving Naturals did not love me back.  The bottom line for any sunscreen is this:  did it protect your skin?  And Loving Naturals simply didn&#x27;t make the cut.  I&#x27;ve burned badly each time I&#x27;ve worn it and that&#x27;s with an every other hour reapplication (the label says to reapply every 1-2 hours).  The heavy white residue of this product is also a deterrent, mainly because it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m willing to look pale if a product is effective.  I&#x27;ve found myself looking for long sleeves and hats just to avoid having to use this sunscreen.     If you have the time and money to paint yourself white every hour or every half hour, then perhaps you&#x27;ll find this product more effective than I did.   Otherwise, try something else.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this sunscreen after reading very positive reviews and since it is highly rated at the EWG&#x27;s website. The sunscreen gave me the most dreadful allergy on my neck and my arms: red and itching rash. After this allergy attack, I even responded (though not so strongly) for some time to other sunblocks, which previously didn&#x27;t give me any trouble (and aren&#x27;t causing allergy now). Must be all the oils in the product, so if you have a small child, be careful with it. It also rolls up with sweat and turns into smudges and dreadfully stains your clothing. The stains show up once you wet the fabric and no detergent takes it off, no washing machine. I was able to reasonably remove it from clothes (no matter what fabric, by the way! synthetic or natural fibers - it stains and stays on all of them!) only after some very determined scrubbing by hand and only with the soap for washing that I had to bring from my home country.</li>
    <li> There is enough good posts so I&#x27;ll just say the 2 things that I think aren&#x27;t often mentioned:    1. I&#x27;ve always hated the feeling of having sunscreen on, this product however has a waxy feeling instead of the slimy/oily feeling I dread.  So far I&#x27;ve played tennis, been swimming, and other general activities and have yet to be sunburned or disappointed.    2. I only gave it 4 stars though because I do not like the smell as some of the other people here seem to.  The smell clearly comes from the sunflower seed oil but it smelled more like past ripe sunflower seeds and it was a pretty solidly lingering smell, however while the smell doesn&#x27;t go away it pretty quickly seems to fade how far close you have smell it.    Great product though and after reading up on all the harmful effects of chemicals in other products this one does deserve a 5 star, but as I see room for improvement I&#x27;m hesitant to say &#x27;perfect product&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why did I buy it :( We bought two bottles, went for a vacation and after one day (reapplying every 1.5) we were burnt ! We were lucky to didn&#x27;t use it on our baby skin. We used California Baby for our little son and Loving Naturals on our. Our son didn&#x27;t have any red spots, nothing. We spend the same amount of time in the sun/water, we have the same type of skin, we reeapply every 1.5 hours and still didn&#x27;t work. I had big expectation.   There was no expiraton day on the bottle, maybe it was old???  It&#x27;s not easy to apply, it stinks really bad, it&#x27;s sticky, stained all our clothes.  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!</li>
    <li> This lotion is thick, bright white and stinky.  It might really work well, but I pass on the other features.</li>
    <li> I found Loving Naturals to be a very heavy sunscreen. The zinc oxide give a white, ghostly tint and is definitely more suited for the beach where the white color is less noticeable. It stains clothing very readily and, so far, cannot be washed out.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking that the 5 oz meant the weight of the sun screen itself, and didn&#x27;t include the heavy plastic that it is in. I weighed it and the whole thing comes to 5.10 oz. For the price it&#x27;s a complete rip off, since I am pretty sure the bottle weighs 2.5-3 oz on it&#x27;s own. Ugh. I would return it for a refund, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t have time to shop for another--I need it for the next 4 days at the Coachella festival. This is too upsetting. I doubt it will last me more than 2 days. ;(</li>
    <li> This is a young company and was getting a good review from skindeep. I want to make sure I get the most natural product so I purchased this for my family, especially for use on my daughter. The sunscreen is very white, but that&#x27;s because of the zinc oxide. We look like a ghost after we apply it but I am okay with that. It gets on my clothes and furniture and stroller fabric, but it sometimes stains, so be careful when applying. It feels oily but I have dry skin so it is okay and it seems to wash off my daughter&#x27;s face pretty easily. I reapply frequently to make sure my daughter gets max protection and my husband says I put too much on her but I think it is just because of the whiteness. The label on both sides finally get soaked with the oil and came off, so it is just a white tube with stick on label, unlike other brands that has more professional packaging. Overall, this is an okay product and the price is of course a lot more compared to other brands but it is really in the middle as there are some even more expensive. I think I will try [[ASIN:B0028Q64S6 Neutrogena Pure and Free Baby Sunblock Lotion SPF 60 - 3.0 Oz 2/pack]]next.</li>
    <li> Good that its zinc only. Washes off when swimming, Bought on Amazon a little while ago for 14.99. and the stick for 9.99. Current price is a ridiculous RIPOFF</li>
    <li> Will not buy it again. Smells bad. Oil separated from cream. Makes face look like a zombie. Sticky.But to be fair, my son didn&#x27;t get sunburn wearing it.So it works good.</li>
    <li> This was a messy, liquid. It was like smearing peanut butter on your skin. Didn&#x27;t smell great either. I threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been outside a couple of days so far this year, and the sunscreen seems to offer decent protection.  The lotion itself is very white and pretty thick.  It smells a lot like dirt or clay, but the smell seems to dissipate with time.  It&#x27;s hard to rub in enough to keep my baby&#x27;s skin from looking white, but I&#x27;d rather deal with the smell and then whiteness than cover my little one with nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> Safe and natural as well as non-nano zinc oxide which is important. Goes on fairly white but can be rubbed in easily. Isn&#x27;t sticky like gross chemical sunscreens can be and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. Besides Badger sunscreen, this is the only one I trust for my super fair skinned daughter and I!</li>
    <li> Sunscreen is a bit heavy, but works well.  Just rub it in and it disappears.  It&#x27;s good to know that there are no dangerous chemicals in this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunscreen because it was rated highly by EWG for its low toxicity.  It contains one active ingredient (non-nano zinc oxide) that is believed to be benign.  The inactive ingredients are all natural.  I recently used the sunscreen for a 3-day, high-altitude climb on snowfields and glaciers.  The sunscreen simply did not provide adequate protection.  Despite re-applications every 75 minutes, I was burned bright red in some locations, and the tip of my nose was badly burned to the point of scab formation.  I would use this product for brief, light sun exposure for infants and others with delicate skin.  I would not rely on this product when robust sun protection is needed.</li>
    <li> I think this sunscreen is best suited for daily use if you are just going to be outside for a minimal amount of time (ex. walking to and from your car to get to work/store. No sun exposure for more than 5 minutes at a time). I used this when I went to the beach, and even after reapplying every 30 minutes AND after every dip in the water, I still got burned. Good thing I tried it out myself before I put it on my kids - they would have been so miserable. I&#x27;ll stick with Vanicream. As for the sunscreen itself: it smells really good and rubs in fairly easy. The bottle, however, is really stiff and hard. I find it more difficult to squeeze out the sunscreen than most other bottles on the market. I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend this sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I needed a natural sunscreen, a family history of alot of skin cancer and pale skin equals a definite need for sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few, burts bees seemed like it fried me to a crisp rather than protect me so I went on to try loving naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great but you do need to reapply often, it does give you a white mask but you can rub it in well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning though don&#x27;t wear it into the water it will not work, I ended up a little pink.  I realize it is water resistant and not water proof but I was only in a toddler pool and really did not get my arms wet a whole lot.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen definitely delivers - there&#x27;s no chance you&#x27;ll get sunburn if you slather this stuff on. Definitely the best protection I&#x27;ve found for my fair skin. The only downside is the thickness, it takes forever to rub in and you&#x27;re still left with a white-ish glow. But I guess that&#x27;s why the sun doesn&#x27;t get through...and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for excellent sun protection.</li>
    <li> You put it on and it makes your face white it will not blend in   I have two tubes one unopened and I will throw it away  I would not buy again</li>
    <li> Just too concentrated with natural sunscreens to blend in. Stays opaque white on the skin. With tons of rubbing it will leave a blueish sheen on the skin. Possibly great for pale or ivory skin, but not for tan or dark (I have medium-dark skin). I appreciate the larger particle size (non-nano particle) of this sunscreen for those who want maximum protection without worrying that chemicals are seeping into the skin and entering the blood stream.</li>
    <li> I purchased two tubes of this product based on high EWG ratings. I was very disappointed. Here is my experience: The sunscreen was separated when I received the bottles, so I shook the tubes to achieve a homogeneous lotion.  The product was extremely greasy to the touch and felt oily upon application. 10-15 minutes or so after applying the product, my arm touched the side of my car and bike while loading my bicycle and left a grease mark on my car- in fact, anything I would accidentally rub against would receive greasy mark from the lotion. My skin was not protected from the sun (I experienced a sunburn in spite of wearing this product). Also, the product smells like rotten nut oils, which made me wonder, why would there be oil in a sunblock?  Hmm.  I have absolutely NO IDEA why anyone would buy this product. In fact, it was so lousy that I wonder if someone tampered with my product, it was just that horrible.</li>
    <li> Natural and a concerted effort to provide alternative, healthier option. Though it does not rub in well and so is best suited for times when you don;t mind having a very white looking face.</li>
    <li> My skin is very fair and this product protects me for hours.  My children are using it as well.  It is light but contains a very high percentage of zinc so it has proven to be very effective!</li>
    <li> I am really happy with this product. I bought it to use on my baby as I am shocked by the amount of chemicals in almost all other sun creams (even &#x27;baby&#x27; creams!). It goes on smoothly, smells nice (although contains no &#x27;fragrance&#x27;) and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. I don&#x27;t have to worry about him getting it in his mouth as the ingredients are all natural. It does cost a bit more but I am probably less wasteful with it because of that. Some people have said it leaves a white residue but I didn&#x27;t find it to be bad, as long as you rub it in. I actually thought it was kind of flattering and hides the wrinkles (on me, not the baby!), but maybe that&#x27;s just me :) At any rate, I&#x27;m happy for a bit of white residue to have a powerful sunscreen that works, and doesn&#x27;t coat my kid in a bunch of poisons.</li>
    <li> I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin. Growing up, my fair skin always burnt when using the SPF products available at our local store. Now at age 40, it shows. Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen when I needed a totally natural protect. I wanted to protect my skin during a week-long outdoor music festival, and then the following week while in Denver. The sun was intense in both locations, but the Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen protected me perfectly.     When I compared the sun damage of my early youth with this product, I was shocked! After a week in the hot, bright sun, my skin was not damaged, or burnt, or uncomfortable. Then when I compared my skin and the skin of my traveling companions, who used the grocery store sunscreens (Coppertone, Banana Boat, you know), I couldn&#x27;t believe how much more effective the Loving Naturals SPF 30 was! Many of my companions were burnt, in fact. Yet, I did not burn at all! I was amazed at just how well it works. Not only did it physically block the sun from damaging my skin, but it is 100% completely natural.     When I first received the sunscreen, I thought the bottle would never last my first trip; I was certain I would run out of the sunscreen. However, don&#x27;t be deceived; this sunscreen lasts much longer than the bottle appears and it&#x27;s worth every penny. Now I am no longer a sceptic. This is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! I highly recommend it and will buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> We got this sunscreen because it scored so well on the EWG list.  We love it!  A little goes a long way and it rubs in nicely too.</li>
    <li> I got the product based on websites (EWG), price and reviews. Used it to run on a sunny day and worked just fine even with sweat, but also used it at the beach and got washed away very quickly in the sea and I got sunburn.    I would not recommend this product for swimming, beach (unless you just plan on walking around, etc.).    I was very disappointed because it is not unexpensive and I expected it to be a good product and trusted my skin health to it.</li>
    <li> I love using this product, it has a very faint, pleasant, fresh smell to it and the coverage is excellent.  It has to be rubbed in for the skin to absorb it and that leaves me feeling well protected.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the positive reviews, and I question whether this is the same product? My husband and I tried it out for our Florida vacation and hated it. The smell is sunflower oil, which is not bad. And it&#x27;s organic, which is why I bought it. BUT, I found it very greasy and hard to rub in, leaving a very visible blue-white tint everywhere. And it stains your clothes (and rental car)--that was a nice surprise! It took us about 20(!) minutes to apply the stuff, and felt it was only good for an hour or two in really hot weather. Less if you wear it to the beach (which I did, and got horribly burned. I am fair skinned, and was reapplying like a mad woman to no avail). I WOULD use it on a baby, because of the reduced surface area, but am not looking forward to trying to use it on myself this summer. Blech.</li>
    <li> This might just be the best sunscreen product I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on easily, is not greasy, but also helps moisturize the skin. The only drawback is that it does have a chalk-like appearance, but not as ghostly as other zinc oxide-based products. I wear it while running and biking and it does a great job of deflecting the sun. I tan with this product, but never burn or even get pink. As a bonus, it smells really nice.</li>
    <li> I am completely happy with Loving Naturals Sunscreen, SPF 30+. It has a lovely scent of lavender, with tones of cocoa and various nut oils. It&#x27;s absolutely luscious and my skin seems to love it. It applies with a white hue, but it absorbs within 10 minutes. In the several weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, I haven&#x27;t seen it stain clothing, and I apply it liberally while dressed in my formal work wardrobe. I&#x27;m thrilled that this product provides UVA and UVB protection, is made with an array of organic ingredients, and has been rated by the Environmental Working Group as being extraordinarily safe. It&#x27;s amazing that you get all of this in one bottle. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen will not absorb into your skin. No matter how small of an amount you use or how long you spend rubbing it in, it will make your skin look white and leaves a greasy film. If you have dry or combo skin, this is definitely not for you. The white sheen turns every tiny flake of skin and dry patch on your face white and amplifies it.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen for 9 days in Hawaii and the only sunburn I received was on an area that I forgot to apply it to.  It goes on easily if you don&#x27;t just apply a blob in one place then expect to spread it out from there...duh.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sunblock (like many others) after reading reviews for sunscreen that is free of cancer-causing agents. I was highly disappointed in the product, however. Really, I should probably rate this a 1-star, rather than a 2-star, but I will say that it provided *some* protection. While we didn&#x27;t completely crispy-critter ourselves wearing this, we also weren&#x27;t in direct sun for more than about 20 minutes when we wore the Loving Naturals sunscreen. In addition, as many others have pointed out, you just can&#x27;t rub out the white color. Many lotions have that white color, but you&#x27;re able to rub it into your skin so that you have a natural color again. With this product though, the white remains until you can shower it off, so, unless you want to look like a greasy, white ghost, I would avoid the sunscreen at all costs. There are others that work well and don&#x27;t leave the weird, white cream look on your skin.  In addition, the cost for the size of the bottle (especially because of the effect it has on the skin) is unreasonable in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to rub in.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face anymore as it leaves me looking like a ghost.</li>
    <li> Having used Badger last year, I purchased this sunblock with hesitation. I picked it up because it was cheaper and the reviews indicated it was compatible. It is a lot more liquid and therefore slightly easier to spread. It still leaves you white but since I mostly use it for my 5 year old, he doesn&#x27;t seem to care. As for performance, I was completely satisfied. One day we made a mistake of going to beach at the worst hours so I applied the sunblock frequently. When we came home grandma was sure that my son would have sun burn but nothing. It passed my test.</li>
    <li> I have been all about getting the \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens this summer because all of the hype, and I was tired of paying for California Baby so I was happy to find this at a good price.  At my own fault, I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients before ordering this, but     thankfully did when it came before I plastered it onto my 3 year old.  There are NUT OILS in this sunscreen and my 3 yo is HIGHLY allergic to any kind of nut.  I was very    disappointed (mostly at myself) for not checking that better.  I knew it was a lot  of natural ingredients, but it never even crossed my mind about MACADAMIAN nut oils in a sunscreen.      The smell was not appealing to me either.  It smells like a \\&quot;cookie candle\\&quot; you would buy at Yankee or something.  OK for a fall smell in the house, but not on our skin.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works. I burn fast and have sensitive skin, yet this stuff doesn&#x27;t make me break out nor do I end up all lobster-red. Just follow the directions on the bottle, and you&#x27;ll be happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are drawbacks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen makes you look paler than normal. It&#x27;s the very stuff that makes the sunscreen work, zinc, that happens to be the culprit and no matter how much rubbing I did I couldn&#x27;t make it go away. If you&#x27;re a goth, this is fine and dandy: save money on skin lightener by using this! However, everyone else may want to pat a little bit of powdered bronzer or blush on top to not look like a ghost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you will need to \\&quot;let it dry\\&quot; a little when you put it on or it will smudge leaving white all over your clothing. Luckily, a quick trip through the washing machine removes all the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t mind looking pale or tossing on a bit of makeup and can wait about 3 minutes to let the stuff dry, go and get this sunscreen! You will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I wanted a safe sunscreen for my kids - we live in Florida and go through a LOT during Spring/Summer.  I can slather this on my kids and know it&#x27;s safe.  It has a tint when applied which I like so I can see if I missed a spot!  So far, it has provided great coverage and stays on during our hours at the beach and pool!</li>
    <li> I just got this sunscreen a week ago. I have two small boys, ages 3 and 7 months.  The sunscreen itself smells nice (sort of like sunflower seeds) and goes on smoothly. You really have to work to get it rubbed it, and even then it leaves a whitish tint.  I&#x27;m OK with that, and my boys aren&#x27;t really old enough to care.  My one big complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  We went to the pool today for 2 hours. I applied sunscreen to the boys before we went outside and again about an hour into our visit.  Both boys got quite a lot of sun and are on the edge of red.  I only applied the sunscreen before going out and I&#x27;m pretty pink.    It&#x27;s not billed as a waterproof product, only water resistant, but I have had similar results even when we weren&#x27;t in the water.      Bottom line: it&#x27;s good as far as it goes, but make sure to reapply, reapply, reapply.</li>
    <li> As a very white, high melanoma risk person, I have become something of a sunscreen aficionado. The finer nuances of sunscreens are not lost on me.    I just purchased this one based on its ranking by Environmental Working Group, and also on Amazon customer reviews which were largely positive.    I&#x27;ve only used it once, and I&#x27;m sold. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to evaluate another brand--this stuff is that good. When I opened it, I was a little worried--it did look like it might leave a residue of some kind, but no, it melted right into my skin and left me powdery soft. And no smell! No excessive rubbing necessary. Yay! Finally. Plus, it&#x27;s clean--no bad chemicals.     On my face I use Keys Solar RX. I kept waiting for someone--like Keys--to make something like that for a body. Well, Loving Naturals, you did it. It&#x27;s not really the same, but for their purposes, I have found sunscreens that I don&#x27;t mind wearing year round.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.   I had read the reviews and didn&#x27;t mind being white(ish) after application, but i don&#x27;t think the sun protection worked very well.  Kids got burnt under their eyes (now they did wear goggles, but we reapplied all day).  And as other reviews said, it was extremely hard to remove even after shower/scrubbing.  I had a white sheen for a few days.  won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Due to a recent nasty scar on my daughter&#x27;s forehead, I want to apply sunscreen to her face every time she goes out to play, essentially daily.  Because of this repetitive use, I wanted a product I was confident was safe.  The sunscreen works great.  It is not scented, but that is perfect for me, because I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the poor packaging and difficulty of application.      The product separates in the bottle, and the oil leaks out.  I find I have to store it upside down, which the bottle was not designed for.  To those who think the product is greasy, I wonder if they shake it before applying it.  That really needs to be added to the directions.      The product is very thick and difficult to rub in.  I find the trick to be not applying too much.  A little goes a very long way.  I have found this to be true of all \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sunscreens though.  I remember when those color zinc oxide creams were all the range.  I assume that is what gives the product it&#x27;s white sheen.  It sounds to me like most of the negative reviews as far as the color and staining were made by people who used too much.  This bottle will easily last us all summer.</li>
    <li> This is not your typical sunscreen. It applies very nicely; it&#x27;s not too thick. I thought it would make me look very pasty; however it was only a faint difference on my naturally pale skin. There have been facial sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried in the past where my makeup gets a little heavy and cakey when applied over it. When I apply Loving Naturals Sunscreen under my makeup it acts as a nice moisturizer and isn&#x27;t even noticeable.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. It is gentle and works great...safe without any scary nano particles. The first shipment was lost in the mail and before I could detect this...a new, larger size was on the way to me along with a coupon for my next order. Fantastic service!</li>
    <li> I think that the first thing people need to understand is not everone&#x27;s chemical composition will match this suncreen, hence why some people burn and others don&#x27;t. As for me, I found this product to be magic in a bottle. I tend to get sun poisoning after a long day on the beach-fever, burned, rashes, you name it. After five years of slathering my body in SPF 80s and 100s and burning I decided to try this product after reading all the reviews. For the first time in my adult life I&#x27;ve returned home from the beach with a slight tan and no burn. I will admit that because of the zinc oxide it does take a bit longer to rub into my skin but that beats having skin cancer in ten years. Loving Naturals also has an interesting smell to it, like an oatmeal smell. Still, I highly recommend it if you are prone to burning.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles of this sunscreen for a recent trip to the Caribbean. I was looking for a safe alternative to the other sunscreens I used to use with them.  After reading the environmental report on sunscreens, I didn&#x27;t want to use those products anymore.  I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it went on.  It is a little white at first but goes on smoothly.  However, to give you an example of how long it stays white, I first lathered up one child and by the time the other one was done the first one wasn&#x27;t white anymore.  So, it definitely sinks in and doesn&#x27;t STAY white.  I also found that it stayed on really well.  The kids were in and out of the water and it seemed to be beading up time after time.  The only problem I found with reapplying is to make sure that your child is dry first. If you put it on while still wet at all, the sunscreen stayed white and wouldn&#x27;t sink into your skin. Also, I didn&#x27;t mind the scent.  I think it is just a result of all the nut oils they used, but it had a slight nutty scent to it.  My kids were not so pleased with this, but it didn&#x27;t seem to bother them that much.  Overall, I really liked this sunscreen and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! Just a little bit goes a long way. The best part about it is it&#x27;s safe for my daughter, which is priceless...</li>
    <li> I love that this sunscreen is vegan. I have really fair skin and try to avoid the sun like the plague. This sunscreen works great, but it really washed out my complexion. On a daily basis people would ask if I was sick! Also the suncreen was kinda hard to blend in my beard.     I think this sunscreen is better suited for a woman because they can mix it with makeup. This sunscreen also has a peanut or nutty smell, but I liked that alot. I guess I will go back to my Elta MD UV Physical (great for oily skin)</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is kind of watery and doesn&#x27;t blend in very well. We prefer Badger or California Baby.</li>
    <li> i read all the feedback regarding this product.  first of all, it will not rub in like most suntan lotions so your face is white.  it is greasy and also smells.  there is no way i could use this everyday.  i would not buy this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is great! It is water repellent, not water resistant. You do need to re apply every couple of hours, especially if you get into the water. However, we noticed that it stays on your skin for a few days (gets stuck in the creases of your skin - elbows, crooks of the arm). It gets watery when it&#x27;s in the sun and hot. Make sure you apply before you go out in the sun. It will stay on longer. YOU WILL BE WHITE/BLUE WHILE ON THE BEACH. I didn&#x27;t really mind. My husband was white because it got stuck in his hair. I looked blue. I did some research before I bought this sunscreen. This is one of the best sunscreens that you can buy in the US. [...]</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my 1-year-old because it was rated safe by the EWG. It is definitely an effective sun screen, but as for the \\&quot;non-greasy\\&quot; claim...well, that&#x27;s another story. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hands after putting this on, so we&#x27;ll be trying something else when this bottle is finished.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve only used this a few times but we have not gotten sunburn at all and I can feel pretty good about the ingredients, especially for kids.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these and I&#x27;m throwing them out.  They got permanent grease marks on the insides of our car doors.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect natural, non-micronized zinc sunscreen, and my search continues to this day! Loving Naturals has everything I desired -- short ingredient list, moisturizing, waterproof, natural and organic. Sadly, it leaves an obscene white cast that did not soak into my skin even after a couple hours. I give it two stars because it&#x27;s quite good as a sports sunscreen (when looking like a ghost does not matter), but it is entirely inappropriate for daily use, school, or work.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with sunblock. I use a nano-zinc on my face every day, but this non-nano zinc sunblock on my neck and chest because my young son has a lot of contact with this area and with an abundance of caution, I am looking to limit my use of nano products. I use the nano on my face because makeup will not apply over this well, but I don&#x27;t mind it on my neck and chest. I use enough to have a white cast to my skin and using any more is simply unrealistic as my clothing is already stained from this product. I got sunburn on my chest while me face did not from the nano-zinc. I did not reapply anywhere on my body, my face was fine but not my chest. I find reapplying at the park again unrealistic as I do this before dressing as to not completely ruin my shirt. My son did not get sunburn but I put so much on his face he looked like he was wearing clown white and I re-applied to his face as well. I will continue to use it  on him this way until he is stops letting me, but I will not use this sunblock on myself again as I need a very small amount of nano zinc and never need to reapply. I don&#x27;t know how much I would have needed with this sunblock to not get burned, but I can tell you it would be a completely unreal amount to wear under clothing. Very upset! I give it 2 stars because it is chemical free and if you load the skin up to the point of it dripping off your face you will be ok, but what adult can walk around like this?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for a trip to the beach to really test this stuff out, but have been using it for daily use just to make short excursions outside.  I love having a sunscreen that I can feel good about using without the worry of all the added toxins in most products.  It has no added fragrance but has a light scent from it&#x27;s natural ingredients that I think smells pretty good.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with whiteness or not being able to rub the product in.  A little goes a long way so maybe some people are just lathering way too much on for their skin to be able to absorb.  The product does not feel greasy and actually feels nourishing and moisturizing to my skin! I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a sunscreen with ingredients they can feel safe and confident using!</li>
    <li> I was really hoping to like this sunscreen but unfortunately I was left disappointed.  I have used it daily for the past month and it was fine for running errands and not really being out in the sun directly for too long.  Today I was outside for a total of 3-1/2 hours and my face got burned.  It was applied about 30 minutes before I headed outside and I did no water activities to cause it to wear off and no sweating (it was sunny and 62).  Being only 30 and having already had skin cancer I really wanted something that was going to protect my skin.  My children&#x27;s sunscreens outdo this 10 to 1.  I will be using their California Baby or Earth&#x27;s Best sunscreen in the future.  I&#x27;ve never had any problems with either of them getting burned....and they are fair and redheaded.</li>
    <li> There are better sunscreens than this Loving Naturals product.  It&#x27;s relatively hard to spread, which makes application a bit difficult and messy, and it leaves you with a white film on your skin that gives you a ghostly pallor.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for a sunscreen that does its best to use safe, gentle and effective ingredients that do as little harm as possible to planet earth and our fellow creatures, this is probably your best bet.    Another good sunscreen choice, and one that applies more evenly and dries less chalky than Loving Naturals Sunscreen is Alba Mineral Sunscreen for kids.  It is also a vegetarian product that is cruelty free.  However, the Alba product uses titanium dioxide as its active ingredient instead of the non-nano sized zinc oxide used in the Loving Naturals Sunscreen, and the Alba does not state whether it uses nano-sized Titanium dioxide or not.</li>
    <li> Soft after using on the beach or at the pool.  Little white, but smells and feels great so I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great sunblock! It goes on a bit greasy but it works well and kept me from getting any sun on my face.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT, IT DOES LEAVE A SLIGHT WHITE FILM BUT BETTER THAN ANOTHER PRODUCT I HAD TRIED BEFORE.  AND I&#x27;M NOW UNDERSTANDING THE REASON FOR THE FILM IS THAT THIS PRODUCT WORKS BY REFLECTING UVA AND UVB RAYS  OFF OF THE SKIN AS OPPOSED TO MOST SUNSCREENS THAT PENETRATE INTO THE SKIN AND WORK DIFFERENTLY.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME TO LIMIT THE TOXINS I AM LETTING INTO MY SKIN, SO I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT I AM ABLE TO FIND PRODUCTS LIKE THIS TO MEET MY NEEDS.</li>
    <li> My son and husband are both allergic to most sunscreens.  This is the one of the few that doesn&#x27;t make them break out.  It smells delicious, and I don&#x27;t question any of the ingredients when putting it on my babies.  It does not make our skin too greasy like others have reported.</li>
    <li> This is our second summer using this product and we love it!  I was a bit concerned this year when I saw reviews saying it did not work so I decided to test it. I placed it on 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 moinutes prior to sun exposure. It DOES work if you apply 30 minutes BEFORE sun exposure! Another issue is that you need to apply it on COOL skin! Don&#x27;t let your child spend an hour or two outside and then put it on them....it does not work as well that way (though I have no clue why).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years ago I would apply a sunscreen on my child immediately before they hit the sun. I now know that the checmicals I was applying were harming my children. Though this one seems a bit odd because you must follow the 30 minute time frame...I will keep using this one as it is the safest there is for my child!</li>
    <li> I know this is the best protection for the sun&#x27;s damaging rays, but the ghostly-white appearance it gives you is very off-putting. I would only use this if my appearance didn&#x27;t matter and I were not around people (working in the yard, etc.). Other than that, the smell is fine. It is very hard to wash off, but I guess that is why it protects so well. It&#x27;s also a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I know there have been several people out there with bad reviews.  I just don&#x27;t get it?!?  Yes, it is on the greasy side....but it smells heavenly...like cocoa!  It protects my 1st grader just fine while at school.  I could never expect this product to work miracles.  Shade, light clothing &amp; hats work in congruence with sunscreen.  I would rather rub in natural oils into my child&#x27;s skin than chemicals.  Just today, I was looking for a facial moisturizer with SPF 30.......Uh, hello!  It&#x27;s been here right under my nose.  I&#x27;m going to start using this as my daily SPF moisturizer (since I&#x27;m getting older and worried about sun exposure). Give this brand a try.  Just be aware of the expiration dates (another reviewer shared, this could explain the unpleasant smell).</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  I was looking for something that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals to use on my kids and myself and this is perfect.  It is thin and easy to rub in.  The only complaint I have is the white residue, but that will happen with any physical blocker.  It eventually goes away, and I&#x27;m more concerned with using something safe than any residue it may leave.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell at first, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.  I&#x27;ve purchased this several times now and will never buy a different sunscreen.  Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this product because I have very sensitive skin and was looking for something with the least amount of chemicals. Everytime I try any skin products my face gets irritated to various degrees, so I always hunt for the perfect one that would be milder. When I received it in the mail I was surprised about how small it is. You would have to replace it pretty often based on the amount of application.  Unfortunately it leaves a lot of white cast. I am aware that mineral sunscreens do that, but this is just too much. I wasn&#x27;t able to blend it in to dissapear. But it is a very good price for a safe sunscreen if you don&#x27;t care about the white.</li>
    <li> I live in Tucson, Arizona and play tennis about 10 hours a week.  A safe, effective sun screen is a must!  I&#x27;ve tried at least 25 different sun screens, including the ones my dermatologist recommended.  This Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen Zinc Oxide is the very best one I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t make me look to white.  And....it works!</li>
    <li> Not sure how they can put non-greasy on the bottle.  It is greasy and does not rub in well.  It leaves a very white residue as well.  Wish I had not bought 2 bottles of it!  I will go back to Episencial!</li>
    <li> Sure it is a little pasty but very safe for your skin. MUch more preferable than other &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since when did it become okay to lather on chemical cocktails on your skin? Somehow our society has grown used to super unpronouncable chemicals in our everyday lives. NO THANKS, I&#x27;ll take food ingredients anyday.</li>
    <li> Purchased this formula because of the high metallic oxide content, and I planned to use it for a trip to high altitudes. I applied it liberally and often enough, but came home with skin damage. And 2 weeks after returning some of this damages appears to be permanent. After a short time this product began to separate and you cannot really shake it up because the bottle is so flat. I just tossed it after the one bad experience.</li>
    <li> This tube is ridiculously small. Before ordering, I actually looked at other containers in this size range and thought I could justify the price to quantity to value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... I can&#x27;t. There is no way that I can move things around in my mind to justify the cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Companies such as this give the illusion of caring about the customer, but I seriously can&#x27;t afford this product in good conscious - thank you boutique sun screen company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already have been ripped-off by purchasing products with oxybenzone in them without knowing the dangers of that chemical (FYI chemicals with an -ONE ending is a hormone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw away 4 tubes of Neutrogena products that have every toxic chemical known to man in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just feel manipulated and that I have purchased out of fear. Argh.... now I am just buying SPF clothing and hats to cover up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I feel the SPF rating of the product is skewed and I bet you could burn through a bottle during a family weekend at the beach. It is hard to put on also and needs to be reapplied often.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t mind how long it takes to apply.  You will have a white coating if you apply to much and if you apply just the right amount make sure you cover everywhere because any area that the sun can touch will get burned.  It is a definite sun BLOCK!</li>
    <li> Yeah, it leaves the skin looking a little whitish when it&#x27;s on, but I could care less. It&#x27;s safe and effective, and that&#x27;s all that matters to me as a mom!</li>
    <li> I have a 6 year old redhead with very fair skin.  She breaks out into hives with most brands of sunscreen/sunblock.  I have had very good luck with loving naturals!</li>
    <li> We used this on our trip to the beach where we spent at least 2 hours in the sun everyday for 5 days and never got a single burn. However, I did get tan.</li>
    <li> I have never written a customer review on Amazon before, but wanted to do so for this product. We have been using Loving Naturals Sunscreen products for two consecutive summers for our children and adults and have found it to be excellent. We switched to Loving Naturals when I read about the Environmental Working Group sunscreen report. I am pleased to say that neither of my children has experienced sunburn.  It is not easy to find, but one bottle lasts a very long time. As a result,I have found it important to plan in advance for any outside activities and to purchase some new bottles before summer begins.  We live in the desert and travel to the mountains and beaches and we are always concerned about sunburn.  It goes on fairly thick, so it may take a little more effort to apply but it is worth it for my family.</li>
    <li> I have some acne and terribly dry skin. I was looking around for a good daily zinc based facial sunscreen and came across this. Great reviews... And I wasn&#x27;t let down. Amazing product, with the best vegan ingredients! Follow advice and get a little water in your hand and dime size amount for face. Rub in and let seep into skin for a bit, then wipe away any white residue. I&#x27;ve had great experience with this sunscreen in outdoor physical activities. BONUS: The zinc (and other great ingredients) really really really helps acne :)</li>
    <li> Go on more smoothly than most zinc oxide sunscreens, which is an advantage when applying to toddlers.  But despite the produt&#x27;s claim, I do find it to be quite greasy.  But overall a good product for those looking for an all-natural alternative to the toxic, chemical based lotions.</li>
    <li> I paid $14.99 in May and now it is $8.79!! Also I have never been able to get the product to come out of the tube no matter how much I try to knead the content, can only screw the complete top off to get the gross stuff out (the water never seems to mix in so it comes out a big mess.  am interested in avoiding the harsh sunblock chemicals as in standard sunblocks so this was first try at something &#x27;natural&#x27;, does not seem worth it especially for what I got stuck paying!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is gritty, gloppy, gray, and greasy.  The Badger brand that we prefer is somewhat more expensive, but much nicer to spread and use.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my trip to Mexico. I applied it on my face, arms and legs, which made my skin look absolutely pale.  Then I was hit by a heavy rain. The cream instantly started to get washed off and streams of white liquid run down through my legs and arms.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews because I am busy with my four little kids.  I am writing this because of the extreme ineffectiveness of this so-called sunscreen.  Three of my four kids were burned after three hours in the sun at the lake.  I am in to natural stuff and was trying to do my kids a favor by using a natural sunscreen.  I feel bad that my little kids got scorched.  I know a chemical sunscreen would have done a much better job.  Badger also absolutely does not work.  Both products are going in the trash.</li>
    <li> This offered great protection for my son.  It is pretty thick and has to be rubbed in very well or it will leave you white.  It also made his hair a little greasy, but it wasn&#x27;t a big problem to me due to the fact that my son didn&#x27;t even get slightly pink after an all day zoo trip.  Doesn&#x27;t have crazy, scary chemicals in it which is very important to us!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to generic, toxic sunscreen.  Just make sure to look in the mirror before going outside so that you know its completely rubbed in!</li>
    <li> So this is not waterproof or sweatproof at all.  I am a lifeguard on the ocean in new jersey and it melts and comes off in the heat and when I&#x27;m sweating.  It doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, especially if you are outside and it&#x27;s hot.  It also comes off swimming and surfing very easily and while playing other sports, such as tennis and soccer.  Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re using it for the water or anything athletic or sporty.</li>
    <li> This works great. My son has never been sunburned. It&#x27;s a little thick and leaves him coated in white but I will trade that for peace of mind knowing its a safe product.  Recommended!</li>
    <li> This lotion was very thin, had an odd scent and was really ineffective for us at the beach. We still got burnt. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all! Not easy to apply, you stay &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, and after a nice swimming.... you pick your bath towel and run home because you look like an allien!</li>
