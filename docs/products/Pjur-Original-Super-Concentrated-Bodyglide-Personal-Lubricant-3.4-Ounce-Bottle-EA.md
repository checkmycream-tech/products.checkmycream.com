    <li> The cleanup is a bit lacking.  It&#x27;s a bit messy too.  The lid on this is difficult to work with and sooner or later this stuff ends up everywhere.  But... it feels amazing.</li>
    <li> More sludgy than slippery</li>
    <li> Smell was OK.  Worked on my dry frizzy &amp;#34;Einstein hair&amp;#34;.,i.e. hair shiny &amp; not greasy. Price was good</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff! Hubby and I love this stuff :)</li>

    <li> Love the stuff.  Does not dry out like other stuff I bought</li>
    <li> look at the size! this is a smaller bottle than one I previously ordered!</li>
    <li> Slick Willy.  The best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Especially nice if you do oral after; no taste or stickiness on your tongue. &amp;#34;Everything&amp;#34; just glides right in!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lubricant 4 years!  It is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> Works great absolutely the best lube out there and I have tried them all.</li>
    <li> gets sticky fast...seems old. I bought the exact same from else where and it is bay far superior. This is the first time I have had a problem with this product so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Worth the price, keeps going and going, very slick!</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been using this for a very long time and are very satisfied.  It was recommended by my gynecologist.</li>
    <li> little bit goes a long way.  gf loved it</li>
    <li> The makers of pjur really know what theyre doing. This stuff is down right amazing. As others have said, a little dab WILL do it. I used a glob about the width of a pea on myself and it lasted far longer than i did. Even after a brief shower i could still feel a slickness on the goods. It even has a slight conditioning effect  I am a little bummed out that this cannot be used on silicon toys but it is what it is. I have ordered the water based version of this lube and am quite excited to try that as well as i am sure it will be comprable.  Protip: tear off the labels if youre worried about descretion. The bottle ends up looking like a bottle of body spray.</li>
    <li> Very smooth for use as a light body massage oil.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried various products and this is no. 1!</li>
