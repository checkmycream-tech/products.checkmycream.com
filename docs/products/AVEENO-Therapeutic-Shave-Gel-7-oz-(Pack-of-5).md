      <li>I am allergic to most shaving cream that is scented, so this is one of the few creams I can use.  </li>

    <li> I have been shaving for over 60 years and used many good brands, buying name brands mainly because of price.  I saw Aveeno at what I suspect was a terrific price and have been surprised by its pleasant, smooth, non-irritating features.  I have not nicked myself once during the past two months. It spreads easily contrary to some gels that glob a bit, and washes off as easily from my face, or razor.  It advertises no added fragrance but has a fresh, dissipating odor.  The can lasts as long as its competitors.  Strongly recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream of all time.</li>
    <li> This review is not against the product but the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been buying aveeno shaving cream for years.  There are two different types with blue caps.  Lite blue and dark blue.  I ordered this product without looking at the name but going off the color of the cap in the picture.  I didn&#x27;t get the lite blue caps, I got the dark blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I only got 4 cans instead of the 5 cans that are supposed to come with the order.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller and initially asked for what I ordered. Then when I realized the names we&#x27;re different, I admitted that I should have shopped the name on the can and not the color of the cap.  I told them that I would like for them to send me the 5th can and that I would just donate them the shelter by our house.  They didn&#x27;t. They sent me a return email and gave me about a week to return.  I work out of town a lot and stay very busy.  I don&#x27;t have time to wrap it all back up and return.  If I had time for that I would have the time to go to the store and buy the shaving cream for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> This is good for anyone that is sensitive to the fragrance of the typical shaving gels and it doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> This is the only shaving product I have found that allows me to shave quickly in the shower without ending up with red, bumpy legs.  I even use it dry for touch-ups.  It only takes a little bit of gel to get enough thick foam to shave.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. i will never go back to any other shave gel</li>
    <li> These were a GREAT price. They took a little while to get to me but for the price it was worth it. This is the only shaving cream my husband can use and it&#x27;s kind of pricy in the store. I was very excited to see them being sold as a set of 5 for such a low price.</li>
    <li> Great cream for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I stumbled into Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel while on vacation in Canada.  I paid $12.00 CDN for one can and it was worth it1 It&#x27;s a steal in the five pack for $3.99 per can on Amazon.  This is easily the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves my sensitive skin nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Well pleased... Will order again.. Prompt service.</li>
    <li> The best saving gel out there.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shave gel for years and it has always worked better than anything else I have tried.  This is highly recommended for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought a pack of 5 and 1 of them was defective. Despite the defective can, the product is very good and helps against razor burn.</li>
    <li> I have to shave every day for work, and my skin absolutely hates it. I&#x27;ve tried all the sensitive skin shaving creams. This is the best one out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream has a pleasant almond scent (I guess you&#x27;ll either love it or hate it, but at least it doesn&#x27;t smell like dad&#x27;s Barbasol). When you spread it on your face it feels a little denser than a normal shaving cream. The active ingredient is colloidal oatmeal, which is clinically proven to help reduce itchy skin. Colloidal oatmeal is not what you eat for breakfast! The most important part is that it dramatically reduced the number of razor bumps on my neck (my neck was bad, even when I only shaved with the grain).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last hint is that although I used to buy the Aveeno brand, I found a generic brand that is just as good for half the price. I definitely hit a &amp;#34;bullseye&amp;#34; when I went to a certain big red store to find the generic :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> Great for easily irritated skin. If you&#x27;re like me and get ingrown beard hairs, here&#x27;s a tip. Actually two: a) Use Aveeno shave gel, and b) shave in the morning and at night. It keeps the hairs from growing in overnight.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! ***3 ounce carry on travel size please!!***</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. I have sensitive skin and this totally helps. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all dry in the morning, which is cool.</li>
    <li> Love this shaving cream</li>
    <li> i love this and so does my boyfriend. its just plain gentle, and produces a lot of foam from a little amount of gel. no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Check you local pharmacy for pricing Great product prices too high</li>
    <li> this is the best shaving cream i have ever used, and ive used many from creams to shaving oils and soaps, this is the best..the smell is very good and it leaves your face super smooth..no nicks or burns..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years but and love it.  However, I have had difficulty finding it locally in retail stores.</li>
    <li> Great stuff if you are looking for an odorless shaving cream (which is very hard to find) Expensive, cans last half as long as edge, gillete, but NO SMELL, finally..</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this shave cream, and we have found it last long, smells good, and leaves our skin, smooth, with no irratations.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years because my face likes it. The fragrance free product from Aveeno is even better. They are both great. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Really like this shave gel. Works well. Pleasant fragrance. And no rusty container!  Duh, finally maybe a woman helped design this!  You will not have rusty rings in your shower or tub!</li>
    <li> the best shave cream ever</li>
    <li> I love this shave cream. I love the way it feels and smells.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to most shaving cream that is scented, so this is one of the few creams I can use.  I like that teh gel is a little creamy and the consistancy of toothpast.  It feels good on my face and after I shave I look like Brad Pitt, so I got that going for me...</li>
    <li> I suffer from various skin problems and I find that this shaving cream is actually pretty good on my face. It does not stop irritation 100% but its better than what is out there,</li>
