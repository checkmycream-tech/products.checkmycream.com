      <li>It really help with heat protection on wet hair.</li>
      <li>I use it on my dry hair if I&#x27;m between washes and my hair is looking flat, this fluffs it right back up!</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair.</li>
<li> makes it look thicker and leaves it extremely shiny.</li>
<li> I used a round boar-bristle brush to blow dry my hair after applying the spray and I felt like I just came out of the salon.</li>
<li> This product is half the price it is on Eva nyc&#x27;s website.</li>
<li> My flyaways lay down &amp; there&#x27;s just a very slight hairspray effect.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a little piece of heaven in an 8 oz bottle.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I, too, received this in my Ipsy bag, and agree with the ladies!  It&#x27;s great for my fine hair.  It not only produces a great initial result, but I find my hair is still voluminous after another day or two.  A GREAT addition to my hair care regimen.</li>
    <li> I too got this in my ipsy bag. I love this spray for fine limp hair.  I have been looking for something to work on my hair forever. This really works. The only problem is trying to find it.  I have signed up for email when this come available but it hasn&#x27;t been available yet. If anyone knows of another place to find it please let me know.</li>
    <li> I received the trial size bottle of the Up All Night spray in my February 2015 Ipsy bag, but I was very reluctant to try it as I haven&#x27;t found a product that really gave my thin hair much volume. I decided to randomly try it out today and absolutely LOVE what it did for my hair. You can spray it directly onto your hair as it&#x27;s really watery and not thick like the sprays you have to emulsify in your hands first (the serum-like sprays), so it doesn&#x27;t weigh your locks down or make it feel greasy or sticky. I used a round boar-bristle brush to blow dry my hair after applying the spray and I felt like I just came out of the salon. It also has a light yet pleasant fragrance that my husband actually complimented me on (&amp;#34;Dang, your hair smells good&amp;#34;). I haven&#x27;t tried it on dry hair for revitalization, but even as I type this review (10 hours after using the product) my hair still looks amazing, so I&#x27;m not sure I will ever need to use it on dry hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff adds so much volume. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands and items to help with my fine hair and this stuff works wonders. I have finally found the holy grail of hair volume!!</li>
    <li> got aa sample and i loved it is why order the bigger bottle...  its great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, its the perfect protection and hold for my hair, I have super curly fine blonde hair that I flat Iron on this. I can&#x27;t say how happy I am that I found this stuff. I got it as a sample in Ipsy glam bag and was hooked. I am currently buying this now to have more.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair fuller, and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Works fab for my asian coarse hair.  I have thick hair.  While I don&#x27;t need it for the volume it works great for keeping the curl or a teased up do in place.  Has a pleasant smell as well. Doesn&#x27;t take much either.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome. I&#x27;m not sure if it really did anything spectacular to my hair. My hair is really fine. I usually have to wash it every night and spray it in my hair before bed. It gives me some volume the next day. Oh and did I mention it smells good?</li>
    <li> Best volumizing spray EVER! I live in Bahrain and my hair has been a flat mess but I got this in my February Ipsy bag and immediately fell in love. My hair wasn&#x27;t flat or frizzy for the first time since moving here a year ago. It also doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and smells amazing. Hooked!</li>
    <li> Love it! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I think this is my all-time favorite hair care product.  I have very fine hair and this spray gives me AMAZING volume and makes my hair very shiny.  I also noticed that it helps hold my style after I&#x27;ve flat ironed my hair.  Plus I can&#x27;t say enough about the fragrance - I would spray this on my hair just for the smell.  It&#x27;s a little piece of heaven in an 8 oz bottle.  Hooked for life, I think!!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! When I&#x27;m done drying my hair, I spritz on one or two sprays. My flyaways lay down &amp; there&#x27;s just a very slight hairspray effect. Absolutely would recommend to anyone - male or female.</li>
    <li> So confused. I ordered this product but got a different eva nyc product. It was a rice protein hair spray. Not really happy.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best volumizing sprays I have used! I have fine hair and this does not weigh down my hair or make it look greasy. The smell is pleasant. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I received a sample from Ipsy. It adds more texture and volume to my hair as long as I don&#x27;t use a lot of other products first. Has a nice scent. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample in my Ipsy bag too. I put off trying it but once I did I immediately fell in love! It smells amazing! I&#x27;ve used it on both wet and dry hair. It really help with heat protection on wet hair. I use it on my dry hair if I&#x27;m between washes and my hair is looking flat, this fluffs it right back up! I&#x27;ve ordered the shampoo, conditioner, and dry shampoo to try next!</li>
    <li> I also received this as a trial in an ipsy bag and loved it. I use it on damp or dry hair with the same results. Give a lot of volume with a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a sample from another company then ordered the full size on Amazon. I really like it. I use it to add body to my hair during the blow dry process then again as a finishing spay. Does not leave my hair sticky or too stiff. Has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> Tried it in ipsy bag and live it!</li>
    <li> I first tried a sample size of this product from an online subscription. The sample was only 1 fl oz. but it lasted a very long time. This product is amazing. It gives amazing volume and was an unbeatable price on amazon, the actual website offers the exact same product at double the cost.. This bottle will undoubtedly last a very long time. There is no harsh scent and it is incredibly light weight. So feel free to buy and spread the news because this product is way worth it!</li>
    <li> This spray is light and definitely adds volume to my thin hair.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Adds volume when my dry hair has flattened out and great for adding grip when I want to put it up!</li>
    <li> smells amazing, works awesome! love it.</li>
    <li> I have very thin fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all! It really helps to give my hair body. I originally got it through ipsy and came back for more. I use this daily.</li>
    <li> Really fast shipping! I love this spray. Gives my fine, flat hair some body!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it received great reviews from most everyone, but it&#x27;s not for me.  It left a film on my hands that made me immediately need to wash off, so I can only imagine what residue is on my hair.  I&#x27;m glad it has worked for others, but I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I first received a sample of this in one of my subsicription boxes and I loved it.  This stuff helps give my hair some texture.</li>
    <li> I got this in my iPad bag and it&#x27;s the beat item ipsy has shipped me so far. I have very fine hair and this spray used on wet hair makes it look thicker and leaves it extremely shiny. I would suggest this product to anyone wishing they had thicker fuller hair.</li>
    <li> love love love&lt;br /&gt;gives me volume&lt;br /&gt;were I want it</li>
    <li> Love LOVE LOVE this product!!!!!</li>

    <li> Like others I received this in my February ipsy bag and I love it! It leaves my hair super soft shiny and full of life. I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon has it for such a good price!</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this volumizer! I have tried so many brands and what I like about this one is that it does not make my hair greasy the next day. My hair feels just as clean as the day I washed it. I normally use the catwalk volumizer and I love it but the next day my roots are greasy. Having a 6 month old, this product works for me because I can&#x27;t wash my hair everyday.</li>
    <li> I got the trial size in my Ipsy bag and tried it out. Hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my fine, straight hair. Gives it the texture and volume that I only get after a blow out at the salon. I&#x27;m hooked for life!!!</li>
    <li> This came in my ipsy bag and I immediately fell in love!! This product is half the price it is on Eva nyc&#x27;s website. I hope it&#x27;s the real thing!! Will update!</li>
