    <li> One of my favorite products. I have been using this deep conditioner for years. I took a point away b/c it&#x27;s expensive and I wish it came in a bigger size. I never use regular conditioner b/c it leaves my hair dry and knotty. The smell is nice and I do see a brighter shine.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo + conditioner (Shine and Enhance). My hair are stronger, softer, smell so good... and I noticed a lot of compliments from my friends since I&#x27;m using it ;)</li>
    <li> This Product as with the rest of the beautiful lengths line really worked on my severely damaged and falling out hair. I use the entire line, shampoo, cond.mask and breakage control and the shine conditioner, My hair never looked better and stopped falling out and breaking especially on ends.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner ever created!!  It leaves your hair your silky, very shiny and helps keep it healthy.  I actually use this as a styling product for my hair.  It&#x27;s much better than gel and leaves my looking natural and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene, please, please, please, please bring this back and make it available!!</li>
    <li> Great hair product.  Been using for years  .  Not sold in stores  Def recommend this product.  Worth the purchase .</li>
    <li> Only conditioner I can find that will help fight tangles in the shower.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make this product anymore.  I wish they did.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner but it was discontinued.Pantene THINKS they made a better product,but they are very wrong.I can only find ones that are left. My hair looks great with this conditioner.I will buy whatever is left!</li>
    <li> I am a Pantene Pro-V girl.  This product was removed from the market.  So, I was glad to have found it again. Yea</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner. It makes my hair feel soft! Has a great fragrance &amp; you use only a little for long hair.</li>
    <li> I love Pantene products. Beautiful lengths shine enhance definitely makes my thin hair silky to touch, shiny to look at, and wow my hair smells fantastic. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner out there on store shelves that I have bought &amp; used...  It does what it says on the packaging &amp; makes my hair strong &amp; shiny...</li>
    <li> I wish she hadn&#x27;t bought this on my log-in for me to review.  Especially after putting up a review on car guy stuff.  I can however tell you she loves it and that&#x27;s as far as I&#x27;m going with it.</li>
    <li> This has become to expensive.  I really like it but hey.......I&#x27;m trying something different</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore :(  It is salon strength for a fraction of the price.  I have long hair so I need  A LOT of conditioner.  This was a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a really hard time finding this product in stores and I fear it may have been discontinued. I really like this conditioner. It&#x27;s thick and rich, and it keeps my hair shiny and supple. I order it on Amazon regularly, and have been using it for abotu 3 years. I don&#x27;t notice any difference between the different types (breakage defense vs shine enhance). I just choose any one of the purple tubes. Incidentally, I didn&#x27;t really like the Beautiful Lengths shampoos. I found them a little heavy. I usually use a light daily shampoo and the Beautiful Lengths conditioner, and that combination works well for my hair, which is long and prone to split ends.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner... and it comes in 3 packs on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve ever found to what comes in hair coloring kits...and that stuff rocks.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a conditioner like your coloring kit... try this!</li>
    <li> This is my go to daily conditioner.  It’s gentle and really works.  It’s not heavy and doesn’t weigh my hair down.  The pleasant smell is a plus as well.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, curly/wavy, dry hair.  It gets on my nerves.  This product is so smooth, so perfect, that they should make it in a gallon size !!</li>
    <li> leaves hair soft and shiny! Especially good for thick and coarse hair! Favorite product by Pantene! A must buy. Continue to buy for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo but could no longer find it in the stores.  Go Amazon.  I can&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;find things with them that are no longer availble in Jacksonville, FL stores.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Too bad Pantene took their best product off the store shelves. I wish Pantene would bring this product back.</li>
