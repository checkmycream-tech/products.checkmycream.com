<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great, smells good, I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> After reading all the review and people claiming this to be an imitation of the real Moroccan oil I still went on ahead and gave this a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did cause this is for sure the  real Moroccan oil :-)</li>
    <li> I have tried other brands and Moroccan Oil is the best. My grandmother uses it for her hands and feet to keep them from cracking. I use it on my hair and get compliments daily on how shiny and healthy it looks. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Pretty small for the price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! Smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth.. I originally bought this in the salon and spent a fortune. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to order it through amazon. Highly recommend and will be buying again once I run out!</li>
    <li> It is a denser oil, which must be apply on hair&#x27;s lengths. It is absorbed quickly, leaving hair hydrated, soft and shiny! I have already included it in my day by day hair routine. I totaly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought it to reduce frizz. It does not do much in that regard. However it does keep my hair soft. This is not a replacement for anti frizz products for curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome! I have no complaints about this oil. I put it on the ends of my hair and keeps the frizz away. I love it.</li>
    <li> It is simply the best product I have ever found for my hair, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Price is right</li>
    <li> Have used Moroccan oil (not argon oil, it&#x27;s different) for years.  Every time I try something new I always come back to this.  It smells wonderful and leaves my thick, unruly, frizzy hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Normally ordered the smaller bottle but 1.7 fl oz is worth the price. The whole Moroccanoil line is amazing and I get plenty of compliments on the smell. My curly hair is much more moisturized and it also leaves my hair shiny during the days when I blow out my hair. Just a small amount goes an extremely long way with this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. When I originally cut my hair really short I used it to help with styling but since I bleach my hair all the time I use this product before blow drying, after I&#x27;ve applied heat protectant and find that I don&#x27;t get the nasty dead ends that people typically get. I LOVE the way it smells too! Amazing product and I recommend it to anyone. Tip is to not use too much so you don&#x27;t get that greasy look, and it may be hard to measure the right amount at first but you quickly learn that less is more. I also use this on my extensions.</li>
    <li> Great hair product, just use sparingly or you will be washing your hair all over again</li>
    <li> excellent product and reasonable price! i will be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This smells good and makes my hair feel wonderful. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love it!!! Love the smell and feel on skin and mainly hair. (Used on African American hair)</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and good price without shipping, I really love the silky feeling without reduce my hair volume,  I will order again!</li>
    <li> I love this product it is amazing!!!! Smells delicious! Keeps your hair feeling smooth and healthy.. Great for all hair types!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I color my hair and it has a tendacy to be dry, this has made my hair so healthy,shiny and silky and smells terrific. I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil for at least 5 years and it really works to tame my hair and make it more manageable.  I am 56 yrs. old and decided to stop dying my hair 4 years ago and will never dye it again.  My gray hair is thick and course but with the right products it is well controlled.  I tried the Light Moroccan Oil but it did not quite do the trick.  I have also tried Organics Argan Oil and that was too thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone no matter your hair type.  The friends that I suggested try this are very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It is the best out there. It is so light and smell absolutely great. It only takes a small amount, to make your hair shine and look amazing. It takes away any fly away hair and smooths it down to a beautiful shine without any oily look. It is a product I will use forever.</li>
    <li> I resisted purchasing this product because it&#x27;s almost all silicone so I didn&#x27;t see anything particularly special about it.  I use a good, cheap silicone serum (Got2b Shine Serum) that eliminates frizz completely and doesn&#x27;t contain any heavy oil.  In fact, it&#x27;s almost pure silicone except for a very slight fragrance.  But curiosity got the best of me and I purchased a very small size of Moroccan Oil Treatment just to see what all the hype was about.  I applied it the same way I do my usual serum, to damp (not wet) hair concentrating on the midlengths and ends and, when almost all the product on my hands is gone, I run my palms over the top layer of my hair.  I use about a nickel size dollop for my below shoulder length hair.  It is very important to stay away from the roots, as this will lead to greasiness and you&#x27;ll have to go back and wash your hair all over again, lol!  I then added my usual styling product, Living Proof No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray, and let my hair air dry overnight.  In the morning, I use a curling iron to create loose waves and then run my fingers through to loosen up the curls so that I end up with the beachy look.  The Moroccan Oil Treatment does protect against thermal damage, as does my usual silicone serum.  My hair turned out really nice and it was shiny and soft and the waves held all day.  So, I figured the results were exactly the same as with my usual serum, so I thought that I would return the Moroccan Oil to the salon.  However, on makeupalley.com, many of the posters were adamant that this serum improves the hair&#x27;s condition over time.  This is due, they speculate, to the argan oil.  So I decided not to return it and to keep using it to see whether this was true.  I only wash my hair two to three times a week so it took me quite some time to derive some additional benefit from this serum.  But I have noticed that my hair is less dry and that it holds up well in the summer humidity (it does this with the other serum too but my ends still felt a bit dry).  So I guess everyone is right.  This serum does contain hydrating ingredients that penetrate the hair shaft, despite the silicone base.  However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll repurchase this item because it&#x27;s very expensive and the deals to be found on Amazon could be counterfeit and I&#x27;m not willing to fork over big time cash for a fake.  So it&#x27;s either go back to the salon where I purchased this, or make do with my usual $5 serum.  Although this product definitely performed well (hence the five star rating), I simply can&#x27;t justify $40 for a serum when the cheap stuff works just as well for frizz and thermal protection.  Instead, I will put it on my wish list and maybe some family member will surprise me at Christmastime.  But if you want the same results and, like me, aren&#x27;t willing for fork out big bucks, then Got2b Shine Serum will be a godsend for you.  I use the same amount and apply it the exact same way.  I even use a drop or two in my palms to go over the finished style for added shine.  I will enjoy using the rest of Moroccan Oil but I think I&#x27;ll reserve it for special occasions.  I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend more for the larger size.  There&#x27;s nothing like finding out the coveted expensive product produces the exact same results as the drugstore brand.  My bad.  I definitely recommend this product, but I also highly recommend Got2b.  After all, Got2b is made by Schwartzkopf, which has an expensive line by that name.  However, it seems to me that they would not likely produce two completely different serums, an expensive one and a drugstore version.  It&#x27;s more likely they put the same product into two completely different containers and sell them at different price point.  Meh.  I&#x27;m just glad I can get awesomely wonderful results with a $5 product.  There&#x27;s nothing better than a great drugstore beauty find.y ends still felt a bit dry).

    <li> Awesome product for your hair!!!! I use it every time I wash my hair and i makes it very smooth and silky!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It works, buy I don&#x27;t think it is as magical as described in  those overwhelming reviews. Plus, my hair some thins become sticky after I applied, I don&#x27;t know this is because of the product or my hair.</li>
    <li> It does make my hair dry faster and I don&#x27;t use a hair dryer as often. But I still need a gloss to add shine. I lie it, but it&#x27;s not a necessity and there are cheaper versions that work just as well.  It still has the extra ingredients and is not 100% oil.</li>
    <li> I started using argan oil on my hair 2 or 3 years ago, after a friend recommended Moroccanoil.  However, since I couldn&#x27;t find Moroccanoil in any local stores I opted instead for a far less expensive brand of argan oil available at a local beauty supply store.  Actually, I switched back and forth between two brands of argan oil and found them indistinguishable.  And, once I finally got the knack of just how much to use so that my hair wouldn&#x27;t look oily I was happy enough with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I saw Moroccanoil in the window of a beauty salon in the local mall, and decided to give it a try.  I really wanted to know if there was a difference and if Moroccanoil was worth the much higher price (it is about 7x or 8x the price of the \\&quot;generic\\&quot; argan oils I had been using).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment I opened the bottle I could see a drastic difference.  First, Moroccanoil is much thicker.  And, amazingly, it never makes my hair shiny or oily looking (the cheaper argan oils never made my hair actually oily, they just made it look oily if I used even slightly too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used Moroccanoil a few times so I can&#x27;t as yet honestly say if it produces better results over the long run.  However, just based on the differences I&#x27;ve seen so far I consider it superior.  Even given the much higher price, I probably won&#x27;t go back to the cheaper brands of argan oil.</li>
    <li> I love the oil treatment it is amazing and does what it says it does. I am im&lt;br /&gt;Love. Szing</li>
    <li> Me and my daughter loves this stuff our hair has never felt so soft especially our ends have to try it</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I use it every day before I blow dry my hair or even if I leave it curly.</li>
    <li> This article is best recommended. It really was what I was looking through Amazon I found what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is so light it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all in my hair. It also smells SO good. I have tried other hair oils and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth it! And the smell is divine! Many compliments from the ladies who catch a whiff of it! : )</li>
    <li> My title says it all. My hairdresser swears by this stuff and I can see why.  Wouldn&#x27;t do my hair without it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It is simply amazing and smells great! I had gotten a small bottle and used it everyday about two or three years ago. I wish I could&#x27;ve had the money sooner to buy it again and again. But I must admit, not using this product for such a long time, made me miss and love it so much more. After one use (in over a year and a half) made my hair so smooth, added extra shine without it looking oily. It is simply amazing! I&#x27;ve tried other products and they either smelled terrible, didn&#x27;t work, or made my hair extremely oily. But I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I received an amazon gift card as a gift and automatically my first thought was to order this product. All it takes is a dime size amount in your hand and that does the trick (I have medium-long hair). This bottle will last me a life time and I am truly thrilled!!</li>
    <li> Works great for my coarse hair!!  My not only feels soft it even looks healthier! I am not sure why this brand works better than other argon oils but I love it!  I will continue using item as long as it is available, I hope this selling will continue to carry this brand!!</li>
    <li> The payment and shipment worked really well and the product is excellent!! Leaves my hair smoth and soft!! It&#x27;s easy to aply!</li>
    <li> Amazing oil! Have used some of the others that have come out recently but have&lt;br /&gt;gone back to Moroccan every time. I have thick hair and its hard to keep volume.&lt;br /&gt;Moroccan never weighs it down. Also if any is left on my hands it goes directly&lt;br /&gt;to my elbows, knees etc.  Get it for a much better price through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like that they carry a 20 oz. now</li>
    <li> love it, its perfect. gives my hair heat protection, shine and an amazing smell. obsessed.</li>
    <li> Excellent service &amp; product</li>
    <li> correct time and product</li>
    <li> Love! Just a tiny amount goes a long way! Hair is soft and cuts down drying time if applied when wet.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 50ml bottle and they sent me a bottle which is going to expire in 2 months. I am surely not going to use it up before it expires. Besides, the oil is just ok and doesnt make my hair shiny as i expected.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Makes your hair so shiny and soft.  I&#x27;d recommend it to everybody especially with long hair.</li>
    <li> I got one for each of my sisters (I already had it). They love it! I makes their hair shiny without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this product and I really, really tried to like it. But honestly I can&#x27;t say that it is any better than what you can get at your local grocery store. I color my hair monthly and style every day, so I need that extra moisture/healing as much as I can get, and this product offers very little of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have long, thick hair. I use it every time I wash my hair. It help my hair to lay nicer and look smoother. It also makes my air feel softer.</li>
    <li> Best product I have ever used! I have very thick, coarse, curly hair and this is the only thing that really works miracles on my hair. A little pricey but well worth it!!</li>
    <li> Wife love&#x27;s this. She wants to order more. Really controls frizz (her words).</li>
    <li> Great price and came quick def will order from this seller again !!!best product to blow out kinky curly hair but u only need a small amount don&#x27;t over use hair will look greasy go by amount of hair u have ..</li>
    <li> This was the first of the Moroccanoil products that I tried. I really like it. It moisturizes and it adds body to hair. It is not greasy, just moisturizing. Great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Smells great and leaves my hair really nice &amp; smooth. I have medium length hair (between my shoulders &amp; elbows) &amp; generally just use a dime size for the ends and through my hair - works GREAT &amp; isn&#x27;t too greasy.</li>
    <li> This product was the LIGHT version, which was not stated in the title nor text. Thus, you had to read the bottle label to find out what it really was.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccan Oil!  It is great for my fine hair - doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.  I have bought this product from my salon at a much higher price.  This product is the same as what is at my salon, but considerably cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It brings moisture back in to my hair</li>
    <li> Great product as always, best price I could find!</li>
    <li> Would definitely repurchase this item again. Happy Customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Helps my super damaged hair.</li>
    <li> When I got the morrocan oil it wasn&#x27;t the light version of it like it says in the description but I still like it anyways.</li>
    <li> Nothing special. I got a cheaper moroccan oil from Walmart to compare and the results were the same. Next time, instead of spending $25 for a small bottle here, I&#x27;ll just run to Walmart to buy the $6.00 bottle.</li>
    <li> Something my mom has used for quite a while on her white hair..loves.</li>
    <li> when i got it, it already expired 4 months ago. I just too lazy to return it. I emailed them,but they said if you do not like it, please return!!!! what&#x27;s the hill!</li>
