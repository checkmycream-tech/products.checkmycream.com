<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this product for three days and I definitely see a difference! After having a baby,as women know, sometimes things don&#x27;t look the same. This lotion is already improving my stomach and thighs :D . I also had a mishap with the shipping address, but they were quick to fix it. Thank you again so much!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product and it smells pretty good too! Can&#x27;t wait to get my next bottle!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  been using Luxe Formula for the last several months. I&#x27;m usually embarrassed by my legs in shorts. Since using Luxe my legs have a smoother appearance. Amazing  product!&lt;br /&gt;Melanie Troup,Texas</li>
    <li> I have tried this product it amazing. I&#x27;ve had stretch mark from my two kids had not been able to get rid of them but this product has made my skin soft and stretch marks less noticeable. I love it. I will recommend this product to my daughter after she has her baby. She will love the results.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. Smells nice and leaves a nice silky smooth finish. I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a week and I swear it&#x27;s working already. I like cellulite products that don&#x27;t plump you up. This does the opposite.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lotion!</li>
    <li> Great  product!!&lt;br /&gt;Already notice positive differences!!</li>
    <li> Omg ladiessss I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day, morning and night for a week and a half.  It&#x27;s a must buy this cream works magical. ...to see results u have to massage really deep. Every night my husband massage my thighs and other areas that&#x27;s needs attention and I can tell you this works amazing! ! I have already order 3 bottles incase they run out of stuck! !!!!</li>
    <li> I used the entire bottle and no difference at all.  Smells nice...</li>
    <li> One of my sorority sisters gave me a bottle and it is the best gift that I&#x27;ve ever received! I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day with the exfoliating gloves for about two weeks now. I&#x27;ve seen such a huge difference in such a small amount of time.  Definitely a product worth the money!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this cream!  It truly works and the results very noticeable.  My skin firmed and tightened up, dimples went away and I generally firmed up!  I am truly amazed at how wonderful the results are, I will continue to buy and use this product and would highly recommend it to all women with cellulite problems!</li>
    <li> I love the way this lotion makes my skin feel -- firm and not saggy, youthful and not aging. I can definitely see an improvement in the quality of my skin tone. It also helps with stretch marks. I am so thankful for this product.</li>
    <li> excellent product. helps a lot to the problem of cellulite, significant changes are .</li>
    <li> I started using this product again about 8 weeks ago, and I am very pleased with the results. My skin feels and looks firmer. The texture of my skin is softer and more even in tone. I also like the light fragrance of the product. I will continue using this product, and highly recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This formula is just the perfect balance of luxuriant feel and non-greasy absorbency.  As a stickler against lotions that &amp;#34;linger,&amp;#34; I love how easily this product is worked into the skin.  I can feel it working right from the start... From awakening the senses with its powerful essential oils and increasing circulation to problem areas, I have no doubt that my skin will soon reflect the results it already feels!  Thank you for creating such great product!</li>
    <li> Love love love. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 and 145 lbs. My thighs and arms are my problem areas and I&#x27;ve never tried a product that has worked so well. Within days, I could notice an improvement on the texture of my thighs. After weeks of using Luxe Spa, the only thing I regretted was not taking photos before I started to compare. I recommend taking photos and measurements before because you are going to be amazed at the inch loss and texture improvement!! Wow!! Life long customer!</li>
    <li> Was concerned about spending money on a product I&#x27;ve never used before. Love the results after only a week and half. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My stretch marks from 3 children are fading quickly and my skin tone has improved so much! I have very little &amp;#34;free time&amp;#34; but this fits right into my routine. I lather up my backside and tummy twice a day and it takes no time at all. The results are amazing and it smells good too! I am excited to see future improvements as well!</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Great results</li>
    <li> I have tried other high quality brand products but none have produced the results that this product has for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years.  This product moisturizes, is mildly scented with very natural ingredients, and above all, REALLY WORKS!  I have seen a marked improvement in cellulite reduction/disappearance and firming of skin not seen with use of any other product. It goes on smooth and absorbs nicely.  I have used on thighs, hips, and tummy as well as neck.  As with any such product, you do need to use this product for a period of time before experiencing desired results, so if you think you will get immediate results after one application, there is no product that will do that!  The product is a great value for the quality and results you will experience.</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel really soft.  I did not see a difference in the appearance of my skin; however, I love the smell of the lotion and the way it makes my skin feel.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several months. I&#x27;m A healthy, active 60  year old who has been wearing Bermuda shorts for the past few summers to hide my cellulite. I decided to give this product a try. I figured &amp;#34;what did I have too loose besides my cellulite&amp;#34;. Well, I&#x27;m sure glad I did😊. I&#x27;m now wearing shorter shorts. Proud to show my thighs. Not bad for a 60 year old. Try it ladies you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect but after debating for a few weeks I broke down and bought a bottle. I loved it, the results were almost overnight. After 2 full weeks of just rubbing it onto my stomach, I saw the full results. My stretch marks are almost gone and my skin is smoother. It also feels tighter. I bought another bottle and will contunue to use it just for peace of mind to maintain the amazing results I have seen!</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist I have seen first hand the undisputable results of this creme. Many of my clients use it daily and it has changed not only the texture of their skin but the tightness as well. I even think it works well as a scar reduction remedy. Really great stuff. Worth every penny. Smells amazing! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. I had been looking for something like this for so long and I have finally found it! Used it before competing in swimsuit competitions and pageants, worked like a charm. My skin never looked so firm and smooth. Smells great too unlike some of the other creams I tried</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and absolutely LOVE the results!!  It smoothes and firms the skin - not just where the cellulite is located, but all over the body if you use it that way (which I do).  I am in my 50&#x27;s and the sags, dimples and lumpy looking skin really bothered me.  But now, my legs look 15 years younger (no lie - especially from the back), and the skin under my arms (affectionately known as \\&quot;chicken wings\\&quot; - you know what I mean Ladies...) is more defined and sculpted.  I LOVE this lotion and highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I just had a baby and had a significant amount of loose skin in all the areas expected!  I began using this cream approximately a month ago, and to my astonishment this cream has been working wonders!  I have noticed a drastic change in the elasticity of my skin.  It has tightened up quite nicely and I am an in amazement of how well this product works!  I have been recommending it to anyone who will listen!  It&#x27;s awesome!!!!</li>
    <li> I buy this at a spa in Houston and it&#x27;s hard to get to-this makes ordering it much easier!&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is awesome! Love the way my skin feels long after I out it on. Smells awesome! My legs look better than they have in years. One suggestion is to really follow the instructions. I didn&#x27;t exfoliate at first and once I did I really saw changes in my skin texture. It&#x27;s pricey but I gave it a 5 because it is really worth it.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It is a miracle in a bottle and it actually works.</li>
    <li> Very smooth, wonderful smell. My skin is better after a couple of weeks of applying twice daily. Using my hubby&#x27;s account to post today- it&#x27;s rare that I do this. Glad I tried it and will continue to use it. Gave it a 4 because nothing is perfect!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Ooh La La&amp;#34; was introduced to me by a girlfriend. I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking for it, but now that I have found it I can&#x27;t imagine my daily beauty regimen without it! In just a few minutes twice daily I have noticed a slimming effect on both my backside and my stomach. It is definitely a product that gives you a massive &amp;#34;bang for your buck.&amp;#34; With just a quarter size amount you can easily cover your butt and upper legs. One more quarter-size amount and your tummy is good to go as well. Needless to say, my boyfriend is always more than willing to offer his services as my personal &amp;#34;Ooh La La&amp;#34; spreader... At the end of the day, I&#x27;m like a lot of working women out there. Trying to find the time to include a workout within the rest of my day is sometimes difficult to do. By slightly modifying my diet and using this awesome product I have seen an impact already! I can&#x27;t wait to see the results as my use of &amp;#34;Ooh La La&amp;#34; continues.</li>
    <li> It Works!! After being skeptical of all cellulite beauty products, I finally found the One.  I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell but quite the opposite, it smells great.  Easy to use and fast results. I would recommend to all my friends...</li>
    <li> Love how the lotion lightened my stretch marks on my stomach, cant even tell i had them!! And I love the natural scent. I use it all over now.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  A friend of mine gave me a bottle and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  After about 6 weeks my skin was noticeably tighter and smooth.  The texture is light and silky and the scent is amazing.  (It reminds me of an Aveda type scent that just smells natural and not overbearing.)  Don&#x27;t forget to use it twice a day and definitely take before pictures so you can appreciate the transformation.</li>
    <li> As a woman(using my husbands account), it is nice to know that there is a more natural solution to dealing with not so smooth legs ;-). This is an affordable and easy way to improve your legs where exercise won&#x27;t penetrate.</li>
    <li> This product works great! within two weeks I started to see results, which only made me want to keep using it! I have tried any other similar products but this one seemed to work the best for me! My mother has tried it as well and has gotten remarkable results! We will be life long users!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and how my skin feels. I look smoother already. Very luxurious. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great formula! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and can already see the difference. I&#x27;ve been using it on my stomach, legs, and arms twice a day. The biggest change I can see is on my stomach. It looks ten times better than before. My arms and legs look noticeably different too. My sister commented on how good my legs looked yesterday, and I hadn&#x27;t even told her I was using this lotion. I love how it smells too!</li>
    <li> Hi just started using this product an I already notice a difference. So happy I tried it an will reorder! Lisa</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and approximately 20 lbs overweight.  I have been using this product continuously for about 5 months.  I had hoped that it would have helped more with the cellulite on both of my upper legs.  With that said, I do believe if I started to eat healthier foods and exercise more that in conjunction with this product my cellulite would diminish some, not all.  What this product has done for me is make my overall skin appearance look younger and feel smoother.  Plus it has a nice scent.  I WILL continue to purchase this product.  Note:  I have also used products by Bliss, Dermadoctor and Clarins and this one is by far better.  Make sure you exfoliate before applying.  It makes a difference for me.</li>
    <li> I just used the luxe spa formula no 33 and after following directions which come with purchase, yes I did actually feel tightening! I will most certainly continue using the product twice daily.After my first month of use I will post a photo of my progress! I love the scent as it smells pleasantly! Marelise Williams</li>
    <li> I bought the product three weeks ago and I already see the results on my thighs and my breast.  It&#x27;s even better if you incorporate exercising while using the lotion.. I came back to  purchased another bottle and they are completely sold out. I&#x27;m hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kaye;-)</li>
    <li> I had a thigh lift 2 years ago. Let&#x27;s just say it did not turn out how I had hoped. Over the past 3  months I have used luxe spa formula on my thighs and butt. I can totally see a difference! My skin is tighter and my legs are much firmer than before. I would suggest this lotion to all my friends. I love it.</li>
    <li> Got this about a week ago and love it already! Smells divine. A friend got it and he used it for his stretch marks from competitive weight lifting. I thought if it made such a difference for him...I had to try it! Love it so far. Skin is already smoother.</li>
    <li> I love This!! This stuff actually works plus makes your skin so soft! I can&#x27;t go a day without using it, the overall texture of my skin has transformed and i love it! I had some dimples on my upper thigh and now, after a few weeks, it&#x27;s like they were never there at all! This stuff is definitely worth it!!! MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> Best stuff I have ever used! Smells great and my skin texture looks so much better!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! It is amazing..... I get it at my dermatologist office in Louisiana! So happy to see it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I have had a problem for years with my skin not being tight anymore and with post pregnancy stretch marks and cellulite. I have tried every cream/lotion I could find, but have never been able to see any improvement. A friend recently told me about this &amp;#34;miracle formula&amp;#34; and we decided to try it together. To our amazement, it worked! We&#x27;ve been using it just over 3 weeks and we can both see significant reduction in stretch marks and cellulite. I also have seen a huge difference in my scar from my C section (I didn&#x27;t see that coming)! This product is well worth the money. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I wanted to get this as a gift for a friend but the reviews are from too many unverified buyers. Not sure what to think</li>
    <li> So happy to see the product on Amazon. The only place I have ever seen this is at a Austin Spa. This stuff works wonders on my cellulite and after dropping 30 pounds of fat, I really needed that. I am still on my journey and needless to say I would like continue using. Thank GOD its accessible now. Summer Season here I come!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  For years, I have been plagued by ugly cellulite, and stretch marks, but this product has made a dramatic change in both.  Almost immediately, I saw improved elasticity in my skin.  Within a few days, you could really see a difference.  In one week, my stretch marks had faded.  It&#x27;s been one month now, and I am SO happy with the results.  I put on a bikini for the first time in years without hating how my bottom half looked.  I actually looked good.  The older stretch marks will need more cream, but look so much better than before.  I will continue to use this product.  It works and it smells wonderful.  I use it all over my body.  If you&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with stretch marks and cellulite,  buy this one.  It works! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Let me just get this out of the way, I am a guy who purchased this product that seems to be marketed to women only, I also struggle with cellulite in places most women tend to have it. I received my bottle today, and also took &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures. So far my skin feel so smooth, baby like I would say! I can&#x27;t wait to update you guys on my results. I doubt the company will use my pictures as I am a male, and I did take a picture of my bare but.  Update: Since I posted this review, the company sent me a free travel sized (looks bigger than travel sized). I opened my mailbox and found my treasure! So far it&#x27;s been a few days, and I already see some results, I do have a lot of cellulite, so I do hope I see dramatic results on week 8.</li>
    <li> I tried it for the first time about 2 months ago , and im in love with this product. The results are amazing, I have 4 kids that left me full of stretch marks, and this cream has been amazing on my skin. It has diminished the cellulite on my thighs as well. My skin feels a lot tighter and softer, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Finally something that works....a must try and buy...</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION!  While I try to focus on my problem areas like my backside and tummy, I find myself using this lotion starting at my neck all the way down to my toes!  The smell is luxurious and the feel of it is magnificent!  Many lotions are often too thick or thin leaving your skin with a greasy feel, but not Ooh La La!  The consistency is perfect leaving my skin with a refreshed smooth feel.</li>
    <li> I just received this product  3 days ago and started using it right away.  So far I am happy with the results.  I&#x27;m 48 years old and I work out and watch my diet but I still struggle with loose skin and cellulite.  I&#x27;m not looking for miracles but I do want to see the little changes that will help me feel a little bit more confident in my bikini.  I love the way my skin feels, very soft and smooth.  I do notice a bit of tightening and I&#x27;m sure that the two more weeks of using this product will give me what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning and at night.  I was told to make sure that I exfoliate my skin with a wash cloth in the shower before I use it to get the best results.  I&#x27;m sure it would be fine if you skip that  step.  Make sure you do a good job of massaging it in completely in your problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;I will give another review right before I go on my trip in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the smell is very wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while and have seen wonderful results.  The results are clear, even my children have complimented me.</li>
    <li> Really love this product! My legs started feeling tighter within a few weeks of use, and I had some small red stretch marks on my hips which reduced in appearance upon my first application. I will be writing a rave review for my blog, however the price can be a bit high, which would be my only drawback. I would imagine, if you use the product conservatively you should be able to make the bottle last :)</li>
    <li> OK, LET ME TELL YOU, THIS STUFF IS MAGIC. I TRIED MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT ANTI CELLULITE CREAMS AND THIS ONE ACTUALLY WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;I AM FAIRLY SMALL LADY, ABOUT 120-122, BUT I ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEMS WITH ORANGE PEEL IN DEFERENT PARTS OF MY BODY. NOTHING WOULD REALLY HELPED ME TO GET RID OF THIS PROBLEM.&lt;br /&gt;ONE OF MY COWORKERS SUGGESTED TO TRY THIS CREAM AND I AM GLAD I DID. THE SKIN IS VELVET AND SMOOTH NOW, PLUS THE CREAM SMELLS YUMMY. IT TOOK ABOUT 6 WEEKS FOR ME TO SEE GREAT RESULTS, BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT AND THEN BUY SOME MORE.&lt;br /&gt;I CANT WAIT TO WEAR THAT NEW SKIMPY BIKINI NEXT WEEK AND SHOW OFF.&lt;br /&gt;LADIES, DONT WAIT AND GET IT, SUMMER IS ALMOST HERE :-))))</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to all of my clients at my med spa... we offer laser treatments that help cellulite, and I always include the lotion with the treatment because the results from the lotion are undeniable! The difference is dramatic, to say the least. I had no idea a lotion could be so potent (in a good way) and effective. Almost every client of mine purchases the lotion for home use, and they continue to buy bottle after bottle as their results continue to improve.  I also love that there are no harmful chemicals used in the product. Did I mention that it smells DELICIOUS?? I always have a bottle at home for myself, and I use it every day.  It&#x27;s a MUST-TRY if cellulite, stretchmarks, or loose skin plague your confidence!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little weary again cellulite reducing products as none have worked for me in the past.  So when a good friend told me about Ooh La La, I reluctantly purchased the product.  I reviewed the ingredients and thought at the very least it could be a good moisturizer.  I have to say that after 4 weeks of using it, I am sooo impressed!!!!  I suffer from stretch marks and cellulite from birthing 3 kids and I can see a great improvement in their appearance around my stomach and bottom! I&amp;#34;m so excited about this product I started to using it all over my body. Can&#x27;t wait to see what I look like in 4 more weeks!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This cream did nothing for me. I am physically active woman with areas of cellulite and this cream wasn&#x27;t magical, wasn&#x27;t helpful, just very expensive for no results. The cream felt like any other cream applied to the body. I am not sure any cream will work but there are many other cheaper options to try.</li>
    <li> Love love this cellulite cream!! I would highly recommend this cream to anyone who is looking to firm and get rid of cellulite. You will see results in the first 2 weeks of use!!</li>
    <li> I get this product locally here in San Antonio Texas!!! I&#x27;ve seen my body change for the better in the most profound way! The c-section scar has basically disappeared and my stretch marks from the 80#&#x27;s I gained while pregnant have improved drastically! My confidence has gone up and I&#x27;m no longer afraid of the bikini Blues. Thank you for the confidence!!! Highly recommend this product!!! Xoxo #luxe no.33</li>
    <li> 5 for shipping ahead of delivery date and for using it for 2 weeks now, beyond that, I&#x27;ll have to write later after this bottle is gone. (for the money this cost it better work)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results I was looking for yet! It&#x27;s my very first time so I honestly don&#x27;t know what to think of the product;( ! It&#x27;s crazy how a lot of people are talking and swear that Luxe Spa Formula is working for them! I don&#x27;t see it yet! I will keep using as it is recommended;)</li>
