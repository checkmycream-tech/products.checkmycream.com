      <li>The Bumble and Bumble gentle shampoo and conditioner is the best!</li>
      <li>I liked the smell so on a whim I bought some.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say before I used this product I did not believe in any miracle shampoos or beauty products.  </li>
      <li>Best use with combination B&amp;B super rich conditioner.</li>
      <li>Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo - it is the best shampoo available.  </li>
      <li>It is really light on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all - recommend more of the bumble and bumble products to anyone!</li>
      <li>I have since ordered two more bottles through Bumble&#x27;s website.  </li>
      <li>so I ordered amazon which I love.</li>
      <li>Been using this product for years &amp; this is nothing like the authentic product.</li>
      <li>The aroma of many products that are supposed to be \\&quot;attractive\\&quot; are offensively potent.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if B&amp;B changed the formulation, but the bottle I got has a much more watery consistency than the one I purchased from the salon.</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny and so healthy.</li>
      <li>- I love how this product smells.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently, I had our son order two more bottles through Amazon and when it came in today, my son asked if I had read any of the reviews on this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My all tme favorite shampoo is by Satinique brand.</li>
      <li>It keeps your hair cleaner longer and gives it more body and shine.  </li>
      <li>But for the price I&#x27;d expect better.</li>
      <li>Many shampoos that have the moisture my hair craves, also, leaves a residue of shampoo, but this isn&#x27;t the case.   </li>
      <li>Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo is the best for extremely sensitive scalps and skin.  </li>
      <li>This is probably one of the best shampoos I have tried for everyday use</li>
      <li>I also use \\&quot;Gentle\\&quot; conditioner that goes with this shampoo, and also their light styling spray before blow drying.</li>
      <li>I bought a bottle at the store and brought it home to compare - and the bottle was definitely filled with a cheaper shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo/Super Rich Conditioner is the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my hair in a long time.</li>
      <li>every couple of washes, and it leaves my hair feeling really nice, clean, soft &amp; shiny.</li>
      <li>I pair the shampoo with [[ASIN:B000BIZSWQ Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner, 8-Ounce Bottle]].  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my not so healthy highlighted hair.</li>
      <li>I feel like this product actually makes my hair look healthy!</li>
      <li>You might watch out though if you skip a day between washes because the conditioner is really rich and can make your hair look a little greasy/slept in style(which works well with wavy hair) but probably not too good with straight fine hair.</li>
      <li>The BB gentle shampoo claims that it&#x27;s gentle but felt like I was washing with something very stripping kind of like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
      <li>I definitely think it works well, but it wasn&#x27;t amazing.</li>
      <li>Its worth the money.</li>
      <li>I really have been enjoying this product,and officially fallen for my Gentle Shampoo-</li>
      <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather much and my hair ended up feeling not so clean.  </li>
      <li>After just the first wash, I could feel my hair softened and became more like my old hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and gentle, yet cleans my hair very well.  </li>
      <li>Very gentle for colored hair.</li>
      <li>Also I am really glad that someone recently  mentioned to me  </li>
      <li>I have never received this many compliments on my hair on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;moisturing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners but was always still left with frizz.</li>
      <li>It smelled and felt like Pantene Pro V. I tried using it too, just too be sure and my hair feels completely different too after using this.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shampoo and I have used it for several years.</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo and the matching super rich conditioner at a local salon.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the B&amp;B Gentle shampoo I have used many times before.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used and even though it&#x27;s expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After receiving the first couple of bottles from this company, I noted immediately that the fragrance was almost over-powering, NOT something I had ever noticed with Bumble&#x27;s Gentle shampoo before.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and color it;  have been using this shampoo for the last 10 years.  </li>
      <li>For the consumers concerned with their health, this product is gentle on your body.</li>
      <li>I have purchased Bumble&#x27;s Gentle Shampoo for years, but through a salon I used to go to.  </li>
      <li>That ingredient is VERY drying to your hair.</li>
      <li>It truly does have a gentle scent.</li>
      <li>My salon was out of gentle, this bottle was for me</li>
      <li>I knew before I even opened the bottle--it was pearlescent and the real stuff isn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Speaking of money, the shampoo can be purchased for $14.67, which is much pricier than any bargain brand out there.</li>
      <li>What I received is NOT Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I should have just driven across town for the real thing.</li>
      <li>I just bought this Gentle Shampoo and the Deeep Conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo for over 10 years.  </li>
      <li>( really shiny)</li>
      <li>I have been using bumble and bumble gentle shampoo for over 6 years.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a shampoo that is gentle on the hair.</li>
      <li>The scent was very perfumey...</li>
      <li>THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY A FRAUDULENT PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>This company really should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
      <li>I have been using Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo for years, so imagine my shock when I opened this</li>
      <li>OR ...I was scammed and this was NOT Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo.  </li>
      <li>It works really well ( for me) with the Color Support Conditioner  Conditioner OR the Nanoworks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other B&amp;B combos and this is my favorite.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product that arrived is 100% definitely NOT Bumble and bumble shampoo. It smells totally different, has a totally different consistency, and even looks different than the real stuff.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if B&amp;B changed the formulation, but the bottle I got has a much more watery consistency than the one I purchased from the salon. It also does not smell the same.</li>
    <li> I wake up in the morning and my hair is a frizzy mess. After using this shampoo for six months, I have found that I need not dread dread-knots. This shampoo leaves me frizz-free until the next time I shower.   I&#x27;m not going to lie and say that it&#x27;s perfect for all hair types, it&#x27;s probably not, but if you have long, thick, slightly wavy hair like mine, this product is for you. The product leaves my hair soft and without frizz or tangles. Many shampoos that have the moisture my hair craves, also, leaves a residue of shampoo, but this isn&#x27;t the case.   The scent of the product is heavenly. The aroma of many products that are supposed to be \\&quot;attractive\\&quot; are offensively potent. This product lives up to its name, though, in the way it treats your hair, as well as the way it smells. It truly does have a gentle scent. The subtle fragrance of honey, although faint, keeps your hair smelling fresh for days.   The 8oz. bottle is almost perfect. A problem arises as you reach the end of the bottle. When there is only an inch of shampoo left, I find myself attempting to prop the bottle up up-side-down. The cap, however, is very small and it is hard to get the bottle to stay. I end up mixing the last bit with water to get every last drop to get my money&#x27;s worth.   Speaking of money, the shampoo can be purchased for $14.67, which is much pricier than any bargain brand out there. With its moisturizing powers, however, I find myself using less than I would of any bargain brand.   For the consumers concerned with their health, this product is gentle on your body. It is free of any harsh chemicals. There are neither sulfates, nor parabens.   This product nourishes your hair, smells wonderful and is free of chemicals. The only drawbacks are the difficulty in getting the last drop of shampoo and the high price. Overall, this product gets a 9 out of 10. It is the best shampoo that I have found to date.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo. Have tried others, but just keep coming back. My hair is always soft &amp; shiny.</li>
    <li> I also have their conditioner - love this shampoo!  I have the Cream de coco and absolutely LOVE IT!  It is really light on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all - recommend more of the bumble and bumble products to anyone!</li>
    <li> Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo is the best for extremely sensitive scalps and skin.  I am allergic to a common chemical that is in a lot of shampoos, even fancy salon formulas (it&#x27;s quaternium or polyquaternium....check your bottle!!)because it makes shampoo foam like the commercials.  Bumble and Bumble doesn&#x27;t have this chemical in it, it doesn&#x27;t have a cloying perfume smell, and it cleans your hair beautifully.</li>
    <li> The Bumble and Bumble gentle shampoo and conditioner is the best! I have let my hair grow out to a longer length and this is the only product that I will use. It keeps your hair cleaner longer and gives it more body and shine.  Deb in Janesville, Wisconsin</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading how great it was. It was the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for a hair product because the reviews were so impressive. It is so harsh I can&#x27;t believe they recommend it for treated hair. My hair felt totally stripped and horribly rough.  I will not buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bumble &amp; Bumble products for years--long enough to know when it&#x27;s not the product I ordered. I knew before I even opened the bottle--it was pearlescent and the real stuff isn&#x27;t. The consistency was also a dead giveaway. So lame. I should have just driven across town for the real thing.</li>
    <li> I just bought this Gentle Shampoo and the Deeep Conditioner.  Sadly I was not really impressed with either one.  The shampoo didn&#x27;t lather much and my hair ended up feeling not so clean.  Absolutely not worth the hefty price tag.  I&#x27;m going back to Pantene.</li>
    <li> Love it smells great !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aveda products for years. My salon starting selling B&amp;B and my stylist used Gentile. I liked the smell so on a whim I bought some. I love it. It makes my hair feel so soft. Its worth the money.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way in providing volume and shine.  Very gentle for colored hair. The only fault was that in two separate shipments the cap was not tight and about 1/4 of the shampoo leaked out.</li>
    <li> I have rather wavy hair that is inherently dry for no reason. I&#x27;ve tried many \\&quot;moisturing\\&quot; shampoos and conditioners but was always still left with frizz. The Bumble &amp; Bumble Gentle Shampoo/Super Rich Conditioner is the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my hair in a long time. I&#x27;ve tried other B&amp;B combos and this is my favorite. It cleans and moisturizes so that I can even let my hair air dry and it still looks great. You might watch out though if you skip a day between washes because the conditioner is really rich and can make your hair look a little greasy/slept in style(which works well with wavy hair) but probably not too good with straight fine hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered through Amazon to save some money ... and wound up with shampoo in a B&amp;B bottle that is NOT B&amp;B. It smells and looks like Pantene. It&#x27;s definitely not the B&amp;B Gentle shampoo I have used many times before. I took it to my salon to compare, too -- it looked and smelled completely different.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product from my salon and loved it every time. However, when I purchased it from Amazon this time, it did not work as well. It does not lather well and leaves my hair feeling stripped of moisture, not at all what you would expect from a \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; shampoo. Quite a disapointment.</li>
    <li> I really have been enjoying this product,and officially fallen for my Gentle Shampoo- as it&#x27;s very simple. I rotate it in ( around,  with my Nanoworks,) every couple of washes, and it leaves my hair feeling really nice, clean, soft &amp; shiny.( really shiny) I never worry about buildup with this. Smells pleasant, nice creamy texture &amp; It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll need to travel with. It works really well ( for me) with the Color Support Conditioner  Conditioner OR the Nanoworks (I have just finished my bottle of Creme de Cocoa , but wasn&#x27;t that impressed) Detangles well. Not the HG or ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ll ever need or want, but I will definitely continue to repurchase !! Also I am really glad that someone recently  mentioned to me  the possibility of 2 formulas, mine does NOT have the c-14OLEFIN, listed anywhere in the ingredients. That ingredient is VERY drying to your hair.That is an older formula, but it is still out there-</li>
    <li> product is superb! have colored my hair for years-product makes hair totally manageable. it also helps with shine and texture.</li>
    <li> I definitely think it works well, but it wasn&#x27;t amazing. And again, that smell!! Personal taste I suppose, but I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Good  stuff - good sevice</li>
    <li> Absolute fake product!! Been using this product for years &amp; this is nothing like the authentic product. Ordered from bumble &amp; Bumble website directly after receiving this. First time disappointment with amazon purchase.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for years and LOVED it...but this bottle seemed very different.  The scent was very perfumey...it did not work into a rich lather at all...and left my hair feeling dry!  So, either Bumble and Bumble changed their formula...OR ...I was scammed and this was NOT Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo.  Very disappointed either way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my not so healthy highlighted hair. It is conditioning but not overly to where it ways my fine hair down. This is probably one of the best shampoos I have tried for everyday use and I have tried a lot of expensive &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; brands. I would definitely recommend this one though.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and the matching super rich conditioner at a local salon.  I was very skeptical at first but i thought i would give it a try.  I was desperate for something to salvage my hair.  I had the typical glossy healthy asian hair but after many self inflicted tortures (dyed, highlighted, permed), it was brittle and dry like a wig.  I can honestly say before I used this product I did not believe in any miracle shampoos or beauty products.  After just the first wash, I could feel my hair softened and became more like my old hair.  The difference is kind of like adding clothing softener to your laundry.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to be this good. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I have been using bumble and bumble gentle shampoo for over 6 years. The shampoo I got was in a bumble and bumble bottle, but it was NOT bumble and bumble shampoo. The smell and consistency was all wrong. It smelled and felt like Pantene Pro V. I tried using it too, just too be sure and my hair feels completely different too after using this. THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY A FRAUDULENT PRODUCT. This company really should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best shampoo i&#x27;ve ever used and even though it&#x27;s expensive, it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product goes a long way and it isn&#x27;t bad. But for the price I&#x27;d expect better. IT can actually dry your hair. My all tme favorite shampoo is by Satinique brand. I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Have been using this exclusively for years.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo for years, so imagine my shock when I opened this and it smelled and felt wrong!  I bought a bottle at the store and brought it home to compare - and the bottle was definitely filled with a cheaper shampoo.  Beware!</li>
    <li> I was using kronos before, it looked good the day I washed it but by the nxt, my hair just looked oily. I switched to bumble and bumble (im using both thr shampoo and conditioner) and its amazing. My hair is shiny and so healthy. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love Bumble &amp; Bumble products just as much as I love Amazon.com and had yet to be disappointed by either, until now!  This product does not smell like real B &amp; B nor does it do the same thing to my hair. The &#x27;labeling&#x27; had been worn off in several places, so perhaps it is really old or it is a different product in a B &amp; B container.  Regardless, as a devout Amazon.com customer, I am extremely disappointed...</li>
    <li> I have just spent time discussing this company with not only a supervisor with Amazon, but with a customer representative with Bumble and Bumble.  This shampoo is NOT a Bumble and Bumble product.  I have purchased Bumble&#x27;s Gentle Shampoo for years, but through a salon I used to go to.  When I switched salons, they advised they didn&#x27;t carry Bumble products, so I decided to purchase this shampoo from Amazon instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving the first couple of bottles from this company, I noted immediately that the fragrance was almost over-powering, NOT something I had ever noticed with Bumble&#x27;s Gentle shampoo before.  I also noted that the texture of this product was different than I&#x27;d remembered; it was more translucent, not the white, thicker consistency that I was so accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I had our son order two more bottles through Amazon and when it came in today, my son asked if I had read any of the reviews on this product.  I hadn&#x27;t, so I started to read through them and to my astonishment I noted several of the comments noted the same issues I had, with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In doing a Google search, I noted that absolutely NOTHING comes up for this company (Rokbargains), save for one - another Amazon.com complaint for another product, a shower gel, sent by Rokbargains.  The two reviews were scathing; the comments made were almost identical to those complaints for the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s supervisor handled this complaint in a very professional manner.  She promptly refunded us the amount for the two 8 oz. bottles purchased and promised that they would look further into this company&#x27;s business handlings. I have since ordered two more bottles through Bumble&#x27;s website.  Bumble&#x27;s customer rep informed me they do NOT sell their products through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - Bumble&#x27;s product IS an excellent product in my opinion, but please don&#x27;t base your reviews on Rokbargains&#x27; product - IT IS NOT A BUMBLE AND BUMBLE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses it, it is great. My hair is soft and shiny after shampooing with it. My husband loves it too.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is the BEST in the world.  I have fine hair and color it;  have been using this shampoo for the last 10 years.  Will not change it at all. It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
    <li> Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo - it is the best shampoo available.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a shampoo that is gentle on the hair.</li>
    <li> The BB gentle shampoo claims that it&#x27;s gentle but felt like I was washing with something very stripping kind of like a clarifying shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft but still has plenty of volume!  I feel like this product actually makes my hair look healthy!</li>
    <li> I pair the shampoo with [[ASIN:B000BIZSWQ Bumble and Bumble Super Rich Conditioner, 8-Ounce Bottle]].  Taken as a pair, I have three things to say:&lt;br /&gt; - I love how this product smells.  It invigorates me.&lt;br /&gt; - I have never received this many compliments on my hair on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt; - It has saved my very processed hair--instead of dry and breaking, my hair is soft and silky!</li>
    <li> I have long hair and live in a desert like area. I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that keeps down the static and silkens out my hair.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and I have used it for several years. Amazon has a good price and I can always find it here.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for color treated hair. Best use with combination B&amp;B super rich conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been using Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo for over 10 years.  I purchased a bottle from &amp;#34;Winebrook Products&amp;#34; fulfilled by Amazon on September 10, 2013.  What I received is NOT Bumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo.  It is a fraudulent product packaged to appear to the buyer as shown in the picture. Please heed this review and BEWARE.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It is quite gentle and you need to use very little for each shampoo.</li>
    <li> I knew before opening the bag that this product was not real. I am a hairstylist how works with Bumble and Bumble all day long.  My salon was out of gentle, this bottle was for me so I ordered amazon which I love. Sad when sellers do this.  Thank God for reviews.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this shampoo. I have heard so many good things about it. I didn&#x27;t feel like it actually cleaned anything, and it definitely didn&#x27;t help my hair, it weighed it down and probably because my hair wasn&#x27;t getting washed with this stuff.</li>
    <li> I love to use this shampoo everyday, gives my hair a soft and silk appearance. I recommend for whom doesn&#x27;t have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years.  It&#x27;s light and gentle, yet cleans my hair very well.  I also use \\&quot;Gentle\\&quot; conditioner that goes with this shampoo, and also their light styling spray before blow drying.</li>
    <li> Love love this shampoo!! My hair is so shiny and soft ...thank you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;t didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all . made my hair dry.</li>
