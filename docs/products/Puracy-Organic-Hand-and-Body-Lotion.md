<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would like some mild but pleasant fragrance added to the lotion.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of it right now.  Otherwise, it is a good, rich lotion.</li>
    <li> I love all the Puracy products, especially since most of them are either all-natural or organic.  My husband has very dry skin, but during the winter he really needs to use lotion as a preventative measure.  Very similar to Puracy’s here’s a touch of fragrance, milk and honey, that almost leaves this lotion with a light, fresh powdery scent. It does linger on the skin, giving it not only a great smell, but leaves it quite soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients such as aloe vera and palm oil immediately caught my eye. These are naturally healing and moisturizing. With winter just over the horizon, my husband’s skin needs that little extra to keep his skin from flaking and cracking.  We use a shea butter for his heals, but this is perfect for the rest of his body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not seeing any of the well-known products in the ingredients that people now want to steer clear of such as things like laureths and petro-products.  Oddly enough, even the vegetable glycerin is kosher.  Anyone can say anything they want, but in my experience Puracy seems to back up what they say.  Of course there’s no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is marvelously refreshing and has that wonderful natural fragrance. The bottle is 12 fluid ounces (355mL), but it doesn’t take a lot to moisturize the skin. Puracy is one of those brands I love and trust and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it. There are no hidden ingredients and I’m a definite fan of all their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Organic aloe vera, organic sunflower oil, and organic jojoba oil revive and soothe dry skin to restore balance and comfort&lt;br /&gt;►  Milk and honey: relaxing aromas of milk and honey, with hints of vanilla and oats, provide a spa-like experience&lt;br /&gt;►  Formulated by doctors and enriched with vitamin E and B5, our proprietary lightweight formula softens skin without a greasy residue&lt;br /&gt;►  No silicones, parabens, dyes, phthalates, formaldehyde, PEG, petrochemicals, nut-based ingredients, animal by-products, or harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;►  All natural, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, and biodegradable, never tested on animals, made in the USA, satisfaction guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Glyceryl Stearate, Vegetable Cetyl Alcohol, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid, Milk &amp; Honey Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURACY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00I84JZTM Puracy Natural Multi-Surface &amp; Glass Cleaner, Green Tea &amp; Lime]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IT1ECBA Puracy Natural Liquid Hand Soap, Lavender &amp; Vanilla]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HAPI0L4 Puracy Natural Liquid Laundry Detergent, Free &amp; Clear, 64 Loads, 4x Concentrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IS9DKBG Puracy Natural Liquid Dish Soap, Green Tea &amp; Lime]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00ISDMQ8U Puracy Natural Stain &amp; Odor Remover Spray, Free &amp; Clear]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9ILA42 Puracy Natural Body Wash, Citrus &amp; Sea Salt]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9J4SHM Puracy Natural Shampoo and Body Wash, Citrus Grove]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9JBJBK Puracy Organic Baby Lotion]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9IWVIQ Puracy Organic Hand and Body Lotion, Milk and Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.edients, animal by-products, or harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;►  All natural, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, and biodegradable, never tested on animals, made in the USA, satisfaction guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Glyceryl Stearate, Vegetable Cetyl Alcohol, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid, Milk &amp; Honey Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PURACY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00I84JZTM Puracy Natural Multi-Surface &amp; Glass Cleaner, Green Tea &amp; Lime]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IT1ECBA Puracy Natural Liquid Hand Soap, Lavender &amp; Vanilla]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00HAPI0L4 Puracy Natural Liquid Laundry Detergent, Free &amp; Clear, 64 Loads, 4x Concentrated]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00IS9DKBG Puracy Natural Liquid Dish Soap, Green Tea &amp; Lime]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00ISDMQ8U Puracy Natural Stain &amp; Odor Remover Spray, Free &amp; Clear]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9ILA42 Puracy Natural Body Wash, Citrus &amp; Sea Salt]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9J4SHM Puracy Natural Shampoo and Body Wash, Citrus Grove]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9JBJBK Puracy Organic Baby Lotion]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00L9IWVIQ Puracy Organic Hand and Body Lotion, Milk and Honey]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Great smell and very moisturizing! Love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a body lotion without all the synthetic fillers and gunk, and this one is awesome.  Thick and creamy, keeps my skin moisturized better than anything else I&#x27;ve used thus far, I really like the scent too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a gift for a friend &amp; they liked it so much that I ordered again for myself. This body lotion smells heavenly &amp; absorbs quickly, leaving your skin feeling very soft. Appreciate the reasonable pricing. Will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Nettie Kemper</li>
    <li> This lotion feels nice and the ingredients are great. I would love to give this 5 stars, but the smell is a little strong and funky. I brought it to work with me because we all share lotion since we deal with money a lot and work in a hardware store, and not very many people like it because of the smell. I still like it over all though and I bought it to work so I&#x27;d have a natural, organic lotion option versus the chemical nightmares my other coworkers bring for everyone. In general though, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This lotion keep&#x27; s my skin moist!</li>
    <li> I love Puracy products not only because they are high quality but because they are consistently good. What I really like about this lotion is that it is packed with good things and not just a watery lotion that disappears too quickly. So inside this bottle is a ton of good stuff for your skin that takes a little rubbing to get it in. It makes a difference to dry patches with just a couple of uses and it is good as an overall skin lotion for keeping it soft and hydrated. Now that Puracy has come out with an unscented version, this is the top shelf of lotions. It feels rich going on and keeps working all day.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I was very excited that Puracy had a hand lotion and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  The lotion itself is nice.  It hydrates very nicely.  However, I did not like the smell... at all..  I threw the bottle away.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion- good overall moisturizer without being too greasy. I like the scent and long-lasting relief of dry skin. It&#x27;t very thick,so bit of a challenge to dispense - pump dispenser might work better. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really liked the texture and moisture of this lotion don&#x27;t get me wrong the lotion is amazing but the odor or smell I just could not take it anymore it is way to strong, if you put it all over your body like me the odor is so strong and it seems to last forever and I don&#x27;t even have a good sense of smell</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion. The smell is unimposing and super fresh and the lotion goes on silky smooth and leaves your skin feeling uber healthy and moist. I especially love that the ingredients are so good for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have had with this lotion is that it can be tough to get it out of the bottle since the lotion is so thick and luxurious and the bottle doesn&#x27;t have a pump. I solved this by taking the lid off and squeezing lotion from the bottle with two hands into a separate, small lotion container that has a lid on it so I can cover it up between uses. This makes it really easy to transfer the lotion from the container to your skin without having to continually squeeze more from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased another five bottles. We use it so much in our household now that we easily go though a bottle a week, so the fact that it costs less than half of some of the other lotions with similar healthy ingredients is another big plus. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I love the fact that this product is organic! I am a bartender and my hands are always dry and chapped because they are in the water CONSTANTLY! This lotion smells amazing and works great.  Makes my hands nice and soft. Lasts for a very long time as well.  Highly recommended for super dry hands! I received this product at a discount for the purpose of my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Sephora fan girl and have spent probably hundreds of dollars on lotions over time. Yes, as someone with eczema I&#x27;m obsessed with finding the right body lotion and have tried everything from the cheap Walgreens stuff to the high end ones. This one is AWESOME. It&#x27;s super luxurious, smells delicious and leaves my skin very moisturized. It&#x27;s been an absolute lifesaver this harsh winter. I&#x27;m not sure what the complaints about the scent is, I personally love it. I do agree with the other reviews though, it is very thick and can be a pain to squeeze out more especially when my hand is already slippery. A pump would make this lotion absolute perfection. Please consider that!</li>
    <li> More and more, I want safe, natural ingredients in things I put in and on my body. I love that Puracy has done that with this very effective lotion, and I will use it up. But...more than a few people have said the smell is not to their taste and, unfortunately, I am now one of them. I really do not like the fragrance and am using the lotion in ways where that will not get in the way. If they could change that one thing, this would be a 5-star review.</li>
    <li> Since my husband I discovered one of our boys couldn&#x27;t use/consume any foods/products with dyes or gluten I&#x27;ve been on a mission to find out what&#x27;s really in the foods we eat and the products we use including shampoos, soaps, lotions, toothpaste and I was disgusted. So I started throwing out everything we had and replacing it with pure, organic and vegan free. The idea of ingesting animal by products makes me want to hurl. After weeks of research I decided to try Puracy Organic Hand and Body lotion for myself. I only just got it yesterday and I love it. My hands and arms literally felt like silk, and kept that feeling for hours afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The milk and honey scent took a little getting use to. It doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant at all, just different from the artificial scents that were in the products I used before. The most comparable scent I could tie it to was baby powder but a little sweeter. I like the scent, I&#x27;ve just never bought a product that smelled like Milk and Honey, it was always flowery or lavender or something.&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely purchase this lotion again. Knowing that it&#x27;s free of all toxins, mineral oil, petroleum and the extras we DON&#x27;T need makes using lotion enjoyable again. I also purchased the Puracy hand soap, body wash, and baby lotion and plan on writing reviews on them when I feel I can give an accurate opinion of my experience.</li>
    <li> I have to use a gluten free lotion and this is now my favorite one. It isn&#x27;t sticky and using an unscented lotion is a big plus for me. I can wear any perfume I&#x27;d like without my lotion interfering with that scent. Coupled with the Puracy body wash it&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> DELIGHTFUL AROMA AND DOES NOT LEAVE YOUR SKIN GREASY</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!  Smooth and worked well on my skin. Will be using this again.</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  I will purchase again.  I also love the All purpose cleaning product, dish soap and laundry detergent!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Rich consistency, very hydrating. My skin is so much smoother after one week. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Yet another amazing product by Puracy. Completely organic an 100% natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it smooth and gliding texture. It was not runny and poured easily. Their products are safe enough to use on any skin type as they are made of natural ingredients. Even sensitive skin like mine had no problem with this product what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;To the contrary I felt my skin reacted better and was smoother. This product was specially good for my winter skin which would easily dry up.&lt;br /&gt;Daily application kept my skin baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their lightweight Formula is Enriched with Vitamin E, Vitamin B5, and Shea Butter for deep hydration. Shea butter is by far my favorite ingredient for skin nourishment. It keeps the skin soft and smooth all year long.&lt;br /&gt;There are no silicon products, or harsh chemical or animal by products.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely loved the mild fragrance that lingers for quite some time. Infact I would keep smelling my hands again and again to inhale the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy has a wide variety of household items available. Few of their links are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IS9DKBG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NGLIZSE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ISDMQ8U&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IT1ECBA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIYV78O&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L9JBJBK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend buying their products.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It dries clean and doesn&#x27;t clash with anything else I am wearing</li>
    <li> nice but the smell was too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve ordered before s d will continue to.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, fragrance-free and just about impossible to be allergic to.  Immediate results you can feel that last.  Try it and your shopping days for a great lotion are over.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I am a first time buyer but so far I love the brand and I love and agree with the mission statement of this company.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new organic lotion to use and was very excited upon receiving this product. Unfortunately, once I put this on my body it started stinging and I had to wash it off. I had some kind of allergic reaction and my skin was red. It says unscented on the bottle but I found it to be scented and it was really strong too so I was really disappointed.  I have given it three stars because of the great customer service and I appreciate when a brand stands behind their product and also the customers satisfaction.</li>
    <li> If I could give this and all the Puracy products a +10 I certainly would!!  I had severe eczema since April, 2015, went to a dermatologist and was given cortizone ointment.  It made the eczema worse.  I was told to use Dove soap which also didn&#x27;t help me, so I found this product when I did a search online for natural ingredients.  My hands are now very soft, and the eczema is completely gone.  I have purchased several of their products and I am very happy with all of them -- I will continue to be a loyal customer.</li>
    <li> The results of using it are okay but can&#x27;t stand the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lotion I have ever used! My skin has never been so soft!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product.  I personally love the scent and most importantly, my skin feels calm and soft.  I&#x27;ve tried many organic body lotions and this is definitely one I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. My hands have never been so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have severely sensitive skin and usually get a rash from skin products. This lotion is the best! I use it every day without complications 😁</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of unscented, but Puracy body lotion does a great job of moisturizing and softening my skin.  The skin softening especially, I really do feel it when I put it on.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day after showering and my skin never feels dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Puracy.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this lotion but find myself continuing to chose my other lotions over this one because my hands tend to feel dry again shortly after using it. It is thick which is nice but I think it may not absorb as well as other brands. I really like this brand and will continue to use their products.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and absorbs quickly.  I like the fact it is unscented which allows me to use my perfume and nothing clashes.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is not greasy or with a strong scent. It is moisturizing and soaks in well. I would order it again and again. Perfect lotion as far as  I am concerned.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing, its so smooth and I LOVE that it is ALL Natural and non toxic!!!!</li>
    <li> Well... it looks like I have lost another top-quality product to my husband. I mean, I don&#x27;t mind sharing but this is ridiculous. I had been using the Puracy Organic Hand and Body Lotion when all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore. I asked my husband about it and he said, &amp;#34;Oh, I took that to the office&amp;#34;. It is excellent.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What???? Of course I told him to bring it back home because with a 12 fl. oz bottle of creamy lotion that only takes a drop on your hands to make them feel soft, smooth and silky (without feeling coated), there is plenty to share. He then showed me his hands. Now, my husbands hands are not the hands of a lumberjack who forgot to wear his gloves for a year or so. HOWEVER, he does work in the yard, builds &amp; repairs things for around our home and in general has rough,dry hands. So when he showed me his hands and I was able to not only feel but see how much softer they were, I forgave him for &amp;#34;stealing&amp;#34; MY lotion. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft hands is not the only reason why he loves it. It is unscented. and for a man that is a hard combination to find... a lotion that gets rid of the roughness yet has no &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; fragrance. I guess that is because it is made with Organic Aloe Vera, Sunflower Oil and Palm Oil to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, he doesn&#x27;t care what&#x27;s in it. He only cares that it feels good, doesn&#x27;t smell like a girl and I am willing to share. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to receive this product at a promotional cost in exchange for my HONEST &amp; UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion and of course being organic is a positive.  A bit too fragrant for me, kind of smells like a very old person would use it.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for daily use- moisturizers without being greasy and like that it is unscented.  Like that the bottle is clear so you can see how much is left in the bottle.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I have very dry hands and my fingers crack from being so dry. I also have just got back from the mainland where it is super dry so my legs and heels are in need of moisture. So when I was offered this Organic Hand &amp; Body Lotion from Puracy for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I was happy to see that it came with a pump. Most lotion bottles just have a pop lid but pump is my favorite kind. I have been using it for about a week and a half now and and my skin is not only moisturized but the cracks are healing up and feeling better each day. I definitely recommend trying this Organic Hand &amp; Body Lotion from Puracy.</li>
    <li> Although I wish Puracy made a lotion that had some scent to it , I still Love this product ! It&#x27;s not greasy and has a really nice feel to it ....I&#x27;ve ordered it twice now and will continue to do so !</li>
    <li> I just purchased the body lotion and using Puracy products for the first time. I love the smell and it easily squeezes out of the bottle. I&#x27;ve been on a mission be find safe products and think I&#x27;ve finally found them. Hope you consider making safe face products, that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Absolutely in love with this lotion. I tried hundreds of different natural lotions. This one of the best I ever had. Works great for my very dry skin on my legs and even my cracked feet. Smells really good too. Deducted one star for the bottle; it looks good, but the lotion is too thick to be squeezed out of it. This lotion is more like a cream and really needs different type of container. I hope the company consider convenience and put it in some sort of container that you can dip this lotion out.</li>
    <li> Medium thick and creamy, it dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> The lotion works really well and leaves my skin soft. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have the harmful chemicals that some other lotions have. A little goes a long way so it lasts a really long time. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a very good lotion and reasonably priced. Feels good on the skin, not greasy or heavy, and so glad it is available unscented and paraben free because I have very sensitive skin. A little goes a long way. One thing that would make it easier to use is a dispenser that is easier to pump or either offer it in a jar since it is thick almost like a cream. the top part of the dispenser comes off easily and you have to constantly turn it around to get it to release.</li>
    <li> Good, but I don&#x27;t Luke the scent.</li>
    <li> It is a thick lotion with a mild scent. I tend to have dry skin, and when I was offered a chance to try it out, I took it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. It doesn&#x27;t take much to rub into an area leaving it feeling good. I asked my daughter what she thought of the smell, she said it was like a donut, then I read a review that was posted and they said the same thing. It is a mild scent. Overall it is a nice lotion and works well.</li>
    <li> This has to be the worse smelling lotion I ever came across. I used it once and got so sick from it. Smells like musty old garbage. I threw it right in the garbage..DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BELIEVE ME YOU WILL BE SORRY</li>
    <li> Upon applying lotion on my dry skin on the arms and shins, I feel immediate relief.  It gives a silky touch removing any itchiness brought by dryness.  The scent of milk and honey is fine but is too babyish or candyish.  I think it is great for kids.  My wife says the scent is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is a bit too thick and it can be annoying when you would need to tip the bottle, bop it, to make the lotion move to the top before you can dispense. You may have to store it with the top on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is that they try to be as organic as possible with the ingredients.  I like the organic aloe, Shea butter and Jojoba, although not sure about the Helianthus Annuus.  Also enriched with vitamin E and B5.  Never tested on animals.  Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
    <li> I rarely write reviews but had to in this case. I was searching for a natural body lotion and stumbled across this one. I love it and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. Not only does it leave your skin soft but it is not sticky (and that is extremely important to me). Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion for my adult son because he has very dry skin and can never find a good lotion for his face and scalp.  After he used it, he called me and was ecstatic....!  he said after applying it, the affect was immediate!  He state that he had immediate relief from his dry skin and uses it everyday now.... he also likes the smell of the lotion.  It is a winner in his book and he would recommend it to anyone that deals with dry skin especially in the colder times of the year.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, seems to do a good job as a lotion. My only problem is getting it out of the bottle. I end up have to soak it in hot water to get it to flow more easily.</li>
    <li> This Puracy lotion is unscented for the most part as the only smell I could detect was a light scent of one of the ingredients (aloe would be my guess).  Since I like aloe, I don’t mind the very light scent which really goes away quickly.  From my understanding this is Puracy’s second formulation that makes this scent free and I can say that I really smell very little from this lotion.  This is a white creamy lotion with a soft smooth texture that makes my skin feel cooler and refreshed when I apply.  The lotion is not oily, absorbs quickly into my skin and doesn’t irritate my skin at all.  This is very hydrating and my skin feels softer and moisturized immediately after applying.  I like the fact that Puracy works to have natural ingredients in all of its products including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a really NICE lotion.  My hands felt so good for hours after using it. There is no fragrance, which is nice. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smells lovely, moisturizing without being greasy. Love that it&#x27;s organic and free of harmful chemicals like siloxanes, parabens, formaldehyde and phthalates.</li>
    <li> I bought the soap and loved it so I thought I would try the lotion and see if it works miracles during our super dry winter months.  I love the scent and don&#x27;t find it overwelming at all-this morning my 12 year old son told me I smelled &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; good! I am not sure if that is a complement to the lotion or a statement of my hygiene!  The lotion is thick and soaks immeciately into my skin-leaving my skin pretty soft!  It has only been a few days but so far so good.  The only complaint I have is that it is really hard to get out of the bottle, even after taking he lid completely off I had hard time-that is just to much effort before coffee!</li>
    <li> Best non-toxic, natural,  all around moisturizer for our family; not too thick not too watery. Also, just a nice, almost undetectable scent.  I have tried many, many, natural/organic lines, and this one is the best. They have wonderful range of products.</li>
    <li> When I first got this brand it was honey scented and I felt nauseous every time I used it. But the unscented is really good! Glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> This Hand and Body Lotion is by far the best out there!!! I am a lotion and creme connisiuer. This lotion has helped to heal dry, irritated skin, it has a light feel to it and is non greasy.Great for the summertime as well! The Best!!! Pure and Organic!!</li>
    <li> This is a good everyday lotion. It absorbs nicely and doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. However, I think the price is outrageous for a lotion that isn&#x27;t spectacular, but pretty run-of-the-mill. I have made my own lotion for a few years, so I am very aware of all the chemical crap they put into most lotions, and I wanted to try this as an alternative to making my own, but unfortunately, its price is prohibitive.</li>
    <li> I received a bottle of Puracy lotion as a Christmas gift from my sister-in-law. I fell in love with it for moisturizing my face and hands. I soon ordered two more bottles and shared one with my daughter on the day she moved into her new house. Now she also is a constant user and applies it on her young children too. * My husband and I travel quite often. My Puracy goes with me! So convenient that the bottle is NOT a pump top - easy to pack. * Hint: store the bottle upside down so the lotion is ready to dispense:)</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed using the various soaps and cleaning products from Puracy, but this lotion is indulgent.  It is very buttery and silky when applied, immediately begins soothing even dry, itchy skin, does a great job conditioning and moisturizing, and has a delicious fragrance of milk and honey.  A baby version with a similar formula but with an oatmeal and honey fragrance is also available [[ASIN:B00L9JBJBK here]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is very reassuring, so I don&#x27;t mind using it on my face as well as on my body and would gladly slather it on a baby&#x27;s delicate skin.  Simply pat dry with a clean towel after bathing or showering and then apply it immediately to lock in moisture and then reapply as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slim bottle has a fip top and holds a full 12 oz.  It would be nice tucked into a gift basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy provided a bottle of lotion for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> All my life I&#x27;ve searched for a lotion that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; (absorbs quickly).  I&#x27;ve never found one until now.  This product is AMAZINGLY effective and yet, not &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34;!!  I also love the attractive bottle, and that it is unscented. THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> This lotion made my skin SO soft! The fact that it&#x27;s all organic and contains no harmful chemicals is a HUGE plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have allergies so I can&#x27;t smell anything, but it passed my friends &amp; family smell test. It apparently smells really pleasant and light. This is my new favorite lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!! I have to be careful on what skincare products I use because I have eczema, this lotion didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. It is thick and creamy and absorbs quickly it left my skin soft,smooth and hydrated, without leaving it feeling greasy like some other lotions tend to do. My hands get really dry and once I started using this product my hands look and feel amazing they stay moisturized all day long.This lotion smells amazing, the aromas of milk, honey, vanilla and oats is very relaxing. This What I love most about Puracy products is that they don&#x27;t test on animals, formulated by doctors and they are made in the USA. I also love that all their products are Organic, non-toxic, hypoallergenic, and biodegradable. They are also free of harmful ingredients like silicones, parabens, dyes, phthalates, formaldehyde, nut-based ingredients, animal by-products, PEG, petrochemicals,  and harsh chemicals. They use ingredients I feel safe using on my skin like Organic aloe vera, organic sunflower oil, shea butter, green tea and organic jojoba oil. I have tried many products from this line and have loved them all! I highly recommend this lotion and this company. It risk free satisfaction is guaranteed!!I recieved this product free in exchange for my honest opinion, and I am so happy I did because I am now a huge fan of their products and will continue to use them.</li>
    <li> The best organic lotion on the market! I choose this over all other big brand lotions! I has light calming smell, all 100% organic and plant based.  use all Puracy products in my home. Tried tested and approved!</li>
    <li> Great light smell, absorbs nicely, great for work, dealing with dry climate and lots of paper!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. I noticed a difference in my skin immediately after the first use. I&#x27;m already on my 5th bottle and will continue to use this great lotion.</li>
    <li> The product was so thick it would hardly come out of bottle. The smell was strong as if old product.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive dry, itchy skin on my hands and legs and it can be difficult to find a good lotion to help treat that. Most body lotions are heavily scented so they are filled with alcohol that burns my skin and the heavy scents irritate my sinuses. The Puracy hand and body lotion doesn&#x27;t have all those perfumes so it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of alcohol in it to burn my skin and irritate my sinuses. But it does have a really pleasant scent that&#x27;s light and not too overpowering. It does smell somewhat like honey which I absolutely love. Another thing I love about this lotion is how thick it is, it doesn&#x27;t slide off your hand or even move when you squirt some into your hand. It stays put, you can even turn your hand upside down and it still stays put. Its thick, creamy texture goes on your skin smooth and leaves it feeling soft and refreshed. There&#x27;s no sticky or greasy residue left behind after applying it either, so you can get dressed right over it right away. In a matter of days after using this my dry, cracked, rough, itchy skin was smoother, softer, and overall looked a lot better. I&#x27;m no longer ashamed to show off my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with Puracy products because they are all natural, plant based, and always non toxic. They are also never tested on animals and our made in the USA. They use all natural and organic ingredients like aloe vera, sunflower oil, jojoba oil, and our vitamin enriched. They are always free of harsh dyes, silicones, parabens, animal by products, and other harsh chemicals. Puracy also gives back to the community and donates to families and other less fortunate people. I feel good about using Puracy products because I support companies that give back to the community</li>
    <li> When I received the Puracy Organic Lotion to test and review, I was happy to test it as I have very sensitive skin. Below are the results of my personal testing of this lotion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First, after my shower, I placed some of this all over my body, especially on my hands and arms and it was very soothing and refreshing and my skin was smooth and soft after use. This does have a mild fragrance, but it is very light and also the lotion is not too thick and overbearing. What I have discovered is that this worked so well for me as I have very sensitive skin and break out easily. This lotion is very gentle when using it for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Improvement on my skin: After using this all over on my skin, it feels like my skin is refreshed and feels cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) My overall testing results: This product in my opinion is just what it is advertised to be and I found it to work wonderfully on a adult or even a child. The scent is clean and fresh and not overpowering, the lotion is not greasy or too thick, feels wonderful when applying the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting to find a refreshing and organic lotion that is so gentle on this skin, then highly consider this item.</li>
    <li> I received this item free for review but despite that kindness I leave my candid thoughts below.  Well, in this case, my fiancee was the primary consumer of this one so I really am leaving her candid thoughts below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* As described on the bottle, the product is a very gentle lotion.  Nothing harsh or abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Just one use leaves skin softer and, in my fiancee&#x27;s case at least, more radiant and kissable even than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Her one issue, and the reason she gave it back to me to find another home for was the smell.  Normally she&#x27;s not terribly sensitive to odors but in this case the smell made her not want to use it.  She described it as &#x27;cloyingly sweet&#x27; which for her is saying quite a lot.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:4ecda0804be174c3ac4745fb1ffd83ff]] Update 6/4. Rating changed from 4 to 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little over 6 months ago I reviewed the original formula of Puracy hand and body lotion. Even though I like the non-greasy formula and how well it moisturised I could not give it a 5 star rating beause I have a strong preference for unscented lotions. My review included a request to the manufacturer to offer an an unscented option. They listened! I have been using the new Puracy hand and body lotion that I received for feedback and I it is practically unscented while still having the same non-greasy thick feel I liked about the original formula. Now it is a 5 star lotion. Thanks for listening Puracy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;The Puracy hand and body lotion is s a rich cream with a strong scent. The sweet smell has hints of vanilla. It moisturises very well but the scent lingers for a long time. I could feel the moisturising effect and a slight residue on my hands so its texture is the kind I like wearing at night, however I prefer to unscented lotions at bed time. My favorite usage is for this lotion is my feet where I like a stronger moisturiser and don&#x27;t mind a strong scent because it is covered by socks and shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeeze cap works very well delivering a small amount of cream that is easy to control. The lotion is absorbed well by my skin. I hope in the future there will be an unscented version of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puracy lotion is from organic ingredients, with the key ingredients being vitamin E and B5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Glyceryl Stearate, Vegetable Cetyl Alcohol, Vegetable Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Xanthan Gum, Tocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid, Milk &amp; Honey Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hand and body cream is provided by Puracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia reviewTocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E), Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Citric Acid, Milk &amp; Honey Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hand and body cream is provided by Puracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> I love this, smells wonderful and hydrates my sensitive skin wonderfully. However, my ex walked by me and commented on how he hated whatever perfume I was wearing. Now, to be honest I did have on perfume and this scented lotion, but the perfume I was wearing is the same one I have worn for the last 12 years and he has always loved it. So now I&#x27;m a little hesitant to use the lotion. Maybe it was just the combination... Not sure, but I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I really like Puracy products, they always perform very well.  I tried their Organic Hand and Body Lotion last year when it had the fragrance of &amp;#34;Milk and Honey&amp;#34;.  Beautiful lotion, but I did not care much for the fragrance.  Puracy has changed the lotion to unscented.  And I find it pretty wonderful, now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick lotion, so thick that Puracy added a pump to help get it out of the bottle.  Surprisingly, despite its thickness, it is not a heavy lotion and it melts into the skin and is absorbed very quickly.  I applied it to my hands and arms and a minute later I was able to start typing again.  It absorbs quickly even in heat and high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this lotion has given me the softest skin I&#x27;ve ever had.  I think a predominance of organic aloe vera makes my skin stay soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it in the shower, at the end of my shower:  I apply it lightly and briefly.  The softness actually lasts for two days, (I tested).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for those of you who tried this lotion back in 2014 should give it another chance.  I did, and now I&#x27;ve changed my star rating from three to five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free sample product from Puracy.</li>
    <li> i gave it to a friend and she commented that she really liked it, it did not leave her hands greasy or leave greasy marks on her tools, she also said it had a mild but very nice fragrence that last a long time</li>
    <li> Like the all natural ingredients. Like the creaminess of the product, works well. However, I don&#x27;t like the strong smell of honey. If you could tone down the smell, 5 Stars.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved it. I think she will be buying more of this...</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00L9IWVIQ Puracy Organic Hand and Body Lotion, Milk and Honey]] is an excellent moisturizing lotion. It is thick, creamy, goes on smoothly and is not greasy or sticky!  It&#x27;s organic!  And, made in the USA, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are  wondering why I&#x27;m giving it 4 1/2 stars, I&#x27;ll tell you.  Because it is  thick &amp; has an awesome consistency, it is too hard to squeeze out of the bottle so I keep the bottle upside down. The scent is a little too strong for me too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;d be great if Puracy provided a pump for this lotion or put it in a bottle that is easier to squeeze &amp; designed to sit on its lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 6/4/15:&lt;br /&gt;Puracy listened to their customers &amp; now sells this lotion with no scent and added a pump. They just took a great product &amp; made it awesome. I changed my star rating from 4 1/2 stars to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include organic aloe vera, organic sunflower oil &amp; shea butter. A complete list of ingredients be seen by hovering your mouse cursor over Amazon&#x27;s Product Photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Puracy products I&#x27;ve used have been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00ISDMQ8U Puracy 100% Natural Enzyme Laundry Stain Remover, Free and Clear]] removed grape juice stains from a white carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Satisfaction Guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For every purchase, Puracy makes a donation of all natural products to local kids and families that are less fortunate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
    <li> UPDATE: 5/24/2015 - I&#x27;m happy that Puracy has re-released their Hand and Body Lotion as an Unscented lotion. Ahhhhhh now my nose can tolerate this product and I to like it a lot. It is so silky.. I&#x27;ll leave my original review as is, but just know that I raised my rating to 5 stars based on the unscented version,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a review of Puracy Organic Hand and Body Lotion, Milk and Honey. I was provided with a free bottle for evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried just about all available Puracy products and have liked all of them. Even this hand and body lotion is good stuff. It moisturized my hands well and has few ingredients that would raise concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is what I don&#x27;t care for with this product. Someone else categorized it as smelling like play-dough. I hadn&#x27;t thought of that but as I sniff it again I can see how you could think that. In any case the scent isn&#x27;t for me but the product does work well. So although my rating of 3 (which means it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot; according to Amazon ratings) implies that it&#x27;s not a great product... it IS a great product. I just don&#x27;t care for how it smells. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> the lotion is great but the dispenser is awful-it is very hard to get the lotion out-they should consider a pump</li>
    <li> I gave this lotion as part of a gift for a new Mom, so she&#x27;d have something small for her. She has raved about it and liked that it had a gentle scent for being around baby. Just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I wanted an all natural, unscented lotion to make my own blends with my Young Living essential oils. This fit the bill perfectly!  It&#x27;s has a nice consistency, not greasy and absorbs quickly leaving your skin well hydrated and luxurious!  Thank you Puracy for an outstanding product.</li>
    <li> Great quality product, the wife loved it</li>
    <li> Feels great on skin and like the smell</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. I love that it is so pure and natural.</li>
    <li> I have highly sensitive skin and nearly ALWAYS react with psoriasis to creams, even those claiming fragrance-free, safe for sensitive skin, etc.  Your product is PERFECT! Rich, creamy, no fragrance, and NO reaction! Leaves my hands perfectly smooth and moisturized, but not greasy at all! Great work!!</li>
    <li> My wife purchased this use on our children and it has been great we love that it is all natural and it keeps our kids skin from getting chapped in the winter months highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great affordable product.  Slightly too sweet smelling but feels great on the body and love that it is so absorbed.</li>
    <li> Smells good, very soft and nice</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this lotion, great buy too!</li>
    <li> Rich with a mild scent. Not overpowering which is what I like best.</li>
    <li> It was a large bottle of lotion for the price. It was non greasy and made my skin feel smooth.</li>
    <li> This lotion is super good. I love the smell and it&#x27;s no doubt ORGANIC. I&#x27;ve been using different types of lotion over the years, and this one is by far the best. If you are looking for a non chemical lotion, this is the one you should have.</li>
    <li> It is true, it contains no harmful substances, but it also has a vanilla-smelling scent  which I just&lt;br /&gt;cannot stand--I like a perfume floral scent in my hand lotion.  And, the worst part, even after&lt;br /&gt;several hand-washings, the strong  odor was still there.  Sorry, gave it away.</li>
