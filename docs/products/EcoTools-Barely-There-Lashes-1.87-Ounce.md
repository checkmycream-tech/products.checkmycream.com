      <li>These are very easy to apply and stay well in the humidity.</li>
      <li>In thinking it over, I think that perhaps if I had more of my own lashes, it would be easier to camouflage that</li>

      <li>I think they&#x27;re beautiful and accentuate the eye very well without look fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>set does contain more than most.  </li>

      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>The product itself is actually better,</li>
      <li>I love this brand.</li>
      <li>They were even easier to take off and removing them didn&#x27;t pull out my eyelashes or hurt, so I was glad if that.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
      <li>so i gave up and ordered this, which I really love also.</li>
      <li>Even if you don&#x27;t do it perfectly, you won&#x27;t look like a female impersonator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>I am happy I got these, because I really like the look of lashes, since I haven&#x27;t used them for 40 years.</li>
      <li>I DON&amp;#34;T LIKE when companies misrepresent their products as being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and seemingly healthy.</li>
      <li>I love this product and it is reusable, so grab some to try and love.</li>
      <li>They feel as secure as my own because they&#x27;re eco (eye?)</li>
      <li>I also love that Eco Tools eyelash glue does not contain Formaldehyde and is made of all-natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>you can wear them more than one time...</li>
      <li>(Someone else would have been more savvy.)  </li>
      <li>For having the word &#x27;eco&#x27; in it&#x27;s name, there sure is a LOT of packaging.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to plug the drain before rinsing, in case you drop one.</li>
      <li>Wipe most of the mascara off the wand and give each eye one</li>
      <li>I stumbled across this more longer-lasting brand after trying to find an adhesive without formaldehyde.  </li>
      <li>For a person who did not have my issues, I think they would probably be much better.</li>
      <li>But I do put eyeliner on top of the line where they are applied, which helps camoflage the area where they are applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most eyelash sets come with lashes alone, glue sold separately.  </li>
      <li>They could have been more generous with the glue</li>
      <li>I got so excited!</li>
      <li>Ok so these work just fine,</li>
      <li>of the most important features -  no formaldehyde, latex, parabens, or phthalates.</li>
      <li>Cruelty free, they are appropriate for day time or office use.</li>
      <li>I wish they had included more detailed instructions for newbies.</li>
      <li>application wore all day and I was pleased with the fit.</li>
      <li>You really need a very light appliction of mascara to bond and blend the falsies with your own lashes.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and stay put.</li>
      <li>They stayed on, and were easy to remove.  </li>
      <li>Barely There lashes are great for the person looking to wear falsies but not look like they are wearing falsies.</li>
      <li>Nice lashes, and look pretty too.</li>
      <li>So light and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>These lashes are light weight and so easy to put on.</li>
      <li>Love how natural these look, nothing over the top!</li>
      <li>The little spoolie they come with blends them out wonderfully after they set.</li>
      <li>Just do a light patpatpat along the band.  </li>
      <li>This is important for me because I wear glasses.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are hypo-allergenic and paraben free and did not irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
      <li>They are paraben and phthalate free, latex-free, and so forth.  </li>
      <li>I think they would be about right for most.</li>
      <li>friendly.</li>
      <li>but I was pretty pleased over all.  </li>
      <li>Permalash wins by a mile!  </li>
      <li>Which is exactly why I don&#x27;t love them.</li>
      <li>thing I really like most about the EcoTools lashes is that they are adhered lightly to the insert.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried 7 different kinds and these are the best so far</li>
      <li>The Ardell lash band, by virtue of the invisiband, is more flexible and conforms better to the natural shape of my eye than the Ecotools band, which was straighter and had to be manipulated to bend to the shape of my eye.</li>
      <li>These are what I would call &#x27;everyday&#x27; lashes, good for work or school, filling in gaps or enhancing stubby lashes of your own.</li>
      <li>the lashes themselves look light and pretty and the glue was easy to work with.</li>
      <li>They stayed on nicely, came off easily and were simple to clean.</li>
      <li>I really liked these and they seemed natural looking.</li>
      <li>Easier to place than full lashes</li>
      <li>Easy to put on even if you&#x27;re not quite adept at handling individual lashes yet.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very soft, and much more comfortable to wear.</li>
      <li>quick swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using another brand for years, and very happy with them, EXCEPT for the fact that they start to look ragged after the third or fourth use.  </li>
      <li>fluttery stars for these easy to apply, easy to wear, natural looking lashes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These are very easy to apply and stay well in the humidity. They&#x27;re very lightweight too. I would get them again.</li>
    <li> I like everything about it....the packages that it comes in and the eco-friendly tool and glue that comes with it.  However, I was a bit disappointed that the lash strip is shorter than I expected.  It is a short strip that will only cover half of my lash lines...i think it is supposed to just add a flare to your outer eye corner and doesn&#x27;t provide fake lash coverage for the whole eyes.</li>
    <li> READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE GLUE!!! The manufacturer represents the product as having no formaldehyde or latex, but I read the rest of the ingredients and found some outrageous things that they DON&#x27;T mention in their marketing. I looked up Methylisothiazolinone, one of the listed ingredients. It can be both allergenic and cytotoxic and known in studies to cause cancer. I DON&amp;#34;T LIKE when companies misrepresent their products as being &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and seemingly healthy. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s start by saying that I&#x27;m not a newbie to false eyelashes.  I can apply eyelashes in seconds...perfect every time.  I&#x27;ve been using another brand for years, and very happy with them, EXCEPT for the fact that they start to look ragged after the third or fourth use.  I stumbled across this more longer-lasting brand after trying to find an adhesive without formaldehyde.  Both Ardell and Duo&#x27;s adhesives contain formaldehyde.  EcoTools says that their adhesive does not - which is awesome.  Too bad I can&#x27;t use the eyelashes, though!  I carefully tried to peel off both the left and right strips from the plastic backing, and both of them had lashes tear out from the strip!  The lashes are just glued on to the strip, unlike Ardell&#x27;s which are TIED to the strip. I trimmed off the ends that lost lashes and tried to apply them. The instructions say to bend them, but they didn&#x27;t want to bend!  There is no natural curve to the strip...it&#x27;s perfectly straight so just when you think it will stick to your eyelid, one side pops up.  I thought maybe it needs a couple days to relax out of the box, but they are still as straight as the day I opened them.  No amount of bending will make them stay!  So they ended up in the trash, unworn.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 5 stars for two little reasons. The band and the glue. The band is a little too thick for my preference, especially for eyelashes boasting to be natural and &#x27;barely there&#x27;. I have blonde eyelashes myself so it&#x27;s just a little bit of a hassle. Second off is the glue. I use another brand because I feel like this one dries too slow, and doesn&#x27;t even bond very well. But that could just be me. Otherwise I&#x27;m very happy with these eyelashes. They&#x27;ve proven to hold up during my work shifts (as a barista) and more often than not no one really knows I have false eyelashes on, just that my eyes &amp;#34;look really great today!&amp;#34; I always wear at least a little eyeliner and have a coat of mascara on my own eyelashes. I&#x27;ve managed to always reuse them once or twice before they&#x27;re too worn down.</li>
    <li> These are best false lashes I&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re very soft, and much more comfortable to wear. I think they&#x27;re beautiful and accentuate the eye very well without look fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Barely There lashes because the inner corner is short, and gradually gets longer as it gets towards the outer corner. This is important for me because I wear glasses. If they&#x27;re too long in the middle they&#x27;ll rub on the lenses when I blink. All my four eyed lash wearing ladies know how uncomfortable that is.</li>
    <li> So far these are the best eyelash extension strips I&#x27;ve tried.  I really like the instructions.  What I don&#x27;t like is that they need to be bent the opposite way to make them fit your natural lash line - ALL extensions are like this and so far no one has corrected this flaw.  All in all they&#x27;re good lashes, but they didn&#x27;t last me the whole day.  One started flapping away towards late afternoon, which makes me NOT want to wear false lashes.  This is really embarrassing when it happens out in public.</li>
    <li> Super natural look, If u want just a touch on your eyes and no looking super fake, this lashes are for you.</li>
    <li> Whether this lash is for you depends on what look you are going for.  For someone who has never worn a false lash and wants to experiment with a look that is \\&quot;barely there\\&quot; then this would be your best bet.  I have worn lashes since high school.  Ardell lashes are one of the most common brands coming in individual or feathery bands but they do not look natural.  The glue included in this EcoTools product is very easy to use and does not look thick and caked on.  You can even apply it directly to your eyelid with no stinging or irritation.  If you are going for a glamorous presentation you might want to consider a different brand or style.  These are very wispy and light but I was pretty pleased over all.  They almost give the look of professional lash extensions as opposed to fake lashes.</li>
    <li> I use these often and can tell what a difference in the way my eyes look. I get compliments everyday and no one ask if they are fake!! Who knew? Great for those with thin small lashes</li>
    <li> Easy to put on even if you&#x27;re not quite adept at handling individual lashes yet. These are what I would call &#x27;everyday&#x27; lashes, good for work or school, filling in gaps or enhancing stubby lashes of your own. For evening or glam I would choose lashes that are more dramatic than these - but I would definitely buy these again, particularly for their ease of wear. They stayed on nicely, came off easily and were simple to clean. They even have their own little storage case.</li>
    <li> No formaldehyde ! I got so excited! For having the word &#x27;eco&#x27; in it&#x27;s name, there sure is a LOT of packaging. Lashes were too small for my eyes, and probably everyone else&#x27;s too; unless you&#x27;re looking for an &#x27;enhancement&#x27; - the GLUE WAS ALL DRIED UP ..it came out in one big blob..none of it was useable. What the heck is the brush for anyway? You don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Love how natural these look, nothing over the top! Good stuff. I got these to wear with my halloween costume and they rock!</li>
    <li> My eyebrows and eyelashes are sadly practically non-existent ever since I went through chemotherapy for breast cancer, over 2 years ago. The hair on my head has grown back and to some extent, my lashes and eyebrows *have* grown back, but they are so wispy, light and thin that they definitely need some kind of augmentation. I&#x27;m a regular mascara user, but I wondered if these might also be a potential solution for someone like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, bear in mind, I&#x27;m a total newbie at this. Never ever wore false eyelashes before. But...I had trouble getting this on in such a way that they didn&#x27;t look fake. The problem is not the lashes, but at the band, the place there the lashes meet your eye. In thinking it over, I think that perhaps if I had more of my own lashes, it would be easier to camouflage that spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...if you are like me, hoping to augment very, very light and thin lashes, or no lashes, you could try these but be aware that it might be more difficult to hide that band, which I think is the dead giveaway that you are wearing fake eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the item seems nice, the lashes themselves look light and pretty and the glue was easy to work with. For a person who did not have my issues, I think they would probably be much better. Back to mascara for me.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1TZYS48UK2ZTF]]Since I own another brand of false lashes, I decided to test this product by wearing an Ecotools Barely There lash on one eye (using the Ecotools lash adhesive) and wear another brand of lash (Ardell Babies) on the other eye (using Duo, the lash adhesive I generally use). A few things were immediately obvious:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I much prefer the invisiband along the top line of the Ardell lashes to the heavy black line at the top of the Ecotools lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The Ardell lash band, by virtue of the invisiband, is more flexible and conforms better to the natural shape of my eye than the Ecotools band, which was straighter and had to be manipulated to bend to the shape of my eye. As a result, the Ardell was easier to apply than the Ecotools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Both brands start short on the inner edge of the eye and end up long on the outer edge of the eye. The Ecotools lash looked more natural because the transition between inner and outer eye was much milder, whereas the Ardell lash starts short but immediately gets very long after the short inner edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The Ecotools lash adhesive, while it comes in a tiny package and is a bit difficult to work with as a result, had an applicator that made it very easy to get just enough but not too much adhesive on the lash band. With Duo adhesive, there is no applicator included (though some people use a pin or other small object with the Duo to get a similar effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Considering that these lashes are called \\&quot;Barely There\\&quot; and that the box touts this as a \\&quot;Naturally Beautiful Lash System\\&quot;, I thought that the outer eye area of the lash was a bit too long. If it is truly \\&quot;barely there\\&quot; and \\&quot;naturally beautiful,\\&quot; I would think the point would be for it not to look like a false lash. To me, it still definitely does look like a false lash due to how dramatically it wings out from the tiny short beginning to the long fluttery end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The Ardell invisiband looked more natural on my eyelid. The Ecotools&#x27; heavy, black, plastic-looking band looked more fake. HOWEVER, the Ecotools lashes on the whole looked more natural than the Ardell&#x27;s.

Once I heard how enthusiastically my neighbors felt about the Ecotools being more natural looking, I increased the rating because I think anyone looking at a lash called \\&quot;Barely There\\&quot; would want a lash that is more natural looking and not obviously a false lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 starson my eyelid. The Ecotools&#x27; heavy, black, plastic-looking band looked more fake. HOWEVER, the Ecotools lashes on the whole looked more natural than the Ardell&#x27;s.

    <li> This set of lashes is called \\&quot;Barely There\\&quot; so my expectations were not that I&#x27;d look like a drag queen or Broadway performer with them on. Their length is concentrates on the outer eye area, and make the eye look more open and extended out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I noticed immediately is that the base seemed thicker than most other lashes I have used. The step of flexing the lash is crucial in getting a flexible,  comfortable application and fit. I like that the adhesive goes on with slight color and dries clear. Another benefit: no formaldehyde, latex, parabens, or phthalates. I did not find the wand to be exceptional, but it worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application wore all day and I was pleased with the fit.</li>
    <li> I really liked these and they seemed natural looking. They were a bit hard to get on but that was probably my fault</li>
    <li> I feel very good about these eyelashes. They feel as secure as my own because they&#x27;re eco (eye?) friendly. And they are--as promised--natural looking. Maybe not quite natural looking enough for me, but I didn&#x27;t mark them down to four stars for that. I think they would be about right for most. And I can try trimming them down a bit--which I&#x27;ll do.  They also felt a bit heavy so I was glad I only tried them out for a single evening, not at a speaking event where I&#x27;d need to keep my eyes open and alert for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost certain that anyone who is used to wearing eyelashes will like these. And they were easy to apply--even for a novice fake eyelash wearer. (-:</li>
    <li> These lashes are light weight and so easy to put on. They are sturdy too so you can wear them more than one time... wash them with shampoo, not hand soap though. The brush helps get the goo off.</li>
    <li> I thought that this was some sort of treatment for lashes, so was surprised when it arrived. (Someone else would have been more savvy.)  I am a complete novice when it comes to false lashes, but I did manage to get them on reasonably well, and wore them on Halloween, which was fine.  Would I wear them when I was not in costume?  No. I think they look silly, and fake.  Do all false lashes?  Do they look better if they are artfully trimmed?  I have no idea.</li>
    <li> These lashes had a very natural appearance when on and I would definitely recommend them for anybody with sparse or short lashes to add a little bit of extra volume. The tools and glue that came with the lashed were not the best however, the glue was difficult to get out of the container and would often bubble up when trying to put the lid back on. The brush was also completely unnecessary for anybody used to putting false lashes on. Final verdict: great natural looking lashes, buy a different lash glue.</li>
    <li> My lashes are long and sparse so I was looking for a filler. These lashes look natural, except with thin lashes, you can see the black band, and are easy to put on. They weren&#x27;t long enough to match my lashes but would probably work really well for someone with thicker, shorter lashes.</li>
    <li> I got the \\&quot;Barely There Lashes\\&quot; for my wife, who used them and reported back on how well they worked for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that it took a little while to learn how to apply the lashes, but once they are on they looked and felt great.  They stayed on, and were easy to remove.  She has not tried individual lashes, so she cannot say if that would be easier.  Ecotools is accurate in describing them as \\&quot;barely there.\\&quot;  They are very natural looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are good but she said she would prefer more dramatic lashes.</li>
    <li> You know ladies when you want to wear lashes but don&#x27;t want it to be a big deal?  These are perfect for that reason.  This is not my first time to order and likely won&#x27;t be last....love these...they are just about the only false eyelashes I wear!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for someone who wants to fill out their lashes but doesn&#x27;t want to look like she&#x27;s trying too hard.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try these lashes, but they&#x27;re seriously odd.  The individual \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; are really long, but they&#x27;re super, super thin.  Nothing at all like a normal eyelash.  They were pretty easy to apply, but did not look natural.  You could see my eyelashes, and then growing out if them were these funny wisps--too long, too thin, too uniform to be anything other than fake lashes.  Actually, you couldn&#x27;t even really see them except up close--their thinness made them blend into my skin.  Adding mascara did not help.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> They look beautiful on! I am a new lash wearer and do not like the way fake lashes look, too long, spidery, thick, or even extremely long. These are perfect. They are thin and only flare out at the end and they give you the look of natural lashes and they add a certain sexiness to the face ha-ha. The glue works wonders and at the end of the day they looked great (I live in New Mexico with strong winds and HOT humid days AND I am a plus size girl so I sweat a little more then most girls). The only Con I can think of is the band, a little thick.</li>
    <li> The wink is because these flirty lashes make you feel pretty and coquettish. The nod is for a complete endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are have worn falsies before, then you&#x27;ll have no problem with these. They&#x27;re a nice basic lash. If you haven&#x27;t, these Eco-Tools lashes are a very good place to start. They&#x27;re easy to apply and stay put. You can trim them if you feel they are too long, but I advise against this....the length is not beyond the bounds of a generous Mother Nature. And even using manicure scissors with great care, it&#x27;s easy to make a mistake and end up looking like you have a lash Mohawk. Not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eco-Tools calls this a \\&quot;lash system\\&quot; because it includes a little stick, one end of which is used to tamp down the lash band after application, the other is a little brush to blend the falsies with your own natural lashes. I didn&#x27;t bother with the tamping stick. A pinky finger is easier and how I&#x27;ve always done it. Just do a light patpatpat along the band.  The brush end is also unnecessary. You really need a very light appliction of mascara to bond and blend the falsies with your own lashes.  Don&#x27;t go overboard. Wipe most of the mascara off the wand and give each eye one quick swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most eyelash glues are not very good and I usually use surgical adhesive (it comes in a small tube and is the same consistency as eyelash glue...I have no idea what surgeons use it for, other than to glue on their own lashes, but anyway, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called and it&#x27;s waterproof and holds quite well). However, the glue provided with Eco-Tools lashes is at least as good as the surgical variety. I wore my lashes for about 9 hours and the glue held...no flipping up at the edges, no falling off or rising up in the middle...lash disasters I&#x27;ve endured with other glues). I have dry eyes, which means, oddly enough, they sometimes get a little watery. The glue stood up to the occasional tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five fluttery stars for these easy to apply, easy to wear, natural looking lashes.  If you&#x27;ve avoided wearing false lashes, these aren&#x27;t very expensive...give them a try. There is something about wearing false eyelashes that just makes you feel feminine and sexy. It&#x27;s a nice feeling.  Enjoy.ear, natural looking lashes.  If you&#x27;ve avoided wearing false lashes, these aren&#x27;t very expensive...give them a try.

    <li> My wife liked using these, or testing them if you will.  They were easy to use and remove and the pricing is not that bad.  My wife liked their appearance as well.  Shave gave them a thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I could only get one lash on.  It looked great.  The other one wouldn&#x27;t bend to my eye shape.  The black line is distracting.  For the same price I got individual short flared brown lashes.  Permalash.  I am happy I got these, because I really like the look of lashes, since I haven&#x27;t used them for 40 years. I haven&#x27;t used the new ones yet, but they look awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!  Permalash wins by a mile!  You can put as many or as few as you prefer, and the trick is to slant them out a bit.  I put 4 on each eye.  Read the instructions, and be ever so careful!</li>
    <li> If you have never used false eyelashes before, but are curious---start with these. They are simple to apply, and not garish. Even if you don&#x27;t do it perfectly, you won&#x27;t look like a female impersonator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I really like most about the EcoTools lashes is that they are adhered lightly to the insert. Not only does this keep them from flopping around inside the package, but it also leaves JUST enough sticky on the band that will allow you to trial fit these before you apply glue. I recommend that you trial-fit these before gluing, just so you know where to put them. Everyone&#x27;s eyes are shaped differently and the last thing you want to worry about when you have glue on the band is where you are going to put these. I prefer to use blunt-tipped tweezers to apply them also. Bend the band a little bit back and forth, then apply the glue lightly along the band. Lay the lashes gently alongside the top part of your upper lashes, and then use the back of your tweezers (or the wooden stick in the pkg) to press the band into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you want your lashes to last for many uses, don&#x27;t apply mascara to them. Lots of people do it, lots of sites tell you to apply mascara to mesh your natural lashes with the false lashes. You can do this if you want a mess, but I wouldn&#x27;t advise it if you are like me and want to make the most of your lash purchase by reusing them.&lt;br /&gt;Very natural, easy to apply, and they stick. Thin band so it isn&#x27;t so obvious. Will buy again. Updating soon with application tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore these for several hours, and just forgot they were there. These are some of the most natural lashes I&#x27;ve ever seen and I love them! I didn&#x27;t wear them to work because I&#x27;m not sure how 9 hours of wear will go on them, and it would be very embarassing to have them lift or fall off in front of customers. Or my co-workers, who would liken false lashes to toilet paper stuffed inside a bra, because they are that juvenile.</li>
    <li> These light weight lashes add subtle dimension. Cruelty free, they are appropriate for day time or office use. They are not terribly difficult to apply and the glue provided turns from iridescent to clear when dry. Also provided is a bamboo tool. One end has a brush to help integrate the hashes with your own, the other is slanted and designed to assist with application. Overall, I liked the added definition. It was understated and natural. They could have been more generous with the glue and I prefer invisible bands to the black one that accompanied the lashes. Of course that can be made less obvious with judicious application of eye liner and shadow. I didn&#x27;t find the applicator particularly helpful--my fingers worked well.  I think these make a good starter set. As with most things, practice makes perfect and there are many good tutorials on the internet. Lashes have come a long way and with proper application these can reward the wearer with a major boost in confidence. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Judging by the name, these lashes are better for you than your average falsies. They are paraben and phthalate free, latex-free, and so forth.  Of course, I have no idea if the false eyelashes I normally use contain bad chemicals or if this is just green-washing.  Suffice to say, there isn&#x27;t loads of information on your average false eyelashes package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does contain more than most.  Most eyelash sets come with lashes alone, glue sold separately.  This set comes with glue, the eyelashes, and a bamboo stick for applying the lashes.  I tried to apply the lashes before going out.  I&#x27;m not a professional at applying lashes, but I have worn them from time to time for performances and stage shows.  I have always found them painful to apply but usually can get them on.  Based on my past experience - and this experience - I&#x27;ll tell you what I liked and didn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the glue a lot.  It wasn&#x27;t very viscous, but went on smoothly and without a lot of clumps.  I didn&#x27;t like the stick - I didn&#x27;t see the point in it. If I let go of the eyelash to use the stick, the eyelash came unpeeled.  I normally use an eyelash curler to press them on, or just my hands.  Back to the glue, the eyelashes did NOT stick.  They kept coming unpeeled.  Also, I found it hard to get the curvature of the eyelash to match my eye.  That last part is not unusual for all false eyelashes, which is why I generally buy the half-size ones for the outer edge of the eyes, which is easier to apply.  The size, however, was good and I didn&#x27;t have to trim these.  Overall, they didn&#x27;t go on as &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; - as it was obvious if they weren&#x27;t applied directly to your underlying lash line, and I couldn&#x27;t get them to stay  on.  I got frustrated and gave up.  However, I still think this is likely a good product that requires more patience than I currently have.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use them for the salon I work for.</li>
    <li> I LOVE these lashes! The look super natural and are so easy to clean. The little spoolie they come with blends them out wonderfully after they set. My ONLY complaint is that the glue that comes with it is... not useful. I had my own (lash grip) and ended up continuing to use that. Other than that these are excellent and I will definitely be purchasing them again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many lashes and these are not only easy to apply they look and feel real.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie who owns about 60 pairs of eyelashes at any point in time. When I got the chance to review the new Eco-Tools lashes, I jumped at the chance. I love this brand. Their products are cruelty free, vegan, and ethical. Their brushes are to die for, and provide a beautiful makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The type I tried were the &#x27;barely there&#x27; lashes. My first impression was that these are small. They only over 1/2 the eye, with just a bit of flare. They are perfect for those who are new to lashes or want a bit of extra lash without it looking &#x27;fake&#x27;. The lashes come with a fine case that can be reused (LOVE) and most of all an epic application tool which has a spoolie on one end and a blunt orange stick on the other to aid in pressing the lashes down and brushing them into your own lashes. This is brilliant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had two downsides. The first was the glue provided did not work for me. My lashes were popping up like popcorn. I broke down, used my faithful Duo and had no issues. The other is the lashes are so small they were hard to &#x27;bend&#x27;. This is when I wiggle the strip to make it have more round shape for easier application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were small downsides. I love this product and it is reusable, so grab some to try and love. Get them for the application tool and the easy everyday look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> They are not wide enough, they only go across about half of my eyelid, that I can&#x27;t understand why they would not be large enough to go all the way across. The lashes are find and look natural which I do like. I have tried false lashes before and these are a little nicer than the ones I had tried before. The band was skinnier so it doesn&#x27;t show as much, I could blend it using liquid eye liner so it wasn&#x27;t noticeable. But being that it covers only half the eye is a deal breaker, I have some lashes, very thin but they are the whole way across and it looks odd to only have a lot on one side. I also had trouble putting them on, took me almost an hour, they didn&#x27;t want to go on right, then they didn&#x27;t want to stick and I had to keep playing with them. I wish that some company would come out with something that was easy to apply, would stay put and looked natural. My lashes and brows are really very thin and I was really hoping that these would help. I guess I have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> These are really natural looking and light-weight. Which is exactly why I don&#x27;t love them. If you want something easy no one will be able to tell is fake, this will get you pretty close. If you want something dramatic, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;I found these rather easy to apply with a little maneuvering and a mirror I didn&#x27;t have to hold. They were even easier to take off and removing them didn&#x27;t pull out my eyelashes or hurt, so I was glad if that.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t think I will be using them very much. I was expecting something more dramatic and instead this is something you can&#x27;t tell you have on, which is good if that is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> Love this. Very natural and easily trimmed. Comes with a very easy adhesive applicator that I use on my other lashes when I&#x27;m looking for something more dramatic. They sometimes lift up but it&#x27;s probably because I use them for days at a time.</li>
    <li> I have sparse eyelashes. I wanted to try falsies. I had never used them before. I am not likely to try them again, because this was a total fail for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the strip of lashes is very narrow. It&#x27;s about half the width of my eyelid (which is not extra wide or anything). Judging by the photo on the package, I guess you&#x27;re supposed to apply these to the outside only. I dont&#x27; know why that would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I couldn&#x27;t get them glued on correctly. I think maybe having someone else help would have been useful, but I was home alone. I ended up giving up and throwing them in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the product is probably all right. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. These are not fake-looking lashes. If you can manage to apply them correctly, they will enhance your natural lashes, not make you look excessively made-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that they come with (a tiny amount of) glue. I wish they had included more detailed instructions for newbies.</li>
    <li> These had a lot of pluses. This was my first experience with false eyelashes, and application was far easier than I anticipated. The glue didn&#x27;t have much odor and seemed to dry quickly. I liked that the glue changed color--it made it easier to apply. Removal was also relatively simple and painless. I have sensitive skin, and had no problems during the brief time I wore them. So no complaints there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I looked completely ridiculous wearing them. It&#x27;s not so much that I looked like I was wearing false eyelashes, although you could definitely tell up close. It looked like I had applied black liner halfway across my eyes and gave up right in the middle. This style is called \\&quot;barely there\\&quot; and that at least is right--my eyelashes are very pale red--pretty much invisible, and these did nothing to enhance them. The shape is definitely not natural, either. They are very long on the outside corner, then fade to almost nothing. To the extent you can see them, it looks stupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the lashes themselves were disappointing, I&#x27;ll at least have the glue handy if/when I try falsies again.</li>
    <li> I have never used false eyelashes before and thought these looked fun to try. I like that they are natural, and then glue is natural too. They were a little tricky to apply, as I couldn&#x27;t get them lined up quite right. A little practice, and I think I will get them fine. They had some adhesive on them from being stuck in the packaging and this adhesive was part of why I had trouble. It stuck when I was trying to manipulate them around to get them in place. This adhesive also seemed to keep them from flexing into the properly shaped curve that is shown in the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I couldn&#x27;t figure out if I should apply my makeup first or after I put these on. After, it was difficult to apply eye liner. And without it, they looked a bit strange since they don&#x27;t go all the way to the end and it looked like I had forgotten to line part of my eye. I did like that the lash line on these looks like eye liner, which made it blend with my makeup well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using the wooden applicator stick, but it was a little awkward, so I used my fingernails to help get these in place. Probably not the right method. The directions show pictures, which is helpful, even if I couldn&#x27;t get them to flex just right and go where they ought to be applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied natural mascara after putting these on. I wore them for a few hours before removing them. They bothered my after a while, simply because my skin is sensitive and just having them in place irritated my eyelids after a few hours. But, after I removed them, I had no redness or trouble with the glue at all. The irritation was just from the sensation of having something there that I usually don&#x27;t have on my lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like that they were not huge and they looked natural and not stage-like. With a little practice, I think these would be nice for special occasions. It&#x27;s great that they can be washed and reused. Just be sure to plug the drain before rinsing, in case you drop one. I will post photos of with and without the lashes after I post my review.photos of with and without the lashes after I post my review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before but as most mascara&#x27;s irritate my eyes, I was really interested in trying these Ecotools lashes.  It took me a few tries to put then on correctly but once I did they looked really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are hypo-allergenic and paraben free and did not irritate my eyes. That being said, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d wear them on a daily basis, but for a special occasion, or family photo I think they would be great. Nice lashes, and look pretty too.</li>
    <li> Ok so these work just fine, functionally- but they look too natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear lashes I want lashes! Big, poofy, over-the-top burlesque queen lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These look like normal lashes. In fact, they look smaller than my normal lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess they&#x27;re fine if you&#x27;re missing lashes, but go elsewhere for over-the-top glam.</li>
    <li> These lashes are great, I&#x27;m not one for super fake looking long and ridiculously full fake lashes. My goal is to enhance but not have anyone notice that I am wearing false lashes and these are perfect for that. If you are the intense eye makeup kinda girl than these probably aren&#x27;t for you. Easier to place than full lashes also I think, but I&#x27;m not that good at it because I rarely wear false lashes.</li>
    <li> Eco Tools Barely There lashes are great for the person looking to wear falsies but not look like they are wearing falsies. They are naturally constructed to be shorter towards the inner eye and longer towards the outer eye. They are very lightweight and look very natural. I also love that Eco Tools eyelash glue does not contain Formaldehyde and is made of all-natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> First of all, applying fake lashes takes practice. i think it took about 5-7 times before I felt like I could do it without taking alot of time and alot of reapplications. So be patient with yourself!  These were a bit easier to put on than some of the other thicker lashes I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes were very natural compared to some of the lashes on the market.  Could be worn during the day without screaming &amp;#34;fakes&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never put mascara on my fake lashes it gums them up and they don&#x27;t last as long. But I do put eyeliner on top of the line where they are applied, which helps camoflage the area where they are applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most important features -  no formaldehyde, latex, parabens, or phthalates. I get very nervous about putting so many chemicals near my eyes so that is a huge plus for me.</li>
    <li> I used to faithfully wear the Winks by Georgie lash adhesive, bc it was specially formulated with botanicals and WITHOUT latex which is my main allergen/ irritant. But after several failed attempts at ordering the correct adhesive (kept getting Georgie lash adhesive-there is a difference-it contains latex) so i gave up and ordered this, which I really love also. The product itself is actually better, however two things I dont like is the stupid bottle it comes in. It is small but it lasts a long time but it has a stupid little &#x27;trowel&#x27; to scoop the glue out with when I wish it just had a brush or squeeze bottle. It dries fast but when you take it off, some of the glue stays on your lids and lashes and gums up your falsies, so be diligent about cleaning them both.</li>
    <li> NOT hypoallergenic.  I found the ingredients on two other sites.  They are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethylhexyl Acrylate Copolymer , Glide-on Glue: Acrylates , water , methylisothiazolinone , methylchloroisothiazolinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those last two ingredients are two highly allergenic ones.  Sad that the description here does not include the ingredient list.  It only states what is NOT included (formaldehyde, latex, etc.). Do your own research and see what it DOES contain.</li>
    <li> So light and easy to apply. Glue doesn&#x27;t need 45 sec to dry. I&#x27;ve tried 7 different kinds and these are the best so far</li>
</ol>
