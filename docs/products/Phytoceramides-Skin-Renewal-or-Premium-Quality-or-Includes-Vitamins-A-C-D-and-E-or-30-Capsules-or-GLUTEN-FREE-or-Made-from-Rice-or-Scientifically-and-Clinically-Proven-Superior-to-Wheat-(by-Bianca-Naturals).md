<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really think I see a difference in my skin  I haven&#x27;t necessarily had anyone tell me how much better I look but overall, I would definitely recommend it. I take care of my skin in other ways as well and often get compliments on my skin so I have not taken it as a negative that no one has suddenly noticed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great stuff. I really believe it works. Wrinkles not as visible and I really look younger!</li>
    <li> I heard about phytoceramides on Dr Oz. He say&#x27;s you can get a &amp;#34;facelift&amp;#34; from a pill. And yes it has firmed and smoothed the skin on my face, but I have noticed results all over.  The skin on my hands, arms and legs is smoother and holds more moisture.  Also I noticed some of the ingredients in this pill like A C and E vitamins are recommended by my ophthalmologist to  help stop macular degeneration so I don&#x27;t have to buy that separately any longer - Amazing pill! Going to recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this product and its fast results!  It is most definitely produced better results than any skin cream or serum I have previously tried and at a lesser cost!!  I was very impressed with the fast delivery and intend to order more!</li>
    <li> Wow, who would think a supplement like this would make a difference.  I had a friend suggest it and have been incredibly happy after using this product.  I see a notable difference in my skin and it also makes me feel good to know I am getting additional vitamins when I take it!  I plan to buy more right away!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this product would give me a little boost as my face seems to be aging quickly these days, but after using the whole bottle, I see no difference whatsoever.  I won&#x27;t bother to buy another..</li>
    <li> I just got started on this product and can not say honestly that I have given it the six week trial-test.  :But I can tell you the service is wonderful, I ordered and it came immediatly, well-packed, etc I just started it.It is winter here and miserable and I do suffer from windburn a lot and swear I think I already think my skin is more resistant to the windburn also I have roseasea (SP?) and have a particularly bad, unhealing patch on my left cheek that I think is better already.  It is too soon to say in all truthfullness because I have only been on the stuff a short time.....but I do think it is helping my rosashea and wind-burn....I will use this seller again until at least six months to see for sure but they are very prompt and I think I am going to like this helpful product.  I have VERY delicate skin, live on a farm and have to be out in bad weather all the time no matter what so I suffer a lot from cold/dry/burn plus the rosashea...I think it is h helping already. I would recommend giving it a fair try for at least two months if one has problem skin of any type......I like the sellers....they were prompt.</li>
    <li> Think about this! It&#x27;s all about the physiology of this product. Yes! It totally works, but when your cells plump to fill in your wrinkles...so do you. You gain weight! Weigh it out!! No wrinkles &amp; 5 plus additional poundage? Or wrinkles, no added poundage?</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for one month so I am sure it is not a fair test of it&#x27;s effectiveness but so far I can not tell much difference in my skin.  It will probably take longer to be able to tell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT... PHYTOCERAMIDES&lt;br /&gt;  IT STARTED WORKING RIGHT AWAY AND I AM SOOOOOOOO PLEASED.&lt;br /&gt;  I AM NOT A YOUNG WOMEN AND DON&#x27;T EXPECT TO LOOK LIKE ONE BUT, THE RESULTS ARE FANTASTIC..&lt;br /&gt;  YOU WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  THANKS PHYTOCERAMIDES</li>
    <li> I am a runner and workout. When using this product, my face could not sweat. It seem to cause me to over heat quicker. Not recommended at all!!!</li>
    <li> After almost sixty days, I notice improvement in my skin.  I think the more I use it, the better my skin will become.  Right now I notice a smoothness and some vibrancy.</li>
    <li> I &#x27;VE TAKEN THE PRODUCT AS ADVERTISED AND AFTER A MONTH THERE IS NOT DIFFERENCE IN ANY WAY OR SHPE. I THINK THIS PRODUCT ITS OVERLY RATED AND TRULY DESAPOINTING....&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NOTHING BUT ROAD BLOCKS WITH TRAYING TO SEND IT BACK AS THEY PROMISED MONEY BACK GUARANTY.</li>
    <li> after 60 days other people are noticing that I&#x27;m looking &#x27;different&#x27; (in a good way).  I&#x27;m so pleased with your product, it has produced the promised results.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommened it to friends and family.  Thanks so much for helping me look my best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how well this works.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s, and have been wanting to get a facelift to get rid of sagging jowls and neck.  You know how you pull your face back and see how much better it looks?  Well, in less than a month, I&#x27;ve noticed my jowls are disappearing, and I am no longer wishing my skin was pulled back to look better.  In addition, wrinkles do seem to be fading.  Some one mentioned yesterday I look more refreshed.  Yea!  I&#x27;ll be using this for a long while.</li>
    <li> this is a scam  its all in the genetics  not in a product  I wish I would of never wasted my money on this item</li>
    <li> I have used it for one month and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I am hoping that after using it for another month, I might see some!&lt;br /&gt;Hence I have placed and received an order for 6 more bottles. My husband is taking it too and hasn&#x27;t seen any improvement either!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with eczema for years and had it around my eyes.  Now that I am older wrinkles have set in rapidly.  I wanted an eye lift then received an article about phytoceramides by Dr. Oz.  I tried this product and was amazed!  It took about 3 weeks when I noticed a big difference. Sun spots have faded and many wrinkles have decreased profoundly!  I have been taking this product 2 1/2 months and LOVE the results!  I am less self conscious about how I look.  I also use a topical vitamin C as recommended by the plastic surgeons on the Dr. Oz show.  I am very happy I tried this!!!</li>
    <li> I have just finished my first bottle. I bought it some time ago and was slow to try it. I have received many compliments on my skin. I would have started using it sooner if I had know that others noticed my skin! My skin feels smoother and is not as dry.</li>
    <li> As a mature person I find this to do quite a good job and intend to continue using this each day.</li>
    <li> At this writing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three months, now. There are no side effects that I notice, and I do see some lessoning of fine lines around the eyes. At my age (over 60), I wouldn&#x27;t expect much more, really; but it&#x27;s better than going to an expensive surgery!</li>
    <li> Looking closely at the ingredients, it contains most of the vitamins I already take everyday.  I&#x27;ll let you know in another month if I see the fantastic resturation of my youth--at least on my face.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended that I try Phytoceramides. After only three weeks I began to see a difference. The &amp;#34;scowl&amp;#34; lines between my brows began to get visibly &amp;#34;lighter,&amp;#34; as though they were filling in — when I run my finger across them, they don&#x27;t feel as deep. Plus my face has taken on younger, smoother texture. All in all, I&#x27;m definitely seeing changes. I have to admit that I&#x27;m astonished. I&#x27;m fairly skeptical about &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; products. If a friend hadn&#x27;t recommended it, I probably would never have tried it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in conjunction with Wrinkle Magic.  My face does look better but I believe it is because of the Wrinkle Magic.  I might switch back to my GNC - hair, skin, and nails vitamins.</li>
    <li> Have noticed an improvement in wrinkles around my eyes and small amount around mouth area, hope I continue to see more improvement with continued use. Thank You</li>
    <li> This is truly amazing , in the first week I noticed my skin was more hydrated , smoother , after 2 full weeks it is super hydrated, smooth &amp; age spots are gone , wrinkles are barely there, my skin is Dewey like when I was in my 20&#x27;s, I&#x27;m 47.  It&#x27;s done wonders for my face , however my legs , arms , hands , feet , skin all over is moisturized &amp; smooth.  Will definitely keep taking it . I will write another review after a full month.</li>
    <li> Ok so I try all this stuff like the cambogia to lose weight and got Nothing out of that no loss what so ever. Then saw the ad for this and thought well I&#x27;ll try it but its going to probably be like everything else, however, I have begun to notice that my skin on my arms aren&#x27;t as dry as they usually are. Also my hands look some better. I am 55 yrs old and have always had dry skin so I have to say there is a difference. I will probably try another bottle to see if it gets better. This was my first bottle and I have to say it at least has shown signs that it may just help.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference and this may be because I am focusing on the dark circles under my eyes.  I really hoped to see an improvement with my under eye circles.  Because it may take a bit longer than others to see a difference in my skin I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Firstly,I guess all of the makers of phytoceremides watched the Dr.Oz show and tripled their prices!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I gave this product a one star rating because I have been taking for one month and their is absolutely no change in skin hydration,appearance of fine lines,wrinkles nothing.I just ordered another Phytoceramide brand which is cheaper and a five star rating from customers-I purchased a two month supply-I figure two months I should know if its going to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!and no,I didnt hear about phytoceramides on the Dr.Oz show- Who could possibly afford all of the items he promotes? If this other purchase doesnt work I WILL NOT BE THROWING ANY MORE MONEY AWAY ON THIS PRODUCT.It sure would be nice to have hydration from within but is their really a MIRACLE in a bottle,we ll  see. Almost forgot,the reason for 1 star Amazon processed and shipped in a very timely manner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I DID TAKE THESE AS DIRECTED, BUT I DID NOT GET ANY EXTRA BENEFIT FROM IT. I DO TAKE THE SAME VITAMINS&lt;br /&gt;BUT IN DIFFERENT STRENGTHS. I WAS HOPING THAT THESE WOULD GIVE AN EXTRA BOOST.</li>
    <li> I can not see any difference.  I have gone thru one and 1/2 bottles. Do you have any suggestions for me</li>
    <li> I am pushing 70 and could see results in less than one bottle and have ordered my second bottle. Very satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> This is a joke...maybe it works on younger people that don&#x27;t really need it to begin with.....in your 60&#x27;s?  Forget it and save up for a facelift</li>
    <li> The contents of this package with the most valuable vitamins for body and skin especially recommended by dr. Oz, can not go wrong. I am very happy with this product, and will be buying more  to maintain the health of my skin which naturally shows as a gradual improvement as all vitamins do.</li>
    <li> The product was great! My dry, blotchy skin has cleared up tremendously. I&#x27;m glad to know there&#x27;s a product out there that actually works.  I would refer this product to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been almost one month and I have noticed no difference.  I&#x27;m hoping for more results in the next 30 days.</li>
    <li> Went through 30 days. Didn&#x27;t see a lot of improvement and what little there was may because I got more sleep.</li>
    <li> Took a selfie before and after taking two bottles and couldn&#x27;t see a difference.  So, I couldn&#x27;t see spending any more money on this product.</li>
    <li> I have been taking Phytoceramides for the past two months.  I just received my new supply, and I have received outstanding results. Receiving compliments from other woman all of the time, people will walk up to me and say how beautiful my skin is.  What I have noticed is that the laugh lines have been significantly been educed to eliminated.  Even this morning I realized that I had a skin tag on my left cheek bone that just feel off when I washed my face.  There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by that I do not take them, so taking them on a regular basis is critical. Don&#x27;t run out of the product, and it is safe and loaded with vitamins.  I am a health educator, and they have all of the nutrients to feed our skin.  I agree with Doctor Oz, they are a face lift in a bottle.  Enjoy!  I do!&lt;br /&gt;Deb</li>
    <li> I decided to live with my wrinkles and grow old gracefully instead of using this product.  As soon as I started taking this supplement I started breaking out on my forehead which has never happend before.  If I didn&#x27;t take it for a couple of days my forehead would start clearing up again....take the product again and I would break out again.....so enough.  I would rather have a few wrinkles than zits.</li>
    <li> i did not expect to see a miracle, but i didn&#x27;t see any change at all after using it for a month......</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am planning to order anything from Amazon, she reminds me she is running low on Phytoceramides, true or not.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in my skin after four weeks. I have been taking this pill for about four weeks daily, I see no difference.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using Phytoceramides by Bianca Naturals a month ago and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I noticed any difference in my skin. I was trying to be patient, as it said that it could take up to four weeks to notice any significant difference. And voila! The fine lines around my eyes are all but gone and I&#x27;ve noticed that the lines between my eyes have filled in, as well and have begun to diminish. My skin does seem more even toned and the area under my eyes has also lightened up. I&#x27;m really amazed!! My husband noticed the difference in his skin too. We are often skeptical of products like this, but are now true believers and will be re-ordering! It&#x27;s safe and doesn&#x27;t seem to pose any side-affects. Awesome!!</li>
    <li> This product works very well however, you must drink lots of water. In the being I wasn&#x27;t aware that I need to drink more water while taking this product. when you consume enough water It does make a difference with the fine lines on the face.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> Good results in short period of time.  I was very surprised how well this has been working.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I am now on the third bottle, I am 65, &amp;amp; have noticed my over all skin feels more moist &amp;amp; supple. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I am 72 yrs old and was starting to have really bad wrinkles after several months of taking Phytoceramides I am finally seeing improvement. My skin has always been good, but old is old and I needed help! I will continue to take Bianca Naturals.</li>
    <li> this amazing product gave me amazing and skin so soft results  thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;Diann Walker</li>
    <li> I am a 69 year old woman and have tried all kinds of things to get rid of the wrinkles on my face.  I noticed a difference about the 2nd week after using this project.  Most of my skin problems were wrinkles on my upper lip and lower lip.  I can definitely see the improvement of my skin texture after using this project.  I don&#x27;t think a person will ever get rid of all the wrinkles appearing because of age facture but this project sure helped my wrinkles not being so prominite. A person needs to remember to keep hydrated at all times so the skin has moisture and does not become dryed out.  The service was great by Bianca Naturals and I would recommend this project to anyone wanting to improve your skin.</li>
    <li> Helps restore moisture &amp; firmness .</li>
    <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! After taking this product for two months, my skin has never looked or felt better. I also have noticed that my fine lines on my face are less noticeable. The better news, I have received a number of unsolicited positive comments about the glow on my face from other people. I realize there is no miracle pill, but this is a less intrusive and more economical than a face lift. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>

    <li> I think I&#x27;m seeing some improvement in my face and hands, but have some problems that just came up and am wondering if anyone else has noticed this--I&#x27;m really constipated, can&#x27;t stop eating and am gaining weight.  This is all new for me.  Anyone else?</li>
    <li> I chose this product because I&#x27;m a 66 year old breast cancer surviver and am always looking for products that will improve the texture and look of my skin. Certainly as we age our skin changes, but after the chemo therapy I notice much more loose skin, fine lines and drooping around my mouth and cheeks. I&#x27;m 5 ft. 51/2 in. tall and only weigh 97 pounds, so I&#x27;m sure that contributes, but this product gave my skin a boost and it felt softer in just a week. I noticed an improvement of the texture in just about 2 weeks. I&#x27;m out of the capsules, but still us the collagen every day and my skin looks younger and less blotchy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who wants an improvement in the texture and appearance of their skin.</li>
    <li> I am currently in my 3rd bottle of Phytoceramides by Bianca.  In my opinion, it took 1 1/2 bottles to see very noticeable results.  My husband, who is less critical, said he saw the fine lines disappearing sooner.  All of my fine lines are now gone and working on the deeper lines.  I can definitely say that I will use this product for the rest of my life!  The price is exceptional for what the product does for the skin.  I&#x27;ve always had moist skin due to the moisturizer that I have used for years, so I can not comment on added moisture to my skin.  Without revealing my true age ;) ... I&#x27;ll say that I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and am a 2 year survivor of stage 4 cancer.  I have always aged well (genetics); however, treatment took a tremendous toll on my age-fighting.  This product has reversed all the affects of treatment and then some. People who do not see me on a daily basis are amazed at how I look.  Recently, a friend who has not seen me in a few years, told my husband ... how is it that Linda keeps looking younger ?  Enough said there !!!!</li>
    <li> Such a great product!!  I have been using it for four months and love the results.  After using it for two months I was able to see a change in my skin.  I am a sickly person and was looking very tired and blotchy.  After using this product, my skin immediately became firmer and vibrant.  My daughters asked what I was using and I wanted to keep the secret all to myself.  ;)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and noticed my skin has a lot more moisture than it had before taking Phytoceramides. I am going to continue taking them to see if I notice any other difference in my skin. So far I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I took this for a few days and didn&#x27;t feel right... so I stopped. I think it&#x27;s too hight in Vit. A. Best to really listen to your body on some of this stuff.</li>
    <li> this product makes your skin soft and moist and even helps those wrinkles start to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Oz turned me onto this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 6 weeks now and I have noticed a great improvement. My eyes are brighter, there is less puffiness when I wake up in the morning and even my hands and feet are softer. I recommend this pill to any man who doesn&#x27;t want to deal with all the mess and tiresome and tedious routine of creams, potions and lotions.</li>
    <li> Used for over a month and saw absolutely no difference at all.  I would say copper peptides are the ticket.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell if this product works or not. Probably need more time to evaluate it.</li>
    <li> Of course, at the age of 70 you cannot expect miracles but I did not see any improvement in my skin texture or appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I am obviously beyond good and evil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Milne</li>
    <li> I saw results the first day I took the capsules. My skin has improved every day since. My eyelids are no longer candidates for surgery. (I just visited my eye doctor and that is his assessment.) The micro-wrinkles on my hands and arms are gone, and it has been less than two weeks. People have told me I look like I&#x27;m feeling better. After 3 weeks, a skin tag on my hand is all but gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw results the first day with my wife. Mostly it was a glow - first on her forehead, but the micro-wrinkles on her cheeks are already gone after 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could not be happier with these results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already re-ordered...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an effective product.</li>
    <li> DID NOT SEE ANY IMPROVEMENT, I WOULD LIKE A REFUND AS STATED.  I KNOW PURCHASED&lt;br /&gt;THE PHYTOCERAMIDE 350 MG WITH LIPWHEAT WHICH ACTUALLY IS THE ONE DR. OZ RECOMMENDS</li>
    <li> I have been using this phytoceramide product for a couple of months. I read that you should not expect to see results for at least the 2nd month, but my skin started to get smoother and firmer after a couple of weeks of use and continues to get better. What&#x27;s amazing is that the skin all over my body, especially my arms and legs are smoother and firmer.  If you are 40 or over and are concerned about aging skin (which means just about everyone) you really should try this product.</li>
    <li> After having taken phytoceramides for about 6 months,  I am pleased with the skin on my face.  It looks and feels softer than before.</li>
    <li> I have been taking tis vitamin for 30 days seems to help plump up the skin.Taking it and using 180 degree hyaluronic serum with vitiman C. Are my wrinkles gone no, But I do feel it helps. Heck I am 70 years old it it helps a little thats great.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product.  I am definitely noticing a difference in my skin. It looks more healthy and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now. While I don&#x27;t really notice huge difference in my skin, for my surprise it helped with my memory. Yeap, believe or not, phytoceramides helps with the memory as per some researches as far as I read, and I really notice a big difference there. Therefore, I&#x27;ll keep using it because I guess it is a two in one product.&lt;br /&gt;I could not forget to mention that their customer service is great. As a former customer service supervisor, I can say that they are well trained.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and already see the difference. My face feels like a baby face, smooth and fresh... Will be buying more shortly and will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition the seller is very helpful and is there to answer any questions and I almost forgot, received my order very quick!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks...&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> THIS REDUCED THE SIZE OF THE PORES ON MY FACE IN ABOUT 10 DAYS....VERY NOTICABLE CHANGE.</li>
    <li> Tried it for a month and saw no changes.  Haven&#x27;t seen anything on how to get a refund or at least another bottle to try it for another month for those who need to use it for more than 30 days.  Wish their &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34; was straightforward.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference within two weeks. My skin was softer and the lines around my eyes were finer. Overall healthier skin tone and I really like the product.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have been using this product for a few weeks now and have noticed a decrease in the lines around my eyes and nose. My face appears fuller and more firm. I have been using the triple c serum night and day along with the pills. So far I am very pleased with the results and it has only been a short time. Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after a few months. I would highly recommend this product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I gave it a two month try and there is NO DIFFERENCE anywhere.  I thought there would be a slight improvement somewhere and there has not been a change in anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  Select a pair of parents with good genes and eat lots of fruits and vegetables and STAY OUT OF THE SUN.</li>
    <li> I rated it three stars because I have only used it for a short time.  However, I have made these observations:  1.  Fewer frown lines on my forehead.  2.  A fuller face and smoother skin.  3.  A difference in my total body appearance-- it looks a little better.  4.  Less dry feet--I swim 3-4 times per week.  I have ordered another bottle to see if there will be more improvements.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the product! It makes my skin smooth and less wrinkle</li>
    <li> I could see the difference in about 4 weeks of using Bianca Natural. I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s i didn&#x27;t see dramatic result from one month supply</li>
    <li> Was looking for a magical anti-aging skin product. At 71 there is no magic but hope. This capsule strengthened my nails in six weeks. Couldn&#x27;t&#x27; figure out why my nails stopped splitting and breaking. Only change in my diet was this capsule. I&#x27;ll continue to take these. I&#x27;ll have to wait to have all these jowels and furrows disappear.</li>
    <li> It has made a change very slight in 2 weeks. Will buy more when supply runs low and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have taken care of my skin with quality topical creams for many years.  Lately I&#x27;ve noticed a dullness and sag setting in.  So I figured why not give Phytoceramides a try.  I saw no results for 30 days ...but at 40 days I began to notice a BIG difference.  My skin is plumper and has a glow to it I have not seen in a long time, ...even with all the high end serums and creams I apply am and pm&lt;br /&gt;religiously.  I am a believer in this vitamin and how it works from the inside out.  The results are wonderful !  I think it could be a fountain of youth for me!</li>
    <li> I quickly received a month&#x27;s worth of this product and took it every day for the past month with no other changes in my diet or lifestyle.  I do believe that I noticed some change in my skin feeling more hydrated, both in my face and in my hands.  I have very dry skin on my hands primarily, since I have eczema, so skin hydration is a chore and always something that I need to pay attention to.  I see some others posted that the results came after month one, so I may not be fully qualified to say for sure one way or the other, therefore my 3 star rating.  I might encourage someone to try for a few months if they are looking for new options.</li>
    <li> At 60 years old you can&#x27;t expect much. However,  very surprised at smoothness it has provided. Safe and trusting source, give it a try!</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing great product ive tried others but this one actually has worked wonders on my skin. Even though i had trouble receiving my second order this buyer is awesome. They sent me out another product in replacement no questions asked. Highly recommend. I will definitely buy more. Thank you so much for the great service.</li>
    <li> It has only been 30 days and have not really seen a change, I have 1 more bottle to do and we will see how it goes. Not very hopeful at this point</li>
    <li> Good product seeing results already</li>
    <li> I sweet buy this stuff...My face is smooth and younger looking the more I use it...combined  hydraulic acid serum...and no doing the great effects! And I am 55!</li>
    <li> I do like these vitamins and can honestly say that with three days I woke up with more moisture in my skin. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> love this I need to get more</li>
    <li> Looking for ward to see if it works like people are telling that it will. Good good good good goood</li>
    <li> This has made my skin smoother.  it really seems to moisturize from the inside out, and there doesn&#x27;t appear to be any side effects.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product and fast shipping. Noticeable difference in my skin after only one month of use. It has also given me energy. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. It was originally seen on the Ellen Show and I thought I&#x27;d try it. After 30 days my skin was noticeably smoother, after 60 days my facial wrinkles are reduced. I&#x27;m older than 60.</li>
    <li> did not work - my husband used it for several months</li>
    <li> I have been taking this for exactly one month and can honestly say I do not see any change in my facial skin. still have one bottle to go, then I will see.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a month and I see no different. Maybe it works on very fine lines but definitely not on deeper ones. I don&#x27;t  see a different anywhere on my face. Waste of money as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> I waited until I finish the whole bottle and the only thing I notice was I broke out on my chest, face and back.  There was no difference in my skin texture at all.  I would not recommend this product to anyone!  I will continue to try other products just because, everyone would like to look younger and something is out there that can help in some small way.</li>
    <li> I do find my skin to be firmer and the wrinkles lessened.  I have used this product for more than one year, and will continue to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service from this company, too!</li>
    <li> There is only 40 mg of phytoceramide per ingredient display. The ceramide may trigger the prostaglandin which makes inflammation, wrinkles, and pain. So, I bought it but ended up not taking it [...].full</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be making my skin look younger and firmer. Yea, great for a mother of a 3 year old who just turned 45!</li>
    <li> I just thought I would give it a try and it does work! I have dabbled in expensive Botox treatments had my doubts about this very affordable pill and to my surprise the lines in my neck are not as obvious!</li>
    <li> The product was shipped fast and I used it.  I noticed a slight improvement in the texture of my skin.  If you are looking for the fountain of youth in a bottle this isn&#x27;t it.  You need to incorporate proper diet, exercise, rest and hydration along with taking this product.  It is expensive and I found cheaper versions of the same thing on this site and on Ebay.</li>
    <li> Love love LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve been using for 2 months and the results are amazing!!  I look like I&#x27;ve had a facelift!!!  Add a Costco-size jar of collagen and VOILA!  Magic!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for  2.5 months. Love it! It has improved the lines on my chin  from my bad teenage skin years.&lt;br /&gt;I am in my 50&#x27;s and those have become more pronounced over the years. I saw an improvement within a month and it has been getting better. My skin is much more supple and youthful looking.  Someone forwarded it to me and I am glad they did. I plan to keep this part of my daily suppliments . The only thing was I have to take it in the afternoon due to hot flashes...&lt;br /&gt;Love IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Donna M.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd month; which is when they say you generally start to notice a difference. I&#x27;m kicking myself right now that I didn&#x27;t take a before picture, but I&#x27;me happy with the product.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle, I hope it works...............I do not see results yet. but hope to. inone more bottle.</li>
    <li> I am extremely happy with this product. It has made my skin more radiant.  My skin also seems more hydrated.</li>
    <li> It took a couple months, but my complexion is clearer and much improved. Don&#x27;t know HOW it works but&lt;br /&gt;I see a difference!</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much.  I could see a difference in my skin within a week or so. It didn&#x27;t seem as dry and wrinkles softer looking.  I hope it continues to &amp;#34;turn back the clock&amp;#34;. Adding this product to my skincare regime,  makes me make sure that I cleanse and moisturize properly.  Thank you</li>
    <li> no effect at all on 57 year old man with oily skin</li>
    <li> can not tell any changes at all.has not helped my wrinkles at all.is NOT HELPING AT ALL. NO changes what so ever.</li>
    <li> Beauty in a pill, I don&#x27;t think so!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, I use it every day, the change is my skin surprises me. Fresher, younger, more vibrant. I look in the mirror in the morning and I am a happy woman. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product and this seller.</li>
    <li> I can tell the difference in my skin. Pores are smaller, and my skin is brighter. I will continue to order.</li>
