<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love my baggy beret. I plan on ordering more.</li>
    <li> This hat fits nicely. This is a good grab and go hat.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the color I wanted...</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift but I can tell you it is beyond soft and pretty. It arrived on time. I&#x27;m sure the person who gets it is going to very pleased.</li>
    <li> Quality decent but thought it was going to be grey not purple.</li>
    <li> Not gray...more like a blueish purple color kinda odd</li>
    <li> It took over a month for me to receive this beanie, which I expected, but since I had waited so long for it I was very disappointed to find that it was not gray. Mine is purple, not even remotely gray. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay more for it, because I doubt I&#x27;ll ever wear it. It is a decent looking slouch beanie, but this is probably not the hat for you if you specifically want that nice looking gray in the picture.</li>
    <li> Well received by my lady</li>
    <li> I love it! And it arrived in decent timing</li>
    <li> The cap was recd earlier than promised.  The quality is excellent and I would order again</li>
    <li> I love slouchy hats. I cant help myself.</li>
    <li> Really like the fit. I am able to tuck all my hair underneath it and it looks cute. The hat is Purple though, NOT Grey.</li>
    <li> Love the hat. It fit perfectly and the description was exact. In some lights it can have a slight purple tint to it but it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Despite the previous reviews, I ordered this thinking it would come as they grey pictured. NOPE. It is PURPLE, NOT GREY, but I LOVE IT. It is super cute, and way warm! Definitely wanna order more!!</li>
    <li> The color almost looked more purple than gray but kept it because it was warm and I liked the style.</li>
    <li> Long delivery time, but as described</li>
    <li> Love the hat and the style. Would order it again for myself and a gift for family and for friends.</li>
    <li> Real pretty and nice and warm. Color is more Lavender than grey. It fits real comfortable, not tight at all.&lt;br /&gt;Does not squash hairdo.</li>
    <li> color is more purple than it looks</li>
    <li> I have dreadlocks and if you have dreads past your shoulders I would not reccomend this hat. Very small. Cute though and purple</li>
    <li> i thought the hat was going to be a dark grey color but when i got it, it was a purple kinda color. it doesnt look bad but i really thought it was going to be dark grey</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for myself, because I work in a cold environment.  But everyone at my work wanted one, so I ended up buying probably 25-30 of them in various colors.  We all love them, and they are cheap.  It&#x27;s the perfect &amp;#34;look.&amp;#34;  They shrink a little when you wash them, but the stitching has held up well.</li>
    <li> fits good i thought the color was gray but its dark purple</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more purple/blue than the picture, but I like the color better than the picture so it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s also very soft and comfortable.</li>
    <li> It was a warm hat, but the color was off. it seemed to have more of a tint of light purple and didnt really go well with gray things.</li>
    <li> great price great prtoduct</li>
    <li> Love..Love... Love.. the hat and I will put them on and still look great in my clothing on a bad hair day</li>
    <li> Arrived as more of a light purple color. Love how cheap this was. I wish it was a little slouchier, but honestly the cap is worth the really cheap investment. The only downside is that the cap took roughly a month and a half to ship so that it had basically missed most of winter by the time it arrived. The customer service however was excellent and they shipped me a new cap immediately after I informed them I was concerned the original was lost in the mail. Original eventually arrived - just two days before the replacement cap arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shows more of a slouchy hat, but in reality I found it to wear more like a beret. Or, if you pull it down over your head more, it&#x27;s like a really round knit beanie. However, I didn&#x27;t buy this for fashion, I bought it to keep my hair contained in the winter so it does the trick.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for the money.  It&#x27;s roomy and won&#x27;t mess the hairdo. It&#x27;s also warm and covers the ears.  Looks good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well received as a gift.</li>
    <li> Size and quality good but this hat is LAVENDER!!! Not a color I would ever seek out and buy. I kept it just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these they are so cute. They are a little big but still supper stylish but yea some of the colors aren&#x27;t what they look like in the picture. This one is closer to purple than grey.</li>
    <li> The hat arrived earlier than expected.  It is more purple than grey, but it still works for me.  The pattern is not as intricate as the photo, but it is still nice and it doesn&#x27;t appear like it might unravel.  It is moderately warm which works for me because I tend to not get very cold, despite living in a Northern clime.  The price is excellent and I might order again in another color.  I wear my long hair in a low bun and this covers it.  I give this 4 out of 5 stars; it loses two points for design and color discrepancies but gains a point for price. ~ M Clipner</li>
    <li> Whoa. WAY too small. Not at all what it looks like, being big, comfy and stretchy. Unless that manican they show is supposed to represent a bay head. I was reaaly looking forward to this hat and it&#x27;s totally bunk.</li>
    <li> The hat did not look like the picture.</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s a bit too big. Better when I let my hair down or use some clips.</li>
    <li> Great price. I like this hat.. Wish it was a little thicker. I would buy it again In another color.</li>
    <li> I love the hat...It is not bulky and just perfect for days that you need a little something on your ears...very fashionable as well..I would  love to by more colors...</li>
    <li> the color is not even grey, its light purple.</li>
    <li> It is a nice hat the color is as pictured. What you see is what you get. I give it two thumbs up!!</li>
    <li> Its kind of purple-ish instead of grey, and is way more baggy in real life than in the photo. Its still cute and I am sure I will still wear it, but just wish it looked like the one in the pic.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. And took forever to get to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good quality and really soft, but I ended up with a greyish purple instead of a dark grey. :(</li>
    <li> The yarn pills terribly.  I had little balls of yarn all over it within 2 wears.</li>
    <li> I LOVE DIFFERENT HATS. GOT THIS ONE TODAY. IT IS A BIT FLIMSY. CAN TELL WILL NOT KEEP MY HEAD VERY WARM. COLOR LOOKED GREY IN PICTURE BUT LOOKS BLUEISH GREY IN PERSON. BIT DISAPPOINTED,</li>
    <li> Patience is a virtue, It takes a while to receive this item but well worth it!  The hat does have a slight lavender cast to the gray color of the hat, but I&#x27;m loving it, it&#x27;s a shade of gray that is really growing on me!</li>
    <li> Was not the color I asked for. Quality is poor.</li>
    <li> My favorite hat. It keeps me warm during this frigid winter in New York.</li>
    <li> I love it!  so many compliments!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the reviews. It&#x27;s more purple then grey but I love it! Great, simple hat :)</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t the color that shows in the picture. It&#x27;s supposed to be grey but looks more like a purple.</li>
    <li> Fits Perfect. Color ended up being more lavender, but still cute.</li>
    <li> No packaging to protect each one. But cute snd soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice comfy and plush</li>
    <li> Wife really likes the hat fits perfectly and she&lt;br /&gt;has it on every day! OuO</li>
    <li> This hat was great on my trip to Alaska, very warm &amp; cozy. I have a small head, so it kept sliding back, but it still looked cute.</li>
    <li> Delivered much earlier than indicated. Which is awesome. The hat is a nice soft knit. Better than expected. Only down fall.I had to tie off the end threads myself. The thread was just wrapped several times around the knit yarn. Other than that, its a wonderful buy. My sister will love it for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I ended up getting this hat sooner than expected. It&#x27;s super cute and surprisingly warm. I got the gray color but I would say it&#x27;s more of a gray purple color.</li>
    <li> Came sooner than its estimated time. Fits perfect! Plus it looks exactly like what the picture shows.</li>
    <li> I really like this Beanie, fits good, but the color (like someone previously said) has kind of a purplish tent. Which I acually like better than just gray tho. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I just got this!!!  It looks really cute, and let me just say that I got it super early!!  It wasn&#x27;t scheduled to arrive untill 1 - 3 weeks later!!  I am very pleased because it is SO cheap and you get more than what you paid for. It&#x27;s not quite something I would usually wear but it looks good even on me. I DEFINITELY recommend this and will buy again!  Awesome as a gift, too!</li>
    <li> Looks more purple than grey when I received it</li>
    <li> Lays too flat; doesn&#x27;t fit as picture shows.</li>
    <li> It fits well and is super soft. The color is ok, doesn&#x27;t look gray as advertised, looks more like a tint of purple</li>
    <li> The hat itself is perfect! exactly as advertised, it&#x27;s just massive on me haha.&lt;br /&gt;Works better with long hair! Not for pixie cuts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item feb 5th and still havnt got it yet. a mth later. wanted it for winter but guess not</li>
    <li> Supposed to be gray, But it&#x27;s not! However, I like it!</li>
    <li> Good quality-I will buy again soon.</li>
    <li> As previously noted...was supposed to be gray and was lavender not happy - should have read the negative reviews....not even close to color pictured</li>
    <li> love the product, but the color is a little off. It isn&#x27;t truly gray, it&#x27;s more like a bluish gray. It&#x27;s ok, I still like the product.</li>
    <li> Supposed to be gray and was lavender not happy</li>
    <li> Sooooo ADORABLE! Have yet to give this to my sister as part of her Christmas gifts, but I know she&#x27;ll love this. THIS is a TRUE warm beanie hat!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it fit well and my sister enjoys here too but the color came in more blue than grey.</li>
    <li> Beautiful beautiful beautiful!!!! No words could explain how amazing these are. I bought this one, the beige one, and the red one! I am so in love. Highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, took a very long time to get to me, but I knew that from the time of ordering.  I get lots of compliments on it.  It&#x27;s warm, stylish, and great for days I don&#x27;t wanna fix my short hair ;)  I do think it&#x27;t a bit of a different color than the photo, it&#x27;s a bit lighter and has almost a purple hue to it.  I was expecting more of a charcoal... but I still like it.</li>
    <li> Awesome! Fast Delivery, Hat Just as Pictured and Described, Thank You!</li>
    <li> My sister loves her hat. She just recently decided to go natural and it allows her to wear her hair in nice styles in the cold without messing up her hair.</li>
    <li> love this knitted hat! It isn&#x27;t quite as big as the pic makes it look, but I liked it enough to order 4!</li>
    <li> I did not expect much for the price and it did take a long time to arrive but the quality is great, they are thick and soft but not too warm/wintery.  They are also really cute and slouchy.</li>
    <li> I orded this thinking it would be grey but when I got it, it turned out to be lavender! I was surprised but its super cute!! It&#x27;s so cute and extremely soft!! Some reviewers said it was thin but I think the thickness is just fine! Extremely satisfied!! :)</li>
    <li> However, it&#x27;s purple, not Grey.</li>
    <li> Such a nice hat...glad I found it. I don&#x27;t normally wear hats- but needed something and this is very nice! Only thing is the color is not as show- it&#x27;s a mauvey purple-but still a nice color. The price was AMAZING. Def. worth it...just wish they offered it in other colors- because I would buy them all.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS HAT...GOT A FEW OF THESE.</li>
    <li> Nice hat, it&#x27;s a little thin but it&#x27;s nice. I believe it&#x27;s more for fashion purpose though, doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s intended for. The price fits the hat.</li>
    <li> Durable, washable , stylish and warm! Id buy this any season! I have like 4 if these in different colors nd they are unbeqtable for the price</li>
    <li> I have never been able to wear a knit cap until I found this one. Just the right size and I loved the loose fit.</li>
    <li> I did not find this product to be as pictured which is really disappointing. Its not that slouchy.</li>
    <li> Really nice, well made and warm.</li>
    <li> I love these hats.&lt;br /&gt;They go nice and snug over my wig.&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy so many.</li>
