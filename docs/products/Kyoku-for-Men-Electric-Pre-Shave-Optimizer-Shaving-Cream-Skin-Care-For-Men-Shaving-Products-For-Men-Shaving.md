      <li>Good Stuff.  </li>
      <li>My husband loved their products and his skin</li>
      <li>No spilling and specially good for traveling.  </li>
      <li>The pre shave is a good product.  </li>

      <li>Even spray and good smelling.</li>
      <li>This arrived on time and when I used it with my electric razor was excellent in that it was smooth on face and did not clog electric razor cutters like oil based lubes do.</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>I love the packaging as I travel a lot and use an electric shaver so this size is great for a carry on.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and Am satisfied with it and will probably buy it again as well.</li>
      <li>Works well and great for travel -  compact and top locks.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with all of the Kyoku products I have purchased.</li>
      <li>Kyoku is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The Kyoku pre-shave works to give me an amazing close shave.</li>
      <li>Really nice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
      <li>It is convenient that it sprays and it does a nice job of preparing your skin for shaving.  </li>
      <li>Did not like, does not feel good on skin, did not make shaving better....</li>
      <li>I am very satisfied with it and when it runs out I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>I know there are many, but among all that I have tried, and I have tried several, this sets the beard up for shaving the best, is excellent in providing lubrication and protection of the skin, and is the most easy to apply--just spray it on.  </li>
      <li>easy to apply, odor good, and seemed to smoothen shave</li>
      <li>This is by far the best electric pre-shave I have ever tried - and that is a lot!</li>
      <li>The best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
      <li>if it keeps my face happy, then it is worth it.</li>
      <li>To be honest, the Face Saver product works better although it is a powder and messier</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s a pretty great result.</li>
      <li>It prepares your face pre-schave with no odor, and it makes shaving very comfortable.</li>
      <li>This product is ok.</li>
      <li>just make sure you continue to use the product for a couple weeks</li>
      <li>Still, I will probably buy another bottle when this one runs out, because I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>I bought this on a whim, mostly because of the reviews, although as we all know, reviews can be gamed;  when I read about the &amp;#34;pre shave optimizer... with beard lifting particles&amp;#34; I chuckled and thought &amp;#34;yeah, right!&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>The LAB SERIES  is so much better</li>
      <li>but I won&#x27;t be buying any more if I use it up.</li>
      <li>I am in constant search for the perfect pre-electric shave lotion.  </li>
      <li>Supposed to be a product to give you a better shave.....</li>
      <li>I use a top end Norelco rotary, but this review should be applicable to just about any shaver.  </li>
      <li>it works, my elctric shaver works better and the scent is not overpowering.</li>
      <li>It has a very very light oil to it that spreads easily over your face</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t think it would work for me but did a great job on my real sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It lubricates and enables the shaver to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; more easily, without tugs or pulls or burns.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Kyoku has improved the performance of each of these razors by a good 30-40% I would give Lab Series a 50% improvement - but both help you get a much closer and more comfortable shave.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very nice, smooth shave that I can&#x27;t normally get with elec razor.  </li>
      <li>It is the perfect pre-shave for me; it is affordable; convenient (it packs well in a toiletry kit and does not leak unlike other brands that are bottled in glass containers).  </li>
      <li>Cool!</li>
      <li>Very very mild.</li>
      <li>It applies easily and is non-stinging.  </li>
      <li>This product helps the shaver to slide easily over the skin to make a closer, gentler shave.</li>
      <li>The shave with the product is fine.</li>
      <li>The instructions said around 2-3 pumps should be fine</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking to get a closer more comfortable shave from your electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Light fragrance  takes about 4sprays to do the trick.  </li>
      <li>Smooth.</li>
      <li>Pricey, but really works nicely vs Williams Electric Shave...</li>
      <li>An effective and convenient pre electric shave preparation that really makes a difference.</li>
      <li>I recently bought the lab series electric shave and have been really really happy with it.  </li>
      <li>Shaving with my Norelco 3D is smooth and close  as ice.  </li>
      <li>and I enjoy is in it.</li>
      <li>After shaving, my face appears just as smooth as when I used Lectric Shave.</li>
      <li>a few days of using this, I can already say this is the BEST shaving purchase I have ever made.</li>
      <li>I enjoy using during my shaves.</li>
      <li>It allows me to get a closer shave and makes my skin feel totally comfortable during and after.</li>
      <li>The Kyoku is very similar to the Anthony Logistics electric pre-shave, but does not have the peppermint scent as it is slighly citric, and comes in a very nice pre-measured pump spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>I get no irritation after my shave, and the chronic parts of my face that are irritated are significantly reducing.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>The irritation I get from my electric shaver is SIGNIFICANTLY diminished.</li>
      <li>I never knew how much to use&lt;br /&gt;There are better products available as pre-</li>
      <li>It prepares your skin and face for a clean shave.  </li>
      <li>Clean.</li>
      <li>, it is the go to product for a close clean shave.</li>
      <li>So far the Norelco head is nice and clean, with no matted or oiled \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; to clean out.    </li>
      <li>This is really cool.</li>
      <li>My shave is MUCH closer than without this magic stuff.</li>
      <li>Helps to make for a much smoother shave, and better results afterward.  </li>
      <li>so it evaporates quickly.</li>
      <li>While the idea seemed good, it takes more than a few pumps to cover my face before shaving.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I should spray more on my hand (thus wasting it more) or it simply does not work.  </li>
      <li>Some people think that you can either have quick shave (electric shaving) or a smooth/close shave with no irritation/ingrown hairs/bumps (wet-shaving with a safety razor), and you can never have both.</li>
      <li>A quick observation..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When it comes to shaving, I am a pretty utilitarian guy. I want something quick before I rush out in the mornings, but I also want a shave that actually lasts the entire day and does not cause irritation. Some people think that you can either have quick shave (electric shaving) or a smooth/close shave with no irritation/ingrown hairs/bumps (wet-shaving with a safety razor), and you can never have both. Frustrated with irritation from electric shaving a few years ago, I went to wet-shaving for a few years, which felt like a lot of fun, but even after I got good at it, I still got irritation and ingrown hairs. Thus, I went back to electric shaving recently, as I figure the minimal gains in preventing irritation from wet-shaving in my personal experience was not worth the extra time spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 770cc Pulsonic Shaver the last year or so, and I&#x27;ve grown tired of how the shave does not last, and how I was getting chronic irritation/ingrown hairs/bumps in certain areas. I tried a bunch of stuff to try to troubleshoot this issue for me, such as alternating wet-shaving and electric-shaving every few days and all that, to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I bought the Kyoku Pre-Shave Optimizer. I was actually REALLY wary of this product because I tried the Lab Series Electric Pre-Shave stuff and Lectric Shave Pre-Shave stuff to no avail. But no matter how skeptical I was, I just could not ignore all the glowing Amazon reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few days of using this, I can already say this is the BEST shaving purchase I have ever made. Why?&lt;br /&gt;- My shave lasts for the 16 hours a day I need it to. My shave is MUCH closer than without this magic stuff. In fact, I would say it is almost as close as my wet-shave. This significantly improved the way my facial hair felt towards the end of my day (ie it was much shorter).&lt;br /&gt;- The irritation I get from my electric shaver is SIGNIFICANTLY diminished. I get no irritation after my shave, and the chronic parts of my face that are irritated are significantly reducing.&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike other Pre-Shave products, I do not hate the smell, and I do not have as much trouble washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with a Shisheido pre-shave lotion that got glowing reviews on Amazon, so after a few more weeks of using this, I will try the Shisheido pre-shave lotion to compare--will report back here when I do so. That being said, Kyoku set a pretty high bar...</li>
    <li> Expensive and useless, smells nice though.</li>
    <li> I tried this after a much cheaper product proved quite effective, but left an unpleasant solvent smell on my face; I was smelling it all day. I find this Kyoku product just as effective, and the fragrance is minimal and inoffensive. Since it comes in a spray bottle, you use less, so it will last longer. That&#x27;s a good thing, because this bottle holds only 50 cc (less than 2 fluid ounces) of the product. Still, I will probably buy another bottle when this one runs out, because I&#x27;m quite satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> I formerly used Aqua Fresh which is no longer available.  I have been casting about, committed to exploring every option available and have tried several different electric pre-shave products.  While this one is a little more expensive, it is the best I have found.  Does the job well of preparing the beard for shaving and I have come especially to like the way it applies.  No strong odor.  Non-greasy.</li>
    <li> To be honest, the Face Saver product works better although it is a powder and messier, it is the go to product for a close clean shave. This one doesn&#x27;t make the skin surrounding the whiskers dry nor upright for a close shave.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband And he loves it! No more in growns</li>
    <li> I am in constant search for the perfect pre-electric shave lotion.  This has been working very well for me so far.  I have very thick facial hair and this really takes away some of the sensitivity involved in shaving.  A little pricey for the amount, but if it keeps my face happy, then it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a replacement for Anthony&#x27;s Electric Shaving Liquid, which has been discontinued.  I tried this product because I trusted the brand.  What a disappointment!  I feel it is over priced to begin with.  The direction asks you to spray the content on your hand, and then apply it.  What a stupid method!  You lose half of what you spray---it either splashes or evaporates.  Then you are supposed to feel &amp;#34;soothing tingle&amp;#34; from the content...Well, I don&#x27;t feel it much.  Maybe I should spray more on my hand (thus wasting it more) or it simply does not work.  Either way, I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It preps my beard really well without the alcohol used in some other pre-shaves for electric razors.</li>
    <li> Supposed to be a product to give you a better shave.....NOT.....you may as well splash water on your face. Does not work!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon will not accept return of this product either due to dangerous contents or gasses?????????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Features:&lt;br /&gt;Prevents redness and irritation - No difference with or without......&lt;br /&gt;Provides slick glide and cushioning - HaHaHa!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Prevents loss of moisture - I can&#x27;t tell any difference.....</li>
    <li> Works well and great for travel -  compact and top locks.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric pre-shave I have ever tried - and that is a lot! Highly recommended! No fuss, not greasy, last a long time, and doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor at all. Feels great, works brilliantly!</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different oils and lotions to improve my electric shave experience.  I use a top end Norelco rotary, but this review should be applicable to just about any shaver.  What I want from an electric pre-shave is:  1. It lubricates and enables the shaver to \\&quot;glide\\&quot; more easily, without tugs or pulls or burns.  2. \\&quot;Sets up\\&quot; the hair for closer shaves with fewer strokes over the same area (quicker shaves as well).  3. A resonable or non-offensive scent (I&#x27;ll be using an after shave or cologne of my choice anyway).  4. Does not Gum up the moving parts or cause the shaver to run \\&quot;hot\\&quot;.  5. Easy and economical use - a small amount needed rather than splashing quick evaporating high alchohol solutions.    The Kyoku product meets all these criteria.  Unlike heavier oils (really for blade shaving) it does not cause increased resistance to the shave head so the shaver does not run harder or heat up due to increased friction. Gliding the electric shaver over your skin takes significantly less effort.  Lowering friction is also found with high-alchohol pre-shaves, but they tend to have heavier smells and not improve the closeness of the shave - still need many passes on the same area.      The Kyoku is very similar to the Anthony Logistics electric pre-shave, but does not have the peppermint scent as it is slighly citric, and comes in a very nice pre-measured pump spray bottle.  No spilling and specially good for traveling.  So far the Norelco head is nice and clean, with no matted or oiled \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; to clean out.    The Derm store shipped it right away but their no-charge shipping took about a week from the west coast to the east coast.  I highly recommend it, specially over many of the heavy oil based products.</li>
    <li> Not a good fit for me. I love the package design for Kyoku, but the product fell short for me. The aerosol pump delivers a tiny puff of moisture, that is so filled with alcohol that there is little lubrication build up. I spray it in my hands , and it takes at least 6 sprays to get anything built up enough to rub on to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that I shave my whole head , it would just take me so long to apply the pre shave mist, it would just double my shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product is also heavily drenched in alcohol. I have since tried  Aramis Lab Series pre-shave and have been much happier with it.</li>
    <li> Have since gone back to Williams Lectric Shave, but Kyoku is fine even if more expensive. Amazon&#x27;s delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> Very nice, but the volume is small, which makes this product a little bit expensive. Maybe they could increase the liquids shipped in this rather small bottle?</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard. Shaving with my Norelco 3D is smooth and close  as ice.  Only need 4 sprays!</li>
    <li> This is my first preshave product.  Prior to this product I was on the verge of returning my new Braun 550-cc .I  AM NEW TO Elecric shaving and was having horrible issues with ingrown hairs and razor burn.  I have sensitive skin and have always used clinique products.  Light fragrance  takes about 4sprays to do the trick.  You don&#x27;t need to sop this stuff on.  It has a very very light oil to it that spreads easily over your face you don&#x27;t even notice its there till you splash some water on your face and feel the oil residue.  Doesn&#x27;t stick to the Shaver and gum it up.  This product is awesome gives a close shave and allows Shaver to easily glide over your face.</li>
    <li> easy to apply, odor good, and seemed to smoothen shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have not used entire bottle yet, so not sure if good value for the money</li>
    <li> I really prefer to shave using an electric razor although a blade shave has always given a much closer shave. I have tried top models from all the big manufactures and while they do quite well still not as close as a blade. That was until now. The Kyoku pre-shave works to give me an amazing close shave. At least as close as a blade without all the mess. Very pleased with all of the Kyoku products I have purchased.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim, mostly because of the reviews, although as we all know, reviews can be gamed;  when I read about the &amp;#34;pre shave optimizer... with beard lifting particles&amp;#34; I chuckled and thought &amp;#34;yeah, right!&amp;#34;. Followed the simple instructions, let the product set on my face a few seconds, shaved... And it was the closest shave I have ever achieved with a Philips Norelco RQ12 head on a 1050x body. The razor seems to glide over your face, it has to be experienced to be believed. Cool!</li>
    <li> I use it ever day. It makes for a good shave.</li>
    <li> So far it is just okay. But as I get to use it over a longer time I think I will like it a little bit more.</li>
    <li> I usually use a [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] with [[ASIN:B000NCMMBA Merkur Combo Pack of 30 Razor Blades]] and an electric as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in conjunction with [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] I got a shave pretty much equal to what I get with my double edge safety razor! And considering I didn&#x27;t have to spend the time mixing up my shaving cream, that&#x27;s a pretty great result.</li>
    <li> Did not like, does not feel good on skin, did not make shaving better....This is the only item I have purchased from Am on I die not like.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric razor for years and have sensitive skin.  I would struggle to get that last bit of stubble from my beard.  Since I started using this Kyoku pre-shave, my shaving time has been cut in half.  It applies easily and is non-stinging.  It leaves my face feeling soft and subtle.  It is the perfect pre-shave for me; it is affordable; convenient (it packs well in a toiletry kit and does not leak unlike other brands that are bottled in glass containers).  I am sold on it and have already re-ordered twice.  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I have been using Williams Lectric Shave for as long as I have been shaving. Recently I noticed how it stains fabric and melts plastic, and I never cared for the smell. I decided to try something else so I ordered 1 bottle of this Kyoku. I just finished shaving with it for the first time. There is no offensive smell.  I need to get used to how much to spray since with Lectric Shave I had to apply it liberally. After shaving, my face appears just as smooth as when I used Lectric Shave. Comfort wise, Lectric Shave is a little smoother while I&#x27;m shaving, but I didn&#x27;t notice any irritation after using the Kyoku. When this bottle is empty I plan to also try Aramis Lab pre-shave.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think such a thing existed.  But it works! just make sure you continue to use the product for a couple weeks so your skin can adjust too it and I swear you will get a closer cleaner shave</li>
    <li> Pricey, but really works nicely vs Williams Electric Shave...No pinching and less irritation. I highly encourage heavy bearded electric shaver users to try this</li>
    <li> Kyoku does exactly what it advertises to do. It prepares your face pre-schave with no odor, and it makes shaving very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I have used this for just over a couple of weeks, and I have to admit, shaving with my electric razor has never been smoother then when I use this. I highly recommend giving it a try for a smooth close electric shave.</li>
    <li> I was getting a lot of shaver burn with the new razor and now that I am using the Kyoku Pre-Shave all is well.  This has a little oily feel to it but it disappears after shaving.  I think it is absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.  There use to be a number of U.S. products like this but they seem to have disappeared.</li>
    <li> Very excellent pre shave product.  It prepares your skin and face for a clean shave.  Highly recommend for preparation of your face.</li>
    <li> It definitely gives a closer shave, and the smell is very light. I&#x27;m hoping to get 4 months out of one bottle with daily use, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: one bottle lasted me 6 months!</li>
    <li> Title pretty much sums it up. I think it might help a little but I won&#x27;t be buying any more if I use it up.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the best pre-shave I have used.</li>
    <li> YOu are supposed to spray this very light, alcoholic in nature product on your palm, then apply it to your face.  Well that is kind of funny, because you should be spraying your face directly with the product, however you can not do that since you may spray your eyes with it, which is proven to be very painful.  Also the quantity to the price I paid for it did not meet the expectation at all.  Very disappointed, and will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> An effective and convenient pre electric shave preparation that really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This is easy to apply, and it lubricates the surface of my skin so my Norelco razor moves with less friction and abrasion on my face. It is the only electric pre shave I have found that does not have a strong perfume smell that I find objectionable.</li>
    <li> Difficult to use. I would not purchase again. I never knew how much to use&lt;br /&gt;There are better products available as pre- electric shaves. The LAB SERIES  is so much better and it&#x27;s unscented&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for years. Non-irritating and a good razor lubricant also while you shave</li>
    <li> The pre shave is a good product.  It is convenient that it sprays and it does a nice job of preparing your skin for shaving.  It also seems to work like a moisturizer.  The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is that it is alcohol based and i try to avoid alcohol products on my skin, even though the moisturizer probably offsets the alcohol.  Also the cost is a little high for the quantity, wondering how long it will last.  I have been using it for over a month so far.</li>
    <li> Very nice, smooth shave that I can&#x27;t normally get with elec razor.  No irritation so far, and I have sensitive skin.  Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;m in love with this product.  I use a Panasonic Arc 5 electric shaver, and it requires extra effort to fully shave my neck, often to the point of irritation.  This stuff really streamlines the process.  It allows me to get a closer shave and makes my skin feel totally comfortable during and after.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kyoku for several years. It&#x27;s a high quality product with quality ingredients that performs as advertised at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I found Kyoku for Men was too thin to spread easily, and once I did spread it, it did not improve my shave very much. I tried another similar lotion with alcohol that I also did not like (Necessary Luxuries) and then found a pre-shave product I did like: Derma-Bloc powder stick, made of talc and paraffin. I plan to keep using the Derma-Bloc.</li>
    <li> This product helps the shaver to slide easily over the skin to make a closer, gentler shave. I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well, I like it much better than the cheap varieties you can buy in a typical store because its fragrance is very light and inoffensive.</li>
    <li> While the idea seemed good, it takes more than a few pumps to cover my face before shaving.  Overall, I just did not like the product performance.</li>
    <li> While this product does what is intended and has only a faint scent (which is a plus), the major ingredients are basically what is in Williams Lectric Shave. I&#x27;ve found the Williams Lectric Shave to do a little better job in lubricating the face for shaving.</li>
    <li> After washing your face with warm/hot water and whatever cleansing product you prefer, towel dry and then apply a few pumps of this to your hands. The instructions said around 2-3 pumps should be fine but I found myself using around 8 pumps each shave to really lubricate my face properly. Wait about 5 minutes for your face to absorb most of it and then shave as you normally would. It has a fantastic clean orange smell to it which I really like. Product lasted me about a good 3 months, I will be ordering it again soon.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I enjoy using during my shaves.</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t care much for the smell, it seems to work well enough.</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I love the packaging as I travel a lot and use an electric shaver so this size is great for a carry on. The shave with the product is fine. I prefer Shiseido UNO Pre Shave but the product packaging is a little large when you are tight on space. I end up just spraying the product into my palm and then putting it on my face. No real issues there are probably better products available for the money.</li>
    <li> One tip right off the bat is to read the instructions...I didn&#x27;t so I missed the part about spraying the pre shave 3-4 times into your hands. It has a lot of alcohol in it so it evaporates quickly. My first time, I only sprayed once and it evaporated before I could rub it on my face.  Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with it...I just got it so I&#x27;ll give a long term update later.  UPDATE I still like this pre shave...it works, my elctric shaver works better and the scent is not overpowering. What keeps me from giving it 5 stars is price. The small amount you do get lasts a fairly long time. A quick observation..in Winter this pre shave gets COLD...of course as alcohol evaporates it cools my skin. Almost too cold....I guess I&#x27;ll have to turn up the heat in my bathroom...lol.  UPDATE2: I ran out of my first bottle of this Pre Shave. As much as I like it, the price is a big consideration for me. I&#x27;ll shop around and try another Pre Shave optimizer. If I can&#x27;t find one that works just as well with a cheaper price then I&#x27;ll probably come back to Kyoku.</li>
    <li> I liked this product made shaving easier! Even spray and good smelling. I had some liquid from another brand left over and filled this bottle with it and it is still great!  So just gives even spray!</li>
    <li> Get the job done, but it contains alcohol. As a dermatologist, I try to recommend patients stay away from products containing alcohol - it can be very drying.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Sensitive skin?  Try this.  Didn&#x27;t think it would work for me but did a great job on my real sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to really help me have a close shave. It&#x27;s hard to use in the spray form. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a shave enhanced for some time.  I tried the Williams electric shave and was disappointed not with the performance of the product but the smell was just terrible. Hasn&#x27;t changed since my father used it in the 70s and 80s. It stunk then and still does. I recently bought the lab series electric shave and have been really really happy with it.  And then I found this one. The kyoku electric pre shave is awesome. The best I&#x27;ve used so far.  I will compare it to the lab series in this review. I have reviewed the lab series pre shave and it still stands. I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison. The smell of the two products goes to kyoku.  It&#x27;s pleasant and not at all over bearing and the lab series has almost no smell at all. Which is great too, but having a bit of a scent is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;The closeness of the shave. Both perform well here. Equals really.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a real plus for the kyoku. The spray pump bottle.  This is really cool. You spray minimal amounts in your hands and then apply to yourself.  This really cuts down on product that ends up evaporating or goin down the drain. I like that feature a great deal. This actually makes the cost of this product well worth it. As you save product loss.&lt;br /&gt;Both products leave your face feeling soft and moisturized. Both products perk up the whiskers.  But ultimately I like how the kyoku does make my face feel after I shave. Dry shaving leaves it dry and not a close have at all. Lab series feels great and I enjoy is in it. It&#x27;s a great product and Am satisfied with it and will probably buy it again as well. As I Like to switch things up.  But the kyoku will be my go to pre shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cost. Which goes to kyoku as well. It&#x27;s significantly less expensive than the lab series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product. I am very satisfied with it and when it runs out I will be buying more. Absolutely recommend this for anyone that loves their electric razor but hate shaving dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed this product before.  I think it is one of the best pre-electric-shave products on the market.  I know there are many, but among all that I have tried, and I have tried several, this sets the beard up for shaving the best, is excellent in providing lubrication and protection of the skin, and is the most easy to apply--just spray it on.  I don&#x27;t shave daily any more, but in daily use, one tube should last a month and the price seems to me to be very reasonable.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff.  Helps to make for a much smoother shave, and better results afterward.  This is my second bottle, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Kyoku is amazing.  My husband loved their products and his skin always felt smoother.  Worth the price you pay.</li>
    <li> Good product. No &amp;#34;cloying&amp;#34; aroma.</li>
    <li> perfect for an electric shave that gives an even closer and smoother feel than with a razor. it&#x27;s really unbelievable!</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and when I used it with my electric razor was excellent in that it was smooth on face and did not clog electric razor cutters like oil based lubes do.</li>
    <li> I believe the directions suggest using four pumps per shave, but I don&#x27;t think that is enough.  I generally wind up using about ten per shave.  It works well though.  Better than any other I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Really nice. Smooth. Clean. Very very mild.</li>
    <li> When it comes to shaving I have to admit I&#x27;m a bit of a compulsive and perhaps fall into the category of fanatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A long time wet shaver, I love using a straight razor (cut throat) blade and have collected them for decades. However, it&#x27;s terribly time consuming so over the years I&#x27;ve relied on electrics for both face and head shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as the effectiveness of electric razors vary from person to person - it&#x27;s the same with the pre-shaves. Chances are, if it&#x27;s out there I&#x27;ve tried it. With few exceptions. Most have had minimal to poor results with the exception of Lab Series and Kyoku.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Raises even the tiniest hairs and whiskers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Provides a close to Optimum  shaving surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Spray applicator is a much needed design and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Lab Series which sells on Amazon for around $12 for 3.4 oz The Kyoko at $12 for 1.7 Ounces is a much more expensive product to use. It&#x27;s saving grace is the applicator - you can greatly avoid waste from spillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day it&#x27;s apples to apples or whiskers to whiskers as both products have worked extremely well for me. I use a Braun 790cc, Norelco Sensotouch 3D, and a new Panasonic 5 blade es - LV61&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyoku has improved the performance of each of these razors by a good 30-40% I would give Lab Series a 50% improvement - but both help you get a much closer and more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyoku does what it promises, at least for me - but again, results vary due to so many issues from hair density, growth pattern, beard thickness, skin condition and so on. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking to get a closer more comfortable shave from your electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
    <li> best pre shave for electric i&#x27;ve found yet no overwhelming perfume smell, really makes the skin dry for good shave</li>
