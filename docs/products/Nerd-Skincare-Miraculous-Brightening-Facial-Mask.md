      <li>I Love these facial masks.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are exactly as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow, I really enjoy using Miraculous Brightening Mask</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really find that it reduced fine lines though - so far</li>
      <li>My face felt so good after using this product and my skin looked TERRIFIC the next day.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, and left my skin feeling hydrated and supple.</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>A very luxurious lotion.  </li>
      <li>I used this after I had a stressful week and was ready to take time to myself.</li>
      <li>I really like this mask.</li>
      <li>and I had a reaction, to use it when I absolutely had nothing going on</li>
      <li>A little messy to remove, but who cares, I love the amazing results.</li>
      <li>I pulled my hair back,  took my time to peeled off the mask and put it on, felt cool and relaxing, after an hour</li>
      <li>really I did smooth the mask back onto my face several times, but as i said i was able to continue my routine with minimal moving of the mask itself.  </li>
      <li>so I could breath and so that I had adequate facial covering.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t justify using them very often due to price for a one time use product, but for a splurge now and then, yes you do need to try one of these, my skin felt fabulous</li>
      <li>only the &#x27;at home chemical peels&#x27; that I use really deliver strongly on that promise, though some various serums and creams do help.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This mask defiantly surprised me I didn’t think I would like it this much, but I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I can see myself in a product from use, and with facts that a potential customer might find useful.</li>

      <li>My hands and face felt really soft and my face looked refreshed.</li>
      <li>The mask comes sandwiched between 2 netted scraps and the whole deal is soaking in facial cream so it is a bit slippery</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received the mask quickly! The instructions were easy to understand and conveniently printed on the pouch. There is so much moisture in each pouch! The mask is one size fits all. Move it around to get each section fitted to your face shape. It smells great and is packed with moisture! After 30 minutes I took it off and rubbed the remaining moisture into my skin. It looks great and feels great!!</li>
    <li> Yes!! Finally a product that does what its suppose to do!!</li>
    <li> Loved the mask. Left my skin feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. I don&#x27;t do spa&#x27;s, mani&#x27;s and pedi&#x27;s, I prefer to do my own thing at home, much more relaxing to me. I couldn&#x27;t tell the ingredients before I received this so I was taking a chance, but it was all good. The ingredients are exactly as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, 1,3-Propanediol, 1,2-Pentylene Glycol, Macadamia Nut Seed oil, Squalane, Behenyl Alcohol, Shea Butter, ( Butyrospernum Parkii)Fruit, Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 and Glycerin, Ceramide 3, L-Arginie, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E, Allatoin, Xanthan Gum, Dipotassium Glycyrrhznate, (Licorice Root Extract), Cholesteryl Hydroxysterate, Glycosphingolipids and Phospholipids and Cholesterol (Lecithin), Ferulic Acid Ester and Cycloartenol and 24-Methyl Cycloartenol Phytosterol and beta-Sitosterol (Rice barn Oil Extract(&amp;#60; Algae Extract and Pullulan and Water and Phenoxyethanol and Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Sorbate (Nannochloropsis Oculata Extract) I know things not spelled right in there, but hey I tried. Anyway you can see all ingredients and their are some really good ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on a girly night, had a hot tub soak, came out, threw this on for probably 45 minutes and just relaxed. Removed the mask, rubbed the last of what was left on skin on and it absorbed really well. It took a few minutes, maybe 5 or so for it to all absorb in, but it is a treatment you don&#x27;t do that often also. I didn&#x27;t want to waste anything left on the mask since it is a one time use product so I wiped it all over neck, chest, and anywhere I hit before I threw the mask away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left my skin very very moisturized, smooth, very light refreshing smell is all, nothing strong. No irritation just soothing relaxation. It did seem to tighten and firm a bit and just made skin glow. I couldn&#x27;t justify using them very often due to price for a one time use product, but for a splurge now and then, yes you do need to try one of these, my skin felt fabulous afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions.

    <li> Would actually prefer to buy individual one use packets that you use with a reusable mask. Was just to messy</li>
    <li> love it made my face feel refreshed and soft. arrived on time undamaged</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing.  My skin feels so smooth and I have received numerous compliments about how clear my complexion looks after using this mask!</li>
    <li> Only contained the netting, no mask</li>
    <li> tried to use promotional code ...would not work! Won&#x27;t buy if your promotions aren&#x27;t valid.</li>
    <li> I made sure I read the reviews before I tried it,  so, I found time in my busy life, got my TV show ready,  I pulled my hair back,  took my time to peeled off the mask and put it on, felt cool and relaxing, after an hour I took it off (I didn&#x27;t want to) and yes it works!  my face looks radiant, glowing  and I look refresh I did not wear makeup for the following 3 days.</li>
    <li> I saw an advertisement on Facebook to get sample of this mask for $1 so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I love good face masks and buy singles all the time, hoping to one day find one that&#x27;s perfect.  This one does deliver on it&#x27;s promise to brighten my skin and tighten pores- I could tell a noticeable difference in my face when I took it off- my face seemed lighter in color, and brighter, and my pores were about as tight as they ever get.  I didn&#x27;t really find that it reduced fine lines though - so far only the &#x27;at home chemical peels&#x27; that I use really deliver strongly on that promise, though some various serums and creams do help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a net, and it&#x27;s loaded with a white cream.  The mask itself feels like alginate material, and has precut eyes, nose, and lips.  The nose was too long for me, so the upper lip portion just was all out of whack.  It took a while for me to adjust it so I could breath and so that I had adequate facial covering.  It&#x27;s to be worn 30 minutes optimally.  It is very hydrating, and it rinses easily when time is up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it.  I would not pay $20 each for one, but my budget is tight; others might not take issue with that.</li>
    <li> I am so excited for this review because this mask is AMAZING!! I have worked in the skincare field for 9 years as a licensed esthetician and laser technician so I have used hundreds of facial mask and skin brightening products. This mask defiantly surprised me I didn’t think I would like it this much, but I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying the mask is easy you just look really silly or “scary” as my daughter says lol, but all you have to do is open it peel off the front and back paper and place mask on the skin (I would recommend doing this in the mirror). Once you place it on the skin it feels nice and moistening and I love that it stays that way the whole time it is on. I hate when mask harden and crack because it makes your skin feel itchy, but this mask stays nice and moist the whole time. I kept it on for 30 min. and honestly I probably would of keep in on longer if I didn’t have to go to the store. After removing the mask my skin felt so refreshed, it was so smooth, hydrated, and had a nice glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this mask, it has exceeded all my expectations and the best part is Nerd Skincare products are made of organically farmed, cruelty-free, fair-trade, and natural ingredients, which is always a plus!  I know I will be purchasing more ASAP and maybe adding this mask to one of our facial treatments at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sharing some photos so you can see how it looks (please don’t judge my photo taking skills lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own</li>
    <li> Since this is a single use mask, I guess I expected a more dramatic result.  Felt fine on but directions said not to rinse off, but too much residual product not to do so. I have a even skin tone with a oily skin type so to be objective this product may not be for me. Great customer service from seller by giving elaborate insctructions on how to use. Might give this one another go.</li>
    <li> for the $1 trial it was worth the money. i found it to be very messy, and did not care for the way it was packeged. it reall doesnt show you front or back. i read the instructions and left it on for 45 minutes and rubbed in the extra moistureizer. i did not feel that my skin was more hydrated than when i use my daily moistureizer :( i really did want to love this product and take no joy in writing a review that is not positive. for $1-5 i think it is worth the price. For $20 i would have been upset with the mess and results.</li>
    <li> After wearing the mask, it accentuated my wrinkles for a little while. Also this thick film it left on my face after I took it off was disgusting. I could not wait to wash my face because of it! Would never wear again.</li>
    <li> Wow, I really enjoy using Miraculous Brightening Mask</li>
    <li> Love the feel of my skin!  The instructions are simple.  A little messy to remove, but who cares, I love the amazing results.</li>
    <li> Excellent mask!  Would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Being that I don&#x27;t sleep well at night, I was looking for a product to help bring back some color to my drab skintone. I used this mask once as I use masks all the time and I have to say this is the best one so far!  It helped brighten my complexion and felt refreshing!  I will buy again!</li>
    <li> Loved this mask.  Easy to use, and left my skin feeling hydrated and supple.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use when you feel the need for a &amp;#34;Spa Day&amp;#34;. I used this after I had a stressful week and was ready to take time to myself. Some of the great qualities of this product are:&lt;br /&gt;~Tightens pores using cutting edge science combined with patented biomedical engineering&lt;br /&gt;~Promotes collagen and elastin synthesis, naturally stimulate and modulate cell behavior&lt;br /&gt;~Contains potent antioxidants protecting skin cell from free radicals&lt;br /&gt;~Softens the of fine lines rough texture&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and when you take the time to really relax when using it is a total mind and body experience. I took a detox bath with dead sea salt scrub and used this mask while relaxing in the tub. Absolutely fabulous!!  My skin had a very nice glow and super soft after using. Part of a totally relaxing and rejuvenating experience. I recieved this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> Amazing.  Worth every penny.  My face felt so good after using this product and my skin looked TERRIFIC the next day.  Despite the price, I will keep using this product at least once a month (I can&#x27;t afford 2x month).  And no, I wasn&#x27;t paid for this review.</li>
    <li> I Love these facial masks. I have reordered them.</li>
    <li> I LOVED THE WAY IT MADE MY FACE FEEL,  WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN SOME TIME..</li>
    <li> This mask was easy to apply. I did so after taking a shower and continued to get dressed with no issues with the mask really I did smooth the mask back onto my face several times, but as i said i was able to continue my routine with minimal moving of the mask itself.  I rubbed the extra serum into my neck area, When I did remove the mask My face felt very moist and clean skin was bright and the splotchy redness seemed calmed down.  It left my skin feeling soft and moist.</li>
    <li> I got my Nerd Skin Miraculous Brightening Facial Mask and I held on to it for a couple of days before trying it out....I was torn between using it just before my photo shoot so that I could look rested and refreshed or just in case it didn&#x27;t work with my skin and I had a reaction, to use it when I absolutely had nothing going on and I could sit at home and doctor my face back to normal. I chose the latter. I steamed my face, splashed cool water and towel dried it. I used my cleansing oil and a facial scrub and then I sprayed my witch hazel toner and let that dry. I put the mask on and chilled for bout 30 minutes! I massaged the product left on my face into my skin and also my hands after removing the mask. My hands and face felt really soft and my face looked refreshed. I am really pleased! It works. I will also review the mask on my YouTube channel called Faye&#x27;s Health and Beauty Channel</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot.  It did soften my face and felt moisturized and even looked better.  I recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> Received my mask yesterday in the mail, very excited to try it.  Very messy to get open and unwrap.  Did keep it on for an hour, didn&#x27;t not much difference between this mask any something I would buy at the beauty supply store.  Good price for the introductory offer but wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this item.</li>
    <li> It worked great!! My skin has actually felt better for weeks after using this mask!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is an excellent mask.  My skin looks so radiant after using it.  I did it yesterday and it still looks great today. It reduced my pore size and made my skin tone more even. After reading how these masks are grown and not made,wow,  very impressive. I feel very fortunate to have had the privilege to try it.  I received this at a discount for an honest review and I really love it.  Thank you Nerd Skincare for an awesome facial mask.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, do not think I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I loved the way this mask left my face feeling! After reading the reviews I was afraid it was going to be a big mess putting it on but it wasn&#x27;t difficult for me at all. A little messy, yes, but it was quicker and cleaner to put on than when I make my own masks with bentonite or other powders. The mask comes sandwiched between 2 netted scraps and the whole deal is soaking in facial cream so it is a bit slippery but ai had it applied within a minute and with no mess to my bathroom. There are precut eye, nose, and mouth slits and you can stretch them gently to for your face shape better. I wore mine for the recommended 30 minutes and almost rinsed off the bean that was left because it Was much but I remembered that the directions suggested messaging it into your face and neck. It dried much quicker than I expected after rubbing in and didn&#x27;t leave my face greasy after about 15 min. The cream is designed not to clog pores and 2 days later I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts from using it. It did help tighten my pores and my face has a nice glow since using it. I haven&#x27;t even felt I needed to wear any foundation or concealer because the texture and color is so nice. I would use this mask again. I received mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using</li>
    <li> I received a gracious discount on this skincare product which worked great for my sensitive skin, I had no irrations, redness or adverse actions after applying face mask cloth to my skin , I cleansed my face before using and applied before bedtime, the cloth is strong, nonabrasive, well-infused which left my skin feeling refreshed and renewed! I look forward to purchasing this gem in the future!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> A very luxurious lotion.  A lot easier to use than others I have used.  This one has a netting on both sides so once you remove the one side you can fit it over your face and than remove the outer one.  There is a lot of lotion and it will tend to slide off of your face so take the time and lie down or else you will be adjusting it.</li>
