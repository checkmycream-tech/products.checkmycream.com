### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I used the volume lifter and the brush, with wonderful results!  </li>
      <li>Wonderful!</li>
      <li>However, I think this hair styler would make an excellent gift for any girl.</li>
      <li>But the best they could do was tell ME it was MY problem</li>
      <li>It is a very good product.</li>
      <li>that means good.</li>
      <li>This dryer looks and works great and came with many attachments.</li>
      <li>nice brush attachments</li>
      <li>It has a nice variety of attachments, which I like.  </li>
      <li>The Ragalta 5 in 1 Hair dryer easy to use and the price is good.</li>
      <li>If I want more of a curl, then I use my curling iron.</li>
      <li>I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven&#x27;t used most of the attachments.</li>
      <li>The basic style is perfect and I love mine.  </li>
      <li>This is now my favorite hair dryer.</li>
      <li>Also comes itch attachments:)</li>
      <li>Took just a little while to figure out which attachments worked best and when - but it&#x27;s now very easy to style my hair :)</li>
      <li>it is cheap, but seems very cheaply made too</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>light weight easy to use.</li>
      <li>The handle is easy and light.     </li>
      <li>I have fine hair and the volumizer attachment</li>
      <li>Wonderful product and easy to use because its flat like a brush and not round.</li>
      <li>I am glad that Ragalta hair styler is cheaper than any other product but good in quality.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it&#x27;s true.</li>
      <li>first couple of times i used it it worked fine.</li>
      <li>The air blow is rather powerful, and it works well.</li>
      <li>so I decided to get one or two more, in case it will unexpectedly die.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with it so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Conair for years but the last styler that I really liked was discontinued.  </li>
      <li>I like the brush style dryers (the half brush, not the round one), as it is very handy in providing good lift at the roots.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, I am very happy with this dryer.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the lowest heat setting, I don&#x27;t need to have a high-speed blower, have more control</li>
      <li>This is exactly what i need for my hair.</li>
      <li>With luggage fees being what they are these days, it is great to have such a small, lightweight, versatile product that is so easy to travel</li>
      <li>and since I use my own everyday without problem, I could see right away that this one was defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s potential and her eyes will light up and you&#x27;ll be her favorite (whatever) until the next time she washes her hair.</li>
      <li>really wanted to return it.</li>
      <li>It was much easier to style my hair.</li>
      <li>Hair styler smells like a burnt iron and within four days the whole thing came apart.</li>
      <li>There is no way to purchase replacements, without purchasing a whole dryer set.</li>
      <li>I have this kind of hairstyler before but the hairbrush material so stiff and it bothers my scalp.     </li>
      <li>A few years ago, I had a drying hair styler and LOVED it, but it finally broke after being used so much.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my wife because she was looking for one particular attachment.</li>
      <li>The curling iron attachment is to short, but I guess it would have be a really powerful dryer for it to heat up a longer curling iron barrel.</li>
      <li>I have very tightly curly hair, my mother used a blow brush just like this when I was growing up, I was so happy to find this one for my little girls curly hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I contacted the AMAZON seller.....and found that they only offer replacement in the first 2 weeks.  </li>
      <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>What I like about this product is that It is very compact and lightweight, while being sturdy at the same time.</li>
      <li>I asked for refund but they replied after 3 days to my mail and it is too much hassle to send the product back.  </li>
      <li>I decided to try this one, mainly, because it was the only brand in the US that made that type of hair dryers.</li>
      <li>I just got it a few days ago and must say it worked better than I expected.</li>
      <li>love this type of hair dryer, very hard to find.</li>
      <li>I ordered from a popular auction site because the shipping to my location of the Amazon Market Sellers were crazy high.</li>
      <li>I ordered this item because other reviews were positive.</li>
      <li>However, it does what I mainly need it to do - to dry and straighten my hair.</li>
      <li>It barely lasted me a month till the clutch broke off of the brush</li>
      <li>makes my hair frizzy and dull, much less effective than the conair brush dryer I was using.</li>
      <li>Right now I only use that attachment and try to give the ends of the hair a slight curl.</li>
      <li>Little expensive but worth it. :)</li>

    <li> I have purchased 4 of these dryers in the past year.  The basic style is perfect and I love mine.  I have also given 3 as gifts.  However, one of the gifts (given just this past Christmas; it is now June.....less than 6 months of use!) is faulty; the little tab that holds the attachments in place is broken and probably has been the entire 5 months of use.  The person I gave it mentioned that the attachements fell off but I thought they just needed to learn to use it properly.  However, last week I got to actually see the item and since I use my own everyday without problem, I could see right away that this one was defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the AMAZON seller.....and found that they only offer replacement in the first 2 weeks.  Amazon&#x27;s refund policy expired March so between the two I have had no replacement or refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a defect like this, the Amazon seller SHOULD replace the item and take the matter up with the manufacturer.  But the best they could do was tell ME it was MY problem and I should contact the manufacturer.  I have and they seemed receptive; so we will see how it goes.  But I definitely WOULD NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS AMAZON SELLER.  THEY DO NO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife because she was looking for one particular attachment. She thought that some of the attachments could be a little bigger, but it suffices. haven&#x27;t heard of any other complaints.</li>
    <li> It barely lasted me a month till the clutch broke off of the brush and I had to tape it to keep using it. The materials with which it is made are very poor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair for years but the last styler that I really liked was discontinued.  I took a chance on this one, am not familiar with this name.  It has a nice variety of attachments, which I like.  My Conair is 200W, this one is 800W.  I used the volume lifter and the brush, with wonderful results!  The volume lifter was the only attachment I used on the Conair, but I can retire the Conair now that I have this Ragalta styler.  I&#x27;ve only used the lowest heat setting, I don&#x27;t need to have a high-speed blower, have more control since I have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, I am very happy with this dryer.  It appears to be well-constructed.</li>
    <li> Every morning I wash, dry and have to style my hair with a hair dryer and a curling iron.  Not anymore.  I just use the Ragalta 5 in 1 Hair Styler now.  This one item has decreased the amount of time I spend each day styling my hair.  I have fine hair and the volumizer attachment adds layers to my hair.  The curling iron attachment takes care of my bangs. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I ordered from a popular auction site because the shipping to my location of the Amazon Market Sellers were crazy high. I have fine hair a little past the shoulders. I typically dry my hair with a hairdryer and then use a curling iron to curl the ends a little. I was hoping to get rid of my curling iron, but I still use it. The curling iron attachment is to short, but I guess it would have be a really powerful dryer for it to heat up a longer curling iron barrel. The circular brush attachment is too thin for my preference. I would prefer a circular brush the size bush shown attached on the picture. Right now I only use that attachment and try to give the ends of the hair a slight curl. If I want more of a curl, then I use my curling iron. Also, it no longer stays on unless I apply pressure to the button. This was after only about a week of use. Overall, I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> My wife is using this product.  She did not complain anything about this product. that means good. I know she is using it everyday.</li>
    <li> Attachments won&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> After i looked for so long, finally i found Ragalta hair styler. This is exactly what i need for my hair. It is not easy to decide for buying online because i am afraid that the material of the hairbrush doesnt exactly as what i want. I have this kind of hairstyler before but the hairbrush material so stiff and it bothers my scalp.     With Ragalta hair styler, it is easier now to manage my hair to get the volume that i want. The handle is easy and light.     I am glad that Ragalta hair styler is cheaper than any other product but good in quality.  I was almost paid $50-$60 for the same product. I recommend it for your hair.</li>
    <li> love this type of hair dryer, very hard to find. first couple of times i used it it worked fine. nice brush attachments light weight easy to use. the on/off switch has already loosened up n will not stay on unless u  r always pushing on it. if this was a quality product i would recommend it since it is not i do not.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven&#x27;t used most of the attachments. I&#x27;ve really only used the dryer and the nozzle. What I like about this product is that It is very compact and lightweight, while being sturdy at the same time. This dryer goes with me everywhere I travel, whether I&#x27;m travelling domestic or international. With luggage fees being what they are these days, it is great to have such a small, lightweight, versatile product that is so easy to travel with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, this dryer does not give me the same &#x27;blowout&#x27; (I use that term loosely) as a regular dryer. However, it does what I mainly need it to do - to dry and straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s true. It has FIVE attachments. I suppose if worse came to worse, you could fix up the queen if you happened upon her as she fixes a flat tire. In the time I&#x27;ve had this hair styler, I usually just use one attachment - the curling brush. Although, since my blow dryer recently caught fire, I&#x27;ve been using the wide-angle attachment too. It does not work as well as my poor former blow dryer. The other problem I have with it is as I&#x27;m trying to (blow-curl?) my hair, the vents keep blowing the hair out of the brush - even on low-speed. Ultimately, I have to follow up with a curling iron. However, I think this hair styler would make an excellent gift for any girl. All she has to do is look at the box, with all it&#x27;s potential and her eyes will light up and you&#x27;ll be her favorite (whatever) until the next time she washes her hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item because other reviews were positive. A few years ago, I had a drying hair styler and LOVED it, but it finally broke after being used so much. Thought I would give this product a try; however, when I received it, I was not pleased with how it worked. The dryer part only has one setting for turning it on - there&#x27;s not an option for low/high or cool/warm/hot. The air flow was so low that it would have taken me longer to do my hair in the mornings using this product. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> It is too bulky for me to handle. I am in my 70&#x27;s and my hands cannot graps it well.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to return it.</li>
    <li> I have very tightly curly hair, my mother used a blow brush just like this when I was growing up, I was so happy to find this one for my little girls curly hair. Wonderful product and easy to use because its flat like a brush and not round. Also comes itch attachments:)</li>
    <li> This dryer looks and works great and came with many attachments. The attachments are not that made well. I only used the brush attachment, which fell apart after a few months of use. There is no way to purchase replacements, without purchasing a whole dryer set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this type of hair dryers for a while after my Phillips that I brought from Russia died. I am not very good with plain blow dryer, when one has to use a round brush in one hand and maneuver a blow dryer with another. I like the brush style dryers (the half brush, not the round one), as it is very handy in providing good lift at the roots. Round brush hair stylers were so weak that even with my thin hair it would take forever and my arm would get tired. I decided to try this one, mainly, because it was the only brand in the US that made that type of hair dryers. Panasonic and Phillips have similar items, but not for the sale in the US... I just got it a few days ago and must say it worked better than I expected. The air blow is rather powerful, and it works well. It was much easier to style my hair. I am pleased with it so far. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, though, so I decided to get one or two more, in case it will unexpectedly die.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite hair dryer. I was already used to a wand dryer but it only had two attachments. Took just a little while to figure out which attachments worked best and when - but it&#x27;s now very easy to style my hair :)</li>
    <li> makes my hair frizzy and dull, much less effective than the conair brush dryer I was using. waste of money. it is cheap, but seems very cheaply made too</li>
    <li> I bought this product few months ago. One of the screw was missing from the dryer. Hair styler smells like a burnt iron and within four days the whole thing came apart. This product is not worth a single penny. Please do not waste your money. I asked for refund but they replied after 3 days to my mail and it is too much hassle to send the product back.  I would suggest you guys to buy Natural/Panasonic hair styler. Little expensive but worth it. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she loves it.  It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> It is a very good product. The Ragalta 5 in 1 Hair dryer easy to use and the price is good.</li>
