      <li>I love this color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much more brown than I thought.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s described as a \\&quot;shimmery chocolate brown\\&quot;, but I&#x27;d more accurately call it a plum-brown.</li>
      <li>I read a review that this color was similar to my long-gone favorite OPI shade, \\&quot;Route Beer Float\\&quot;, a beautiful iridescent-gold-brown.  </li>
      <li>This color is actually more of a grape than brown but really unique.</li>

      <li>Pretty sure these wer knock off&#x27;s</li>
      <li>I love this brand of polish and this color is a great medium tone with just a little bit of gold shimmer.  </li>
      <li>and what makes it special is the gold microglitter.</li>
      <li>While this color is nice, it&#x27;s definitely more plum-colored than I was expecting, and the shimmer was not nearly as pronounced as it appeared by glancing at the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I had a pedicure with this nail polish at a salon at  White Marsh Mall(Elite nail Salon) &amp; loved it.</li>
      <li>I truly never thought that I would love this one as much as I do.</li>

    <li> i love the color. it meets all expectations, perfect for many of my outfits. you should give it a try</li>
    <li> Love the color and versatility.  Goes with anything.  Goes on smooth and two coats will do it.  OPI and Essie are my favorite brands.</li>
    <li> Get lots of compliments. Stays on pretty well also.</li>
    <li> jI wanted nail color in the brown/beige/taupe color family, but this color is Just a tad darker than I thought it would be. I will keep it and wear it one day hopefully I will grow to like it. I love OPI nail color because they have a wide variety of colors and their color stays on longer than any other product I&#x27;ve tried in the past. Just apply a top coat over your nail color and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> beautiful color, much cheaper than in the stores</li>
    <li> Nice but very dark and dreary I wish I picked a better color.</li>
    <li> I truly never thought that I would love this one as much as I do. But I have fallen hard for this color if they decide not to keep .(I WILL TRACK YOU DOWN!) but seriously I get so many people asking what color it is and brand.</li>
    <li> I received my polish within the time frame stated and it was carefully packaged. I love this color and actually wear it during any season. Beautiful polish! Thanks!</li>
    <li> First of all, I love OPI. And I was really excited about the Sping 2012 Holland collection. This brown has a much warmer base than \\&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jaque\\&quot; and what makes it special is the gold microglitter. You don&#x27;t see it unless you are in the sun, but it just makes the polish extra shiny indoors. Love this one!</li>
    <li> I read a review that this color was similar to my long-gone favorite OPI shade, \\&quot;Route Beer Float\\&quot;, a beautiful iridescent-gold-brown.  While this color is nice, it&#x27;s definitely more plum-colored than I was expecting, and the shimmer was not nearly as pronounced as it appeared by glancing at the bottle.  It wears very differently than the bottle would indicate.  It&#x27;s described as a \\&quot;shimmery chocolate brown\\&quot;, but I&#x27;d more accurately call it a plum-brown.</li>
    <li> love the color and the quality. it looks good on the fingers and being so close to skin colour i can use it at work as well..</li>
    <li> I am a bit of a snob about OPI polish because it lasts forever and was disappointed when this started showing wear after the first day. Not sure if I will purchase nail polish online in the future</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted me to buy this color for Christmas and she loves it.  Beautiful shade of brown with some subtle bronze/gold colored flecks mixed in with the color.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this color because it goes with everything I own. It&#x27;s neutral but is super trendy right now. The seller was quick to ship and I received my package in less time than anticipated. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome brand and awesome color. I do not mess with crappy polish when it comes to doing my nails and always stick with OPI.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this color. OPI always goes on smoothly. It is opaque in two colors but I always use three.</li>
    <li> it was ok but not what i expected. I&#x27;m into matte colors not sparkly and this one is like a deep tree trunk brown color with lots of glitter. not for me but maybe for you.</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish and loved the way the polish looked online.  However, I bought the polish sight unseen and didn&#x27;t think it was nearly as pretty in person.  I&#x27;ve only worn it once and think that&#x27;s enough for me.  It&#x27;s much more brown than I thought.  I knew it would be a little brown, but it just wasn&#x27;t a good color for me.  If you are looking for a brown polish this is the right one for you, I think it would be pretty on someone more dark complected or with a nice tan.  (I&#x27;m very pale and didn’t find this color flattering.)</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for another color and saw this one and had to buy it.  I love Opi colors....the only complaint I would have is&lt;br /&gt;that its a bummer when they discontinue them.</li>
    <li> The color is nice,but it does not last.  After one day, the polish chipped .  Repeatedly retouched before removing it altogether.  Chipped quickly, unlike other colors of the brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a straight guy who likes to wear nail polish.  This is a great color for guys and contains a very slight hint of gold sparkle.  When I wear this color I&#x27;ll use a solid black with just a bit of copper sparkle on my accent fingers and it looks great!</li>
    <li> The glitter isn&#x27;t as apparent on my monitor, but the shade is pretty true to the photo.. Polish appears to be fresh.  It arrived within anticipated period of time.</li>
    <li> Love OPI products and was very happy with this color as well. Would buy this color again and buy more as well.</li>
    <li> not the color it appears in the pictures.  Was dissapointed with it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color!! This has to be my favorite color at the moment! And I order a ton of nail polish.</li>
    <li> It is not shimmery like pictured. Alot darker than i expected</li>
    <li> The color is great and it was delivered on time!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Smooth application. Getting a lot of compliments from men and women. This is a keeper. I&#x27;ll order this one again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34; You Don&#x27;t Know Jacques!&amp;#34; is the perfect color, a nice warm brown with a hint of sparkle, it is flattering on all akin tones. Not too dark nor too light. As always OPI doesn&#x27;t chip or fade but it&#x27;s easy to remove. I really have to recommend the color again because 1) My mother in law hated it! (She has no taste!) and 2) no matter how long or short your nails are, Jacques! Is flattering. Amazon&#x27;s price was well below nail salons and I&#x27;m of the opinion that OPI is worth a few extra pennies for the color &amp; the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this color. I actually bought it for myself for christmas because I kept seeing this color and being drawn to it and I&#x27;m excited to use it again this fall :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it yet. But does look like pictures. Does look like it would be a good neutral all winter</li>
    <li> Love the color. Nice polish.</li>
    <li> The polish when applied does appear shimmery as it does in the photo.  The color also looked brownish in the photo but looks a bit purple on.  Either way, still very satisfied with the color.</li>
    <li> Poor quality. Polish was old and tackie. Almost impossible to brush.</li>
    <li> The nail polish looks nothing like the picture. Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money.</li>
    <li> Took this to my manicurist today. They loved it. It&#x27;s a nice neutral. A little darker for the pop effect.</li>
    <li> I Nice color, I&#x27;ll probably use it more in the fall.  Need a good top coat to get it as shiny as the picture.</li>
    <li> This was a fantastic addition to my wardrobe of OPI nail polishes.  It is exactly as described and looks like the picture.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves nail polish. She is always looking for good quality polish, and fun new to her, and different colors.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay,  Streaked more than other OPI colors.</li>
    <li> Pretty sure these wer knock off&#x27;s they seam watered down.  The polish lasts longer than the crap u get at walmart but still not the real thing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, I&#x27;m generally not a big fan of shimmery nail polish, but in this one it&#x27;s really subtle and pretty.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It is really pretty and the perfect nail color for fall. It is a really pretty brown with gold flecks.</li>
    <li> The polish is great!  I love it!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of polish and this color is a great medium tone with just a little bit of gold shimmer.  Can be a casual color and yet it dresses up your hands very nice.</li>
    <li> Try this color, you&#x27;ll love the copper chips in the polish.  Stays on a long time!&lt;br /&gt;It goes with everything.</li>
    <li> Good neutral color with just a hint of glitz.  OPI cant be beat! A brown color that goes with almost everything.</li>
    <li> You need about 3 coats of color for this nail polish to not be see through. I was dissappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> OPI polishes are outstanding in their wear and chip resistance.  I saw this color in a magazine and was afraid it might not be what I wanted.  I love the color and it has just a hint of a sparkle in it.  Not showy or anything but really nice.</li>
    <li> Compliments everywhere I go with this polish! Have been wearing it for two years now! I call it my signature color! Have gold flecks in it.</li>
    <li> It dries nicely and smoothly. Thank you for the fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> This a nice color for Fall ,this is nice Brown color with a little sparkle not to much .You could wear this color with just about any outfit.The Polish lasted a good week on my nails with a Top Coat .</li>
    <li> This color goes with everything.. Love OPI and the great colors that put out.  My granddaughter found this color and we both fell in love with it. I always use the OPI base under all my polish and it stays on so much longer.....</li>
    <li> Saw this at my manicurist&#x27;s salon and had to add it to my home colors.  A great brown with a touch of gold tone.</li>
    <li> Very Pretty fall color!  Hint of sparkle without being annoying or childish.  Who doesn&#x27;t adore OPI&#x27;s colors??!!  I am going to try this with shellac system.  I have heard you can use traditional colors.  Will let you know how it works!</li>
    <li> I love this color!  It is a very nice shade.  The color is more like a mocha chocolate.  It covers well.</li>
    <li> Love this color, it matches with everything.  Looks exactly like it is shown in the picture.  Was delivered promptly and well-wrapped.</li>
    <li> The color is almost the same as visible online. It stays on great.  I can&#x27;t stop saying I love it.</li>
    <li> The polish is a plum/brown color with a hint of shimmer.  Perfect on my fair skin.  My new favorite color.</li>
    <li> Beautiful cream brown/mauve with copper flecks.  Absolutely gorgeous!  Looks one way indoors and one way outdoors, all beautiful.  I recommend Essie Good to Go Top coat.</li>
    <li> Great color neutral but not too neutral.  Just enough color when don&#x27;t want much.  would definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;great!</li>
    <li> Top of the line polish.I had a pedicure with this nail polish at a salon at  White Marsh Mall(Elite nail Salon) &amp; loved it. When I ordered it, I was happy with the results. Thank you for the polish!</li>
    <li> This color is ok, but I really do not see the flecks of gold in it.  It is OPI so its a great polish, so I like it and will wear it.</li>
    <li> I love this polish and it&#x27;s the only one I ever use....it&#x27;s long lasting and the colors are fantastic.  This color is actually more of a grape than brown but really unique.</li>

    <li> love the color, love the OPI product, stays on for a long time, got lots of compliments, please with product</li>
    <li> This nail polish is so pretty on my nails! I absolutely adore it. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I adore China Glaze. It slides on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave lines. It dries pretty quickly and looks gorgeous on. I will miss this polish when I run out.</li>
