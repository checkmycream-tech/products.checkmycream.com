    <li> Smells great and really is a great conditioner, as for growth, I havent noticed it yet but I have only used it twice.</li>

    <li> Made my hair felt so nice and soft and it left my hair smelling great... Love this product will buy it again</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner for the money. Honestly. I will def buy it again. Use it once a week &amp; notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This product has not only increased my hair health, it has increased the length of my hair half way down my back in the last year, and this happened all through my health issues which was causing me to shed hair like you would not believe.</li>
    <li> Back in 2009 i used doo gro after what my mom considered a trim turned out to be a bob, and i loved it. At the time i used the shampoo conditioner and hair lotion, then I would pull my hair up tight. About two months later i straightend my hair (i have really curly hair) and it was almost to the middle of my back. Mind you, it was a bob, and I am tall 5&#x27;6, so that was a big difference. Now im using this product since about a year ago i cut my hair into a bob again, and I&#x27;m going to see how it does. I use this product with the doo gro mega thick leave in conditioner. Guess i will see how it goes over the next few months since I really don&#x27;t straighten my hair in the summer.</li>
    <li> Conditioner is excellent on my hair and have been using the whole line of Doo Grow Products on my hair with amazing results.</li>
    <li> I love how it works and it seriously is a great product. I would suggest to not be very very handed with it at all. Even though it is not a natural product, it smells really good and leaves my natural hair pillow soft. I have a review on my YouTube channel as well &amp;#34;Leeny Lynn&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I think this is great for everyday maintenance, however i have had to pair a few other products with this one to give it more protein</li>
    <li> This made my hair feel so soft. I can&#x27;t wait to use this again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, I have used it for 3 years. My hair has grown a great deal and its growing thicker. I love the product, would definitely recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for growth. I bleached my hair so bad it snapped off around the crown! So now I look like I have a mullet! Not cool. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now along with other Doo Gro products. I use this one the most though (everyday). My hair has grown about an inch and a half! That&#x27;s pretty awesome considering my hair usually takes forever to grow. Also it&#x27;s a very good size jar for the price it has lasted me well over a month. Still have plenty of it left. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I needed for my hair which is very dry. As I get older the hair becomes very dry. This helpd my hair a lot. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Have only used it a few times, the smell is a little funny compared to the Mega Thick (blue). My hair wound up super fluffy after washing and drying.</li>
    <li> Got to say I&#x27;m always goin to use doo gro products each time I use something they made I fall in love with it</li>
    <li> Not good for my hair made my hair very dry and break my hair so don&#x27;t use this products if you relax your hair didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
