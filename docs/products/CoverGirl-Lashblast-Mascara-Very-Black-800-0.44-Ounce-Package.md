<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look fuller and longer. Brush makes it easy to apply. Lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not picky when it comes to mascara. I tend to choose the least expensive option. That said, I think this one is really great and I would definitely buy again for the right price. It doesn&#x27;t clump, smudge, or irritate my dry eyes, and it looks really nice.</li>
    <li> Item as promised! Fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This mascara in black gives the best results! It&#x27;s all I buy now. A word of caution though, I bought the brown color by accident one time and it doesn&#x27;t lengthen nearly as well as the black colors.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE! I could not for the life of me find this mascara in stores anywhere for some reason. Worried that they might have got rid of it, I checked online. This mascara is great, it does not clump at all on me and just works so well. I will buy this product forever!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! It may need to be reapplied after all day but it doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under my eyes even if I fall asleep in it!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really give me the appearance of fuller lashes which is what I was expecting.  It&#x27;s been hard getting the mascara on the wand, but hopefully with more use it will get easier.</li>
    <li> My only drugstore product left in my arsenal -- the best mascara for length and volume hands down!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff and I like that it&#x27;s black. I prefer to wear black but if the price is right then I will wear brown.  Yay for black awesome mascara</li>
    <li> This stuff flakes off during the day.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold a curl or give a curl, but it isn&#x27;t clumpy. It adds a little bit of volume, but I usually like a bit more. The length is okay, but this is definitely recommended for the person who likes a more lighter and natural look to their lashes. It&#x27;s great on my bottom lashes although it may be a bit bulking to hold while applying to the bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> I always like this mascara, for me it doesn&#x27;t clump and it works the best.</li>
    <li> Good price and product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get it. This mascara was incredibly useless, and did absolutely NOTHING to enhance my lashes. I don&#x27;t know how this is the most popular mascara on every makeup site, and all the celebrities think it&#x27;s the best drugstore mascara - it&#x27;s useless! It&#x27;s really not as great as the reviews say! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this piece of trash. Save it for a better brand.</li>
    <li> Best mascara I have ever used... And I try a lot because I am a make up artist. Even all of the expensive ones, I always go back to this one!</li>
    <li> AWESOME LONG LASTING DRAMATIC RESULTS MASCARA...A MUST BUY!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about mascara and I have tried lots of drug store brands as well as high end brands. This one is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. It goes on fine, and with a lash separator and a spoolie it actually looks very good at first. It just flakes throughout the day and isn&#x27;t very long-term. I use it for quick errands or if I&#x27;m in a rush and don&#x27;t want my holy grail mascara, which is Maybelline Full N Soft Waterproof. If you don&#x27;t already know this, waterproof mascaras are a completely different formula than non-waterproof and you can tell right away because non-waterproof gets flakey very fast. Try Maybeline Full N Soft Waterproof and you will see the difference!</li>
    <li> CoverGirl is classic and this mascara is pretty good.</li>
    <li> This is my HG mascara.  I have tried many different mascaras at many different price points and I always come back to this one (sometimes I use the Clump Crusher, if it&#x27;s on sale).  I have fairly long eyelashes, but they&#x27;re pretty light so I really just need an extra oomph of color and volume.  This does the trick without giving me spider lashes.  It dries nicely without that &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; feeling that some mascaras give you.  Love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Give a nice thick dark lash, brush helps to prevent clumps!</li>
    <li> Great mascara, wouldn&#x27;t trade for a more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Great economy mascara. I love the brush. :)</li>
    <li> Great mascara, stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Just what I was looking for &amp; the price is nice as well. Only downside is when putting in more than one coat it clumps as little but just make sure you have a eyelash comb thingy and you be fine.</li>
    <li> -- easy on, stays on without flaking and is easily removed.  As good as some others I&#x27;ve tried at twice the price.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best ever, but definitely  good enough to finish the entire tube and purchase another!</li>
    <li> Great mascara. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> when i apply, it feels like something is on my eye.  it makes my eyelashes feel heavy.  I do not like that.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick and long as others, but it works for a quick every day application.</li>
    <li> The mascara is a little thick and the brush is, also. I will try a different type next.</li>
    <li> Not that great and runs under my eyes during the day.</li>
    <li> my favorite mascara of all time it gives volume and definition it will not clump ever even after several layer i have not found another mascara that compares even coming from the same brand this is the best out of all of them</li>
    <li> The round design of the container makes it easy to slip out of your fingers but it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, I have always put two coats on of whatever brand I use, I like this because it is thin, no clumps!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cover Girl make up for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> My only problem with this mascara is the brush. It&#x27;s a bit thick and that makes it hard to cover the corners of your eyelashes without getting some on your skin around your eye. Otherwise, it&#x27;s pretty standard mascara. There&#x27;s better out there, but for the price this does the job.</li>
    <li> This is my fail-safe mascara. After I curl my lashes, this helps keep its curl. I think it&#x27;s advertised as waterproof, but if I get into the water I&#x27;ll get raccoon eyes and will sting a bit...But it&#x27;s perfect for work and non-wet situations!</li>
    <li> Love it. Where&#x27;s well through the day also with no afternoon mascara shadow</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras but I keep coming back to this one.  It really does make it look like you have more lashes.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara and it comes with 3 for the price of one !</li>
    <li> Very satisfied as I continue to buy this mascara!</li>
    <li> Love this! I was using the Colossal Volume mascara before and this is a much smoother application.  Edit: After several more tries of wearing, this mascara has exceeded my expectations! Does not smear at all or give me raccoon eyes, and it&#x27;s held up for a full day of classes plus gym. Very happy with this.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t separate lashes well, can get clumpy.</li>
    <li> makes your lashes look long without clumping</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of money on makeup but I don&#x27;t need to for mascara. This stuff is cheap and I like it better than any thing else I have tried. I ALWAYS get asked if I am wearing fake lashes. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Favorite Mascara - no spider legs eyelashes and they do add a little bit of volume and make your lashes look fuller.</li>
    <li> This is my fav cheap mascara. A must! Thank you!</li>
    <li> My go-to mascara. Great results for a very low price</li>
    <li> Bought this product before, loved it</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE MASCARA BRAND  I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> great product with a great price..</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Can&#x27;t go out without one..</li>
    <li> According to my wife, she is very happy with his product</li>
    <li> for under $1, it works perfectly. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful!  The wand spreads my lashes perfectly, and makes them look almost fake after I&#x27;ve applied them just right.  Make sure you wipe the wand of as much product as you can, though, or it can get messy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because I have oily skin, and this mascara comes off pretty easily throughout the day.  If I have a long work day (granted I wear light eye makeup at work), I&#x27;ll be sure to bring my mascara in my purse and do one quick touch up when I can.  I sweat it right off at the gym if I am not adamant about my sweat towel, but I know that&#x27;s coming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already placed an order for the waterproof mascara, and hopefully those long work days will last!</li>
    <li> worked a little too well, it dried out my lashes and made tons of them fall out!</li>
    <li> Mr favorite for years - try others and keep going back.</li>
    <li> This one isn&#x27;t as rough on your lashes, easier to come off, and definitely adds more length than the waterproof one.  This is an excellent mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mascara! It&#x27;s great.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t appear clumpy.  It makes my lashes look so nice and full.</li>
    <li> This mascara works very well. It doesn&#x27;t clump or case irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big make-up wearer but when I do use mascara this goes on great and looks wonderful.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I use this as a second coat over top the covergirl lashblast length mascara for amazing results.</li>
    <li> I love covergirl mascara, it goes on really nicely. My last mascara that I had would smudge during the day and leave me with a little bit of black under my eyes, this doesn&#x27;t happen. That&#x27;s the main reason why I went with Covergirl again.</li>
    <li> I love every single mascara that I own so far. love how leaves my lashes if you have a very sensitive eyes this may not be the one for you.</li>
    <li> Fast Delivery and great quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for like 5 years, it&#x27;s great, non flakey, good coverage, long lashes.</li>
    <li> always love my cover girl ...... I am glad that amazon sell this product</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. Really makes my lashes look much fuller.</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s ok, nothing great. Doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, doesn&#x27;t do miracles for the lashes either. Fine for daily office wear. Many other brands look better on my lashes, but this has the distinct advantage of being cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think it may be causing very minor eye irritation for me, but it&#x27;s hard to be certain since it&#x27;s springtime and there&#x27;s a lot that could be causing eye irritation. Think I&#x27;m giving up on eye makeup until the pollen is back down to reasonable levels.</li>
    <li> great price. my fav mascara.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought it at the store but found it cheaper on here, so I took advantage of it. Great mascara!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the brush or the formula. The formula was a bit too wet, and didn&#x27;t really do anything to lengthen or volumize. The brush is also not great for applying mascara because the plastic bristles are spaced too far apart to cling onto your eyelashes and apply the product. Overall I don&#x27;t think these plastic bristle type brushes are useful.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara.  Great price too</li>
    <li> There are many many mascaras to choose from, personally I like this one a lot. I use it more for volume in addition with a lengthening mascara. I like the brush on it, works well for me and helps keep my lashes separate.</li>
    <li> Great mascara!  Been using this for years</li>
    <li> Woow love this mascara, its so wet and moist and it gets every single lash. My lashes looked so long and dense, it&#x27;s the best mascara I ever used. It&#x27;s not clumpy, which is great... and mainly, it is water proof, even after cleansing my face it was still on, I had to use cotton with some petroleum to completely remove it. Really quality mascara, no doubt... love it  love it..... Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I just love it. It guves my lashes a fuller and larger look. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky or clumpy</li>
    <li> This mascara works great for me.</li>
    <li> I have grown to really like this mascara. It is not clumpy or cause irritations. It does, however, make your lashes seem heavier during the day but this is only a minor flaw to me considering it last all day.</li>
    <li> A sweet friend of mine bought me this mascara and I love it.I love how it lasts all day and I love the dark color of it. It&#x27;s great mascara :) I&#x27;m lucky to have such a great friend:)</li>
    <li> This is the only mascara I have used for years.  The brush is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t go on too thick (unless you add on too many layers obviously).</li>
    <li> I like CoverGirl!!! Ьy lashes look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I love it.  Makes my lashes look fabulous everytime.  Never clumpy or gunky.</li>
    <li> This mascara flakes off throughout the day. By the end of the work day I look like a raccoon with black circles of mascara under my eyes. Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for some quality mascara that will stay put.</li>
    <li> Best  Choice for price and quality. It is my every day mascara.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit clumpy.  But right color.</li>
    <li> Good mascara for a great price.</li>
    <li> Good, but product seems to dry out easily in the bottle.</li>
    <li> This was a awesome find and good price I used my giftcards that I earned through this site and paid 0 out of pocket http://www.instagc.com/422189 great place to earn giftcards for christmas and save lots of money!</li>
    <li> Great and natural look mascara for the price!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and it was way cheaper to buy it online. The only thing is that the box was exaggerated, such a waste. It only needed a small envelope or box. I could&#x27;ve fit 8-10 more things of mascara in the box.</li>
    <li> A great mascara. I keep trying other mascaras and always come back to this brand. Love it.</li>
    <li> This is the brand I use for beautiful lashes and to cover the gray hair along my edges!! Waterproof makes sure that the mascara isn&#x27;t rubbed off by sweat or humidity.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara! Definitely makes my eyelashes look prefect with such a natural look, I love it!</li>
    <li> If a mascara can curl my lashes itself and thicken them then I&#x27;m going to keep buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to spend the $$ on Diorshow because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that did that except for Diorshow, and now this awesome orange tube is the only mascara I buy.</li>
    <li> Came quick, works well, looks great! I&#x27;ve been through many mascaras most of which I&#x27;ve loved, but i never tried rubber bristles. It went on smooth, extended my lashes, and the brushes got thinner as they went away from the handle- perfect for inner lashes!</li>
    <li> Gives me nice lashes!</li>
    <li> Love this mascara.  I have been a long fan of Dior but CG blast does a better job.  I bought this mascara after seeing so many reviews on youtube with high hopes of finding an alternative and it delivered.  The only negative is the wand...its huge.  I do use a primer which really puts your lashes over the top with wow factor but also helps lashes from breaking.  I would also highly recommend Tarte lash curler.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara!!!  As description says, does what it is supposed to. Lasts all day, even through hard workout sweat, dust in the eyes, allergies- all of it.  Not goopy or clumpy consistency. Like the brush design, doesn&#x27;t glob all my lashes together- still very defined and singular.Good price, shipping was on time. Another good item and purchase, thanks amazon</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of covergirl. The mascara wand is very nicely shaped and does not clump up my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves this. She says it makes her lashes more full than other brands. would buy again.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best mascara I have ever owned. It doesn&#x27;t clump, builds up long lashes and washes off easily.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara! Makes my lashes look long and think without any clumping.</li>
    <li> Best ever wand. The bristles are firm, substantial and apply well. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I just keep coming back to this mascara.  It does everything!</li>
    <li> This is a great mascara. I use this under my other 3d lashes. This gives me the volume and the length I need!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the fat wand.  Difficult to apply.  Also wand it plastic with short plastic bristles.  Do not like it!</li>
    <li> Gets a little clumpy after a while - otherwise, I got a GREAT deal on this so I am happy!</li>
    <li> Good basic mascara. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I would get it again.  Not really clumpy and makes my lashes longer.</li>
    <li> Good mascara for the price.  It is my budget go-to mascara!</li>
    <li> I have always used cover girl products.</li>
    <li> Always been my favorite mascara. I cannot find another that works as well and doesn&#x27;t have a funky brush.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite mascara and I will continue to buy this for years to come.</li>
    <li> I have bought this several times over the years and now I know why I keep looking. The way it goes on is fine, it really does pop. But it is the flakiest mascara I have recollection of. If you sleep in it, there are tons of black flakes around the eyes the next morning. I know it&#x27;s not recommended to sleep with mascara on but it happens. I won&#x27;t buy it again because of this and also the brush is not my favorite at all. I tend to poke my eye or smudge while putting it on because of the design, it&#x27;s too bulky and the bristles too short. I like Cover Girl products normally, just not this one.</li>
    <li> One of the great mascaras I have ever had. It creates false lash effect. And you can easily built it up. I have done three coats and it does not become stiff and heavy on your eyes.</li>
    <li> An okay mascara if you have rather thick and dense eyelashes which I don&#x27;t. This is a light mascara and take several coats to do the job I need it to do - almost. Make up for Eyes is better but more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Better than other department store brands I&#x27;ve tried (M.A.C., Chanel, shiseido, benefit) and for a way lower price! I will definitely buy more in the future!</li>
    <li> A friend who worked in product development at CoverGirl recommended this mascara to me years ago, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Really defines my eyelashes for a great price.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Minimal clumping and full</li>
    <li> I love this massacre!!  It&#x27;s affordable and makes my lashes look extra long.</li>
    <li> I like this mascara for days where I&#x27;m wanting the &amp;#34;no-makeup&amp;#34; makeup look. It can be built up a bit and looks better if lashes are curled first. I also find it doesn&#x27;t wear well (on me) for lower lashes as it makes my under eyes dark. But not many mascaras pass that test for me.</li>
