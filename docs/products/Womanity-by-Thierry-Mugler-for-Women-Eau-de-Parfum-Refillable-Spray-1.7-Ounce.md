      <li>how much I love it.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>it can handle the Florida heat, I&#x27;m sure it can handle any heat.</li>
      <li>Update:&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason for why I love Amazon</li>
      <li>My favorite scent .</li>
      <li>and I just wanted to be able to afford it...</li>
      <li>She love it.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance and got this.  </li>
      <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so in love</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this one.</li>
      <li>It smells rich!</li>
      <li>Love this perfume is a unique smell, exotic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so clean and sexy.</li>
      <li>it was brown in color and smelled extremely strong like men cologne.</li>
      <li>I want to order more right now!</li>
      <li>When I first sprayed this on my wrist it had a salty smell but within two minutes it changed to a &amp;#34;fig&amp;#34; kind of smell.  </li>
      <li>Of course it was available.  </li>
      <li>When I opened the perfume box,  the unique code on the inside lid had been ripped off the box</li>
      <li>Best new fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much .</li>
      <li>And what I love so much about womanity it lights up a room once you enter.</li>
      <li>I love his whole line of perfumes.</li>
      <li>It does have a woodsy sweet smell.  </li>
      <li>When it wears down it has a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>I did not get the replacement yet, but the issue was quickly resolved.</li>
      <li>But even if it wasn&#x27;t - it wouldn&#x27;t do any good as it is filled with pink water and not the perfume.</li>
      <li>It is so unique that it is instantly recognizable.  </li>
      <li>I knew I liked this scent when I got a sample of it from the local department store.</li>
      <li>Because it&#x27;s a little more musty, when you sweat, it blends with your body scent and it&#x27;s strong enough to smell good after spending all day sweating in the hot sun.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Being a customer for over 6 years I expected great service and an authentic item.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I got was damaged (spray mechanism is missing that tube that goes to the bottom of the bottle).</li>
      <li>When I opened the package from Amazon, the first thing I noticed was that the box of perfume was not wrapped in sealed plastic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really beautiful and a little bit strange.  </li>
      <li>First, I normally like floral smells</li>
      <li>You should go to your local store and smell it first!!</li>
      <li>Well, not when we&#x27;re around other people anyway :)</li>
      <li>no, its not a weak smell</li>
      <li>Lastly, the bottle design is fabulously cool.</li>
      <li>I love Thierry Mugler perfumes but not watered down.</li>
      <li>A little on the strong side, but just use the &amp;#34;spray, delay, and walk away&amp;#34; technique (thank you &amp;#34;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&amp;#34;!)  </li>
      <li>I personally bought because first off it&#x27;s Mugler and second because the bottle is pretty! ^.^ .</li>
      <li>This is one of my new favorites now</li>
      <li>I was worried it would be a knockoff since it was cheaper than what I usually see it priced, but it came in the mail (a little late, just by a day or two) and it smells great, nicely packaged, no damage.</li>
      <li>but not sure if I will ever fall in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I get complemented on it daily and everyone wants to know what it&#x27;s called and where to get it.</li>
      <li>The scent is woody but it wears down and turns to a succulent sweet scent.</li>
      <li>innovative, renaissance woman,  and a little bit strange.  </li>
      <li>The box was open and the perfume bottle had a gash in the glass which had clear nail polish on it, I guess to try to make it look normal again.</li>
      <li>I live in Florida so during summer you&#x27;re sweating the entire time</li>
      <li>I have smelled this on other women and thought it was pretty.  </li>
      <li>The perfume bottle looked cheap and not real metal and glass like my other bottles.  </li>
      <li>I love Womanity and have purchased several bottles, along with other Thierry Mugler perfumes over the last few years.</li>
      <li>so it can really wear down your deodorant.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it!!!! I love his whole line of perfumes. It smells rich! And what I love so much about womanity it lights up a room once you enter. My husband kisses my neck all night just to smell it.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite ! very hard to get! i think it is being phased out... which is a shame ! has become one of my favorites. scent lasts all day . please please keep carrying this</li>
    <li> Fake Product&lt;br /&gt;Received the perfume and it was brown in color and smelled extremely strong like men cologne.</li>
    <li> This by far is the best fragrance I have ever smelled. It&#x27;s so clean and sexy. I love all the fragrances from Thierry Mugler, he is awesome!</li>
    <li> I ordered this  it smells so good. ...I love it!</li>
    <li> The Seal was broken on this product. I contacted Amazon about it and they said they would replace it. Amazon does not accept returns of perfumes because they claim they are \\&quot;hazardous waste\\&quot;. I had TWO other issues with perfumes. I did not get the replacement yet, but the issue was quickly resolved. THank you.  Leslie Marks</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume for my cousin , and yes is very very good. She love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this perfume from a tester and really liked it. But when I received it and tried it on it was different. Super strong!!! Unbearable.</li>
    <li> the aroma is very beautiful, loopback,long-lasting and bottle luxurious but I put 4 stars because the box spirits was without cellophane</li>
    <li> I was worried it would be a knockoff since it was cheaper than what I usually see it priced, but it came in the mail (a little late, just by a day or two) and it smells great, nicely packaged, no damage.</li>
    <li> There are really no words to describe how this smells.  When it wears down it has a beautiful scent. Almost everyday, I get asked, &#x27;What are you wearing&#x27;? Everyone loves this!!!</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I tough this was a woody maybe fruity perfume but it isn&#x27;t . It&#x27;s definitely citrus. I gave it to my assistant.&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous bottle thou</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know where all the good reviews are coming from, this smells like mens perfume. I was to lazy to send it back so I gave it as a gift to one of my guy friends. I would not buy this from Amazon based on the ratings. You should go to your local store and smell it first!!</li>
    <li> I have smelled this on other women and thought it was pretty.  It is so unique that it is instantly recognizable.  I just can&#x27;t get past the briny - nearly fishy - note.  I find it a little bit nauseating.</li>
    <li> Smells good came in original box.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume is a unique smell, exotic.</li>
    <li> I have not used this fragrance before.  It is different than any other fragrance I have worn.  It does have a woodsy sweet smell.  I do like it but not sure if I will ever fall in love with it.  The jury is still out.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I was skeptical about buying this without knowing what it smelled like. I personally bought because first off it&#x27;s Mugler and second because the bottle is pretty! ^.^ . I also heard that Gaga wears it, that was another reason I got it. The scent is woody but it wears down and turns to a succulent sweet scent. All I need is one spray and I&#x27;m good to go. Oh by the way, The price for the 1.7 oz was amazing! I got like $30.00 off and they also send 2 vials of misc. testers! I&#x27;m definitely ordering from here again! (FragranceNet)</li>
    <li> Stunning perfume that smells like ocean breezes. I absolutely love this one.</li>
    <li> I knew I liked this scent when I got a sample of it from the local department store. It is very different from what I usually wear. This scent smells &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; and distinctive. I&#x27;m an artist and I like distinctive. The only thing that puzzles me is that no one else has ever complimented me on it. I still like it though. It&#x27;s a nice contrast for those days when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing a &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; scent. This is much more musky smelling, but very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and bought this based entirely on the glowing reviews. My initial impression was one of disappointment; the tops notes did not appeal to me. However, once they dissipated, the heart of the fragrance emerged and that&#x27;s what hooked me. The scent is a departure from the ones I&#x27;m drawn to (Angel, Prada Amber and Iris, Estee Lauder Sensuous, Nude by Stella McCartney). The fragrance is difficult to describe; all I know is that I&#x27;m obsessed and can&#x27;t stop smelling myself! Lastly, the bottle design is fabulously cool.</li>
    <li> The best perfume ever</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume is you like more woodsy smells. I love the smell of tree bark so this stuff is perfect for me. No, it doesn&#x27;t smell like tree bark, but you can definitely smell a wood flavor in it. It&#x27;s sort of a \\&quot;musty\\&quot; scent for women. It still smells feminine, but not the usual flowery scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use it for the summertime. I live in Florida so during summer you&#x27;re sweating the entire time your outdoors so it can really wear down your deodorant. I use unscented deodorant so for hot summer days, this perfume is perfect. Because it&#x27;s a little more musty, when you sweat, it blends with your body scent and it&#x27;s strong enough to smell good after spending all day sweating in the hot sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it can handle the Florida heat, I&#x27;m sure it can handle any heat. It&#x27;s also perfect for working out because, again, you&#x27;re sweating a lot and us girls don&#x27;t like to smell bad...ever. Well, not when we&#x27;re around other people anyway :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great perfume. If you want something that isn&#x27;t flowery, but still a feminine scent or if you want a nice smell during your workouts, this is the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recommend smelling before buying because that&#x27;s always a good idea when purchasing perfume/cologne.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance!  It&#x27;s really beautiful and a little bit strange.  I do feel like the outlier when I wear it, innovative, renaissance woman,  and a little bit strange.  It smells a little bit like a day at the beach, a little salty sweat and sweaty.  Very sexy!</li>
    <li> I love it so much . The smell of this perfume is erotic and sexy .</li>
    <li> I love Womanity and have purchased several bottles, along with other Thierry Mugler perfumes over the last few years. When I opened the package from Amazon, the first thing I noticed was that the box of perfume was not wrapped in sealed plastic. When I opened the perfume box,  the unique code on the inside lid had been ripped off the box so I was unable to register the bottle on the website  The perfume bottle looked cheap and not real metal and glass like my other bottles.  The perfume itself was the wrong color and did not smell like Womanity at all.  Amazon kindly refunded my purchase after I explained the details of the product I received.</li>
    <li> I already knew the product. It came as I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance. I get tons of compliments.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Reliable service</li>
    <li> I love it ,I give the rating of 5 stars because It feels good on me,stays with me,and I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;ask for the name all the time I have it on.i do recommend it to my sisters and friends.</li>
    <li> Delicious.  Best new fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.  A little on the strong side, but just use the &amp;#34;spray, delay, and walk away&amp;#34; technique (thank you &amp;#34;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&amp;#34;!)  :)</li>
    <li> Great buy!!!My wife wanted the perfume...and I just wanted to be able to afford it...Thank You Amazon, we all won (especially me that night)!!!</li>
    <li> Everyone asks what I am wearing, perfect not too strong not too girly scent.&lt;br /&gt;..I heard this was discontinued? so I will buy in bulk! THATS how much I love it.</li>
    <li> Always, always love the fragrance of Womanity. I purchased this for my daughter and she was pleased!</li>
    <li> What a great smell.  I love this perfume.  I found the lotion in a perfume store....however they sold out of the fragrance..... So I searched Amazon to find.... Of course it was available.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I would recommend the seller and the fragrance.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent . I get so many compliments when I wear it . It is a heavy scent . They stop selling it in the store so I am glad I could get it online</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is getting harder to find and I hope they do not discontinue it. I get complemented on it daily and everyone wants to know what it&#x27;s called and where to get it.</li>
    <li> Very nice it made a great gift</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this.  First, I normally like floral smells and this isn&#x27;t floral.  When I first sprayed this on my wrist it had a salty smell but within two minutes it changed to a &amp;#34;fig&amp;#34; kind of smell.  Hard to describe in words but it really is a great smell.  This is one of my new favorites now and I&#x27;m so glad I took a chance and got this.  For me, this is a smell I can wear all year around and not just a season.  I&#x27;m so in love I want to order more right now!</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason for why I love Amazon so much!!!&lt;br /&gt;After talking to Amazon representative for 5 min they agreed to replace this item for free.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update again when I get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought  a Womanity by Thierry Mugler for Women, Eau de Parfum Refillable Spray, 1.7 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;Sold by Amazon.com LLC. Being a customer for over 6 years I expected great service and an authentic item.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I got was damaged (spray mechanism is missing that tube that goes to the bottom of the bottle). But even if it wasn&#x27;t - it wouldn&#x27;t do any good as it is filled with pink water and not the perfume. no, its not a weak smell because it is Eau de Parfum, it has no smell whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;It gets worse, because i cannot return this item to get my money back (against their policy). No one wants to hear my complaint about it either.&lt;br /&gt;So the only thing I can do is to warn other buyers to prevent them from making the same mistake by writing on forum and leaving a bad review...</li>
    <li> The box was open and the perfume bottle had a gash in the glass which had clear nail polish on it, I guess to try to make it look normal again. The perfume inside the bottle was watered down and due to amazon policy it can not be returned so I am stuck with paying the money for junk. I love Thierry Mugler perfumes but not watered down. This just stinks a big one!</li>
