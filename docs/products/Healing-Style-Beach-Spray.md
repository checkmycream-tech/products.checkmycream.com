      <li>I have very fine hair and was hoping for more of a hold.  </li>
      <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite beach spray and we have tried many.</li>
      <li>It smells great and really keeps my curels together and stops frizzing.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>it has more staying power than mousse, yet my hair doesn&#x27;t ever look or feel unnatural.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this</li>
      <li>Love this for my curely hair.  </li>
      <li>This is a pretty good beach spray.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s fine in texture.</li>
      <li>Light, fragrant, easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>The smell is unique but it fades you just smell it as you spray it.</li>
      <li>I use it professionally on models and it gives nice &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; to the hair.</li>
      <li>This company sent this out to my sis in law so quickly by the time she got home to FLA</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair feel super and kinda wavy</li>
      <li>It spritzes on cleanly, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gum&amp;#34; up in humidity, and provides just the right lift at the roots.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to give my hair nice and big curls.</li>
      <li>and if I use this stuff I&#x27;m VERY ready for a shampoo when those every 2-3 day shampoos roll around.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much the user above sprayed on her hair, but this is one of THE best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  </li>
      <li>My stylist recommended this product for my short, fine, slightly wavy hair, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>getting a wave look without too much product can be a challenge.</li>
      <li>Really encourages my wavy hair to hold a curl.  </li>
      <li>I am unemployed, so I refuse to splurge normally, but this is one product that is completely worth the $20 I normally pay for it (from Ulta...</li>
      <li>I have very fine, straight hair and live in an extremely humid climate, so my hair really doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl to save its life.  </li>
      <li>Other than that it works like most hair sprays.  </li>
      <li>I love my other Lanza products</li>
      <li>so I have high hopes for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it makes your hair look wet and kind of stuck together even when its dry.</li>
      <li>and it gives fantastic lift to your hair if you comb your hair in the opposite direction it will fall, rub it in at the root and blow dry before letting it fall the normal way you wear it.</li>
      <li>Makes my fine hair a little too crunchy and tangly.</li>
      <li>It gives a bit of body and is not stiff so it moves and feels like hair, which I like.</li>
      <li>If you want something flexible to hold and keep your style natural</li>
      <li>but I like to use it when my hair is damp out of the shower to hold my natural hair.</li>
      <li>i wouldnt recommend spraying it near your roots though bc</li>
      <li>My hair is still soft to the touch</li>
      <li>I have been using this quite a bit to hold and enhance my natural wave</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair again the next day as I am trying to get my hair healthy again and washing everyday dries it.</li>
      <li>Beauty salons charge double what Amazon charges for exactly the same product.</li>
      <li>When I use this, either on its own or after I apply a little mousse to my hair when wet, my hair not only holds a curl all day, but even after I sleep on it.  </li>
      <li>If you have fine limp hair you must have Beach Spray to give you that thick full head of hair you deserve.</li>
      <li>This is one of the few products that actually works for my very fine, fragile, wavy hair, it takes out frizz and gives me the body I need without feeling like my hair is sticky or weighed down.</li>

<li> and I use it everyday), remember to tousle your hair after you put it on, and use it on mostly dry or totally dry hair as opposed to wet hair (it will dry like a mousse if you do that and not apply the texture you probably want with this product), then you&#x27;re golden!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not 100% into the scent, which I find to be a little too masculine and specific, so I&#x27;m not as likely to use it on myself.</li>
<li> I have naturally wavy hair, but it&#x27;s also thick and long so</li>
<li> you keep in mind that you only use a little bit of this product on your hair at a time</li>
<li> I really do not use it anymore.</li>
<li> Leave in on wet hair.</li>
<li> so I am hoping a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> I have yet to use it on wet hair, but I did try it on dry messy hair and it was a bit sticky</li>
<li> It&#x27;s slightly sticky, but not much.</li>
<li> i just use it like from my ears down.</li>
<li> Helps with styling my slightly curly hair.</li>
<li> I like the way this spray lets me style my hair, however I do find that my hair seems to be a little dryer than usual after using this spray</li>
<li> Remember a little bit is all you need!</li>
<li> product is small for the price</li>
<li> so small - mine lasted for over two months</li>
<li> Anyway, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that by the end of the day my hair feels dirty.</li>
<li> I try and go at least a couple days between shampoos</li>
<li> I have waist-length THICK hair</li>
<li> What I mean by dirty is that I can feel product on my hair like residue.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair terribly sticky (especially when you USE IT CORRECTLY and don&#x27;t overload your hair with it</li>
<li> I wanted this to work for me so badly since I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products over the years</li>
<li> It had an awful feel to it as well.</li>

    <li> Great spray without a powerful smell and crunchiness. This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite beach spray and we have tried many.</li>
    <li> My stylist recommended this product for my short, fine, slightly wavy hair, and I love it!  It spritzes on cleanly, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;gum&amp;#34; up in humidity, and provides just the right lift at the roots.  it has more staying power than mousse, yet my hair doesn&#x27;t ever look or feel unnatural.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream!  Makes hair last for days!</li>
    <li> defines and separates my curls and helps control frizz, not my favorite but a great product! i wouldnt recommend spraying it near your roots though bc it makes your hair look wet and kind of stuck together even when its dry. i just use it like from my ears down.</li>
    <li> This company sent this out to my sis in law so quickly by the time she got home to FLA it was there.  So good stuff al around, a body and texturizing product. Price good too, paid way more at salon.</li>
    <li> 3/19/15&lt;br /&gt;This product is small for the price so I am hoping a little goes a long way. I have yet to use it on wet hair, but I did try it on dry messy hair and it was a bit sticky but it did give me body so we will see. I love my other Lanza products so I have high hopes for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/4/15&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this quite a bit to hold and enhance my natural wave or when I curl my hair. It gives a bit of body and is not stiff so it moves and feels like hair, which I like. The smell is unique but it fades you just smell it as you spray it. Anyway, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that by the end of the day my hair feels dirty. What I mean by dirty is that I can feel product on my hair like residue. My hair is still soft to the touch it just feels like theres product coating the hair if that makes sense so once my curl/wave falls the hair will tangle a bit. This also prevents me from wearing second day hair .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like it but I like to use it when my hair is damp out of the shower to hold my natural hair. When I do this I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair again the next day as I am trying to get my hair healthy again and washing everyday dries it. If you want something flexible to hold and keep your style natural this is perfect just plan on washing your hair. Remember a little bit is all you need!</li>
    <li> I believe this product makes my hair feel thicker.  Whatever beachy is... I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much the user above sprayed on her hair, but this is one of THE best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t make the hair terribly sticky (especially when you USE IT CORRECTLY and don&#x27;t overload your hair with it - it&#x27;s NOT a hairspray!!!) and it does an amazing job helping my hair hold style.  I have very fine, straight hair and live in an extremely humid climate, so my hair really doesn&#x27;t like to hold a curl to save its life.

I am unemployed, so I refuse to splurge normally, but this is one product that is completely worth the $20 I normally pay for it (from Ulta... will order on Amazon from now on since it&#x27;s cheaper).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you keep in mind that you only use a little bit of this product on your hair at a time (that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so small - mine lasted for over two months and I use it everyday), remember to tousle your hair after you put it on, and use it on mostly dry or totally dry hair as opposed to wet hair (it will dry like a mousse if you do that and not apply the texture you probably want with this product), then you&#x27;re golden!</li>
    <li> I dont spend anytime on my hair and love this stuff!!  Smells good easy to use i will continue to purchase this product</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good beach spray. I use it professionally on models and it gives nice &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; to the hair. I&#x27;m not 100% into the scent, which I find to be a little too masculine and specific, so I&#x27;m not as likely to use it on myself.</li>
    <li> Makes my fine hair a little too crunchy and tangly. It had an awful feel to it as well. I really do not use it anymore.</li>
    <li> Love it, my daughter said my hair looked prettier than she had ever seen it!  Will use it again</li>
    <li> My stylist used this stuff on me and I like it because it smells great and it gives fantastic lift to your hair if you comb your hair in the opposite direction it will fall, rub it in at the root and blow dry before letting it fall the normal way you wear it. However, I find it does leave some build-up and can be a tad sticky. I have waist-length THICK hair but it&#x27;s fine in texture. I try and go at least a couple days between shampoos and if I use this stuff I&#x27;m VERY ready for a shampoo when those every 2-3 day shampoos roll around. Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> It really helps to give my hair nice and big curls. I use it before getting my hair curl and done..</li>
    <li> I wanted this to work for me so badly since I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products over the years and my hairdresser recommended it.  My hair was just as frizzy, and curly...  Not beach  wavy by any means.</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that actually works for my very fine, fragile, wavy hair, it takes out frizz and gives me the body I need without feeling like my hair is sticky or weighed down. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> If you have fine limp hair you must have Beach Spray to give you that thick full head of hair you deserve. this the most amazing product I have ever used!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product to create beach waves. I have naturally wavy hair, but it&#x27;s also thick and long so getting a wave look without too much product can be a challenge. It&#x27;s slightly sticky, but not much. I can still run my fingers through my hair after using it.</li>
    <li> It helps keeping hair in place. Leave in on wet hair. I do not recommend it for using it after bathing at the beach with salt water!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this I have waist length hair with extensions this smells good and it makes my hair feel super and kinda wavy --- do not blow drive....</li>
    <li> Amazing wave product and I have tried a ton.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Really encourages my wavy hair to hold a curl.  Light, fragrant, easy to use.  The price is excellent on Amazon, also.  Beauty salons charge double what Amazon charges for exactly the same product.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the speedy delivery and the great price.  I have very fine hair and was hoping for more of a hold.  Other than that it works like most hair sprays.  Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hairstylist.  Helps with styling my slightly curly hair.</li>
    <li> Too sticky - I returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this for my curely hair.  It smells great and really keeps my curels together and stops frizzing.  Would order it again and from this buyer.  Arrived on time and packaged well.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product for anyone with short hair who wishes the wind blown, tossled hair look.  thank you.</li>
    <li> I like the way this spray lets me style my hair, however I do find that my hair seems to be a little dryer than usual after using this spray</li>
    <li> good smell but sticky.</li>
