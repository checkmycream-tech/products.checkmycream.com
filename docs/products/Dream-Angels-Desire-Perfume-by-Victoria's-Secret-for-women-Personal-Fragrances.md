    <li> Awesome ...great buy if you like this fragrance. It was discontinued in the store but I was able to find here.</li>
    <li> This item I had to return.  I have worn this product for as long as I can remember and it didn&#x27;t smell like it should and had a stale smell.  I had no problems returning it though.  I don&#x27;t know why VS discontinued it but they need to bring it back.</li>
    <li> I hope that amazon always carries Angels Divine it is simply a soft and beautiful spray.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the service.</li>

    <li> My husband buys this for me because it&#x27;s his favorite.  In fact, the ladies at Victoria&#x27;s Secret did remark that this one was the one men seemed to prefer.  I wear it for my hubby, but my friends have complimented this scent as well.</li>
    <li> I order this because VS discontinued this perfume from their beauty line, so you can no longer find it at their stores or on line.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume arrived on time and properly package... but it does not smells the same.&lt;br /&gt;This is very similar, but no 100% right.  It has (I think) more alcohol in the mix.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good but goes away very fast.</li>
    <li> The problem with this perfume is that it isn&#x27;t being manufactured anymore. I love it and buy it when I can find it at a decent price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Girlfriend, I just wanted to surprise her. We like the smell of it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> it was what my girlfriend wanted and it came promptly on time  thank you</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean scent. Long lasting too.</li>
