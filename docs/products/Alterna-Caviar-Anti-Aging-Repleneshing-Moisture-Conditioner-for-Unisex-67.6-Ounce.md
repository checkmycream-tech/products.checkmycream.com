      <li>Within one week of using Alterna my hair is soft, smooth and shiny!</li>
      <li>This is clearly the better deal.</li>
      <li>The shipping was VERY fast and the whole process was smooth.</li>
      <li>This Alterna conditioner is the best hair product,  you only need a little bit.</li>
      <li>Offers a smooth look.</li>
      <li>It really detangles!  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ordered this product from Amazon, However; I have been using Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Moisture Conditioner for about a month now.</li>
      <li>This salon-size is a much better deal and will last months longer.</li>
      <li>makes it super soft!  </li>
      <li>The products actually dry your hair more and more and the silicone will only temporarily coat the hair shaft to make it seem conditioned and smooth, when in fact; it was actually killing my hair.</li>
      <li>WIth just a towel dry, my hair falls much better.</li>
      <li>Its perfect for my long, thick hair.</li>
      <li>Redken Real Control was no longer saving it.</li>
      <li>I really notice the difference when I come home and shampoo my hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using this and am using a mild free and clear shampoo and an oil treatment to treat the dry and damaged hair I now have because of this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My curls are back, my hair feels soft &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for anyone with unruly hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I have noticed I only need to wash and condition once every other day because my style stays nice....</li>
      <li>When we go away on trips, I will usually use the hotel shampoo and conditioner, and my hair does ok.</li>
      <li>The best and worth the initial big buy because it lasts for at least 6 months (I have super long thick hair).</li>
      <li>It seems a bit expenseive, but these large bottles last me about 4-6 months.  </li>
      <li>i  give conditioner three stars, just because it was at least able to detangle the disaster from the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am a 45 year old woman.</li>
      <li>Also, takes my 2 1/2 yr old.</li>
      <li>I have using Alterna for nearly 20 yrs.  </li>
      <li>Wow.. what a difference.</li>
      <li>, the shampoo is a complete zero.</li>
      <li>I switched to using Loreal&#x27;s Evercreme spray conditioner and Serum (which contain no harmful ingredients to the hair) as well as the EverStyle hair spray which contains no alcohol and contains all natural botanical&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It makes our hair soft and manageable, even the ends are what we expect.</li>
      <li>Not to mention my greys were coming in very coarse and this has made them soft also!!</li>
      <li>live in a dry climate and this helps!</li>
      <li>hair is shoulder length, wavy, fine and very thick.  </li>
      <li>with these changes to my hair I almost considered cutting most of it off!</li>
      <li>I have waist length hair with loose natural curls.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the first time I have ordered this product from Amazon, However; I have been using Alterna Caviar Anti Aging Moisture Conditioner for about a month now. My stylist recommended I try it. I am a 45 year old woman. I have waist length hair with loose natural curls. My hair is just starting to very slightly grey and has become course, dry and hard to manage style. My hair lost its shine, looked dull and the color was lightened due to dryness. I have always prided myself on my hair... with these changes to my hair I almost considered cutting most of it off! I thought that this shampoo and conditioner were extremely pricey. I had been using Pantene for years. My stylist told me that the use of these shampoos and conditioners were what actually made my hair so tired and old looking! I was using silicone based products, hair sprays with alcohol, silicone based Serums. I used these products over the years to make my hair smooth and shiny but didn&#x27;t understand that it was a vicious cycle I was creating. The products actually dry your hair more and more and the silicone will only temporarily coat the hair shaft to make it seem conditioned and smooth, when in fact; it was actually killing my hair. Within one week of using Alterna my hair is soft, smooth and shiny! I switched to using Loreal&#x27;s Evercreme spray conditioner and Serum (which contain no harmful ingredients to the hair) as well as the EverStyle hair spray which contains no alcohol and contains all natural botanical&#x27;s. Wow.. what a difference. My hair is almost back to the deep chocolate brown it was when I was younger. I do not have to use handfuls of this product. It seems like I need less and less every time I use it. My curls are back, my hair feels soft &amp; smooth. I have noticed I only need to wash and condition once every other day because my style stays nice.... even after sleeping. LOL  I cannot say enough good things about this product. Try and smaller bottle and see what you think. I know I am amazed and I will keep using this amazing conditioner! : )</li>
    <li> I was very happy to see I didn&#x27;t have to pay the inflated price of $32 for an 8 oz bottle in order to use this wonderful product.  My hair loves it and so do I !!!</li>
    <li> This Alterna conditioner is the best hair product,  you only need a little bit. It takes my knots out in the shower. Also, takes my 2 1/2 yr old. daughter&#x27;s knots out in the bath. No tugging or pulling knots out. The comb glides through. I brought this big size b/c it&#x27;s the best value.</li>
    <li> I love Alterna shampoo and conditioner. I cannot use anything else on my hair. When we go away on trips, I will usually use the hotel shampoo and conditioner, and my hair does ok. I really notice the difference when I come home and shampoo my hair. It is like getting that awesome cut. My hair just sits better and styles with ease when I use the Alterna products.</li>
    <li> I do not believe this worked like the hair caviar conditioner I have been using in the purple bottle. It felt sticky and I am questioning authenticity. My hair dresser agreed that something was off------</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners ever created. Period. If you have dry, damaged hair, it will actually restore moisture, elasticity, and preserve length. Try for yourself, you will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> im not sure what all the hype is, i bought this and the shampoo, the shampoo is a complete zero. the conditioner is so...soo.... nothing great, nothing work the money. shampoo was horrific, i mean made me have a rats nest on my head, had to condition like 4 times just to try to rinse out the shampoo. i  give conditioner three stars, just because it was at least able to detangle the disaster from the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. Its perfect for my long, thick hair. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Highly recommended for anyone with unruly hair.</li>
    <li> I have using Alterna for nearly 20 yrs.  Caviar is their best product line.  Expensive and worth every penny!  Try it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used this conditioner for years! We love it. It makes our hair soft and manageable, even the ends are what we expect. It adds shine and does not weigh our hair down. It rinses clean and makes our hair smell fantastic! We will be buying more for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It is amazing and literally has revitalized my hair and my hair almost hurts without it. The best and worth the initial big buy because it lasts for at least 6 months (I have super long thick hair).</li>
    <li> I thought this was going to be the holy hair grail judging by the reviews. My hair is coarse, dry, curly, frizzy. I blowdry and straighten every time I wash it (once or twice a week). Unfortunately this doesn&#x27;t lather well, and makes hair feel rough and stringy instead of soft or conditioned. Hate it. So annoyed - bought the massive container and not eligible for return. A very expensive mistake.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair feels after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate and this helps!</li>
    <li> I have loved Alterna&#x27;s haircare products but have often found the packaging too small for the very expensive price.  This salon-size is a much better deal and will last months longer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner (along with the shampoo) for quite some time now.  It seems a bit expenseive, but these large bottles last me about 4-6 months.  I have very long, thick hair.  It&#x27;s a bit frizzy.  This has been the best shampoo and conditioner I have found to battle the frizz and make brushing it effortless after a shower.  It really detangles!  Amazon has always had good prices and good shippers, and I have not had any problems.</li>
    <li> I swear by this conditioner! I will never use anything else. Even my husband has noticed a huge change in the health and appearance of my hair!</li>
    <li> Just what I was after, perfect product. I have to be careful not to buy anything that will make my head itch, this product works like a charm. my hair couldn&#x27;t be softer!</li>
    <li> Entering my middle age I noticed my hair going from shiny to rough, brown &amp; wavy to sprouting white hairs everywhere that are grizzled and dog-like. Couple that with the always damaging repeated applications of hair dye &amp; daily heat styling, my hair \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; has become a frazzled mess. Redken Real Control was no longer saving it. In desperation, I plunked down the $32 to purchase an 8.5 ounce bottle of Alterna Caviar Moisture Replenishing Conditioner. Instant miracle. My hair is now softer than it was before all this started. What a wonderful thing to come across two liters - 8 times the regular size amount for roughly double the price. If I were to buy eight 8.5 ounce bottles equaling 67 ounces total at $32 a piece, I&#x27;d be spending around $256. This is clearly the better deal.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. I have colored grey hair and it makes it so soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> it is a good conditioner. I have no specific complaint, but it does not really do anything/any improvement to my hair</li>
    <li> If you have over processed hair this is a great conditioner. You can use it daily and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy. I highly recommend. My hair is blonde and it helps it from looking dry. Offers a smooth look. Product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My hair is shiny &amp; healthy looking after using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It smells great also.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is worth every penny!  My hair has never been softer and it also helps tame my frizz!  I have colored, thick, curly hair and this stuff makes it super soft!  Not to mention my greys were coming in very coarse and this has made them soft also!!</li>
    <li> I love the caviar products. GIves my hair a good shine and makes it manageable. I was tired of buying products in a budget that left my hair dry and a terrible shape.  I bought the salon size shampoo and conditioner/ WHile this looks expensive, this has 8 times the volume and only 3 times the cost of the store sized product. WIth a handy cheap dispenser, I had a pretty good product at a great cost. WIth just a towel dry, my hair falls much better. I have a waist length hair and works for me well.</li>
    <li> Packaged good and neat. Came as promised. Great condish!</li>
    <li> I LOVED Alterna!  Was a total convert!  After using the product for 6 months, my hair is very different.  It began breaking off, standing straight up on my head, and I now have a terrible problem with dry scalp and dandruff.  I have NEVER had these problems before and this is the only thing I changed in my hair care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give background, for 25 years I have washed and blown out my own hair five days a week.  It is oily and doesn&#x27;t look awesome unless I do a lot to make it look awesome. I keep doing the work because people comment on it all the time.  It&#x27;s nothing special, but it&#x27;s always done!  Hence, when there is a problem, I take note.  In 15 years, there hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, wavy, fine and very thick.  It takes 45 minutes to dry it when wet.  I was using the Sephora version of this which cost an arm and a leg so I priced it in a larger quantity and bought this instead.  Whatever this stuff is, I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t the same as what I was buying at Sephora.  I&#x27;ve stopped using this and am using a mild free and clear shampoo and an oil treatment to treat the dry and damaged hair I now have because of this shampoo and conditioner.  I will not be using this again.</li>
    <li> Supplier did a great job getting the product to me and the product is great as I remembered it being from previous purchases.</li>
    <li> This bottle will last you a while for sure! I love this product - makes your hair feel wonderful and silky soft! I highly recommend it. The shipping was VERY fast and the whole process was smooth. Thank you, Alterna - you guys rock!!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is amazing!  My hair feels thicker, looks healthier, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> One of the best, period. Same for shampoo</li>
    <li> My Hair has made a remarkable transformation since I started using this product. It&#x27;s so soft and healthy looking these days. It&#x27;s a bit expensive but it&#x27;s my hair and it&#x27;s worth it. I will give this product a 5 star and the sellers are pretty good to.</li>
