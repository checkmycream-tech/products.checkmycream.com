      <li>Has a pleasant odor even though no other fragrance has been added.</li>
      <li>and I also realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a thorough application because of what had preceded it and that using a tissue to apply it was not really the best way to get to all of the irritated</li>
      <li>Wow, amazing.  </li>
      <li>Works as expected; great product</li>
      <li>It truely keeps her skin protected and the uric acid off her skin.</li>
      <li>but so far is going pretty good.</li>
      <li>Glad I can get on Amazon since I&#x27;ve not been a bedside nurse for years now and had forgotten about this stuff until I was in the hospital recently and was able to use it again.</li>
      <li>Works very well and spreads easy.</li>
      <li>The best barrier cream for old ladies who spend a lot of time seated or lying down in bed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m writing this from the perspective of someone with bowel movement issues and will keep it as medically clean as possible, but if you get squirmy about bodily functions, then you might want to find a review more suitable for your need.</li>
      <li>I could not believe how fast the cream healed her hands right up!  </li>
      <li>This cream is great for preventing irritation or for mild irritation because it protects and soothes but is not thick, greasy, sticky or messy.</li>
      <li>and I have been fortunate in that I really don&#x27;t need to do that business very often at night</li>
      <li>Thank you for the product and the fast delivery!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>most especially in the crotch area.</li>
      <li>This cream really is a butt saver!</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has kept my skin from breaking out with what can only be called diaper rash!</li>
      <li>This version works great but getting off your hands is very hard.  </li>
      <li>first, I put it on tissue and wiped with it when I felt I was clean enough.</li>
      <li>This has been a huge blessing for the issues I&#x27;ve had with my skin following an ostomy reversal.  </li>
      <li>I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with fragrance.</li>
      <li>but it works really well</li>
      <li>so it has time to really absorb into the skin like it is meant to.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and absorbs well.</li>
      <li>I would absolutely buy it again and recommend it to the people who need it.</li>
      <li>It really locks in the color for permanent tattoo eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Works very well.  </li>
      <li>I put some of this cream on top of her two prescribed creams and it creates a barrier and makes the two other creams stick.  </li>
      <li>The area is clean and dry</li>
      <li>Great stuff for our critically ill patients.</li>
      <li>I use it to create a barrier on new tattoos and permanent cosmetics.  </li>
      <li>I also put some in to about the depth of my finger nail to get to the really sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It actually does have a fragrance until it dries (fast)</li>
      <li>We purchased this for my 92 year old mother to keep her skin soft.  </li>
      <li>If skin is extremely irritated or itchy, a different product that is thicker (and messier) works better, such as Calmoseptine.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried desitin and pure aloe gel with no real result.</li>
      <li>I have tried other products made specially for dry cracked skin and they have caused  burning and redness.</li>
      <li>After a little experimentation, I hit on the right way to use it for this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it keeps my dry skin soft and supple without the greasy feeling some creams leave.</li>
      <li>Do not use too much, only a very thin layer creates a nice dry skin barrier.</li>

    <li> Works great on skin around ileostomies. Do not use too much, only a very thin layer creates a nice dry skin barrier.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream used as a water/urine/fecal barrier. Has a pleasant odor even though no other fragrance has been added.</li>
    <li> Great product; excellent service. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a RN and we had this at the hospital. Great stuff for our critically ill patients. I use it on my hands and feet routinely. Best healing cream I&#x27;ve ever found. Very moisturizing and absorbs well. Glad I can get on Amazon since I&#x27;ve not been a bedside nurse for years now and had forgotten about this stuff until I was in the hospital recently and was able to use it again.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for my 92 year old mother to keep her skin soft.  This is the best cream I have ever used and it keeps my dry skin soft and supple without the greasy feeling some creams leave.</li>
    <li> works great! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Works as expected; great product</li>
    <li> Works well to prevent bed sores, but is very thick and a bit difficult to apply evenly.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  Like this version more than the spray version.  Spray version easier to use but it is too sticky.  This version works great but getting off your hands is very hard.  I would recommend gloves when using.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I use it to create a barrier on new tattoos and permanent cosmetics.  Helps pigment prevention and makes client aftercare easy</li>
    <li> Good product... delivered quickly...as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent barrier cream for my father.</li>
    <li> This barrier cream is wonderful for skin irritations</li>
    <li> I am in nursing school and I love this</li>
    <li> As a mother of two I have used my fair share of diaper creams, sprays, ointment, you name it!  My youngest is sick quite frequently and the medicine she takes burns her bottom and/or gives her a yeast infection.  I recently purhased this barrier cream to use in addition to two prescribed creams.  While the prescribed creams were effective in taking away her yeast infection they would wash off as soon as she went in her diaper.  I put some of this cream on top of her two prescribed creams and it creates a barrier and makes the two other creams stick.  This cream really is a butt saver!</li>
    <li> I have only tried it once  but so far is going pretty good. I was expecting it to be less resistant than the spray barrier but it works really well and it doesn&#x27;t sting or cause irritation. I really like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t come with fragrance. I would absolutely buy it again and recommend it to the people who need it.</li>
    <li> Slightly greasy. But good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this from the perspective of someone with bowel movement issues and will keep it as medically clean as possible, but if you get squirmy about bodily functions, then you might want to find a review more suitable for your need. I hope this helps others with similar problems. I am post surgery for colorectal cancer and ostomy reversal. As anyone with IBS or post colon surgery knows, your exit area can become quite irritated with frequent wiping, kind of our own special &amp;#34;diaper rash&amp;#34;. Irritation to the point you have blood on your tissue, from hemorrhoids or not, is no picnic. Mine is non-hemorrhoidal, just bad skin irritation from constant wiping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried desitin and pure aloe gel with no real result. There was temporary relief, but the problem would be there again with the very next toilet visit. Then I found Cavilon. It was the solution I was looking for. After a little experimentation, I hit on the right way to use it for this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I put it on tissue and wiped with it when I felt I was clean enough. Needless to say, there was discomfort with this method and I also realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a thorough application because of what had preceded it and that using a tissue to apply it was not really the best way to get to all of the irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that applying it in the evening before going to bed after showering and drying the area has worked the best. The area is clean and dry and I have been fortunate in that I really don&#x27;t need to do that business very often at night so it has time to really absorb into the skin like it is meant to. I put on a nitrile (non-latex) glove, put some on a finger and spread it around. I also put some in to about the depth of my finger nail to get to the really sensitive skin. I started getting immediate results after 2-3 days. There is no more irritation or discomfort down there. I am still putting it on once daily after 2 weeks, but am considering going to every other day.going to every other day.</li>
    <li> This is excellent, have been using it on an invalid.  Best product ever.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best lotions I have ever used</li>
    <li> I have horrible dermatitis on my hands from time to time do to heavy hand washing. I have tried everything to soothe the itch and pain that the dermatitis causes and nothing better then this barrier cream. It&#x27;s instantly soothing and the pain is gone. I have tried other products made specially for dry cracked skin and they have caused  burning and redness. I decided to try this cream because it claims to provides a barrier against moisture and it truly does this cream is the best.</li>
    <li> The best barrier cream for old ladies who spend a lot of time seated or lying down in bed.</li>
    <li> Does what it suppose to do i n protecting skin on verge of breaking down.</li>
    <li> It is the only barrier cream I have found that work and stays on .</li>
    <li> Nice texture, glides easily over skin and protects from incontinence and leakage from ostomy appliance,  Dries fairly quickly and  enables adherence of wafer.</li>
    <li> It actually does have a fragrance until it dries (fast) but it is very pleasant.  Works very well and spreads easy.</li>
    <li> This has been a huge blessing for the issues I&#x27;ve had with my skin following an ostomy reversal.  It&#x27;s easy to use and has kept my skin from breaking out with what can only be called diaper rash!</li>
    <li> Preforms as dirrected</li>
    <li> My mom started having break down after surgery.this product is excellent for that</li>
    <li> If you have issues with after surgery iliostomy reversal irritation, this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> great for skin healing!</li>
    <li> cream leaves a nice film on your skin....protecting it from the elements...water, etc.</li>
    <li> We were introduced to this product while my husband was in the hospital and it is the best for clearing and and protecting against rashes..most especially in the crotch area.</li>
    <li> Absolutly love this stuff. My child has TERRIBLE diaper rash and her daughter prescribed this stuff and its amazing. It truely keeps her skin protected and the uric acid off her skin. It has honestly changed her life. I use this an then another layer of aquphor on top for absoluty no kidding barrier protection.. may be overkill, but a burned butt is a sad thing.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the product and the fast delivery! Ellie</li>
    <li> I bought this cream for my daughter after reading the reviews.  Her hands were sore, red, cracked and bleeding from working outside with animals in the cold and having to constantly wash her hands.  I could not believe how fast the cream healed her hands right up!  Wow, amazing.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  It really locks in the color for permanent tattoo eyebrows. It&#x27;s a great aftercare method.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested this cream to combat dryness on my legs.  Indeed this is serious stuff aNd I recommend it to everybody.</li>
    <li> This cream is great for preventing irritation or for mild irritation because it protects and soothes but is not thick, greasy, sticky or messy. If skin is extremely irritated or itchy, a different product that is thicker (and messier) works better, such as Calmoseptine.</li>
