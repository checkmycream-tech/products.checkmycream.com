    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since around 1998 when I received it as a Christmas gift from my mom. I fell in love instantly and it&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve ever stayed with this long!  Though it&#x27;s gone through several packaging and name changes over the years (used to be called The Healing Garden GreenTea Therapy), and may be a tad different than the original, it&#x27;s still wonderful and makes me feel fantastic. The scent is light, clean and fresh, perhaps a little bit woodsy (like after a spring rain). It smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and isn&#x27;t overpowering. Very hard to find in stores nowadays though, so I&#x27;m delighted to have found a dependable marketplace seller via Amazon.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing the Green Tea scent for years, but lately haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores.  This was just what I was looking for and it arrived sooner than I expected. Scent is light and clean, not overpowering like perfume.</li>
