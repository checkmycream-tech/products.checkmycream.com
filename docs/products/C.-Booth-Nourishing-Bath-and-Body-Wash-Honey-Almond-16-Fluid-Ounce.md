    <li> Good value, great almond scent.  Not junky-trashy.</li>
    <li> Not wild about it. Doesn&#x27;t get as bubbly/sudsy as I like.  I wish the scent was stronger.  But it works.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin or skin irritations, this is the body wash for you. I have mild psoriasis and this is the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim for my lady and it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful.  Scent is sweet and pleasant and pretty much makes you smell like cookies.  The soap lathers well in a loofa, and two teaspoons seems to be enough to clean one&#x27;s whole body.  Consistency is that of most shampoos. I will be reordering.</li>
    <li> The smell is amazing!  I love to soak in the tub and just take in the yummy scent.  My skin feels so nice when I get out.  I got this bath wash for a birthday present and have been ordering it ever since!</li>
    <li> I love this, it is really thick and rich and the smell is wonderful, good purchase. I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> C.Booth Nourishing Bath and Body Wash is equally good as the lotion. Again, it is all natural and excellent as a body wash. It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling soapy, but instead it leaves the skin silky and refreshed.</li>
    <li> THIS BODY WASH IS WONDERFUL.  I LOVE IT.  I CAN FEEL IT SMOOTH MY SKIN WHILE SHOWERING.  I LOVE THE SCENT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS ONE!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I was expecting, I opened the bottle to sniff the product as I always do with all bath products. I found it had a strong alcohol scent. I decided to try it anyways, it was so disappointed by how it made my skin smell. High chemical scent, did not have a light sweet scent that I was expecting. Scheduled a return!</li>
    <li> I first discovered C.Booth when visiting my daughter in  CA, when I returned home to TN  I looked for this product in my local stores with no luck....should have tried Amazon first!  My skin feels soft and supple again!  Love the scent!  Will certainly purchase again!</li>
    <li> Nice smell and lathers nicely.  Have purchased it again!</li>
    <li> This is lovely stuff, really. It is very moisturizing, I almost didn&#x27;t need lotion afterwards. It foams well, leaves no film on me. I took a star off because I wanted it to smell like almond and it doesn&#x27;t , really. That said, I still might order it again, especially when/if  winter gets here.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great and leaves my skin moisturized and soft, especially when I pair it with C. Booth lotions and body butters.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my hubby, who has terribly dry skin. After half a bottle, his skin is dryer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Nivea body wash with almond.</li>
    <li> I love C. Booth products and this body wash doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is creamy and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and clean. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Perfect addition to the Honey Almond collection! I already use the lotion, dry oil mist and body butter. The fragrance is soothing with just a hint of vanilla overlay. Really enjoy that silky clean feeling for dry/sensitive skin. Definitely recommended and granddaughter (7) approved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried the C. Booth products, they are not expensive and they are effective.</li>
    <li> I really like this body wash.  It lathers up quickly so not much is needed; a single bottle can go a long way.  Great subtle non-perfume smell and skin feels clean and smooth.  I follow it with the C Booth Firming Body Lotion.  My husband says my skin has felt much softer since I starting using both products.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and smoothness.  Light scent, lots of good moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I have used C. Booth products for years. Unfortunately, their labels are so dated they don’t adequately represent the quality of the contents. I believe stores such as Target and Walgreens dropped them because of low sales. The contents, however, are outstanding. Not the usual soapy-perfumy stuff, the effects of which evaporate the instant one reaches for a towel. The scents are more subtle (a good thing) and the ingredients do amazing things for dry/rough skin.</li>
