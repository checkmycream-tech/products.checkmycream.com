<li> It looks exactly as it does in the picture but the strap and zipper broke in less than a month.</li>
<li> way bigger than expected.</li>
<li> but it did not hold up well to to the everyday use of a 15 yr old girl.</li>
<li> Handle is very long but adjustable.</li>
<li> I also wish that the bag was just a little smaller</li>
<li> Came in way earlier then expected!!!</li>
<li> its a dark grey color.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s 14 inches wide and 11 inches tall.</li>
<li> The strap is the worst, its braid lays crooked and uneven because of the cheap material, the strap in the picture looks nothing like the real thing.</li>
<li> I will use it, sprayed it down with perfume(hoping that works?)</li>
<li> I waited for this bag, it came to me in a green packaged bag.</li>
<li> Like dead fish.</li>
<li> Was very cheap looking, the fringe is all wrinkled and stiff and feels terrible, very rough and thin.</li>
<li> Not sure if its just the fabric of the bag that makes it smell FUNKY</li>
<li> The fringe is quite wrinkly and is hard to straighten out.</li>
<li> It sucks.</li>
<li> cheap horrible quality</li>
<li> and when I say that I mean literally.</li>
<li> The bad itself is fine for the price, but the smell makes it worthless.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s kinda poorly made.</li>
<li> Too bad the little strap to hold the access strap</li>
<li> But the quality of this purse is very poor.  </li>
<li> I am thinking of cutting the tassels off.</li>
<li> My daughter tried to carry it for a week, but the smell is making her sick.</li>
<li> and arrived with a horrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t look like much right out of the box but we used it in a play and the student loved it so much we let her keep it.  Now she uses it daily!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used out yet but it&#x27;s a really nice purse, it is kind of cheap looking. Still very cute also it was bigger then I thought it would be but I would recommend it if you like fun funky lookin purses like this</li>
    <li> Came in way earlier then expected!!! Too bad the little strap to hold the access strap part broke right off... Also, way bigger than expected, which is great. good thing I know how to sew it back together otherwise this wouldn&#x27;t be three stars.</li>
    <li> It looks exactly as it does in the picture but the strap and zipper broke in less than a month.</li>
    <li> For the price it is a fun purse.  It&#x27;s a good size for holding a lot of things, but not huge.  I&#x27;ve had some compliments about it.  I really want a real suede fringe purse, but until I decide to pay the money for one, this one is fun.</li>
    <li> I waited for this bag, it came to me in a green packaged bag. The purse does have a YUCKY smell to it? Not sure if its just the fabric of the bag that makes it smell FUNKY but otherwise for the price and the size being as is...it&#x27;s okay. I will use it, sprayed it down with perfume(hoping that works?) and I just hope it&#x27;s durable enough to hold my daily uses inside it. Lol The strap isn&#x27;t too thick it&#x27;s kinda poorly made. Just being honest, yet again for only $12 what else is to be expected?</li>
    <li> Im looking for a swede purse to replace my old one. This purse is all I wanted. Huge, soft, simple.  I am using it, but honestly I really wish they would eliminate the tassels. Thats the reason I gave it 4 stars. I am thinking of cutting the tassels off.</li>
    <li> i love the bag.its soo cute.its bigger then i thought and even though it smells alittle its just adorable i cant wait to use it. it came soo fast that im even happier with it</li>
    <li> Fringes on this bag tears up after 2 weeks of use. Good size purse, its stylish and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I figured that the bag would be like the size of a piece of computer paper. It was the size of a beach bag. It stunk and when I say that I mean literally. When I opened the bag to get the crossbody bag it smelt like something died. Like dead fish. Amd garbage. And there&#x27;s only one pocket. Pluse you can&#x27;t return it. It sucks.</li>
    <li> When it arrived the strands are really crumpled and smells like glue. I also wish that the bag was just a little smaller but it does say that it is a message bag. I do like the color and style if the strands weren&#x27;t all wrinkled. I think i&#x27;m going to try and use a hair straightener to unwrinkle them because i don&#x27;t have a clothes iron.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what you&#x27;d expect for the price. The fringe is quite wrinkly and is hard to straighten out. Not completely bad for the price though.</li>
    <li> but it did not hold up well to to the everyday use of a 15 yr old girl. It&#x27;s cute, but not very sturdy overall. I guess if you are one of the people who carries a big bag that you don&#x27;t actually carry a lot of stuff in you may get longer use out of it.</li>
    <li> When i got this item, the package smelled cheap, bag was cheap. didn&#x27;t end up using it.</li>
    <li> This bag smells like cigarettes and the smell will not go away. My daughter tried to carry it for a week, but the smell is making her sick. The bad itself is fine for the price, but the smell makes it worthless.</li>
    <li> Returned. Was very cheap looking, the fringe is all wrinkled and stiff and feels terrible, very rough and thin. The strap is the worst, its braid lays crooked and uneven because of the cheap material, the strap in the picture looks nothing like the real thing. It is not useable as a real purse. Would be ok for a childs play purse.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter for her 16th birthday. She loves it!! Nice and roomy and the long strap is perfect for wearing across the body, like she likes to do.</li>
    <li> I do not mind the faux suede, in fact I prefer it.  But the quality of this purse is very poor.  One look at the zipper made me realize this is of the cheapest quality.  The inside lining is cheap as well, as is the strap.  It is cute in the pictures but I&#x27;d be embarrassed to carry this purse around.  Darn it, I was so excited about it too!</li>
    <li> it was insanely cheap looking. way bigger than expected. and arrived with a horrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> love this bag. perfect size if you are looking for large bag. Handle is very long but adjustable. its a dark grey color. it&#x27;s 14 inches wide and 11 inches tall.</li>
    <li> In the picture looks that it is a good quality on the material, but in real it looks cheap and weak.</li>
    <li> cheap horrible quality</li>
    <li> it is quite a nice little fun purse for me as i am not a teenager... but love my jeans and this goes with them very nicely. the quality is nice too.</li>
