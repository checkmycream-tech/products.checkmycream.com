      <li>It ran out before I was able to get a good feel for the product.</li>
      <li>It seems to relax some of the under eye lines and great for a quick perk-up around mid-day.  </li>
      <li>What I like most about this product is that it is very light, yet gives me a dewy moist appearance under the eye.</li>
      <li>My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it.</li>
      <li>but I love the face</li>
      <li>I also like the night cream, as it is also light, yet effective.</li>

      <li>I plan to continue to use this product forever and am so grateful that it is available on Amazon!</li>
      <li>works great with the Revaleskin Intense Recovery Treatment and with the Revaleskin night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works better than the eye cream itself.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite eye cream ever.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d love to hear from others about their experience with the eye cream.    </li>
      <li>I also  have concerns here---66.00 for this eye cream is almost too good to be true---is this the real thing????    </li>
      <li>and this is very mild</li>
      <li>It is light and non greasy.  </li>
      <li>I have looked &amp; tried many products of this type &amp; have not found any to work as good as this product on my entire eye area.</li>
      <li>I have tried all kinds of eye cream and this is the only one that has had any good effect on my bags and crows feet.  </li>
      <li>Second time I ordered this product &amp; am very pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>I recived this product very fast from BE Bold store from Amazon.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have ever had a problem with, not the product, but the mechanism with which it is delivered</li>
      <li>1% Coffeeberry Extract Formulation Replenishing Eye Therapy does exactly as it says it will.</li>
      <li>Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;~(&amp;#60;^..^&amp;#62;)</li>
      <li>I had to crack open the bottle to be able to use the rest of the product which I have to get out with a Qtip.</li>
      <li>Love the product, have been using it for  several years, it was recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product is probably a good product, but there is not enough in the container to actually get a feel for the product.  </li>
      <li>With each purchase I have written a positive review.</li>
      <li>I gave this two stars because it&#x27;s an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product, but I found it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my eyes.  </li>
      <li>I tried a bunch of things and nothing really did too much</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look so tired in mornings anymore, great product</li>
      <li>it squirts out too much.  </li>
      <li>The price of the product was about 40% less that most</li>
      <li>I am &#x27;older&#x27;</li>
      <li>What I love about this product is it helps with the entire eye area puffiness including the upper eyelid.</li>
      <li>I started using this product after my dermatologist, Dr. Gary Cox,    highly recommended it.  </li>
      <li>It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
      <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t completely rid my eyelids of sagging it deffinately helps reduce the puffiness &amp; lifts them a bit leaving the eye area hydrated &amp; not tired looking.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything out there, lotion or cream wise, that will erase or remove the wrinkles but at least mine aren&#x27;t as deep</li>
      <li>cream!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I like this product very much, have noticed a smoother brighter skin with improved texture and smaller pores.  </li>
      <li>Most more expensive eye creams &amp; serums do nothing for my upper eyelids.</li>
      <li>I looked at the experation date and it was clear that it was wiped out with some solution.</li>
      <li>and they look old too soon</li>
      <li>I have been using this eye product only, but really like it.</li>
      <li>My only real gripe is that while the cleanser, day cream &amp; night cream last a good long time( months ), the eye cream gives out  much sooner than the other creams---I&#x27;ve tried to be very careful with application(you</li>
      <li>If you use it consistently your dark circles will disappear and your eyes will look refreshed.</li>
      <li>Honestly if your problem is dark circles, this basically erases it at least for me.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s very thin, more like a serum than a lotion</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used less expensive products that do at least as good a job.  :o</li>
<li> This product was first recommended to me by a Plastic Surgeon in his office approximately 5 years ago.</li>
<li> This product should last a few months using twice a day.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in the circles under my eyes, but not as much as expected.  </li>
<li> but i went to a dermatologist and he recommended it, I see here that a few people in different regions also had this recommended by a dermatologist</li>
<li> so I would stop messing around with other products and try this one.</li>
<li> After reading other reviews saying that the product ran out so fast, I believe that it was the pump that failed.</li>
<li> This eye cream smooths out wrinkles and takes away dark circles.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, this time, the pump is problematic,  when I use it nothing comes out, I have to shake it, turn it upside down</li>
<li> Be careful where you buy it!!</li>
<li> so i just wanted to tell people that this actually did work for me and some people write fake reviews and it makes people waste money so this actually works</li>
<li> Seriously though, I wanted to write on here because I know a lot of people have this problem where their eyes get really dark</li>
<li> I used a small amount, about the size of a match head on both eyes, twice a day, and it ran out after about 7 days.  </li>
<li> no more wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure about buying it on amazon because I have never bought face cream on this site</li>
<li> It is soothing, but no more so than less expensive products I&#x27;ve tried for puffiness.</li>
<li> It is too expensive to purchase for the amount that you receive.  </li>
<li> Expensive for no results.</li>
<li> A bit on the expensive side though.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or I just got one from a bad batch</li>

    <li> I have used this product for years.  It is light and non greasy.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I am Very happy with the purchase, and you just can&#x27;t beat the price. :D Great product . I get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried all kinds of eye cream and this is the only one that has had any good effect on my bags and crows feet.  I don&#x27;t look so tired in mornings anymore, great product</li>
    <li> Honestly if your problem is dark circles, this basically erases it at least for me. I tried a bunch of things and nothing really did too much but i went to a dermatologist and he recommended it, I see here that a few people in different regions also had this recommended by a dermatologist so I guess there is something scientific about it. Seriously though, I wanted to write on here because I know a lot of people have this problem where their eyes get really dark and they look old too soon so i just wanted to tell people that this actually did work for me and some people write fake reviews and it makes people waste money so this actually works so I would stop messing around with other products and try this one.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Revalskin line through my dermatologist&#x27;s aesthetician for about a year. I like this product very much, have noticed a smoother brighter skin with improved texture and smaller pores.  The line is pricey, but it&#x27;s the only face I&#x27;ll ever have and time IS marching on. ( I&#x27;m 64 ).    My only real gripe is that while the cleanser, day cream &amp; night cream last a good long time( months ), the eye cream gives out  much sooner than the other creams---I&#x27;ve tried to be very careful with application(you don&#x27;t need much)nevertheless, I&#x27;ve run out again sooner than expected---I thought I had a defective bottle but I was told it was dispensing properly.    I also  have concerns here---66.00 for this eye cream is almost too good to be true---is this the real thing????    I&#x27;d love to hear from others about their experience with the eye cream.

    <li> I started using this product after my dermatologist, Dr. Gary Cox,    highly recommended it.  I trust him and believe in the value of this product.</li>
    <li> This product is probably a good product, but there is not enough in the container to actually get a feel for the product.  I used a small amount, about the size of a match head on both eyes, twice a day, and it ran out after about 7 days.  It is too expensive to purchase for the amount that you receive.  It ran out before I was able to get a good feel for the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  If you use it consistently your dark circles will disappear and your eyes will look refreshed.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after application, but overall I really like it.</li>
    <li> I gave this two stars because it&#x27;s an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product, but I found it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my eyes.  I actually preferred using either the night cream on my eyes.  However, since I&#x27;ve switched from the night cream to the Intensive Therapy 1.5% coffeeberry, I use that over my eyes, as well.  Works better than the eye cream itself.</li>
    <li> Smells great! A refreshing cleanse for any face.</li>
    <li> I recived this product very fast from BE Bold store from Amazon. I looked at the experation date and it was clear that it was wiped out with some solution. The price of the product was about 40% less that most so I have a feeling I recived  a expired product. I was out of my eye cream so i had to used and it has been a week didnt notice any impruvment. I give the product 2 stars only because it may have worked if it was not expired.</li>
    <li> my eye cream came from a friend who works in a dermatologist&#x27;s office, it lasted me 3 months and it worked great I&#x27;m not sure about buying it on amazon because I have never bought face cream on this site</li>
    <li> I love this Revaleskin  Eye Therapy, my skin look great no more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;It works great with the Revaleskin Intense Recovery Treatment and with the Revaleskin night cream.&lt;br /&gt;I have looking for this for 5 years now and I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;~(&amp;#60;^..^&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> It is soothing, but no more so than less expensive products I&#x27;ve tried for puffiness. No noticeable change in puffiness after two months of regular use.</li>
    <li> Second time I ordered this product &amp; am very pleased with it.  Others gave it a good review &amp; based on this I ordered it.  A bit on the expensive side though. Received it earlier than anticipated.</li>
    <li> This is my third Amazon purchase for this product. With each purchase I have written a positive review. What I love about this product is it helps with the entire eye area puffiness including the upper eyelid. I&#x27;m 62 and have sagging eyelids. Even though it doesn&#x27;t completely rid my eyelids of sagging it deffinately helps reduce the puffiness &amp; lifts them a bit leaving the eye area hydrated &amp; not tired looking. Most more expensive eye creams &amp; serums do nothing for my upper eyelids. I have looked &amp; tried many products of this type &amp; have not found any to work as good as this product on my entire eye area.</li>
    <li> Everything in perfect order;</li>
    <li> What I like most about this product is that it is very light, yet gives me a dewy moist appearance under the eye. It seems to relax some of the under eye lines and great for a quick perk-up around mid-day.  It is pricey, but I use it sparingly with great results.  Most eye products are too thick/greasy for my tastes, but this is perfect!  I also like the night cream, as it is also light, yet effective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some improvement in the circles under my eyes, but not as much as expected.  I&#x27;ve used less expensive products that do at least as good a job.  :o(</li>
    <li> I like the eye cream but I love the face cream!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and this is very mild and I don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> Fiz uma revisão errada do produto, mas o vendedor me atendeu no que eu precisava, e ja conheço o produto que é maravilhoso. obrigada patricia.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite eye cream ever. I freaked when my office quit carrying it. This eye cream smooths out wrinkles and takes away dark circles. I have never found a comparable cream.</li>
    <li> Love the product, have been using it for  several years, it was recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this time, the pump is problematic,  when I use it nothing comes out, I have to shake it, turn it upside down&lt;br /&gt;then it squirts out too much.  This is the first time I have ever had a problem with, not the product, but the mechanism with which it is delivered</li>
    <li> Loved it and now am now using SOZO brand with coffeeberry since this line has been discontinued. I will continue to use SoZo SoRadiant!</li>
    <li> The pump did not work.  I had to send it back[[ASIN:B001MS7NYU Revaleskin 1% Coffeeberry Extract Formulation Replenishing Eye Therapy, .51-Ounce Pump]]</li>
    <li> Great product. It&#x27;s the only product that keep my skin fully hydrated through the day</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommend this brand. I have been using this eye product only, but really like it. I am &#x27;older&#x27; so it helps build the collagen under my eyes and gives a smoother appearance.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product and I love it. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that the pump stopped working after 2 weeks. I had to crack open the bottle to be able to use the rest of the product which I have to get out with a Qtip. After reading other reviews saying that the product ran out so fast, I believe that it was the pump that failed. This product should last a few months using twice a day.  I will purchase again and keep my fingers crossed that the pump works.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye cream for years and loved it.  Don&#x27;t know if the formula changed or I just got one from a bad batch but... it&#x27;s turning yellow on my skin.  I look like someone punched me in the eyes.  When I wiped it off the tissue was yellow too.  Be careful where you buy it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and this was recommended by a plastic surgeon. I&#x27;ve found that this eye lotion has reduced the depth of the wrinkles around my eyes so I&#x27;m more than pleased. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s anything out there, lotion or cream wise, that will erase or remove the wrinkles but at least mine aren&#x27;t as deep so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thin, more like a serum than a lotion but my dermatologist recommended it so I&#x27;m going to get used to it!</li>
    <li> No improvement in a month. I will keep using to see if it takes longer. Expensive for no results. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Revaleskin 1% Coffeeberry Extract Formulation Replenishing Eye Therapy does exactly as it says it will. This product was first recommended to me by a Plastic Surgeon in his office approximately 5 years ago. Wrinkles, lines, bags and shadows begin to improve within 3 days and continues to do so. I plan to continue to use this product forever and am so grateful that it is available on Amazon!</li>
