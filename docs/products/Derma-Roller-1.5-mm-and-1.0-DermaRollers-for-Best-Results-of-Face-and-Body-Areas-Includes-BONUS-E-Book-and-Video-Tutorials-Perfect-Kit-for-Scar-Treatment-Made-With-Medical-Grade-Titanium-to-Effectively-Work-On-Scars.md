<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Addicted. Works amazing. Just be careful what you use after and during healing process. I find my DIY hyaluronic acid and rosehip oil are best!!</li>
    <li> Easy to manage .... I like it</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me</li>
    <li> Thank you. Works really well.</li>
    <li> I definitely like this product and felt immediate improvement in my scene and visual within a week.  The 1.5 is definitely a bit more painful than the 1.0.  I had used a 1.0 for about 6 months and wanted the upgrade so to speak.  I use the 1.5 once and the 1.0 2 or three times a week.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Product literature a little sketchy English-language-wise but I got the distinct impression the maker of this product totally backs it because of the &amp;#34;call us&amp;#34; and free online videos. I&#x27;m not sure what I expected this to feel like but I was pleasantly surprised. I could feel the little needles pricking my skin but, oddly enough, it didn&#x27;t hurt. Afterwards it just feels warm, as if I&#x27;ve gotten too much sun. The next day all the pink-ness was gone but my skin was glowing. Immediately after my treatments I use a hyaluronic acid/vit C/vit E/niacinamide/matrixyl lotion that I make myself and it does tingle a bit, although not more than it normally tingles. I&#x27;m using this for wrinkles, a scar, and uneven tone/sunspots and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference on the wrinkles and uneven tone/sun spots after only a few treatments. The scar is a surgical scar so that may take months to diminish but I&#x27;m looking forward to my results! (Female, 54 yo, fair skin)</li>
    <li> Slowly but surely my stretch marks will go away. So far it&#x27;s fading... slowly lol slowly...</li>
    <li> It does what it says, I have not been using it for that long but I already see result&#x27;s I like how it make&#x27;s my face glow and it plum&#x27;s my face enough to make it more youthful! I look forward too a couple of months down the line and the results I know will be amazing, I wish I would of discovered this sooner, I would of save a lot of money the spending thousands of dollars on laser treatments for my face. by the way I have some deep in pit scars from pass acne so that&#x27;s why I wanted to try this. and I&#x27;m very please so far, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, just feel&#x27;s like a little sunburn on your face after using it. but it doesn&#x27;t hurt and has amazing result&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Derma rollers are my favourite skin care tools that i use regularly at home to take care of my skin. At first i was very scared of using these tiny little needles on my skin. But trust me now I am very after happy using this . You need not worry of spending more than 100 $ to professionally  treat your skin , This product is very cheap comparatively and you can use this for a long any time at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using derma rollers in micro-needling therapy has a wide benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne scar removal&lt;br /&gt;Cellulite reduction&lt;br /&gt;Stretch mark removal&lt;br /&gt;Treat hair loss&lt;br /&gt;Sun and Age spot repair&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkle elimination&lt;br /&gt;Collage stimulation&lt;br /&gt;Youth rejuvenation&lt;br /&gt;All these can be solved at home using this derma roller. It may look scary  to use but it will not hurt you while using it unless you put extra pressure while rolling it on your skin. After using this product i can feel my serum gets absorbed very easily into my skin. My skin feels very healthier and glowing without any marks, scars blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about this product it comes with three different size of needle heads which are in different colours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.5 mm head - 1200 needle count - Perfect for body rolling&lt;br /&gt;1.0 mm head -  600 needle count - Ideal for facial hair&lt;br /&gt;0.5 mm head - 180 needle count - Intended for use around eyes and nose area&lt;br /&gt;We can every sizes in the same package because each size has its own uses. The handle is very comfortable when using the product . It has a good grip when we hold the product. Also it is very easy to switch the needle heads. The directions to use the product is clearly stated in the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this product and I recommend for everyone who are looking for a good derma roller that is gonna be long lasting and perfect for smoother and youthful looking glowing skin. I received this product in return for my honest review . All the above statements are 100 % my own.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so I really can&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; review for it just yet.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made! Really works! I love it. My results were so phenomenal  (after about 10 uses) that my mother ordered one.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed and I think after one week of use its already helping</li>
    <li> I like using the rollers.  I see a change in how my skin looks and feels, and better absorption of my moisturizers.</li>
    <li> Honestly I had bad stretch marks behind my legs and upper thighs and i see a big difference, I would really recommend this to anyone I&#x27;ve only used this 4 times in 2 and 1/2 months, but I am excited to keep going :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and love it.  Some minor peeling and a little bleeding but I do it at night.  Afterward, I wash my face (again) and continue with my moisturizers and Retin A.  A helpful tip with the minor irritation is Arnica gel.  It&#x27;s all natural and you can get it at your local pharmacy.  It really helps the healing process overnight and cools the skin.  Also, I would pick up a bottle of cleansing alcohol and be faithful in cleaning it each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it really does fade fine lines and wrinkles and use the roller eyery other day or 3rd day.  I was hoping it would help a little with bags under the eyes, but maybe I need a bit more time to see a difference.  It did make a noticeable quick change to my chest area where women tend to wrinkle as they age.  Overall I would compare 3x rolling equivalent to 1 IPL at my doctor&#x27;s office.  Definitely well worth the money for the results.</li>
    <li> Rollers arrived quickly. Good directions included and they worked just as indicated.</li>
    <li> Works even better than promised.</li>
    <li> I have had this for about 1 month and have had wonderful customer service when I had a question.  I use it twice each week and notice that the serum (their top rated) hyaluronic acid, is instantly absorbed.  I have a few stretchmarks that I am trying to improve the appearance of.  The eBook is very clear and the followup emails from the company include tips of use.  It&#x27;s important to let your skin completely &#x27;heal&#x27; between treatments.  It feels a bit like a mild sunburn following the rolling but a moisturizer helps minimize that.&lt;br /&gt;I will post again when I am more sure of the results I am looking for.  I definitely would recommend this product as a great alternative to costly invasive procedures for life&#x27;s aging imperfections :)</li>
    <li> Came quickly and was exactly as described. It was sealed and clean, and was easy to use. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Awesome purchase. Happy customer. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 1mm roller twice. So far very happy with it. I wish that it would have storage for both rollers not only one in that box😞</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the derma roller about three times now so it&#x27;s hard to really see some of the results but I can definitely speak towards the experience. At first my skin was a little sensitive to the needles. Nothing painful but definitely a lil uncomfortable around your nose and forehead. The easy way to adjust that is just rolling a little slower. After rolling, i got a little redness but mostly my face was just itchy. By the second and third time I noticed my skin was much less sensitive so I have to imagine it gets easier over time. I noticed a few lines disappearing and when paired with some really good products your skin will soak it up quickly. The description says it&#x27;s good around the eye area but I have to admit that area is really sensitive to the needles because the skin is much thinner so Its a matter of how brave you are (although like the rest of your face, it probably gets easier). I really like what I&#x27;m seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m confident that with more use, this product really does deliver the results your looking for. The only difficult part of the routine is waiting at least 12 hours until you apply makeup to avoid clogging pores. So scheduling it is kind of a pain, but if you&#x27;re lucky enough not to wear makeup, this isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  Love what it does for my face and especially my legs.  A huge improvement as been seen in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> excellent, never used before ! Love it!! Excellent delivery</li>
    <li> Absolutely most effective treatment! It even got rid of my under eye bags and my c-section scar is noticeably lighter and softer! This thing is amazing! I did not expect results this awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this roller, I was nervous about using it at first but it&#x27;s easy to use and so far I&#x27;m having great results.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money. Work very well so far. I would buy again</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but that&#x27;s a good idea for this afternoon, I think! Thanks for the reminder.</li>
    <li> I heard of the derma roller from a women&#x27;s magazine, it might have been First.  I read that Jennifer Aniston is a big fan.  I ordered a small derma roller, for the face.  Seeing that my face absorbed cream much better and looked better after the derma roller treatment, I got the body kit that includes a roller with two interchangeable heads.  My skin is very dry, especially in winter.  With the rolling and then moisturizing, my skin looks better.  I use the larger one on my thighs, belly and behind and the smaller one on my face.  I gave the smaller one (my original purchase) to my husband who also likes it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. It does hurt and it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get under the eyes even with the smaller attachment but well worth it. I use it with Aveda facial products. So far I can feel and see a big difference in my skin. Don&#x27;t forget to use it on your hands because the hands are the truest way to tell your age.</li>
    <li> Happy , satisfied customer :)</li>
    <li> I have had good results so far with this. Takes a little practice to get used to the right amount of pressure. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This  is my first time to  review  a product.... This Derma Roller is a God Sent. I am using it on strechmarks that i have been battling with for a long time and to my surprise,they are beginning to fade away...I can&#x27;t wait to see the marks dissappear. ..    Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times &amp; I&#x27;ve already noticed a significant difference in the coloring of my age spots on my face.  In regards to my &amp;#34;bat wings,&amp;#34; the elasticity in my arms has improved.  I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase as well as the customer service of this company.  Be sure to read Puruskin&#x27;s instructional manual and follow it to the T to get the best results.  (i.e., using hylaronic acid serum prior to treatment).</li>
    <li> Great product so far. I&#x27;ve only used it three times (once a week) and I already notice a difference. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results are after 2-3 months of treatment.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this roller.  It works very well and the results have been very good for me.</li>
    <li> I have had this for a while now and seen the improvement from using this product. I had 2 tiny little indents from injury to the skin on my face. They have all but disappeared now after using the derma roller on them only 2 times. I really put a lot of time into rolling on those 2 areas while doing my whole face. This device really works. It just feels like a sunburn when you are finished and heals in a matter of days. I am happy with the results for improvement to all my skin. I have seen improvement everywhere I have used it. I would strongly advise others to make sure you use a valuable moisturizer after you are done and your skin is absorbing better and deeper. I use my favorite retinol creme, or peptide cream, or coconut/vitamin E homemade cream...the coconut/vitamin E mix is a homemade moisturizer and is extremely good at soothing the skin and healing it fast.</li>
    <li> Since receiving this product I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times (only on my face). Today I had my first compliment (used it last night). I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the fresh pink glow that was brought up from the treatment last night. I want to use it more but I have sensitive skin so I need to do a little at a time. I also have a scar on my arm from a skin cancer removal over a year ago &amp; I&#x27;ve treated it when doing my face &amp; it looks better now. The OZ Naturals w/Vit C serum is a must to use! Thanks for the recommendation for this serum! This product works very well with my skin type. For right now (after 3 treatments) I&#x27;d give it one thumbs up. A few more times I could probably give it two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Was delivered earlier than delivery date!</li>
    <li> Love Ive only used it once so far but I ready see a sight difference I can only imagine how much more result I will after a couple months of doing it... It doesn&#x27;t really hurt but has a slight sting when u get done and when I took a shower the next day. ( I did it right before bed then rubbed coconut oil on ).  But hey beauty is pain lol  *two thumbs up*</li>
    <li> Started this journey in December 2014 -     January 22, 2015    Have been using roller per instructions, usually twice a week on tummy, and I have to say that the deep stretch marks are markedly shallower.  I also noticed that a old surgery scar is less apparent.  Wow, I wish I would have known about this years ago.  It&#x27;s only been a few weeks!      I am also using BioOil for scars &amp; stretch marks, this keeps the area nice and supple.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens after 6 months.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the quality of this product, along with the very valuable information on how to properly use the device - a lengthy PDF arrived in my email with great info about use, care, cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is I find it difficult to change the head to the other size - would prefer to have 2 different handles - tough to grasp the head without pricking your fingers</li>
    <li> I have tried everything under the sun to help my skin, to no avail,,,,  until now.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 1 month ... 2x a week with light pressure and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference.....skin is brighter, less black heads.  I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
    <li> Ladies there is no way this works.&lt;br /&gt;Pinholes is like abrasives in facials, make your shin harder over time. Abrasives, like pins in the skin will ultimately harden over time!&lt;br /&gt;How is that going to help you?&lt;br /&gt;If disagree with me that&#x27;s fine because, I am a Dermatology Specialist and my clients do not use these buble gum rollers.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous - I have only used them twice and believe I&#x27;ve seen a change for the better in my skin.  They do turn your skin red but it fades in 24 hours.  I would definitely recommend them.</li>
    <li> So far i used twice , but i liked</li>
    <li> I used it on my post baby stretch marks and the skin has tightened. The roller is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Very nice roller! Well exceeds my expectations!</li>
    <li> Great product, the moment I got this product I&#x27;m so excited to use it right away. I did 2 treatment already since I have this but so far I can&#x27;t tell the difference yet but hopefully for the time being I can see the improvement or the good result that I want to see. Thank you for this product.</li>
    <li> really works how they say it does.  depending on the area, you can see results literally over night.</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure about trying this but I LOVE it!! I use a bit of Vit C serum before &amp; after use.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and a little painful. Used it once, made me bleed...sitting in my cabinet thinking about tossing it.</li>
    <li> I got my product in the mail recently. Product came packaged exactly how it is mentioned. I feel like derma rolling can work but its my first time trying it, fingers crossed. So far I luv my derma roller.</li>
    <li> Awesome  have seen scars lesson and disappear after using this about 4 times on my face. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> This product arrived quickly and is exactly as described. Both are wrapped in sterile packing and has a plastic case for storage. It works great and afterward, my skin feel puffy and looks flushed. By the evening/next morning, my skin feels really hydrated. The company sends you tons of information upon purchase and follows up with you to make sure you really know how to use it. You also get a free ebook to dive into using the roller efficiently. I do use a numbing ointment with it, so I haven&#x27;t actually experienced any pain. Read up and educate yourself on these products before using - you won&#x27;t regret it! It&#x27;s now a part of my facial regimen! I love getting facials, but I just can&#x27;t afford those payments, so this is my solution and I don&#x27;t regret it for a minute. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to &amp;#34;see results,&amp;#34; but I also forgot to do pictures before I started so I could document it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait and take my time to thoroughly use the product before giving a review.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and I can honestly say that the product is amazing!  The science behind it makes sense.  I&#x27;ve always known that our bodies are designed to heal themselves--which is why our bodies will cough and produce phlegm whenever we get a cold.  This response is our body&#x27;s way of pushing the virus out of our system.  The Derma-Roller creates tiny wounds in our skin.  Our body responds by sending extra collagen to the area to facilitate healing.  This extra collagen, of course, makes the skin look younger, fuller, and more radiant.  Those tiny wounds also create a clear channel for any facial serums to be absorbed at a MUCH greater capacity.  In my case, my Vitamin C cleanser has now yielded a REMARKABLE brightness and tightness in my skin!!!  Likewise with my facial serum.  The Derma Roller has made the difference.  At first, I began using the roller once a week....now I use it every 3 days and the results are just simply amazing.  I also use the Derma Roller on a scar that I&#x27;ve had for 2 years and the scar is almost invisible.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using a 1.0mm face roller of a different brand since Christmas. I purchased the 1.5mm and used it last week once and again today and will not use again.  This left track marks every where I used it.  I thought perhaps I used it too hard last week--at one point blood spurt out, so I waited until I healed (5 days!) and carefully rolled again today.  I did my stomach, thighs, hips and it looks as if I was whipped in  horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.  I inspected the roller and I cannot find any visible imperfection, but my skin is showing that one or two of the needles must be off kilter, or dull, causing deep scratching and a great deal of pain.  I have not tried the 1.0mm head for this, as I am happy with my other 1.0 roller.</li>
    <li> I have been using my roller for two weeks and have already seen results!  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after 30 days.</li>
    <li> I ordered the product and received it intact.  The roller head would not stay attached to the wand and after three attempts I decided it was in my best interest to return it.</li>
    <li> Seems to be going ok so far. I&#x27;ve used it once, haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet, but we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> I have only used the Derma Roller one time but have seen a difference in pore size within the first week. Anxious for continued use to see long term effects!</li>
    <li> I saw results after 1 week.  I would highly recommend using something to numb the skin on your face prior to using.  I used this liquid that I apply prior to waxing my eyebrows and that helped to dull the pain.  It is uncomfortable at first, but once you see the difference you won&#x27;t be as bothered by the pain.</li>
    <li> Came in perfect condition. So excited to try this product!</li>
    <li> Shocking and wonderful. I&#x27;ve been using this kit for a couple weeks and have seen a clear upgrade to my skin, firm and more responsive to daily moisturizing and this is a must during the winter! Outstanding tool to have or give to friends or family who may be looking for a way to beat back time or elements.</li>
    <li> Holy s*** this thing is amazing! I&#x27;ve only used twice and have noticed a significant change in my stretch marks, tummy tuck scar, and cellulite.  my entire life I have been obese over 250 pounds. I&#x27;m now 140 my entire body is made up of stretch marks botched plastic surgery scars and cellulite this is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever used that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Give it a shot!</li>
    <li> This product worked very well on just about every skin blemish</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the derma roller!!  I am noticing a difference in just three uses on my face.  The Customer Service at Puruskin is outstanding.  I emailed with a couple of questions, and had answers back immediately!  To me, the price is amazing for a product that works so well.  I sure wish I would have  known about this product a few years ago...better late than never, though.&lt;br /&gt;  Sharon Nichols</li>
    <li> I used the roller and after only four times (4 weeks) a red scar has been significantly minimized. I use argan oil after the treatment. You may experience some itching and/or red lines several hours after its use. It&#x27;s perfectly normal and I see it as a sign that the product is working. I am so pleased with the results that I just purchased one as a gift. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt, the product was packaged well, and the roller is easy to use. I really like the wide derma roller on larger areas of skin...it rolls easily.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Seems to work exactly as advertised and was shipped on time!</li>
    <li> inexpensive alternative</li>
    <li> Just received the item &amp; have used it once. Really nervous it was going to hurt but it really wasn&#x27;t that bad! I used it on a few wrinkles on my face. It&#x27;s only been once so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it&#x27;ll work but I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this roller and the results that I&#x27;m getting. I&#x27;ve use the 1.5 roller for my stretch marks twice now and the 1.0 roller once on my face where I have some old acne scars. I&#x27;ve seen results both times and am truly glad I settled on this roller instead of buying two different ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many lotions in the past to try and fade my stretch marks with little success. My stretch marks are mostly from being pregnant, but I have a few from my teenage years. So, I pretty much bought this roller out of desperation to try and minimize the stretch marks as much as possible. I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews from across the internet before purchasing one and boy, am I glad I did. I honestly would&#x27;ve followed what many people suggested they did to get results, like rolling 3-5 times per week, but a few reviews stood out to me, and those were from people with in the medical field. I decided to proceed with caution and use the roller as those reviewers suggest by rolling ONCE a month only. It will be a slow process, but it will be the safest and best thing for my skin. I mean, this is your skin, so why not take care of it instead of risking something just for &#x27;instantaneous&#x27; results? Give your skin time to heal before you roll again! Please do research before rolling too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve rolled twice already and have seen the difference it has made. The stretch marks I&#x27;ve had on my inner thighs since high school are now so faded that I have to look really closely in order to notice them. Yes, I still have a ways to go, but I&#x27;m willing to wait patiently and do it right then risk damage to my skin. I still have deep marks on my hips and tummy from my pregnancy and I know those will take longer to fade, so I&#x27;ll update when I start seeing some improvement there. So far I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and what it has done to help my stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#x27;re interested, after I roll, I apply a mixture of sweet almond oil and shea butter. I also use the sweet almond oil once a week as an all over moisturizer for my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this for 4 months along with vitamin C serum. I tried everything according to the little manual but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. How can I get a refund?</li>
    <li> Been using the small roller on face and neck a little over a week.  The first time I thought it was a little painful, but now not so much at all.  It seems to have brighten my complextion but since I have just started using it I will have to wait and see if there is a marked improvement in my skin over time.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot of money getting this same treatment at a doctor&#x27;s office.  Then my daughter bought the Puruskin Derma Roller and gave it to me as a gift.  My skin is not overly sensitive and the only place that was sensitive was on my forehead where the skin is thinner...so I didn&#x27;t press as hard in that area.  I&#x27;ve just used it twice so far and can&#x27;t wait to see results in a couple of months.  I was planning on getting another treatment, so this Derma Roller is saving me lots of money.</li>
    <li> Skin seems to look better in the initial day following a rolling session. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times as you&#x27;re only supposed to roll one or two times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality assurance is highly valued by their company following up with you, and replying to you if you have any questions which is nice. My only issue is they&#x27;ve sent an unfavorable number of emails asking for a review starting after I initially purchased it. I&#x27;m in business so I understand the need for positive reviews and referrals especially in a primarily online marketplace offering, but they keep bugging you to put feedback up. Again I understand, but keep in mind, results are not immediate, so don&#x27;t expect an amazing review after I&#x27;ve just purchased the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like I said, so far so good. Just got to keep on a rolling. They also send you some good tips and a very comprehensive PDF manual about rolling and best practices. It would&#x27;ve been nice to also receive a quick rolling guide with the product as opposed to having to figure read it on the com</li>
    <li> After 5 times on my face, I do notice improvements. And surprisingly it does not hurt as much as  imagined.  Big head came with bent needles. Customer service resent new one immediately after contacted. Will continue using it.</li>
    <li> After only one treatment it has almost eliminated an old chicken pox scar on my face. Great product!</li>
    <li> These do the job and are of great quality! I would recommend them!</li>
    <li> Wow! I absolutely love this dermaroller. I have been getting professional dermabradions from Beverly Hills for years. I can honestly say this works just as good. This dermaroller leaves my face glowing and have got compliments for family and friends. The best thing is the price. You can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m in shock it works so good. I encourage all of you who are looking for a great completion to try this wonderful product. I got this at a discount for my honest review. My review is awesome. Give this a try.</li>
    <li> OMG...  IT HURTS SO MUCH ..  NO THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Only 2 treatments so far but feel like there is a difference in the skin tone already.  Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> It really helps the creams and lotions absorb onto the skin.  Noticed softer skin immediately.</li>
    <li> I was afraid to use it, but  I am so happy I finally did, it works! And the customer service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the results I have received after many uses already !</li>
    <li> Great but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to post at this time.  Needed instructions on how often to use.</li>
    <li> I was excited and a little hesitant at first, but this seemed to do what it said. I didn&#x27;t have much pain, and only a little blood around the nose areas. I haven&#x27;t used it as often as I wanted so I can&#x27;t report a major change, but this was good investment to try derma rolling for a newbie. I have sensitive skin, so I did have a little more redness lingering into the next few days, but that was OK. I did feel like my moisturizer really sunk into my skin vs. just settling on top. I like the fact there are two heads and they did provide ample instructions.</li>
    <li> Love it! The handle gives you a good grip so you can roll on smoothly. I use it on my stretchmarks, followed by bio oil and I seen improvement within weeks.  Very satisfied, quick delivery also! 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the face attachment so far.  I have only used the face attachment twice so far.  I am using it primarily on my neck and chest.  I am hoping to tighten up some sagging on my neck.  Yes, it hurts.  You&#x27;re running needles over your skin.  Suck it up buttercup.  Beauty is pain.  Or so they say.  I hope to see results after continuous use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed by the quality and therapeutic effects of the Derma Roller by Puruskin. I have read many complaints about dermarollers in general, particularly from those purchasing many low quality rollers with faulty needles, etc which could contribute to scarring, but I dont have this concern or experience with the Puruskin Derma Roller. The product is of great quality from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I&#x27;ve tried the Derma Roller 4 times thus far after getting it a couple of weeks ago, using only the 1 mm microneedle... just out of curiosity and to improve overall skin health. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite improvement of facial skin texture. I only foresee continued improvement for the aforementioned as well as fine lines, any pigment spots,  etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a U.S. based Dermatologist myself and from my experience in the last two weeks, I give this product a 5 star rating. I have to give credit where credit is due. It can be hard to be a right product to tailor to each individual, but I was not disappointed with this one. Everyone, however, should still do their own, thorough research to ensure a right product for themselves.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference...the next day after use my face is still swollen and that&#x27;s actually the only time my face has a nice plump look...I have been using since December....</li>
    <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;3 in 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit &amp;#34; for a little over a week now, and I am starting to see some improvement in my skin&#x27;s look and feel. My scars have started to fade as rolling the Derma Roller definitely feels like little needles rolling up &amp; down my skin. After using the Derma Roller for about 6 minuets, I add Retinol onto my skin to help speed up the scar removal process. My skin has also become smoother and feels softer than it did before I started using the Derma Roller. I have read many positive reviews on this great invention, but they do say that noticeable improvements happen after about 6 weeks of using. I will be glad to see the results then as I stated that I have only used my &amp;#34;3 in 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit &amp;#34; for a little over a week with improvements already.I really like the 3 different sizes as I can choose what size I want to use on my skin and I would recommend this one to everyone. I am glad to have been selected to try and review this product out. I love it.  (I have received this product free in exchange for an honest review).</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I am sure I will love it</li>
    <li> Great service,  product, and quality jus as promised. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked yet and Ive been using it for awhile. It sure hurts though!</li>
    <li> I have somewhat fair skin and have not had any issues with irritation using this roller.  It is good quality and easy to use.  Now, I wouldn&#x27;t roll my face and go out the same day...I only use it before I sleep.  Only gave it 4 stars as I haven&#x27;t really used it regularly to say it has made a huge difference, so not the fault of the product but only related to my lack of experience with it.  Just don&#x27;t go crazy with it!  Be gentle. I would think more frequent gentle use would be of more benefit than infrequent, heavy use.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working. I am 66. Have started on my forehead, to reduce the wrinkles.  After 3 or 4 treatments, my forehead is less wrinkled. I am happy.</li>
    <li> Great product noticed results on my stretch marks after 2 weeks</li>
    <li> my legs get all scratched up</li>
    <li> I am really happy with the mirco derm double set. Best of both worlds. Be careful slidding the differant attachements off and on I accidently cut myself so take your time as you slide it off and on. I overall really like this derm roller. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I just received this last night and used it the same day. I was unsure if the quality of the product was going to meet my standards.....but it DOES! I can&#x27;t wait to see any and all results!</li>
    <li> I have used it 3 times so far so my review won&#x27;t be thorough yet. It doesn&#x27;t hurt-it tickles some on some parts of my face. I found that if I make shorter strokes it is more tolerable. My skin feels afterwards like it is a little sunburned (it says it would) and is a little red but it is not a problem. When I wake up it is back to normal. It seems to me that my skin is a little more radiant. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything else yet. It says that the average number of uses is 10 before you see anything substantial. I follow the cleaning part very well and I haven&#x27;t had any issues. I will update my review after more uses.</li>
    <li> Ineffective waste of money</li>
    <li> I got this a couple weeks ago and I have used it once a week. This is my third time using it, and I absolutely love it! The customer service is amazing, and they make you feel so excited with your purchase. If you have any questions, they answer right away. I have a few marks on my skin from picking at my face a long time ago. They are right on my cheeks and they bother me so much. I&#x27;ve tried everything. I notice results from only three uses, and even my friends have made comments about my skin. I think it&#x27;s working and I can&#x27;t wait to see where my skin is down the line! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is a great idea an it works, works, WORKS !!!! I AM 61years old. I added this derma roller to my Obagi and retinol treatment an I am so pleased with the results. I use it once a week an my results are peeling an more youthful skin. If u are worried about the picking sensation from the needles, don&#x27;t be...I find that it feels like a mild sunburn ...also frankincense essential oil adds for a great peel also. Doing it all and Im very happy. This is my 2nd review on Derma Roller. I stand behind this product 100%.</li>
    <li> my needles were bent so the derma roller cut me up a bit.</li>
    <li> So I was pretty skeptic before trying this and did not take a before picture. Why I didn&#x27;t think it would work I don&#x27;t know, the whole reason I bought this was because of the reviews. I have suffered from acne my whole life. I am in my thirties and I have been in and out of a dermatologist&#x27;s office since I was 15. I mean I should be over the whole acne thing by now right! Ugh!...Well I&#x27;m not and I have the scars on my face to prove it. Or I did! After just one use they have faded tremendously. They are worse on one side then the other due to cystic acne but I and my husband can already see a big difference. I believe after just one or two more treatments they will be gone!  I was nervous to use it at first but it was hardly painful if that&#x27;s what I should even call it, it was more prickly. I didn&#x27;t want to push to hard because it said if you bleed your pushing to hard. I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere right after I did it because my face was completely red, but I think it was from the oil I put on it. I used a toner on it after about an hour and the redness got better. I am very please with this product!</li>
    <li> I have not been using it long enough to know if it helps with wrinkles or stretch marks. But I am hopeful. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month. I did get a compliment on my skin the other day, but I cannot be positive that it is due to derma rolling. I will write again after using it for longer. I have noticed that the next day after derma rolling my skin feels firmer and it is also a little itchy/ dry, like it is exfoliating dead skin. I try to use a night cream on my face to add extra moisture under my moisturizer and that seems to help. So far so good. I will write again in a few months or as soon as I see noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far but so far its been great. I bought this for my husband who has been losing weight and would like to get rid of his stretch marks. He was worried that it would hurt, but it didn&#x27;t bother him unless it was a really sensitive area such as the underside of his arms (if I rolled lighter over those areas he was ok). He was also worried he would be all red and sore the next day. He was pretty sore and red the night we did it, but it was back to normal by the morning. He&#x27;s starting to see results, and I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look after using it for longer.</li>
    <li> the 1.5 needles is already broke some needle.</li>
    <li> I need to buy some oil, cream to apply with this. They sent a coupon for the Aragon OIl with this, but I didn&#x27;t realize I needed it and threw it away. So keep it if you get this and research what you would want to use with cellulite</li>
    <li> I bought this to try the body roller, which I have not tried yet. I do already have a 1.0 for face and neck. I have been using it for a couple months. I do see some improvement. I do not except over night results as this process takes time, and my skin is very sun damaged. I have large pores on my nose, that has not improved yet. This company provides excellent support.</li>
    <li> I have used my Derma Roller every night since I received it a couple of weeks ago. I love it! My skin looks amazing the next morning. I use the Retinal serum 2.5% after I use the Derma Roller. It absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. I am going to keep using both of these for a long time! Thanks Derma Roller!</li>
    <li> A little painful at first then gets better.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. Appears to be smoothing my skin out. Be patient,  my acne scares look better and i will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> Only one week of use on my face and I have already noticed improvement of the wrinkles and also on the firmness of my skin.  I only use moderate pressure and although slightly uncomfortable, it is not painful and the results are worth the minor annoyance.  The Body Roller is amazing and again, only after a week I have noticed improvement with cellulite.  As long as you don&#x27;t press extremely hard it is not painful either.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my skin after months of use.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times, and am seeing some results in specific areas. Only the pin that holds the roller on,has now rusted and broken off. I have wired it back together, but am not happy about the product being so cheaply made.</li>
    <li> These dermarollers are helping my stretchmarks, and navel piercing rejection scar.  I derma roll once a month.  I&#x27;ve done it twice and see a difference. It is painful for up to 2 days after treatment. The skin gets pretty raw.&lt;br /&gt;If you start bleeding, let off on pressure, you shouldn&#x27;t be bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash your skin with anti bacterial soap before and after rolling.  I basically do exactly what is done by tattoo artists.&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply non purfume lotion.. it still can burn..&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product. It arrived faster than I had expected and the packaging was very nice. I love that it has two heads so I can rotate them depending on my needs and cutting the time I would normally spend. This is a great product and I would recommend this brand to anyone! It was fast, convenient, and reliable. If you are thinking of purchasing a derma roller, this is the best!</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous to try the derma roller since I don&#x27;t love needles but I wanted to try to improve the clarity of my skin. I was pleasantly surprised at how it felt. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all in my opinion- mostly just tingled a little. I feel that it has helped tighten and rejuvenate my skin! I&#x27;m excited to see the results with continued use! I really love this product and would definitely recommend it, especially with the quality and dual heads. It&#x27;s a great bargain!</li>
    <li> Just got it and started on my first session with the 1.5mm head for my stretch marks.  I&#x27;ll update as I go, but I&#x27;ll give a run down of the first experience.  I have no derma rolling experience and the manufacturer gave pretty good instruction on how to use this.  You have to register with the website for them to send you a .pdf guide to the product.  The instructions for prepping and storing are pretty good.  This product came with a cover for each head but didn&#x27;t come with a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as using the product goes, this is the most unusual tickling feeling going over my skin.  The closest thing I can compare it to is having one of those pin art toys pressing against your skin.  I just can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m pricking my skin at all when I&#x27;m doing it, but my skin got a little red after I was done so I assume it worked.  I also had a few lines going across my skin but I suppose that&#x27;s an indicator that I went too fast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I rolled one direction, I would go back the opposite direction overlapping the previous section.  I&#x27;m using pure argan oil and  chlorella stem cell eye cream over the rolled area.  My skin has reacted well to argan oil and eye cream is meant to stimulate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write another review next month with any updates or noticeable progress.</li>
    <li> Love this dermaroller!  Been using it for one month, and I&#x27;ve seen and improvement in acne scars marks on my face. I love the plastic case it come in. I also started using it on my hairline  and rub in my Jamaican Black Castor Oil to help regrow thinning edges. Just be sterile to avoid any infections.</li>
    <li> Great product! Would purchase again</li>
    <li> I have been really impressed with the customer service of this company, and the product is definitely high quality too. I&#x27;m excited to start incorporating this into my beauty routine!</li>
    <li> I have only been able to use it twice, but I am impressed so far.  I feel&lt;br /&gt;it helps my skin feel cleaner and refreshed.  I think I need to push a&lt;br /&gt;little harder when using it, as I was skeptical a first, but so far I&lt;br /&gt;really like it.  I hope by continuing to use it my facial products will&lt;br /&gt;work better to increase less lines and a more refreshed glowing appeal.</li>
    <li> I am new to Derma Rolling and wasn&#x27;t sure how it works. If you are too, buy from Puruskin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before my derm roller arrived they e-mailed me with updates and what to expect. When I received it, I also received a link to download an e- book of instructions, hints, etc. These guys are amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a problem, contacted customer service and they had a new one out to me the next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had this kind of service from an Amazon seller before!! I had a few questions and these guys went above and beyond to make sure that my experience with them was a 5 star experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not only recommend them to everyone out there, but I would seek them out if I ever need another derma roller or skin product that they carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the roller itself is sturdy and of really good quality. They shipped it quickly with lots of follow-up to make sure that I knew how to use it correctly and that I got the maximum benefits from my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys rock!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait until I had used it at least 6 times and I have. I have had this derma roller for a month now and have used it twice a week since I got it. It does exactly what it says it does and it&#x27;s sturdy. For the price, I can&#x27;t believe how good the quality is. Now, as far as noticing a difference in my skin, I have been rolling one stretch marked buttock, and not the other. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference but, it&#x27;s only been a month. Also, the product I bought for application after rolling might be to blame. I will try other creams/serums but, as far as the roller goes, it will be with me forever, it seems. Very durable and reliable. Of course, it is painful, but I think that goes without saying. I may buy a numbing cream so I can roll harder over my skin. I think I would have had better results if I had been able to roll harder over the skin. Great product, though!</li>
    <li> Needles! Way not as bad as I thought working well 😊😊 try it I say</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used my roller 5 times and I have seen some changes to the look and feel of my skin. I suffer from unsightly ingrown hairs on the back of my thighs and some light stretch marks on my bum. I have been using it once a week on both the back of my thighs and my bum. I am so impressed! I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to the extra TLC I&#x27;ve been giving to my problem regions, or if I can give sole credit to the product, but either way, I&#x27;m super satisfied! I love using it because the pain is minimal, but enough to give me a sense of instant gratification - like I know the pain is worth the payoff. I have noticed the most significant difference is in the feel of my skin though. My butt feels so firm and smooth! Haha. I am so much more confident to prance around in my unmentionables unabashed in front of my dear husband, and he seems to be enjoying the newfound confidence. I recommended this product to my mother, and she immediately ordered one, but through another manufacturer, and ultimately was disappointed because she paid much more and received only one roller head, and no instructions. I will continue to recommend not only micro needling, but this brand in particular because I am very pleased with the level of customer service I&#x27;ve received. I would attach pictures of the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far, but they are of my bum, so just take my word for it! Haha.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user but after reading all of these reviews and seeing so many that were positive, I decided to take the plunge.  First time was tonight.  I experienced no pain - just a slight nick feeling.  The area turned slightly red but nothing worrisome.  I applied OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum.  My skin feels so tight it&#x27;s amazing.  I am really hoping this works particularly on my frown lines between the brows and also on my lip lines.  I will update as time moves on.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and very affordable.  I&#x27;m so excited for the results that I am experiencing! :)</li>
    <li> Well let first off start off by saying I brought this for my stretch marks and I use mines three times a week n it works wonders !!! I roll just hard enough to puncture the skin but not hard enough to bruise or bleed. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over three weeks and I&#x27;ve have seen a remarkable improvement ! I am not a paid actor at all I&#x27;m a real person w real stretch marks that are really going away all thanks to this product. You will not see results right away but you will definitely fell the difference. It is not painful at all it may tickle or feel a little weird but that&#x27;s about it ! And not only is this a good product but the customer service is AMAZING!!!! They answer all your questions and concerns and never just leave u waiting or unanswered! Their response time is incredible!! And it&#x27;s always helpful notable info. And on top of all this they offer 100% satisfaction money back guarentee .! You can&#x27;t go go wrong !</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I bought this product MEGA DOKTORDERMA ROLLER™ Micro-Needle System and their derma roller is so much better than this product. They both look the same and have the same 1200 titanium microneedles. But even if I press it hard against my skin , i dont get red rashes or a &amp;#34;ant bite&amp;#34; sensation for the whole day. I have only used it for 10 days and my skin wasnt used to microneedling therefore am still figuring out which one is better. But so far I like the other product over this one.</li>
    <li> Was excited to get rollers.  Had some difficulty getting larger roller attached.  I contacted Eric T of support team and man!  He was right on it!  Ii have NEVER had such quick response or resolution of a problem like this at any other time for any other product..  Certainly earned my loyalty!  Looking forward to looking 20 years younger after starting use of my rollers!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have always had bad skin, oily with acne scaring. The derma roller is making my skin look so much better and I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far! The Puruskin company has been so fantastic with sending helpful literature on how to use the roller to get the best results. I haven&#x27;t used it on any area except my face and I have only used the small roller so far but will probably graduate to the larger one in time. I&#x27;m so happy that I purchased from this awesome company. The product is good quality and very reasonably priced. I would recommend it to anyone looking for prettier skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice now. It isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> This product arrived so fast! I&#x27;m so excited to help my skin look more youthful. This product looks and feels great. I&#x27;m very impressed with Puruskin. I already received helpful tips on using this product. I would most certainly recommend this company and product to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> When I opened the Derma Roller I was a little nervous. It was surprising how easy and comfortable it is to use!!! My skin is already feeling more firm!!! I am excited to continue using and see results with my stretch marks too.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Shipped quickly, nice packaging, and good instructions included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never used anything like this before, but I am converted! It does not hurt, but feels invigoratingly prickly. When used on my face, I had smoother,  tighter skin the next day and could definitely notice positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used on stretch marks and cellulite in conjunction with essential oils I did notice a reduction of appearance of these things and feel that with consistent use the results would be even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that one day I used the roller and went swimming later in the day, and that is NOT a good idea! It probably says somewhere in the instructions, but just in case I would suggest NOT Exposing skin to any irritants within 12 or so hours of use.</li>
    <li> I have had this in my possession for about two weeks and have used it on a few occasions. So far, I have not bleed from using it or felt pain at the area I worked on for no more than one day. Vitamin E serum works well with this and you can tell because of the slight burn that is given. It is very convenient and accessible.</li>
    <li> Product was as advetised. Easy to use and follow up by the compay was impressive.  Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough for results yet.</li>
    <li> great quality product with detailed, informative user guide also provided. I&#x27;ve noticed results after two sessions and would definitely recommend the two-in-one purchase for face and body.</li>
    <li> Perfect, what I needed</li>
    <li> I purchased puruskin derma roller and so far it&#x27;s been working great.i&#x27;ve had it for almost 2 weeks already and i am seeing a difference. My skin feels softer and i can see it looks smoother.  At first it stings a little but i got used to that. Afterwards, it&#x27;s ok! I really like it so far. Have to wait and see, later on on my improvements on my skin. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought This for my Girl Friend And she loves it shipment reach on time as expected</li>
    <li> I have waited to use this product because I was healing after a procedure. Now I am using this product on those new scars and an old facial scar. I have to say the  product brochure and other literature tells you exactly what to expect. This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and I was pleasantly surprised. My facial scar is getting better with every other day use. I also see the other roller head I use on my body beginning to work too. I like this product because of the 2 roller heads for face and body. I can&#x27;t wait to see future improvements.</li>
    <li> Nice results after using just once. Bought it with vitamin C serum..nice combo</li>
    <li> Great product! Seems to be working! Happy with the results so far! It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, got the 1.5 mm :)</li>
    <li> When I first used this I was very hesitant, I did what was instructed.  I used this on the back portions if my legs, they were sore for a little, but can see a little bit if difference.  I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I ordered this product! What a good deal to get both rollers in the same package! It is so easy to use and clean!  I am learning more and more about how to use it.  It is nice to keep it handy when I get out of the shower and use essential oils to help combat cellulite and reduce stress.  Apparently the derma roller helps your skin soak in the oils more effectively. This is a great product.  I like how quick my order came and the clean look of the packaging.  I totally recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My sister told me I should try this, and I am glad I did.  I really feel like my face has a more even tone.  I have horrible acne scars.  I had my face lasered  a few years ago, which took away a lot of the scars, but there are still some.  The interesting thing I found is, after using the derma roller, my face feels a lot like it did as when it was healing from the laser.  (it kinda of feels like my pores are more open and sensitive).  I feel like my face looks and feels smoother and my pock marks are less noticeable.  I also think the customer service is fantastic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my new Derma Roller!  It&#x27;s very easy to use, the instructions that come with it are very helpful.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times on my face and neck.  In the morning after I have used it my skin looks great!  I can&#x27;t wait to see even better results as I keep using it.</li>
    <li> The service was amazing and I&#x27;m so excited to try this out to help with some skin issues!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this derma roller! I received it so quickly with amazing instructions and bonus material, too! It&#x27;s high quality, durable, and I love that it comes in two sizes for best results. Thanks again Puruskin for providing this awesome product and for your amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, quality derma roller.</li>
    <li> Great product!  A little too early to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference but I feel like it is.  Suffering with both acne scars and wrinkles this product is a great way to help both those skin issues.</li>
    <li> Great product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Skin feels a lot smoother.</li>
    <li> I have only used this twice, the 1.5 on the stretch marks on my body and the 0.5 on my face, and I really really like it. I put on my organic argan oil on my face afterwards at night time, and when I woke up my skin was glowing and overall my complexion looked better. I&#x27;m excited to continue using this and I cannot wait to see results!&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to use, but my face and body do hurt a little bit afterwards. Nothing unbearable. I recommend this dermaroller.</li>
    <li> I recently received my Derma Roller. As promised it was delivered in 5 days. It came on the 13th, used it the first time on the 18th. Regarding the comfort level of using the derma roller: I would say that I have a middle of the road pain threshold. I started with my face, with light to moderate pressure. It was only slightly uncomfortable and I experience very minimal pain. As in not enough that I wouldn&#x27;t use it again. Like many others stated, my face was red after using it. I expected my face to be sore until the next day. However, the tingle that was there dissipated shortly after using the roller. I also used it on my body (some areas that has scaring) and that was fine as well. For now I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I only used the derma roller once (so far). I am very excited about the prospect of developing progress. Since I&#x27;ve only used the roller once, I can&#x27;t speak to any changes...yet. My plan is to update my review after additional uses.</li>
    <li> Great Product &amp; Condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Derma Roller for somebody else and don&#x27;t know how it worked for her.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was great and delivered as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t praise the customer service of Puruskin enough. I purchased the set of two derma rollers, one head for the face and the other one for the body. On my second use of the larger one for the body the pin in the center of the roller came out. I just reinserted it. I didn&#x27;t really want to return my purchase, but I did send Puruskin an email letting them know what happened. To my surprise they answered my email promply and replaced my kit. They even said to keep the used ones. They were great! So courteous and professional. I will definitely purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> After having made many purchases through Amazon in the past, this is the first time that I have ever reviewed a product.  Some background info - since 18 yrs of age I have used a makeup that contains zinc oxide and totally blocks the sun;  however, the combination of time, gravity and lots of smiles have caught up with my skin.  I did a lot of research on derma rolling/rollers and having read ALL the reviews, I determined that the Puruskin product would be the best product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kit arrived and while I have a high threshold for pain, I was just a bit intimidated.  I have used the 1.0 mm twice this week since it&#x27;s arrival on 12/28/14.  I was very cautious both times with the sterilization and the level of pressure when rolling.  My experience was that rolling on the cheeks was not overly painful.  Rolling the forehead and temple area was \\&quot;ouchy\\&quot; but I was determined.  After  I finished rolling, I applied the serum which helped with the stinging.  My face had the \\&quot;sunburned\\&quot; look/feeling and itched but I did not scratch!  The next morning I applied more serum since my face felt really dry.  Also, I could feel the flakiness which told me the healing was in process.  My skin does not look as dull and it is definitely softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I ever be 30 again?  Nope!  But I can be the best 59/60 that I can be!  I will definitely continue to use my derma roller and am excited to begin seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Information regarding the product indicates that results would begin to show after ten uses.  The reason for the five star rating is due to Puruskin&#x27;s outstanding customer service and guarantee.  I will post an update in the near future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE  2/15/15  To date I have used my derma roller 12-13 times.  I can definitely see a difference in my skin. My \\&quot;crow&#x27;s feet\\&quot; are diminishing. I actually bought two additonal kits - one for a friend and one for a cousin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to ordering and receiving my kit, I had an appointment to have my teeth cleaned.  Of course, a dental hygienist is very up close and sees every flaw in your skin.  Because of an issue, I needed to go back to the dentist and my hygienist said, \\&quot;Your makeup looks so pretty.\\&quot;  That pretty much went right over my head and then it occurred to me later that she saw a difference in my skin not my makeup since it has not changed.  When I returned two weeks later, I shared with her and the other ladies in the office about my derma roller.  They all were writing down the information. So I would imagine they too started researching Puruskin and derma rolling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the rolling - once you know what to expect the sensation is definitely bearable.  One word of advice - buy and use the after rolling products that are recommended!  It helps with the stinging after rolling!  And, follow all the instructions for sterilizing the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use my derma rollers and when they require replacement, you can bet that I will be buying more from Puruskin!ygienist is very up close and sees every flaw in your skin.

    <li> doesn&#x60;t worth what i paid for</li>
    <li> After one use with aloe vera gel i can feel my face get tighter.  I will do again in a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> Happy with product and customer service!</li>
    <li> Is very painful and the result is only for two days also you need crems .&lt;br /&gt;Good luck for who wants to try</li>
    <li> I was very nervous before I began using the derma roller on my face since I have a slight needle phobia that I am working on. I was extra careful and followed all the instructions and tips that came with it since I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. After the first roll I was completely fine I felt it, but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable. I rolled it on my cheeks forhead and chin to help with some scars and wrinkles. I really like the results I have seen so far. My skin is looking very fresh and after a few days off it has a nice dewy glow. Side note: I recommend looking into some quality products to apply to your skin afterward since that is when you can get the most out if the product since your skin will absorb so much more of it. I am going to be repeating the process a few more times over the next couple of weeks and look forward to seeing more results! I would definitely recommend this derma roller especially if you feel your skin needs some freshening up! The customer service is amazing and the product ships quickly so you don&#x27;t have to wait to start looking wonderful.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product working as announced. I&#x27;m still using. But, look like good.</li>
    <li> I have been using the smaller Derma Roller Kit on a fatty tumor on my forearm for about six months. I am so happy with this treatment that I recently upgraded to the larger Derma Roller.  After showering, I just roll the larger Derma Roller over the area a few times (I know &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34;--but this does not hurt!).  Next, I apply some essential oils and moisturizers to the area. I can actually feel the pores in my skin opening to allow the healing to begin.  I found the Derma Roller package directions and on-line customer service extremely helpful and my new Derma Roller arrived only a few days after I ordered it.  I am excited to continue this healthful skin surface treatment for fatty tumors.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most WILD product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Some people would probably think I&#x27;m nuts if they saw this little gadget...&amp; think I&#x27;d lost my mind-lol.  It kinda looks like a self toture device - haha.  So, why use a roller full of needles???  For me, it&#x27;s simple. I will do/try ANYTHING to prevent having to ever go under the knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My story: I suffered an extreme loss back in May...lost a lot of weight...my hair was thinning/falling out...&amp; I am still crying quite a bit.  Due to all of that...I have SUPER puffy eyes...cry lines...&amp; my arms got scary and saggy...along w/ my neck :(  Since I was so fit...I lost a lot of muscle mass. It was bad!  I wasn&#x27;t taking care of myself...but, sometimes when you lose a loved one...it&#x27;s hard to learn how to cope. When the reality of my health slapped me in the face...damage had already been done. My cheeks were sunken in...face looked sad &amp; saggy...along w/ my arms (saggy where they bend in the middle)...&amp; eyes super puffy. Yes, I hated looking in the mirror!  I was also told that when you lose a lot of weight too quickly that your skin loses its elasticity. Apparently, it has something to do w/ the fact that you&#x27;re body can&#x27;t produce collagen fast enough to keep up w/ rapid weight loss...essentially your skin loses the ability to build the collagen to keep it taut/tight.  That made me feel like...is there any hope??? I went back into training...w/ the help of my father...I was soooo weak! The goal -- rebuild my muscles...so I started eating more...trying to take care of myself from the inside out.  It&#x27;s been a loooong road...but, I am now stronger physically than I ever have been...but, the elasticity is still an issue...along w/ some lines (smile lines).  I figured...what the heck...I&#x27;ll try this little gadget &amp; pray for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the derma roller 3 times so far...but I can see a change in the color of my skin.  I didn&#x27;t push hard the first time I used it...so it felt more likea tickle-lol.  And...yes...I used it EVERYWHERE!!!  I used emFACEize on my face w/ their mezmereyes which worked perfectly...&amp; for my body, I used  nivea coq10 after my first time... that kinda burned.  The 2nd time (on my body) I used vaseline w/ aloe on my body...that was a little better.  The 3rd time I used Trader Joe&#x27;s vitamin e &amp; coconut oil...&amp; liked that a lot better.  It&#x27;s kinda wild how when you go to put lotion/oil on after...it&#x27;s like your skin soaks it up soooo quickly. Derma rolling will NOT hurt unless you use serious pressue.  Believe me...I&#x27;ve done it - lol.  I am an instant gratification kinda girl.  I used more pressure my 2nd use...and even more my 3rd (it was kinda painful).  With that said...remember...I&#x27;m trying to fix over a month of not taking care of myself.  I pushed so hard that I looked like I had a sun burn that night. I&#x27;ve had no bad effects...just kinda itched.  I have to admit...I like the next day how my skin looks...it has a nice color.  I know it&#x27;s still to soon to notice tons...but, I&#x27;ve noticed on my lower legs that it seems to make those irritatting holes/pores (from shaving) disappear.  Thank you derma roller!  All I&#x27;ve noticed is the clarity...or color of my skin...so far.  However, I feel it will help fix my scary saggy arms...&amp; super puffy eyes.  If you&#x27;re nervous...don&#x27;t worry!  You don&#x27;t have to push hard on the roller...if you don&#x27;t push hard...it just tickles :)  And...believe me...I&#x27;d tell ya! After all...I did use it over my ENTIRE body - lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose trying the derma roller...it&#x27;s satisfaction guaranteed :)  I have to tell you...the customer service is AMAZING!!! They are sooo wonderful!  If you email them, they will respond to you w/in the day...usually w/in an hour or two.  One of the workers seems like family to me...I &amp;#60;3 her!!! I tell her my crazyiness - haha...&amp; we just laugh.  Idk if they&#x27;ve ever had a customer use the derma roller from head to toe...but, heck...why not try it!?!  I use my derma roller 2 times a week.  I can tell when my face has healed...b/c I don&#x27;t feel it tingle when I rub my face/put on lotion.  I kinda like the tingling...makes me feel like the derma roller is really working - YAY!  I will continue to use it...&amp; update you as things continue to change...that way you can see the time line...how many weeks it takes to fix certain issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck...&amp; God bless!</li>
    <li> I am SO impressed with their customer service!  I got my new Derma Roller a day sooner than expected!  The product is awesome and I&#x27;m excited!</li>
    <li> I really love this Derma Roller Kit. I&#x27;m currently using is to minimize a scar on my arm that occured from a burn. I used it according the directions that came with the product and then applied Frankinsence essential oil to the area. I look forward to seeing great results from using the Dermaroller consistently!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It is a bit painful with first use. With second use the skin seemed to be a little less sensitive to the roller. Redness and sensitivity was apparent for 24 hours after using roll. When trying for the first time use the 1.0 roller.</li>
    <li> This is really nice...will have to re order</li>
    <li> My friend swears by it! Glad to gift her a new one.</li>
    <li> This roller is awesome! I have noticed that my skin is much brighter and healthier looking. I have been using it once a week. After each use, my face is quite red. I usually put on an awesome moisturizer and no makeup for at least 12 hours. The next morning my skin looks great. The company that sells this has incredible customer service and gives great tips for use of the product. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I have used this roller a few times, each attachment a few times to be specific.  I&#x27;m intrigued and liking the results so far.  I did notice I have to be really careful about changing roller heads so I&#x27;m not sure a single handle with multiple attachments is the best way to if saving some space isn&#x27;t priority.  Update&gt;&gt;&gt;  I just used this set again and have to say that changing rollers/heads was a breeze so I guess I just needed a chance to get a feel for it.  The 1.0 is especially easy since you can keep it in the little case while you snap it together and then can return it to the case before pressing the release button to separate it.  I also tried another brand roller (in a different needle size) for comparison and even though I thought it would be insignificant, I ended up appreciating the handle grip and angle of this one a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first use of the roller was interesting.  I was momentarily surprised at the sensation.  It wasn&#x27;t painful but I can&#x27;t say it tickled either.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble completing the task or repeating it later when it was time for next treatment.  I noticed my skin is really dry for a while after using it, even using serum and lotion so I don&#x27;t use it if I have a special occasion in the next day or two.  Update&gt;&gt;&gt; A few sun-created freckles on my face have definitely faded and some forehead creases are looking much less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stretchmarks and so far the roller seems to be changing them, tightening them up somehow.  I was a bit shocked at first when they old marks were bright red the next day but that faded and I knew to be ready for it next time.  I am really looking forward to seeing how much they might reduce by Summer.</li>
    <li> The dermicare made it worse than it already was because the needles made my skin darker than they were infact I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who wants to get rid of stretch marks or have more radiant skin</li>
    <li> Only tried once in small area. It works really well. Instruction are very clear and eay to understand. Excitied to start my regular use of the derma roller. The only problem I have to solve is coming up is planning a weekly routine that follows the instructions: You are to wait at least 12 hours before applying make-up after use.</li>
    <li> Great well made product. Easy ordering, prompt shipping. Works as expected. Dermarolling helps my acne scars and overall skin appearance.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Easy to use with great directions on how to use it properly.  I am still waiting for noticeable results…it has only been two weeks of use.</li>
    <li> Hello! Encourage me to write this review because this product really works.  I start using the derma roller one month ago, weekly and have seen a reduction in the appearance of my strech marks.</li>
    <li> i was a little hesitant to do my first session of derma rolling because my skin is very sensitive but it was not at all what I expected. I noticed the difference in my skin after the first week of use. Puruskin provided me with all the information I needed and the customer service is great...feels like I have a personal derma roller tech helping me along my sessions. Would totally recommend this product</li>
    <li> I like how this operates came on time I have been using it for about a month and is all of what I hoped for</li>
    <li> Once I got used to controlling the pressure and consistency I fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;I use it every couple of nights. Sanitizing with strong rubbing alcohol is crucial and also a full nights recovery after a session! One more thing, no products that are irritating until the next morning, but a good natural moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I brought this product  a couple of weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t seen a great deal of change as of yet but I remain  hopeful, so for now the 3 star rating will remain (because of the easiness and the through instructions that I received) I will post again in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Pretty unique product! I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before so I was a little apprehensive about the needles. But once I tried it, it was pretty cool. All those little needles leave you with quite the tingly feeling while you use it and shortly after. The rollers are easy to use, switch out and clean. I don&#x27;t use any really expensive skin products but just use a non scented dermatologist recommended lotion. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin absorbed the lotion better and stayed soft for a lot longer when I used it with the roller.  I&#x27;m excited to keep using my derma roller.</li>
    <li> I buy everything on Amazon, yet rarely leave reviews. This product, however, is review worthy. I researched a lot of the different derma rollers on Amazon before getting this one. I liked that there were two head sizes in one, and unlike some of the other products, it was very clear about a full money back guarantee if the product didn&#x27;t do anything. This isn&#x27;t a time sensitive money back guarantee, it is a ten use(which is good for me, because I tend to procrastinate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon ordering, I received an email from the company with a link to their e-book which has been very helpful. I also decided to take a look at their website which has a lot of recommendations for great products on Amazon to use with the derma roller. It&#x27;s nice when the research is already done for you. After my derma roller arrived, I received another email from the company with tips for caring for your skin and reassurance of their support and desire for 100% satisfaction. In all my years using Amazon, I have never had so much customer support for a product. I feel like if there was a problem, they would do everything in their power to make it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, there have been no problems. The product was packaged nicely with an instruction booklet included. I was gearing up for pain, but the pain is very bearable. This isn&#x27;t the type of thing where you receive results overnight, but after just a couple of uses I have noticed that my skin feels more hydrated and full. I&#x27;m excited to see the difference it will make after using it for a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, excellent customer support!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I had serious doubts about seeing any kind of results for my stretch marks, they were very deep trenched, and silvery in color, but now, thanks to this product and 100% argan oil, they&#x27;ve very near vanished; and I&#x27;ve only used it about 6-9 times! I wish I would have taken before and after pictures to prove how great it works. Also, if any of you are concerned about it being painful let me just go ahead and tell you that it is not, I read reviews that stated that it was this god-awful feeling but, as long as you use some sort of oil it&#x27;s fine, I would recommend 100% Pure Argan Oil Organic. Thanks :)</li>
    <li> I love it, awesome product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  Did exactly what it claimed.  I could see a difference after first use.  Would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I waited to post a review until I had used this product, as I felt it was not realistic, nor honest to due so upon arrival of the Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;There are significant improvements that have been noticed by not only me, but friend who I had not seen since the holiday season. My skin appears more taut and by nature, I have larger pores. There has also been a reduction in pore size, which I am thrilled by.&lt;br /&gt;Each individual is unique, and I can only share my experience with this product, which has been very positive.</li>
    <li> I purchased a derma roller in the past and used it one time. It was a trial run on some scars on my leg before I attempted it on my face. It left me with scratches as well as little punctures, and after all that went away I didnt notice any difference so it just sat in my bathroom cabinet taking up space. I decided to try again, and bought this *better quality* roller. I like that it has two heads so I can try it one for my cellulite and the other for the acne scars. I did a trial run and was impressed by how much better this one was, no scratches! So I tried it on my face. I did hear the popping sound of it going into my skin.I did not use any numbing cream, and it was not very painful but I did bleed a little.  After I was done my face was very red and I started to freak out about having to go into work the next day. I held a cold compress to my face for 20 mins and all of the redness subsided and I was back to normal. The next day my scars looked improved but I knew that it was from the swelling. A few days later and I am back to normal. Derma rolling is something that takes time, and I am not ready to give up just yet. I think it is helping diminish the hyper-pigmentation from post inflammatory acne (red marks). I am still hopeful that dermarolling and the collagen peptides I&#x27;ve been taking will improve my troubled skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty impressed with results so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing a improvement yet I have used this derma roller 5 times so I&#x27;ll be increasing my derma rolling skin care regimen to 2 times a week Along with Hyaluronic Acid Raw Biology Organic Vitamin C professional grade kit. The kit has not given me any results either which I wrote review and I will update my review since I will need to finish up using that product until it&#x27;s empty...I don&#x27;t like throwing my money away. So, I&#x27;ll continue to use this Derma Roller along with same skin care regimen (Raw Biology Hyaluronic Acid Organic Professional Grade Kit - organic Vitamin C,  Premium Retinol 2.5%&amp;Vitamin E, Hyaluronic Acid &amp;Vitamin C) that I&#x27;ve been using  until that product is gone. As for the switching roller heads from face to body roller use a thick cloth like a dry wash cloth so you can hold onto to it to place onto handle or you will hurt yourself like I did because this product only comes with one handle and the body roller is on it when you receive it and the face roller is separate and it&#x27;s just the roller so you will have to place it on handle carefully by using a thick dry cloth. I was not pleased with that reason. You would think they would provide the face roller on a handle as well but they Do Not.  Also, there are No Instructions on how to switch rollers from body to face roller onto handle.  I had to figured it out on my own by using a dry washcloth. Do Not Attempt to do try and hold roller in your hand without a cloth when switching from body roller to face roller onto handle because you will hurt yourself and bleed.  Also, I did notice with face roller it sticks sometimes when rolling on face.  I&#x27;ve been using this 5 times with skin care regimen and no improvement as of yet so I&#x27;m increasing my Puruskin Derma Roller use to 2 times a week with skin care regimen products that I use morning and before bed..  I will be back to update this review in 4 weeks to see if I see any results fingers crossed I will with both products.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the derma roller for a short time but I do notice a difference in the absorption of the face products that I apply after using it.  Also I haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or bleeding with the derma roller.  And the customer service is great!!!  They actually contacted me to see how I was doing with the derma roller. Great company and a great product!!!</li>
    <li> The derma roller is amazing!  I have never used anything like it before and I cannot believe how quickly I saw results!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very much yet but I could see a bit of a difference already. Make sure to use lotion or bio oil.</li>
    <li> First of all, the pkg arrived via mail in just a matter of a few days. Awesome!! In Hawaii, that&#x27;s not always the case.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using this product for abt a month now on only half of my face to see if I could tell the difference.  Without telling my family which half of the face I used the product on, I had them take a close look to see if they noticed a difference... YES!!!  The smile lines around my eyes &amp; mouth are definitely less defined.  It is important to note that I used the derma roller every other night after showering &amp; then followed up w/ an anti-aging cream.  Though the derma roller was slightly uncomfortable &amp; left me somewhat itchy afterwards, I found that the cream helped decrease that discomfort.  I think the product will continue to prove successful for me.&lt;br /&gt;I also spent a few minutes looking at other reviews and am impressed with Karyn &amp; her replies to all customers 5 star or not.  All replies were genuine &amp; gave helpful hints for better results.  That helps make a product worth trying... when the seller takes the time to help each individual.  I look forward to moving on to cellulite &amp; scars from child-bearing:) Can&#x27;t wait for more results!!!</li>
    <li> i love this product it clear  up my acne scars they are almost 100% gone</li>
    <li> I got this a couple weeks ago and I used  it twice..I can already see changes to my acne scars and discolorations.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the 1.0mm on my face about 3 times now since 01-10-15. I saw a big difference after the first treatment. However, due to the severity of my acne scarring, I need the 1.5mm. I can&#x27;t wait to use it. I do recommend this product. Just please be sure to do your research so you&#x27;ll know what you need.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed my Derma Roller so far.  I am excited to see the changes as I use it!  I like that both heads came together and they are so easy to switch out.  It is quick and easy to use.  Great Experience All Around. Thank You</li>
    <li> I have used the derma roller on some of my scars and have noticed that they are getting lighter and less visible!  I just had a baby and look forward to seeing how it helps my stretch marks!  I am happy with the results I have seen so far!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great price! I&#x27;ve used it twice and I already see improvements!</li>
    <li> I have a red scar on my arm.. I used if for 3 weeks off and on and followed it with some essential oils.  The red is greatly diminished.  I is almost gone. I believe this worked really well.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I bought this to use on some stretch marks that I have had for 23 years, that I got from my first pregnancy. I have tried everything to at least improve the look of them, all to no avail.  I have been using the derma roller twice a week for a couple weeks now and Omg.... I can actually see an improvement!!! I am currently using it with vitamin E oil but plan to try it with vitamin C cream as well. I will keep using this as I am amazed by the results.  I did not find its use painful, a bit uncomfortable maybe.. but not painful. Give it a try, I don&#x60;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, clean. Instructions are easy to understand. Only problem is removing heads. I think it&#x27;s the one I received, it takes me about 10 minutes to remove and because of that I don&#x27;t use this derma roller often. I&#x27;ve use it twice and I had it for a while.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, well packaged - but, I was too afraid to use it and pitched it.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try, it sure couldn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m really glad I did. My skin seems to be getting firmer. I did buy the Hyaluronic Acid Vitamin C Serum they recommend. I think the two seem to compliment each other. I am happy with this purchase and will continue to use both and hope that my skin keeps looking younger, firmer and keeps the rosy color I have gotten from my rolling treatments. Also, I think it feels good. It feels like my skin is working on repairing and not just hanging on.</li>
    <li> Great friendly customer service!  I received the Derna Roller and I can really tell a difference when I use it as recommended.  Especially helps by NEO Retinol cream and Bio Serum work better!  Recommend!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful!! My mom tried it as well and loved it! My skin looks smoother!</li>
    <li> OK. don&#x27;t see the difference. Maybe I should use it more often!</li>
    <li> Coming to my skin type,mine is always oily,dull and have some pimple scars.Came across this product accidentally and after a lot of research concluded to buy a dermaroller from puruskin. I had received this product last monday which was on Oct 12th and used it twice with 1 mm roller on face. Unbelievable!! There is a visible difference in my skin tone with only 2 uses. My face has become bright,fresh, with visible reduction of blackheads,blackspots ! Had never been this satisfied with any beauty products! I love this product a lot!! Thanks to puruskin for giving such a nice product !</li>
    <li> ok I had to wait a little bit on using this and its been about a week and a half and I have to say , WOW I AM IMPRESSED!! it is softening lines on my face and between my eyes and I also have a scar on my face that is also softening . I am defiantly going to be buying more of this product. I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but I NEEDED TO DO THIS ONE3 .. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Works very well and is easy to use, but definitely need numbing cream first.</li>
    <li> I was terrified at the idea of punturing my skin with tiny needles, but honestly it was far different from what I expected. It does NOT hurt! I even pushed down harder cause I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it right. I was expecting to feel the tiny pokes as I rolled it over my skin, nothing! It feels prickly. I did draw some blood, but thats normal. I will continue to use the derma roller, and am excited to see results in the future.</li>
    <li> I love love love love my derma roller!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month and I&#x27;m seeing great results.</li>
    <li> Good product good condition</li>
    <li> I used it once and waited the whole week with anticipation to use it again. I already see an improvement in my skin. Read the directions and watch their video so you know what to do and what to look for during the aftermath of the session, foolproof. Also, gather all supplies first so that you have the alcohol for disinfecting the roller after use.</li>
    <li> I know derma rolling works because I&#x27;ve seen it reduce stretch marks. It takes time, it isn&#x27;t overnight. I ordered this for my mom, but I like the design and so I&#x27;m going to take this one and order another one for her. I REALLY like having a big roller because I can get done fast. I didn&#x27;t pay attention and I thought I was getting 2 separate rollers, but it&#x27;s one handle with an interchangeable head. I like it better than my old roller from another company.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the roller for a couple of weeks now, and I can really see a difference in my skin. I used the large roller (2) on my buttocks and thighs for cellulite reduction. After rolling, I&#x27;ve been applying the it works defining gel. I&#x27;ve really seen an improvement on my deep cellulite! Even recommended this to several of my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the small head for my face, and I really like the way my skin feels after rolling and applying hyaluronic acid and La Mer moisturizing cream afterward. After my first treatment, my Pilates instructor complimented me on how smooth my face looked! It literally softened my appearance overnight!  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The pink roller broke off the handle within 2 days of using it.</li>
    <li> Started one week ago, hoping for good success. I use 2 or 3 times a day then apply oils.</li>
    <li> I have had six fractional laser treatments over the last four years, the last one two months ago.  I am seeing better results after using this derma roller ten times, than I saw with the last laser treatment. Wish I had found this product sooner!</li>
    <li> This may be the single best online buying experience I have ever had. Not only is the product amazing, but the customer service has been nothing short of outstanding! Since it takes time to see results, it is  a bit too soon to leave an accurate review of how derma rolling is working for me (I have only had the opportunity to use it twice since purchase). However, I can say that I have already noticed my skin is a bit firmer and has an overall better glow. I have every confidence it will just keep getting better from here. I have been recommending this product to everyone I know that I think would benefit from it and I would certainly recommend it to any one here on Amazon contemplating derma rolling.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Ordering a second set for my daughter to try. It works.</li>
    <li> Great product...!! Seeing results. Stretch marks are starting to fade!!! Yay!!!</li>
    <li> I have used other derma rollers, but so far this one is the BEST.  You will be amazed at how much better your skin looks after using the derma roller by Puruskin.  I used it even on the back of my hands to continue to promote a healthy look.</li>
    <li> shipping fast,very good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely amazed by this product! Great customer service and very quick shipping. I&#x27;ve used it five times so far. Using it about once a week. After the third use I started to notice a huge difference in scars and very old stretch marks from growth spurts. Some are almost completely gone. Even the texture and tone has also improved. I&#x27;ve tried many things to help with scars and by far this has been the most drastically improving techniques. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what another five treatments will do!</li>
    <li> Well, today was my first time really hurt, but it shows that actually works as it should, well I buy latex gloves, alcohol, tissue paper, and creams of first quality</li>
    <li> For the price I figured I&#x27;d give this a try, the product/service is advertized at one of my favorite medspas so there must be some truth to the promises.  Very simple tool and equally simple to use.  Not really painful in my opinion but you certainly know there are needles being rolled over your skin.  Immediate reaction was nothing- no marks no swelling.  It was only hours later that the &amp;#34;track marks&amp;#34; came up - little red dotted lines where I had rolled the device.  Lucky for me I tried this on the upper thigh out of common sight for the winter. Not sure how long they will last.  Slight swelling around those areas, which, to me signals the healing mechanism is at work and that usually does result in new collagen if all the dermatological sites are correct.&lt;br /&gt;Currently I can&#x27;t say if the therapy works yet but the product certainly is in its mechanical description, just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I love this derma roller! Well constructed and easy to use. After one use my skin feels softer and I am addicted. I can&#x27;t wait to see long term results. Already recommended it to my friends and they love it too.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a couple of weeks and have noticed a difference in my thighs. They seem to have firmed up a little more with less cellulite noticeable. I haven&#x27;t noticed to much on my face yet. Hopefully future usage on the face area will start to see a difference.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is easy too use, to clean, to switch between rollers.  I was a little hesitant to use it but after the first treatment my fears went by the wayside.  The tingling sensation I found to be pleasant and I am looking forward to contined improvement on my face and body.  Puruskin&#x27;s customer service is five star too.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, easy to use....I have used it twice and love it so far....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this on my face once so far. Drew a little blood and it was painful, but I expected that, so it was fine. I feel like even just a few days later my skin does seem smoother and firmer. Will use again soon.</li>
    <li> Barely started regimen n barely starting to see results. Will report back as results are become more promenant.</li>
    <li> I like the roller and see a little change and waiting as time passes to see super results.. Neat tool, just need the time to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my roller about 3 times now and I have noticed that my stretch marks are lighter. I&#x27;ve had them for 10+ years and they were white/grey. Some are lifting faster than others, but that&#x27;s because some are longer and thicker. I&#x27;ve decided to start using the roller twice a week now instead of once and I do expect to see a lot more progress within the weeks to come.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this gadget for anti aging, I&#x27;ve been using dermarollers for yrs and they definitely work, it&#x27;s great for scaring and keeping my skin looking glowing &amp; plump! First time I&#x27;ve used this company and I&#x27;m very happy, they sent me lots of useful info and gave me one free. It does hurt and you won&#x27;t see the full effect until 3 months from now when your skin has renewed, but stick with it. And roll on a regular basis. You&#x27;ll love the results. No pain no gain!</li>
    <li> I like the roller but I think it really should come with a container(s) one can use for disinfecting the microneedel rollerheads! That would earn the product all the 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have acne, and I was a little skeptical at first because I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything for my problem skin. However I like what I&#x27;ve seen so far using this product. My skin seems smoother, pores diminished, and less blackheads. The first day after using it my skin was raw and sensitive, but that cleared up after 24 hours and my skin looked better than it had in years. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I used the derma roller for the first time last night on some stretch marks i had developed about 2 or 3 weeks ago. It has already evened out my skin, and the marks already look lighter. You can only use the 1.5 needle once every 4-6 weeks so i have to wait a while before using it again, but i&#x27;m super excited to do so. Also, the company gives you a discount on their Argan Oil which is super nice. I can&#x27;t wait until it comes in. I love this so far, i will hopefully post pictures soon of how my marks have transformed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my dermaroller, so far is working great for me I have been using it for a while and I&#x27;m seeing results.  Great product</li>
    <li> I purchased the Puruskin Derma Roller for the first time one week ago. I have used it three times this week, the first time I was very careful not to push too hard so I could see how my skin would react to the roller. The second time it was better and I was more confident and last night I was more aggressive with the roller. I didn&#x27;t use numbing cream because I wanted to be aware of the pressure I was using. I looked like I had a sunburn afterwards and it did sting a bit but the sting gave way to tingling and the redness remained. I was able to put a little makeup on this morning, my face is peeling a little already, but not bad. I have great faith in the product and I have tried everything under the sun. I can&#x27;t really afford to go to a spa or plastic surgeons office for services so this is perfect. My advice, buy it, use care, common sense and follow the ample directions given to you in the ebook, you can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cindy B</li>
    <li> This device is amazing! I work in a dermatology office and everybody is asking me what am I  doing to my face!&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it a couple times and I already saw a difference in my skin. It looks younger and brighter and I don&#x27;t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get it! Thanks Derma Roller!</li>
    <li> I love this company.  I buy from Amazon all the time but this is certainly one of the best customer care, follow ups etc that I have had with companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the products...seems to be great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice..it really doesn&#x27;t hurt and I am a wimp w pain.  I can already see the tone in my face has changed and some diminishment of a few dark spots.</li>
    <li> I am still reviewing this product. In menopause (post) I experienced  hair thinning in my crown area. Along with Rogaine and the Derma Roller the results were very pleasing. I will continue use this product on my scalp area for it also relived me of flakiness.  Also I had these dark spots from my glasses for about three years. I rolled the Derma Roller on that area and in two week gone!</li>
    <li> Got this for a low cost and it&#x27;s okay I guess..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this purchase. The rollers appear to be high quality for a very reasonable price. There is a learning curve for using the rollers, but it is not difficult. I pull loose skin tault and don&#x27;t press too hard over bony areas. The needles are sharp and clean cutting as opposed to reviews for other products which comment that the needles catch or snag. The sensation can be uncomfortable, but now, after a couple of weeks of use, it is a rather pleasant feeling like a good scratching. Be careful not to change direction before lifting the roller from the skin! As far as results, I don&#x27;t know yet but am being patient and consistent....</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly and it is exactly what I expected. Thank you! Can&#x27;t comment on the longterm results yet but optimistic</li>
    <li> can we use this derma roller for hair</li>
    <li> It usually takes sometime to see results from a body derma roller. So far, so good. I endorse this product</li>
    <li> I dont usually write reviews, but everyone must know how awesome derma rolling is! If you are considering adding this to your routine, just do it. You wont regret it. It is uncomfortable at first but once you see results, its so worth it. My acne scars are fading significantly and my skin looks healthier overall. I wouldnt say it is painful(only on your forehead)this is the 2nd roller Ive ever purchased. My first one stopped rolling easily after only a few uses. Only reason I didnt give it a 5 star is because it is inconvenient to store. Since it has 2 heads, there isnt anywhere to store the 2nd one so its just somewhere in my draw... It would be nice to have a big enough container for both heads.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using on stretch marks for 2 months on abdomen.She began  5 times per week and now about 3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;She would describe her stretch marks as road tire marks since they were very deep, rough and purple.Now they are smoother and evening out no longer purple more the white color and some are  dramatically better.She has been using in conjuction with a mix of 50/50 pure cocoa butter and shea butter alternating days with argan oil(after 4 kids thats pretty amazing she says, granted I love her stretch marks and all)&lt;br /&gt;She will continue to use it eventhough I think she is nuts, just looking at the needles creeps me out but given the results and how happy she is I give this product 5*****.</li>
    <li> I have you this for a month and haven&#x27;t notice in changes in my stretch marks yet. It&#x27;s still early so I gave it a 3 star. Will update in a few months and see if there&#x27;s any changes. The roller is great quality and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> It is a nuisance yo use it, plus in my case at least it did not provided the results expected. I ended up with damaged skin that luckily peeled off after a few days. Returning it...</li>
    <li> Excellent product and exceptional instructions and support</li>
    <li> Good product. I do see difference in pigmentation of my skin. I will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> I am so bad it is not work good and I did not get abook l sent mor time and no ansar me. Iam thenk the book whith the derma roller put it is not ,I am so so bad</li>
    <li> I bought this in early December. I just used it for the first time 2 nights ago. I was a little nervous not knowing what to expect and with the holidays coming up. It was not painful in my opinion just slightly uncomfortable. My skin was smoother the next day. I also have (had?) a broken capillary on the tip of my nose. It was so red even makeup wouldn&#x27;t cover it. I know this is hard to believe after only 1 use but it&#x27;s barely visible now. I can&#x27;t wait to keep using it and see how my skin looks in a few weeks &amp; months. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have waited so long to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company has the best customer service which is unheard of these days.</li>
    <li> I love this Derma Roller!  I had never heard of this -so of course, I had to Google it.  I finally got up the nerve to try it-no blood-that&#x27;s what scared me most-or making my face look worse!  I love the feeling &amp; my vitamin C oil soaked in so fast instead of just sitting there.  I will be using this!  I am using every 4th day &amp; love the way this gives my face some color. Really!  No phony looking make-up or blush!  I am going to start on my saggy arms along with exercise.  This roller has given me some encouragement to my 65 year old mind.  I needed a boost this cold gloomy winter &amp; this is it. Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> I have used this for the past 2 weeks and I was skeptical when I first received it having never used anything like this before.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised that it has actually tightened my skin.  I will continue to use this every few days like I have and I will update my review after I use it longer.  Pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Derma Roller since March 19th. I roll using the 1.5 mm head once every two weeks (twice a month.) I&#x27;ve had my stretch marks since I was in 7th or 8th grade. After rolling I use an oil mix that contains 20% Vitamin C, Castor Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Apricot Oil, Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E Oil, Hyauloric Acid, etc. I moisturize once day sometimes twice. I don&#x27;t hear popping noises when I roll it over my skin as I&#x27;d like to but that doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not working. The reason being I don&#x27;t hear the popping noises is because my skin isn&#x27;t moist &amp; hydrated enough. Once I continue to moisturize my skin, hopefully I&#x27;ll hear popping noises. I have noticed an overall smoothness in my skin &amp; stretch marks though. I do wish that the head was a little bigger because it does take me a while to roll it over all of the areas. I look forward to keep using the Derma Roller &amp; see what my results will look like later down the road. Overall it&#x27;s a good product 😊</li>
    <li> While I haven&#x27;t been using this a long enough time to see huge results yet (the representative who contacted me said it&#x27;ll take about 2 months) I have seen some small but rapid changes in the short period of time I&#x27;ve been using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last month I burned a section of my arm on the edge of an iron I didn&#x27;t know was hot. The scar wouldn&#x27;t bother me much except it&#x27;s right through my birthmark and I&#x27;m oddly attached to my birthmark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a condition called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Some of the symptoms of PCOS is excessive, dark facial and body hair, and stretch marks. I have to tweeze/wax my chin a lot and many of the hairs come back ingrown. I&#x27;ve been using it on my chin and noticed that in the short period of time I&#x27;ve had it (ordered on Apirl 21st, 2015, came about the 26th) that many of the hairs are no longer ingrown and removal is easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had a bright red shaving scar on my right leg where I had taken out about a dime size chunk of skin. I&#x27;ve used it there a few times, not as often as my arm, stretch marks, and chin, and in a couple of days it started to peel and is now much lighter in color. The scar on my arm is also not as red as it was, though it&#x27;s still noticeable, at least to me. But you know how that is, you rarely notice changes in yourself, it takes others to point them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No difference in my stretch marks yet. But they&#x27;re large and there&#x27;s a lot of them. I&#x27;m trying to start on the areas where they&#x27;re the worse. Even if they don&#x27;t totally go away it would be nice if they were a little less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I love this! it comes with instructions and different sized heads. This really opens my skin up for moisturizing and invigorates it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt. its quite easy to use and although I got a discount on this for reviewing purposes,  I purchased another at full price for a gift. I love it!</li>
    <li> I was both apprehensive &amp; excited to try the Derma roller. I thought it would hurt but it was more irritating. I used it all over my face. Now that I&#x27;m over the anxiety I plan on using it in other areas. My face feels slightly burnt but that&#x27;s about it. I will keep you updated!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like receiving emails urging me to write reviews about items I&#x27;ve barely had a chance to use.  I got the Derma Roller for Christmas so have only used it for a month.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s improving the skin on my face but I have seen improvement on a scar on my upper thigh from two different surgeries using the same incision site.  The scar is smoother and less visible.</li>
    <li> NOT sure yet.  Used it 3 times in the past few weeks.  Hurts so I use it in small sections at a time. My face reddens and bleeds little here and there. Lol makes me laugh writing this&amp;#34;who in their right mind? &amp;#34; well. A woman trying to gain a part of her youth. I do this at night as it says not to apply makeup for 12hours afterward. Nothing remarkable at this point.  Haven&#x27;t gotten the courage to do my baby gut full of stretch marks!  And I hide my face scrapings from my husband or he&#x27;d start singing crazy songs at me</li>
    <li> Great product! I am very excited about the results!</li>
    <li> This was a great investment for me. I can see a difference in the fine wrinkles in my skin, especially between my eyebrows and around my mouth, mainly the laugh lines. I would recommend this product and would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The product caused hyperpigmentation on the areas where I have post partum stretch marks. Now I have to use a skin lightening cream. Caution on African-American skin.</li>
    <li> This tool helped diminish the appearance of acne scars!!! It works. People are asking me what I am doing different to my skin, I just tell them about the Derma Roller.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit with everything you need to get started. I searched for a couple weeks before making the decision to purchase this kit. It comes with a step by step e-book that should answer most your questions about derma rolling. Be careful though as I went to pull the small roller out of the container and sliced my finger. The needles are super sharp.  Too soon to tell if it works, but it was easy to do and it really did not hurt. Will update again after I tried it a few months.</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive,  so the first 2 times I used it, I was cautious.  The third time I used the 1.5mm on my face and I can tell that the results will be better.  I know I am learning how to use it and I am excited about the results.</li>
    <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t hurt</li>
    <li> Best little device I have ever purchased!  My pores are smaller, my skin is tighter and my face feels plumped and refreshed. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times so far. I apply Eminence Firm Skin Masque and leave it on while I roll, wash it off afterwards then apply Eminence Recovery Oil.  I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it and I even bought one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. I use it in conjunction with my favorite creams. the instructions were clear and realistic. The two different head sizes were a plus. It came quickly after I had ordered it and it feels good after a few sessions. I use it twice a week. I&#x27;ll post again in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> After just three weeks of using the Derma Roller I can&#x27;t believe the change in my skin!  This product has exceeded my expectations and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!</li>
    <li> Used for the month and did not get to the desired result</li>
    <li> I ordered this after I had lunch with a friend and her skin looked AMAZING!! I said what are you doing that your skin looks so good? She said I bought a Derma Roller. So I went on line and ordered me one. I have only used it twice, but I can already see that my skin looks better. As a matter of fact I ran into an old friend in the Grocery store. He looked at me and said Wow you look so young!! That did it for me! I was hooked!!! Also, I didn&#x27;t have any pain or discomfort. I mean its little needles, I knew I would have some feeling from it, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas and have only used it twice so far. BUT, my pores already look smaller and my face seems a bit smoother where I was getting some crepey skin!  If that&#x27;s all it does, then money well spent!  I TRIED to use a tattoo cream to numb my face, but it caught my face on FIRE and I had to wipe it off immediately! ugh! Then I had to wait for my face to heal from the burns!  I do have really sensitive skin though.  So I just derma rolled without numbing cream.  I pressed hard enough to bleed in several places and could hear the needles poking in my skin.  It actually wasn&#x27;t intolerable, just uncomfortable.  Definitely had a red face that whole day (sensitive skin, remember?) but was right as rain the next day! Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice and saw some improvements however my stretch marks are deep so I might need laser treatment. All in all, it works.</li>
    <li> High quality and prompt delivery!!!</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used the roller twice. First time I used it wasn&#x27;t so bad. I only bled a little in a few places and its because I didn&#x27;t press down much. Didn&#x27;t really see any difference in my skin. Second time I tried this week I rolled with more pressure. I bled in more places then last time. Today is the third day since rolling and I&#x27;m a little worried. My face has a lot of red bumps. They sort of look like I have severe acne on my cheeks. I do not have sensitive skin and the first time did not cause any bumps. I hope they go away. But so far I am not liking this product. I&#x27;ll be back in a week for an update.    UPDATE: Ok so it took a few days about a week for my skin to clear. Maybe I was too aggressive the second time around? not sure but its cleared now and my skin does have a nicer glow to it. I do like the end result but im not sure if im going to use it again so aggressively. When I broke out what looked like really bad acne, I was just wishing for my old skin again, lol. Yes dramatic but I was really worried. So I will try again weekly in a gentle way.</li>
    <li> Only used it 2 times. Great product!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but I like it !</li>
    <li> I have several different types of derma rollers but these blow the others out of the water.&lt;br /&gt;First, they are the sharpest of all the rollers I have tried but the real test came when I used them.  You must be more gentle when rolling with these but the results are amazing.  I have a slight scar down my cheek from a melanoma removal and it is barely visible after using this roller.  My pores also appear to be disappearing slowly - never thought that would happen given the size of them on the sides of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t braved the body roller yet but given the results on my face after just a few uses, I can&#x27;t see it not working the same.&lt;br /&gt;Again, be careful ... THESE ARE REALLY SHARP!  I guess no pain, no gain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times so I dont know how the results will be but it came as described in very nice packaging. Everything was sealed and brand new. The customer support for the product is great! I would definitely buy this from this company again.</li>
    <li> I think it is helping.</li>
    <li> Once I started getting up the nerve to just go for it, I started researching it and found out what a higher quality this one is over the others that are available. Not only are they i better depth (which turns out is harder to find for home use and more effective) but there are so many more needle on the roll...this mean LESS time rolling! Which was good because I was nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so nervous to try it the first time! I messaged them for advice and they walked me through the whole process. They explained that if I use it right after the shower, my skin would be clean and more pliable. It works out perfect to do it at night so your skin can stay clean and soak up all of the extra moisture! I&#x27;ve decided to do it every Saturday so I can go make up free the next day. I used coconut oil and ran the rest of the oil in my hair and left it overnight. My skin and hair have never been so soft!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Awesome product!</li>
    <li> Seems to be well made. I&#x27;ve used several times on my face but haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in fine lines. I will continue to use</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd derma roller I have tried, and this one is way better.&lt;br /&gt;Needles are small and round.&lt;br /&gt;there are a lot more needles on this one than my old one.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  It does what it says it does!  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> This company is hands down the *best* when it comes to customer service.  I learned about derma rollers from my daughter, and so went searching on Amazon for the one she had bought.  While reviewing the various options, I came across the Puruskin derma roller and thought to myself &amp;#34;Hrrm...two heads, case, &amp;#34;how to guide&amp;#34;, all for the price (or less) than most of the other derma rollers, which come with a single head, and no PDF guide.  I actually wondered what the catch was, but after reading all of the superlative reviews of the Puruskin derma roller, it seemed like a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you, this company has AMAZING customer service.  I am very aware of that, because in my own company, our primary focus is on great customer service, so I am always watching and noticing how other companies do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for results with the derma roller itself, it&#x27;s a bit too early for me to tell, so I will update this after a few weeks of use, but I just felt that I had to post because in a market (derma rollers) where most of the offerings are indistinguishable, one from the other, the place that a company selling such a product can distinguish themselves is in their customer service, and Puruskin&#x27;s is *outstanding*.</li>
    <li> I have used a smaller Derma roller for a year or so. It does exactly as it claims. This bigger one will be used more comfortably in larger areas like the belly where I am seeing a marked improvement in stretchmarks I have had for decades. Exactly as marketed, very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It really works. It is a bit uncomfortable on areas where skin is thin (forehead, decolletage), but the results cannot be denied. Definitely plumps areas that wrinkle like corners of the eyes, but it also works on scars. Would definitely recommend! What&#x27;s the saying - no pain, no gain?</li>
    <li> works great my girl friend have been using for three weeks now and have noticed some results, skin looks smother. for best results i suggest adding in a few squats into your daily workout.</li>
    <li> I use the Derma Roller for under my eyes,  and for my scalp. I apply Rogaine right after,  and apply hyaluronic acid around my eyes. .i can feel a tingle in both areas as if both are penetrating much more than without the roller. My skin feels much tighter now. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. .</li>
    <li> love it!  great for my skin!</li>
    <li> I just used my Derma Roller for the first time last night and Im already in love with it! I have to admit that I was worried about looking like a vampire with blood running down my face but it was very easy to use and I had no problems. Your face tingles after use and after you apply a serum it feels so fresh and alive! I can&#x27;t wait to try the larger roller on my thighs to help with the cellulite. Also their customer service is one of the best anywhere. They get right back to you about any concerns or questions that you may have and stand behind their product! That means a lot and I&#x27;m so happy I chose their product over all the others!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a derma roll for weeks now and doesn&#x27;t work as quick as I&#x27;d hoped but I am seeing results on my face and stretch marks are disappearing yay good luck</li>
    <li> Highly recommended!!! Works</li>
    <li> This derma roller is very good, the 2 tips make it more useful than just buying one size roller at a time.  I have only used the blue tip for my face and neck. The 1-mm depth is supposed to be optimal to kickstart collagen production. The quality is very good, the head rolls freely and does not snag your skin. Puruskin also provides you with a link to a very very good manual with links to all kinds of useful info, such as where to buy the skin products to work with your roller, how to sanitize your roller, etc.  Definitely a good buy!</li>
    <li> Very convenient roller.I&#x27;m satisfied with your purchase</li>
    <li> Good product and prompt delivery</li>
    <li> I purchased my Derma Roller after hearing such good things about it.  I am so glad that I did! I have already noticed smoother &amp; silkier skin.  As far as comfort, the roller feels like a light, tickling sensation over the skin. I follow the treatment with my favorite skin products. It amplifies their potency.  I am fighting aging every step of the way. The Derma Roller is now a go to in my arsenal. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I have only used my derma roller once but it worked! I have less acne scarring on my cheek already! I cannot wait to use it on my whole face once my recent outbreak of acne goes away. You are not supposed to use the derma roller on spots in which there are pimples.</li>
    <li> This is a long process, and while I can see some progress now, it will be a while before I can give it a real review. The discomfort is similar to using an epilady - definitely tolerable when you set your mind to the goal. The only thing I question is the seller repeatedly emailing asking for a review - they know their product generally takes a while to show results, but their emails started immediately after my purchase. That is not reasonable.  I do have hopes for some good results, the scar is starting to break up slowly, but it will take time for an honest review. I already purchased the product, pressure from the seller now seems silly.</li>
    <li> I got caught in the hype with this one. Honestly I didn&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ll just eat healthy, drink tons of water andd use my shea butter.</li>
    <li> This roller is so amazing. When I first read about derma rolling, I thought it was ridiculous, but when I did some research, I was intrigued and decided to try it. I use the small roller for my face and the large one for some abdominal stretch marks. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it has made. I saw results pretty quickly in both areas. My facial texture and firmness have improved and small wrinkles have diminished. The stretch marks have lightened considerably, and while they are still there, they are more shallow and blend into my own skin color. Loved it so much I ordered another for my daughter!</li>
    <li> After 2 weeks and you will see your stretch marks lightening up after only 6 uses. I rub Organic Argon Oil over my stretch marks, then follow up with the derma roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few things:&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, do your research on what stretch marks really are. They are permanent! Treatments, with the exception of surgery, will get you results, but will never completely rid of your marks. Only lighten them up and mask them to reduce the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now on to the derma roller: Yes, it hurts a little. If you&#x27;re not up for some pain, then go ahead and keep your stretch and have a nice day. For those who are willing to dedicate time every 2 days or so (more than that is too much for the skin) and use the derma roller with argon oil, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS. I also always follow up each session with intensive stretch mark cream. This is when your skin is most vulnerable and I just love to seal in the moisture with some stretch mark cream so it can really penetrate deep. I also recommend using the cream on the off days in which you are not using the derma roller. I recently purchased &amp;#34;TriLASTIN&amp;#34; which works I guess, but is too expensive. I&#x27;m starting to just stick to Mederma or pharmacy brand creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other tips for people seriously really wanting to get rid of stretch marks:&lt;br /&gt;-Stop gaining weight. Changing your eating and fitness habits is crucial, because there is no point in doing all this with the derma roller when the marks will just keep coming back. Of course if you are pregnant or going through puberty, you are facing an uncontrollable growth, and in that case moisturized skin is your best solution (Aquaphor highly recommended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As seen above, keep your skin moisturized! Aquaphor works wonders for keeping your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliate!!! Scrub away that dead skin and work that top layer to get the collagen going! I love me a good lavender body scrub. I also use an exfoliating glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-WATER!!DRINK IT!! You&#x27;d be surprised what a difference this can make to your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Also, treat your stretch marks as soon as they appear. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all, and i hope this can maybe help out some people! Remember you are amazing and beautiful the way you are and no one can tell you otherwise!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new dema roller. Just used it for the first time today. Can&#x27;t wait to try it again. I received it really fast. S</li>
    <li> not for me, makes my melasma worse, but otherwise i would have loved to use it.</li>
    <li> OH YEAH THERE IS SOME PAIN, BUT I DONT CARE, WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS LITTLE LOVELY WRINKLE ERASER. Seriously do NOT wear make up for 2 days after use. That practically reverses the treatment. Minimal product on skin unless very high quality because they are going straight into pores after using DERMA roller,? Skin respondes generously with your own skins recipe for plumping. So good1</li>
    <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m microneedling every 30 to 40 days due the skins natural collagen replenish cycle. Too often and the inflammation can actually disrupt the collagen reproduction.</li>
    <li> This thing is okay... I&#x27;m not really sure if it works or not.</li>
    <li> Great for Stimulation! I Definitely Felt it afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;I myself, don&#x27;t use it much &amp; should!</li>
    <li> I just got this product in and so far it&#x27;s great! First of all, the company that sent it out is amazing to work with and I would give the m 5 starts. The only reason I&#x27;ve given the product 4 starts is because it isn&#x27;t a pain free experience (it&#x27;s made up of tiny needles so it kind of hurts, so don&#x27;t press too hard and you get used to it), BUT so far it&#x27;s working fantastically! I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times on my face and some stretch marks. My face looks so much healthier and refreshed. My skin is smoother and some of my blemishes have gone away. And my stretch marks are actually starting to fade! I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll completely go away, only time will tell, but they are definitely less noticeable. I would for sure recommend this!</li>
    <li> I am very impressed and EXCITED about this product! It came completely sealed and is sturdy. Definitely a quality product/company. I have only been &amp;#34;rolling&amp;#34; for a short time, but am already hooked. Talk about EXFOLIATING!! I used to offer microdermabrasion and get the treatments myself. I loved the way my skin felt after- well, I can already tell this is going to be even better and it&#x27;s SO much more convenient and affordable! I&#x27;m excited to see what happens after consistent use, because I&#x27;m already a happy customer. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I used twice since I received it, my face swells for up to two days afterwards, I tried pure coconut oil and it helped with the redness,  so far I have not noticed any transformation.  I will give it some more tries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and the seller.  Product is very high quality and seller was very prompt.</li>
    <li> Nice gadget still observing result</li>
    <li> I have used the derma roller for about two weeks, beginning to see a difference, can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in a month or two.  I&lt;br /&gt;have not even used any numbing product and it hasn&#x27;t been that bad and I do have very sensitive skin. Would recommend this product and the customer service is awesome.</li>
    <li> Quality derma roller.</li>
    <li> I have only used it once because of the pain involved. IT DOES HURT. However, only having used it once I already noticed an improvement. I suggest getting numbing cream. What I have not seen on anyone&#x27;s reviews is the peeling of the skin after. My face peeled like crazy so be warned the down time is considerably longer if you factor that in. I will definitely use it again once I get the numbing cream since I am a big baby. It is worth it for sure!! I was not too fond of the body roller though. My legs looked like I was attacked by a rabid cat.</li>
    <li> This item really hurt my skin - stopped using it right away!!!</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ve seen some improvement on the scars I used it on. But I have only used it for 2 weeks now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to use on my cellulite, stretchmarks, and the smaller attachment for my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product only once so far (because I was directed to only use this every 4-6 weeks), and I can ACTUALLY see great results already (especially in fading my stretchmarks)!</li>
    <li> Its a great tool. I use it on my varicose beins and on my chest. It makes the creams i use after more effictive.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Works very well.</li>
    <li> this is the tool very good</li>
    <li> I think it is a very nice product and would recommend it for sure.</li>
    <li> Neat tool.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve yet seen any difference other than my skin feels much better.  I started very light and with only 3 rolls in each direction.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every other day for a week and a half with hyaluronic serum.  I am really noticing a reduction of patchiness and blotchy scar-spots on face and chest.  Going to keep at it now that I have mastered pressure.  (This takes practice)  I find that it does not hurt at all.</li>
    <li> Too early to see results, but will keep at it.</li>
    <li> Love this little device! Use it nightly and my skin looks great!</li>
    <li> Amazing high quality product and superb customer service!</li>
    <li> Firstly, I must say that I have never encountered better customer service in MY LIFE. These people know how to do it right, which is a good sign that their product rocks. I tried both the small and the larger rollers- for different parts of the body. I won&#x27;t lie- it is not painless but it is not that bad that it stopped me from using the roller 3 times this week alone- and I&#x27;ve had it only 1 week. I can&#x27;t yet say if there is any improvements since it has only 1 week but I am hopeful that I will see the changes that I want. I am an acupuncturist and I do a lot of facial rejuvenation acupuncture but I make sure to try each product on myself before recommending them. I am pretty confident that this product will end up on my recomendattion list! Good job, Puruskin.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the derma roller for 2 days and I can already tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the product so far. I have not had it long enough to see results. I am going to keep using it for my stretch marks. Hoping for the best.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best derma roller with a great amount of needles for the best results. Has done wonders for my crows feet and fine lines under my eyes. I also use it around my laugh lines. I have 2 large scars on my thigh that I am working on and I see great improvement.</li>
    <li> Far exceeded my expectations; product and customer service. It was recommended that I use cellulite creams, however I choose to go more natural with vitamin E (45,000 IUs), Aloe Vera Natural, and or Organic Coconut oil, after fifteen years of trying so hard to get cellulite to go away, these products has so far shown me the answer after three times rolling.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very long, but I&#x27;m happy I chose the two sizes, I&#x27;ve become braver with each use, but have not had enough time to report results.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with the quality of the product and support.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the derma roller once and it left red scratches and welts every area I rolled. I will try it once more in a couple weeks in hopes I don&#x27;t get the same results. I can&#x27;t quite say I see any change in my stretch marks just yet since I&#x27;ve only rolled once. I will update after I roll again. On a positive note, I did receive my derma roller sooner then expected.</li>
    <li> Not as painful as I thought it would be. I have concentrated on a line between my brows and there is definitely a difference. I use it once or twice a week, before bed and it gets slightly red, but by morning, it&#x27;s fine, no issues with being noticeable.</li>
    <li> I used the Derma Roller three times by now, and I can see a difference. There is an improvement !!!!!! The customer service is excellent.</li>
