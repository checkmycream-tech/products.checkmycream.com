<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the most aweosme hair product!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I disliked this product so much I would have sent it back if I had not run out of time. First of all it does not smell good especially the weekly treatment (to the point my husband didn&#x27;t want to hug me for too long when I used it because of how bad it smelled!). Second of all it actually made my hair look worse. I have really fine brown hair with blonde highlights. Since we have well water I decided to be proactive and try this to prevent the rust from building up in my hair.  After 1 week of using the shampoo and conditioner daily and the second weekly treatment my hair was completely stripped and had no shine what so ever. I usually have really shiny hair and this product made my hair look so bad I looked sick! My hair felt and looked dry and brittle. My hair has just now regained its shine after a month of going back to my regular hair products!  For what I paid I was very displeased. Everyone here raves about the salon malibu treatments so I would recommend saving your money for those and skip this product.</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this product by hairdresser as we have an extremely high level iron in our well water.  My hair was turning orange!  My hair is much healthier and retains it&#x27;s natural color with this product.</li>
    <li> We have hard water at home and at our summer cottage. I bought this to use this summer and so far I&#x27;m not noticing a difference on the plus side from using my regular shampoo and conditioner. In fact, I need to buy another conditioner because I can&#x27;t get a comb through my hair (it&#x27;s fine but goes to my shoulder blades) after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t color my hair so can&#x27;t comment on any difference there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while it seems to work perfectly ok as a shampoo and conditioner, it&#x27;s not better than my usual brand (Tresemme) - and it costs twice as much.</li>
    <li> We have very hard water where we live and I have found this to be the best shampoo &amp; conditioner to counteract the harsh effects the water has on my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> We have well water and our softener wasn&#x27;t working very well for about a month. My daughter and I had such dry and brittle hair from it. I bought this and it was like night and day. It took some brassiness out of our hair too. So much softer and smooth.</li>
    <li> Havasu Arizona vacation ruined my hair due to hard water and this product 100% stripped the minerals out and looked better than ever! I had used it years ago with bad well water and hoped hit would work..I won&#x27;t leave home without taking it WITH me next year!</li>
    <li> This is the first reviews I&#x27;ve written on Amazon, but I just can&#x27;t say enough about this product. We bought a vacation condo that has hard water, and no matter what shampoo I tried (and I tried them all!) my hair just would not lather up. I ended up using a ton of shampoo just to have limp, still dirty hair. I&#x27;ve been using the Malibu products for a week, and wow! I actually have clean hair again! The shampoo lathers up perfectly, the conditioner is great, and the hard water crystals for weekly use are awesome. I will NOT be without this shampoo ever again! Great purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Outstanding product. Wife and daughter both have extremely long and thick hair. Went to visit my parents that have good old well water with a water softener system. Hair rinsed out amazingly well and in short order. Was noted that it does have a slight citrus scent to it but nothing offending. Will certainly be ordering again next time we visit or expect to have to deal with non-ideal water conditions.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product out of desperation. I have bleach blonde hair that I pay good money for and love. I also have terrible well water issues. After my last trip to the salon, my hair was a beautiful platinum blonde, but after one shower, it started turning orange. After about a week it was VERY orange. My schedule wouldn&#x27;t all for another trip to the salon anytime soon so I searched for an alternative. I found this product online and after one use of this kit, ALL the orange was out. I never thought the results would be this great. I was hoping for a little less orange, but my hair color was completely restored. I kept the treatment on for about 20 minutes with a shower cap - I could see the results before I took the shower cap off. I used the shampoo, treatment and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great for that Michigan hard well water problem:)</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my hair feel soft and silky. I will definitely purchase this again</li>
    <li> Item was recieved quickly...  This shampoo, so far is working for me. I have very hard water and my hair was becoming a tangling mess.  This product seems to be returning my hair back to its old self.  Thankyou</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like how it made my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have tried for years to find the right shampoo, conditioner, smoother, oil, treatments, etc... and NOTHING worked on my hair until I tried Malibu shampoo and conditioner. We have only mildly hard water but my hair always had a frizz to it and was very dry. After one use, my hair came out soft and smooth. This stuff really works It is a true miracle!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because we have very harse well water.  I read all the reviews and everyone raved at how good it works however I have not found that it works any better than the less expensive Ion well water shampoo and conditioner that I purchased at Sallys.  The fragrence of both the shampoo and conditioner is not very pleasing the conditioner is much worse than the shampoo.  It doesnt leave my hair very manigable and kinda drys it out.  The brassiness is still very noticable in my hair even after using this product for a month.  I did find that the the weekly shampoo works pretty well but it drys your hair out really bad.  I will not be buying this product again and will go with the less expensive Ion poducts that are more effective.</li>
    <li> she loves them good price</li>
    <li> This worked like magic on my hair the first time I used it.  As I continued to use it, I saw less of an effect on my hair.  I will probably purchase it again just to use occasionally.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair very soft and smooth, but takes a couple of shampoos the first time.</li>
    <li> Used it once, my hair had more damage after using it. Buyer beware... I now use just vinegar water rinse to get rid of the orange in my hair and a shampoo and conditioner called Tuscan Soul made by Salvatone Ferragauso. Great stuff</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed. I found my hair to be very dry, felt like straw. The packet to scrunch thru hair i found helpful but the shampoo and conditioner were terrible. I tried for about 2 weeks before giving up.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair, prone to slight frizz but with the right shampoo/conditioner usually falls nicely without much styling. After I moved to PA where we get hard water, my usual shampoo/cond stopped working on my hair.  I tried this product hoping it would work with my hard well water.  However, it did nothing at all.  My hair feels really coarse and brittle.  Big waste of money for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the little treatment packets (which you can buy separately); I&#x27;d give that 5 stars.  But skip the shampoo and conditioner, they are pointless and don&#x27;t smell that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the treatment packets, they are little miracle packets.  They *really* work, removing the hard water deposits on your hair.</li>
    <li> Maybe this was made more for blondes, I have very long brown/black hair and I could not even brush my hair it was so snarled and had to add a different conditioner.  I did like the packets, my hair was extremely shiny when used.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;We have hard well water and before using a high quality shampoo my hair was falling out left and right.&lt;br /&gt;A little shampoo goes a long way. I really like the weekly treatments but after a while of using it you only need to treatments once a month to keep hair soft. I switch off from this well water shampoo to another high quality shampoo every other wash.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again. I felt like it made my hair have a greasy build-up. The reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is because my daughter liked it but her water isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
    <li> Thos product actually helps your hair .... Drommthe firat moment I used it I noticed a metal smell coming off my hair... It feels softer and smother. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo and treatment I have used to remove the reddish tint in my blonde hair - caused by our iron rich well water. I&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
    <li> I absolutely recommend this set of products. I always have the worst hair when I go to Vegas, and thought it might have had something to do with hard water. This time when I went I had great hair! Soft, manageable, and full of volume. I have very thin, fine hair, and volume is always a problem. It even works in California, where the water is also pretty hard. I&#x27;d been having weeks of awful hair so I tried the demineralizing treatment and it worked like magic! Absolutely worth the price. It&#x27;s almost a miracle!</li>
    <li> This is the best on the market for well water.</li>
    <li> After moving to an area with very hard water, I wanted to try a product that would help soften and bring back the shine in my hair.  I read all the reviews (and my hair stylist even recommended it!) and decided to try Malibu.  The shampoo works great (I use it once a week), but the conditioner is the best (I use that at least 3x a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massage scalp packets, however, are the gem in this trio.  They bring my hair back to total softness and shine.  I use those one every 3-4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying Maibu products again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Added bonus:  This well-water kit also helps decrease static in the hair.  Very helpful in reducing those annoying flyaways!</li>
    <li> seemed to work pretty well with my crappy well water.</li>
    <li> I live in an area that runs with well water, which is very hard on my hair. I was hoping this would help remove some of the dryness that I have been experiencing, but unfortunately, I found this almost made me hair feel more dry. The shampoo left my hair like straw, which is not too uncommon, so I expected the conditioner to add the moisture back. It did not. I could barely get my fingers through my hair with the conditioner in and it was just as bad once I rinsed it out. Combing my hair was difficult as well because my hair was so tangled and dried out. I also was not too fond of the smell of this product. Overall, I am left unimpressed.</li>
    <li> This stuff has saved my hair. For years I have battled dry brittle hair from having extremely hard water. It makes my hair so soft, shiny, and smooth. The fact that it&#x27;s vegan is very important to me as well. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more and using this from now on.</li>
    <li> I recently moved to a new town with very hard water. I&#x27;d never had a problem with hard water before and my hair was a disaster after only 2 showers. It was greasy and had a weird texture that made it impossible to smooth or even run my fingers through it. There was a lot of build up and my giant, frizzy hair is already hard enough to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;I found this stuff and, in spite of having tried billions of hair products in my 27 years and having NONE of them work, had to give it a shot. These were desperate times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a HUGE difference in my hair after only a few washes. I still cannot believe I found a hair product that actually does what it says and even works with my ridiculous, overwhelming, Jewish hair. I&#x27;m on my second package now. I can&#x27;t use anything else while I have this water and I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this so quickly. If you have hard water, you HAVE to try this stuff. I wish I could put it on auto-replenish so they would just send me new bottles every other month.</li>
    <li> Our water conditioner has been on the fritz lately and my hairdresser mentioned that she could tell I had chemicals in my hair, it was brassy and sticky, probably from my well???? Well, I said she was right and I went online and found this Malibu Wellness and used the packet first, my hair came back to the perfect highlighted hair I had...people thought I had my hair redone!  It is very gentle!</li>
    <li> When I had to clean rust deposits from the sink and tub of our new summer home, I never thought how that extra iron might affect my hair.  After a few weeks of showering with our well water, my blond coiffure took on an orangeish tint, with a deeper color on the fringe around my face.  Panicky, I trimmed off the colored fringe as much as I could, then searched for a solution to my problem on the Internet. I consequently ordered the Malibu Making Water Well Kit, which arrived in just a few days.  One application of the shampoo, weekly demineralizer and conditioner took out most of the orange cast.  After a few shampooings, my hair color was back to normal.  The kit was a tremendous help.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me.  My hair (chemically straightened) felt terrible. I Still had to use a different conditioner to get the tangles out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Purchased 4 bottles of purified baby water &amp;#34;Nursery&amp;#34; for $1 each at grocery store to wash my hair (with the regular shampoo &amp; conditioner), felt a difference instantly. Had to wash my hair in the laundry room sink but it is worth it to stop the breakage &amp; hair loss.</li>
    <li> Malibu used to make EC Mode.  However, they&#x27;ve discontinued that line.  This product is what Malibu recommended as a replacement.  I have really hard water that tends to turn my blonde hair a little brassy.  Yes, I color my hair.  This does work really well to get the hard water build-up out and remove that brassy tone.  I also have naturally curly hair.  It didn&#x27;t weigh my curls down.  My hair is also dry.  Not damaged, just dry.  This didn&#x27;t provide quite enough moisture to use as a daily shampoo and conditioner.  I think this will be a set that I use about once a week to get the gunk out.  I&#x27;ll stick with my more moisturizing shampoo and conditioner the rest of the month.  I think it would work great as a daily shampoo and conditioner for someone with more normal or oily hair.  The weekly treatment is also great.  But with my hair being dry, I think I&#x27;ll stick with using it once every two weeks.</li>
    <li> The Malibu products for hard water are great for removing and maintaining your hair if you have well water.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t understand why I was having damaged hair...until my last hair salon visit to a new place. I had hair almost to my waist and got a good 6, 7 inches cut off because I got tired of doing it &amp;#34;a little bit at a time&amp;#34;. It had been at least a year already so I decided to do it all at once. My hair dresser asked what type of water I had, was it well water? Yes! My mother has well water. My hair dresser said that would do it and she told me about this product. The first thing I did when I got home was look this product up and ordered it (it was the best price also).  I am amazed at what this product has done. I was able to comb through my hair easily right after a shampoo and conditioner which is something I haven&#x27;t been able to do for years. The shampoo has a citrus smell to it which is not what I usually prefer but the conditioner does. For how well it works, that&#x27;s okay for me.</li>
    <li> AMAZING! If you have hard water, you def need this! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have very hard water (iron) and must use a treatment every few days to remove build up or my hair gets heavy and my scalp itches and produces flakes.  I use this and Ion products and it removes build up and makes my hair softer and lighter.  However, it rarely removes ALL the color buildup (brassy reddish tones).  Wrapping your head in a plastic cap (or I just use a plastic grocery bag) and applying heat with a blow dryer is a must.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for green chlorine damaged hair, and so far these are the only products that work (in combination with a good water filter!). When I first got the products I used them everyday for two weeks and I noticed a major difference in the color, which got lighter again, and the texture, which got softer. However, it will strip your hair and dry it out if you use it everyday. My hair strylist noticed that right away and told me to only use it once a week at most. But yes, I very much recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not happy with the smell - almost smells like vomit. Conditioner is not so great - doesn&#x27;t do anything for detangling. Shampoo does ok with the hard water issue.</li>
    <li> Works as well or better than expected.  Hair is much softer than usual from hard well water.  Highly recommended. Shipment was prompt, the price is right.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This stuff is just fantastic.  I have lived in the same apartment for some years now, with hard water.  I never thought to try a treatment for that.  And I am very pleased with the results of these products, when used together.  I also recommend the spray, leave-in conditioner.  I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I noticed a difference in my hair quality . But after the 2nd shampoo I felt my hair softening on the ends. Usually my hard water makes the ends of my curly hair stick straight and dry looking. My ends are curling now like they did before I lived with hard water .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic claim,and hard to believe. But it is true. You can contact the Malibu company and request samples - this will be enough to see the difference (they are generous samples). This product is amazing. I live in a city with hard water. The calcium carbonate content is very high, as is chlorine. In turn, if you live in an old part of town, pipes tend to erode, leaving iron and copper deposits in the water too. Yuck! Within 2-3 weeks of moving here, my hair started to feel gummy. No shampoo I could find would remedy this. For reference, I don&#x27;t really use styling products, so product buildup was not the culprit. After about 2 months, the ends were so dry they were breaking off, while the roots were oily and flat. In short, my hair hasn&#x27;t felt, or looked, like hair since I moved to this city.     Enter Malibu Well Water Action system. The first time I used it, I was amazed at how soft &amp; genuinely clean my hair felt. Not stripped, just clean. One week later, and I have hair I haven&#x27;t had since childhood. It is soft, bouncy, and so, so, shiny!!! The demineralizing packets are incredible. You can smell whatever mineral is coming off of your hair. For me, it is copper and iron. Gross!     An aside: I grew up a redhead. For a few years, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair seemed to be fading. The redhead equivalent of going gray. Stylists told me my roots were growing in ash blonde - there isn&#x27;t an ash blonde in my family! Since I&#x27;ve been using this system, I see the stylists were half right. I&#x27;m not a redhead anymore (somewhat sad about that, but what can you do). However, my newly blonde hair is so vibrant! Streaks, varying tone, and so much depth. If you suspect you have hard water, give this a shot. I had no idea my hair color was so naturally vibrant. Apparently, my water has been hard for years and I didn&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> What I received in the mail does not match this picture. Surprising since this is from Malibu Wellness directly vs. via another seller. Disappointed since the first time I bought this, it was an exact match for the photo and I had no worries about whether or not the product was as it had been described.</li>
    <li> Removed the brassy tones from my hair as promised.</li>
    <li> I have been using this daily to help with hard water and brassiness. Seems to be working great!</li>
    <li> I have well water and I was skeptical that this product would help make my hair less dry. After the second to third use I really love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> May hair looks and feels great!!! I love this product my new favorite shampoo and conditioner.  I like how it smells and the repair packages that are included work miracles.  You have to try this product.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been living in a house that runs on a well for 3 years now. I have always kept my hair light blonde but the mineral deposits made this practically impossible! My hair turned bright orange and I couldn&#x27;t even lift the orange with bleach!  One of my stylist friends who has platinum hair recommended this to me. I was a little skeptical but after viewing this product on Amazon many times, I decided to purchase. BEST. DECISION. EVER! I followed the directions and shampooed first followed by the weekly treatment. Within a minute of spreading this through my hair, I could see the orange lifting. I waited a few minutes and then rinsed, followed by another shampoo and conditioner. This did dry my hair slightly but I&#x27;m sure it could be paired with a good deep condition to remedy that. All in all, this product is absolutely amazing. I recommend this to anyone with well water. This is the only thing that has ever worked for me. I am definitely sold, I will be a customer for LIFE! !</li>
    <li> this is great shampoo</li>
    <li> My daughter is using this product her hair is so soft and shines</li>
    <li> The well water in our house is so full of iron, it&#x27;s horrible!! I had been noticing that my hair was looking really awful and I just couldn&#x27;t figure out why. I was trying every kind of deep conditioning treatment out there, home remedies, etc. My hair stylist mentioned that the water you use has a tremendous affect on your hair, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. I noticed a dramatic change after the very first use and it just keeps getting better the more I use it!!! I love this stuff and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone with bad water issues.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hard water since I moved to Nevada for over four years, my hair use to be thick, shiny, and full of life.  It has become brittle, stuck to my head, and has even fallen out due to the hard water.  I&#x27;m so pleased that I did my research and came across Malibu Hair Care.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week but I can tell a HUGE difference in my hair.  It is starting to come to life again !!!  Thank You Malibu  :)  I recommend this product to anyone who is battling hard water, you won&#x27;t be let down.</li>
    <li> Can someone please help me out here? I got the product today the plastic the items came in was broke and torn and when I used it my hair has never been so nappy and gross I was in tears trying to brush my hair does this product get any better? Ir wad mine tampered with?</li>
    <li> Worked great on my once naturally blonde hair...turned ORANGE with our well water...I have nolticed I have to use it every day or it begins to turn orange quite quickly. When I use it I can definatly tell a difference :) it did not turn it back to its original color yet....we also installed some expensive fliters so our water is clear now...but it still must have minerals turning my hair dingy. Overall I do love the product!</li>
    <li> I have well water and blonde, highlighted hair. I have spent a fortune and had numerous colorists work on my hair to, &amp;#34;get the orange tint out&amp;#34;. My colorist said she was &amp;#34;out of ideas&amp;#34;. This product changed my hair significantly after one use and treatment. I LOVE it and highly recommend it. This product made me like my hair again - thank you, thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product worked well. I have soft water but it was still feeling stringy and straw-like after showers. I was tired of buying expensive conditioners. I use one treatment every 2 weeks and my blonde hair pops and glimmers. Thank you for this product, I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Works amazing for removing iron build up out of blonde hair!</li>
    <li> The price on this stuff has gotten way out of hand so this 2fer is a good deal. Wish it had the &#x27;gel&#x27; packs instead but the weekly treatments are OK I guess. Anybody with hard water knows that this is THE stuff. Accept no substitutions. If you have neglected for a while and need a good starting point (ie: your hair is rusty already), get the CRYSTAL GEL packs. Not cheap but you only need ONE and then wash with this stuff 1-2 times a week for maint. The packets they have here will do a little but they are more of a &#x27;maint&#x27; item to the gel treatment which is what the salons use and charge you $15 and up.</li>
    <li> Great product but when it arrived it, bottle lid was open and of course liquid spilled all over package. I lost about 25% of the product. It seemed as though it came directly from factory as both bottle lids were unscrewed and liquid spilled all over. I used what was left and the product really does help you hair.</li>
    <li> This product us great! My only complaint was that the covers were loose and done product seeped out...other than that it&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the product was not packaged very well for the postal system.  The entire bottle of shampoo leaked out before it was delivered to me.  I am going to try and find the product locally.</li>
    <li> some what pricy but other wise a great product.</li>
    <li> Something had gone awry with our well water&#x27;s iron pump and my hair FREAKED OUT - brassy, rough, refusing to curl or fluff; misery!  Google results reflected Malibu Wellness Making Well Kit and the reviews convinced me to try. Product arrived promptly and worked exactly as promised.  Very, very pleased with the results - turns out I will not be bald after all, no less have to live with sticky, flat hair; life is good!</li>
    <li> I have a lot of iron in my water!  Since I highlight my hair my hair tends to get a brassy tint.  I use this every other day and it does prevent my hair from getting brassy.</li>
    <li> Really good product!!! Made quiet a difference in my hair, my hair healthier and has more shine to it..love it!</li>
    <li> Does not work well. Smells bad, drying to hair and turns blondes orange.</li>
    <li> This product did not do much for my hair and the build up from my hard water, it smells great though.</li>
    <li> Is drying to my hair if used too often. Works great as a treatment shampoo. Adds body</li>
    <li> This kit really does the trick to get hard water stains out of your hair. After a few washes it is back to how it should look.</li>
    <li> I have noticed a difference in my hair after one use.  My hair feels softer, more shine and less frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t lather up like regular shampoo, but it definitely works.  I have highlighted wavy hair that frizzes in humidity.  I have well water and my hair has taken a toll from it.  There is a definite difference in quality of my hair.  I bought this because I noticed my friend&#x27;s hair always looked healthy and shiny even though she is a swim instructor and is in a pool quite a bit . She mentioned she used these products.&lt;br /&gt;I do use small amount of Argon oil after hair is washed, but I have always used it with previous shampoos and conditioners.  Argon oil seems to work better with these products.</li>
    <li> I am utterly amaze at how well this product works.  My hair feels so much healthier and softer.  I actually have volume and life in my hair again.  After living with a water softener using the salt with rust remover I was starting to lose an unusual amount of hair.  Not to mention that my hair was just not the same.  After doing some research I came to the conclusion that is was the salt from the softener with the rust remover.  During those searches this product kept coming up and I had to try it.  Needless to say, it made a huge difference in my hair.  I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair I was losing every time I washed it.  I&#x27;m super please with this product.  I ordered it through Amazon because it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love Malibu and started using their products over a decade ago when my hair was suffering from chlorinated pools. Now my problem is hard water which leaves my hair tangle-prone, with a rusty colored tint and an irritated scalp. I really notice a difference with my hair color and softness when I use the shampoo and conditioner, which I do every time I wash my hair. The scent is subtle enough and the treatment is great, although I feel like I need more than one packet for my long hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> 2 treatments turned my normally silver hair back after it turned rusty looking from our hard well water.  Love the system</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use have been using it everyday for the last month and have seen great results. If you have well water this is a must have!</li>
    <li> Our water softener isn&#x27;t working so we needed this godsend for our hair!  It definitely helps, we do recommend to get the grease out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Must admit I like this product. Initially an issue due to the post office.  But the company came to my aide and I received a different shipment in no time at all.&lt;br /&gt;Love the feel of my hair and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> My long hair felt like straw after living moving to a home that has well water a few year ago. There was no elasticity, just breakage, dull color, greasy scalp, and porcupine ends. I thought I would have to cut it all off and get a pixy cut. After just one use, my hair felt much better and by the third use my hair felt like butter! I can already tell my hair has more elasticity. I&#x27;m so pleased with this product, the scent is WAY better and milder than the Ion brand of hard water treatment. And it should be stated that I never leave comments on products because I never have the time, but I feel I can make the time for this review because this product has changed my life!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this hair care kit.  It is definitely living up to its claims of restoring my hair that has been damaged by hard water.  However, when I received the package, the conditioner had leaked into the inside of the plastic box it was contained in.  Luckily, it hadn&#x27;t yet reached the other package in my shipment.  There was no damage to anything else, but it did leave me with a mess to clean up and less conditioner to use.  This probably could have been avoided if the bottle cap was tightened (or checked) before shipment.  Despite this problem, I really like the product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Wish I had found it years ago! I have hard well water with iron. My blonde hair sometimes goes very brassy. This system has taken the brassiness away and has brightened my color. I love it!</li>
    <li> I hate the hard water build up on my hair and thought this will shampoo and conditioner will solve the problem.  I don&#x27;t think so.  After using them for about a couple months, I still don&#x27;t think my hair is improved at all from less build up.  Think I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Probably the only solution is to buy a water softener.....not looking for something to remove the build up.</li>
    <li> I moved from Scotland to NY and my hair HATED the change in water.  The hard water made my hair like straw, and I honestly hated washing it, it too so long and felt horrible.  After doing some researching I bought this kit.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as good as it did previously but it&#x27;s 100 times.  I&#x27;ve since tried more expensive brands like Redken&#x27;s Cleansing Clean Shampoo, and it was just terrible.  I&#x27;m now back to buy my third set of Malibu!</li>
    <li> It works and has rid my hair of the orange. We have hard water and this product does the trick.</li>
    <li> We have really hard water at our cabin and this product has brought my hair back to life!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks much!</li>
    <li> I have extremely hard well water. I started using this product on Saturday, 5/24/14 and I am in love with it. I suffered from oily, weighted down hair, and an itchy scalp. Now, it&#x27;s the complete opposite. My hair is silky smooth and easy to comb through. It&#x27;s lighter and softer than ever. It feels like I just used a cleansing treatment. There is no way that I could have gone more than 24 hours without washing my hair. Now, with this sulfate and paraben free shampoo and conditioner, I went over 48 hours without washing it, and it did not get very oily. In addition, my scalp didn&#x27;t itch. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve tried on my hair, so far! I paired it with the Bio-Ionic Agave Oil Treatment, and my hair looks and feels great!</li>
    <li> After the first time using this I felt and saw a noticeable difference. My hair was shiny and soft and so much easier to brush through and blow dry. I love it and it smells amazing. The Wellness Treatment powder didn&#x27;t really do much so I don&#x27;t think that is much worth the hype but the shampoo and conditioner are fantastic!</li>
    <li> I have a ton of excess iron in my water, so i use the shampoo on a one-a-week basis to keep the build-up out of my hair. My hair has seemed to be much healthier and grows faster since I started using this. However, I think the conditioner is pretty pointless, because it&#x27;s not very good at moisturizing. I used the powder packets once every couple weeks because there are so few of them. I have since just started ordering the shampoo by itself because that seems to be the only necessary product in this bundle.</li>
    <li> Where I live we have hard water that is also highly chlorinated. My hard was getting a terrible texture and was super dry, I thought it was just me. My hair stylist recommended that try this and after a week my hair was soft and back to what it was before we lived here. Great product.</li>
    <li> A friend told me about Malibu shampoo. We have well water and my hair was unmanageable due to the hardness of the water. It was also turning brassy from all the Manganese in the water. The shampoo works well enough. Has a pleasant smell and suds well. I also think it helps somewhat to keep the brassiness out of my hair. I have colored hair and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be stripping the color.  I hate the conditioner. I might as well not have used anything. But, what works the best are the little packets of crystals for removing minerals from your hair. My hair was noticeably more manageable and cleaner feeling after using this treatment. I have chin length, very fine hair and a half packet worked great.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my stylist. Works great to rid my hair of the heavy iron content in my well water. I use it once a week.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically write product reviews, but I thought I should for this one. I have blonde hair that has been stained by my well water-it&#x27;s mostly affected on my left side of my head as we went quite blonde on that side a little while back for a fun hair style. I&#x27;ve since been trying to get my hair back to it&#x27;s natural blonde color but can&#x27;t get rid of the dark brassy color!  My hair dresser and I have been trying to get the color out, but nothing had been working-not even the expensive salon treatments that claimed to take out the orangey/brassy stain.  I found your product online, read a LOT of glowing reviews and thought, hey, why not? So I ordered your product and it arrived a week earlier than the eta I was given (I&#x27;m in BC, Canada).  I used it last night (it arrived after work yesterday) and after just one shampoo and treatment my hair has improved a significant amount! As it is fairly gentle on my hair, and the iron is quite stuck in my hair, I didn&#x27;t expect it to all be gone by the first try, but I can&#x27;t wait to do it again and see if it&#x27;s all gone by round two!  I took before and after photos, and will keep taking them after each wash until the brassiness is gone-I wish I could post the photos so far! As far as product smell, it has a nice light scent when you&#x27;re washing your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t linger much after which is great.  I found the conditioner worked ok for my hair, but will probably use a heavier one on my ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this sounds really odd... but I live on a farm with well water-the house has a filtration system and the barn does not. I have a grey horse that funny enough has the same issue on sections of her body with the red stain that NO high strength horsey shampoo or purple shampoo will get out or hide (and no, they&#x27;re not poop stains).  I&#x27;m going to try your product on a section of my mare and see if it makes a difference on her brassiness too-wish me luck!</li>
    <li> Horrible, dries out my hair soooo bad!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m done with these kinds of shampoos that are nothing but chemicals.  Total gimmick, does nothing, you&#x27;re better off buying something else.</li>
    <li> We have well water with pretty significant amounts of iron, which require the use of Iron Fighter salt in our water softener.  My beautiful blonde highlights had actually taken on a copper hue.  I used the mask treatment twice and the shampoo/conditioner daily and almost all of the copper hue is gone from my hair!</li>
    <li> We have a lot of iron in our well water and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!  This stuff really works (from the first shampoo).  Makes my hair softer, shiny and less brittle.</li>
    <li> Our Northern well water has so much iron in it my hair and fingernails turn Orange! This product line REALLY works. It removed the orange AND brassiness from my L&#x27;Oreal enhanced haircolor. I no longer have to &amp;#34;color correct&amp;#34;. My hair became soft, wavy, and shiny again, just like winter in the South with soft water. So happy, but it may be drying. My hairdresser suggests using it only once a week, and would be good to alternate using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I also started to use hair oil. Love my hair again! Will order the larger size because this is the answer for me.</li>
    <li> In very small print, the envelop for the hard water demineralized treatment says &amp;#34;not recommended for use on white or grey hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should be included in the product description.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of iron in our water and it takes the brassiness out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it in the past.</li>
    <li> I have hard water and have been getting my haor dyed blond.  My hair has remained in great condition since using this. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> For those who have color treated or fine hair like mine I would suggest using a rich conditioner after use. I couldn&#x27;t use the shampoo and conditioner daily, more like a few times a week. It left my hair too dry. The packets were useful, I would use them every two weeks.</li>
    <li> great for people who have well water!!</li>
    <li> Works great and makes my hair soft!!  The shampoo and conditioner smell awesome, the little packets smell weird, but its not a big deal.  I know people want to know if it lifts color and yes I do believe it does.  It is a clarifying shampoo, but I don&#x27;t think its as strong as something like Prell.  I just colored my hair and it is way too dark so I used this shampoo and it did help to lift the color when I left it in a little longer than normal.  I think if you just shampoo and wash right away you won&#x27;t have it lift a lot of color.</li>
    <li> Was suggested by a salonist. I&#x27;m hoping it will help my hair due to the well water making it brittle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only made my hair sexy, but also magically turned me into a mermaid.</li>
    <li> It is not an effective product. The hair turns so dry after using.</li>
    <li> Could be my imagination, but I swear this stuff works better at the salon.  It is too harsh for daily use on blonde hair.  It does help combat brassiness, and it smells wonderful....like lemon sorbet.</li>
    <li> It smells nice but does&#x27;t appear to work any better or worse than anything else. I also made my hair very soft which is a problem&lt;br /&gt;if it is humid.</li>
    <li> I have been looking all over and tried MANY different things to get the brassy orange color out of my blonde hair that&#x27;s caused by very hard well water with lots of iron in it. THIS DID IT! My hair is naturally blonde, but I also have highlights put in it, which I was beginning to think was a waste of money since my hair just kept turning orange and looking terrible within a month or so. I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference I saw after using the little \\&quot;Wellness Actives\\&quot; powder and the shampoo and conditioner for the first time. My hair looked so much brighter and shinier and felt softer. It looked almost like what it did when I left the salon. While I can&#x27;t say it got rid of the brassiness 100% on the first shot, it was pretty darn close! I&#x27;m guessing by the second treatment it should be completely gone! This product is a must have for anyone with hard well water and brassy hair. This is definitely a product I&#x27;ll be purchasing regularly!</li>
    <li> I love this hard water haircare set.  Its a great value and it is really nice for my thick curly hair.  My hair feels clean in super hard water and soft with the conditioner.  Wish it had a subscribe and save option here.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job removing brassiness from hair due to hard water.  Would highly recommend this product if you have hard water.</li>
    <li> Left my hair worse then straw. Also more hair came out with that shampoo then when I dye it. Not worth the chance.</li>
    <li> really helps battle the damage from my very hard well water. real cure would be an in-home filtration system,but ...</li>
    <li> I never knew they had something for hard water.  The shampoo gives my fine, naturally curly hair body; however, I don&#x27;t blow-dry my hair, so the conditioner is way too heavy.  I&#x27;m going to give it to a friend.  The packets really make a difference.  I&#x27;m going to try half a packet next time, since it makes sooo much!</li>
    <li> Worked good.  Would recommend it to others that have hard water.  My hair was pretty bad and it is getting back to normal.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I use the hard water treatment crystals and can totally tell a difference when i don&#x27;t use them. We have hard water and my hair is fine and color treated. I mix done of the crystals with drops of water into a paste, put on my hair and leave it for a few minutes.  Rinse,  wash with the Malibu shampoo and condition with Malibu C. Been using for a few weeks now to make sure how i like it before i reviewed.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonders. My water softener is not working right at the moment and my hair has felt nasty from the hard water. I bought this to try and used it the day it showed up. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner every time I washed my hair and have used the powder once a week. My hair feels lighter and this makes my hair smell amazing. It&#x27;s like a citrus scent.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff is drying. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had hard water build up or not. Apparently not. After one use, my hair looks like straw and is unmanageable. I haven&#x27;t tried the treatment in fear it would be too harsh.</li>
    <li> I am still evaluating these products.  My hair is sometimes almost too soft after using.  If I use in combination with other shampoos and conditioners, it seems to help reduce the hard water buildup.</li>
    <li> Glad I purchased this set from Malibu Wellness. I like that the Shampoo is Sulfate free. Without using a heavy conditioner, my hair feels fantastic after just one wash/treatment and conditioning.</li>
    <li> I guess this works ok but it dried my hair out too much. I had to use a leave in conditioner to comb it out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this set! I&#x27;ve been experiencing a dry scalp, slimy hair, and breakage for a few months now and had no idea why. I tried everything from dry scalp treatments to oily hair shampoos and had yet to see a change. I finally took to the internet and realized that I may be experiencing these symptoms as a result of hard water, and immediately hopped on Amazon. Because of the reviews, I figured I would try this set, and got next day delivery for today. Best amazon purchase I have ever made! I was smiling in the shower tonight because I could feel the difference after just shampooing. Now I am sitting here with freshly blow-dried soft, volumuous, healthy hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will definitely be using the Malibu Hard Water Shampoo/Conditioner from now on. I never expected results this good, but it truly works as it says!</li>
    <li> I like the smell.  But as far as doing anything great for my hair, It did not deliver.  I saw no difference whatsoever and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t really help very much, made it impossible to comb through and not very soft.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t spend my money again on this product</li>
    <li> Just used the shampoo, treatment and conditioner for the first time.  Noticed a great deal of difference.  My hair feels so smooth and healthy! I have been living with well water for 2 years now and I am a blonde.  The build up of brassiness in my hair is worse that it has ever been! I recently got it highlighted to try and cover the yellow/brass but it returned within 2 weeks.  Not sure if anyone can help me but I feel I could really use another treatment.  Has anyone used a treatment closer than a week apart? Or how consecutively did you use the shampoo and condition or treatment to achieve maximum results? And lastly does any other blondes out there still use their purple shampoo along with this product?  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for awhile and I really like it, we have a lot of iron in our water and this seems to help more than other products I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted bleach blonde hair and hard sulfur water. I haven&#x27;t found anything better to keep the brassy orange color out, except THIS product. LOVE it! except it does make it dry so I only use it one per week ( only wash my hair three times per week) and mix it with moisturizing shampoo. my fav is organix Biotin shampoo.</li>
    <li> We have very rusty water. I use the packets about every three or four weeks. I don&#x27;t bother with a lot of fussing around. In the past I would have wrapped my hair in plastic wrap, foil and a towel. Then laid on the floor in front of the heater. With this product, I just take a little longer shower. The conditioner is for for after the treatment only. Excellent value for your money!</li>
    <li> This shampoo, conditioner and crystal packet are a blessing! I moved to a home w/ well water and it has destroyed my hair. I have tried all kinds of shampoos to combat the damage and have had mild success with sulfate free shampoos. This stuff works, I mean really works. From the first use I felt like I had my hard back. Ill buy it a million times over, go on tour singing its praises and make a commercial on the companies behalf...</li>
    <li> Arrived early , package was ripped open but otherwise fine</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even explain how much this product SAVED my hair. My hair is natural very wavy, frizzy, dry, and overall just unmanageable. I spend about $200 on a Brazillion Blowout to help manage my hair (worth every penny, highly recommend!) and the initial results were HORRIBLE. I cried for about 3 weeks before calling the hair salon explaining that it \\&quot;didn&#x27;t work\\&quot;. The hair stylist asked what kind of water I have, which is well, and explained that all of the build up of the minerals from the water is making my hair heavy, sticky, frizzy, and overall just horrible. She used this shampoo ONCE and it literally gave me a different head of hair. My brazillion blowout reactivated on my hair and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. THANK YOU MALIBU!</li>
    <li> For the benefit of the doubt, I&#x27;ll give this product two out of five because it works so well for so many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it did not work well for me. The conditioner was way too strong and I found myself often having to hop in the shower a second time just to remove the product. I bought the kit because my apartment&#x27;s hard water caused hair loss, but this product overconditioned my hair and actually accelerated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the amount of product, I can really only recommend purchasing a filtered showerhead for similar costs. It&#x27;s a much wiser investment.</li>
    <li> We have very hard well water. It&#x27;s so bad it turns our whites off white its so bad. I pay good money to get my fine blonde hair done. I&#x27;ve tried a few purple and blue shampoos that didn&#x27;t help get rid of the brassiness from the mineral deposits in my hair. Within two washes with Malibu shampoo my hair was GREAT! Soft, extra volume, shiny, and color like I went to the salon yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner seems to &amp;#34;dry/tangle&amp;#34; my fine hair so I either mix it with a moisturizing conditioner, or just use my moisturizing conditioner alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. I plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was only expecting one packet of weekly treatment in this kit but it actually comes with four packets, enough for a month. The bottles of shampoo/conditioner are on the small side but a little goes a long way. I feel as if my hair is not as drab.  It&#x27;s shine is back and dryness gone.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel dirty product not what expected! Does not make hair soft like ad says did not like disappointed</li>
    <li> I had green hair last year. My friend who is a beautician recommended Malibu. It could not get out all the old stain, but there is not much new.</li>
    <li> wow. wow. wow. I am impressed with the results I&#x27;m getting from this shampoo + conditioner + treatment combo! It&#x27;s battling the damage that hard water has wreaked on my hair, without stripping the color from my locks. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very hard water with a lot of iron in it.  I love the way this product makes my hair feel -- so soft.  I am not a blonde so I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works at removing the brassy color that many blondes experience with hard water with iron in it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> AMAZING shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!! My blonde highlights had turned orange after washing my hair in water that stunk of sulphur &amp; rust. After 2-3 treatments with this it was gone!</li>
    <li> Amazing product took the disco lording right out of my hair within a couple washes! It&#x27;s a mirical</li>
    <li> My grey hair has alot of yellow in it&lt;br /&gt;Malibu c did not work at all</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair!</li>
    <li> The shampoo and clarifying treatment definitely helps my hair texture.  I live in a very rural area with a well- our water is loaded with minerals and ferrous iron.  Unfortunately, it strips the color out and leaves my hair with a nasty brassy tone.  That&#x27;s okay because I need to buy a water softener anyhow.  Until then, I will buy this product.  I could see it working out well if you lived in maybe a city with hard water and alternated the shampoo with other shampoos.  It&#x27;s just too powerful for everyday use, however.  At least on my hair (which is normally thick, brown, straight shiny hair).  It did not restore it to it&#x27;s original texture and shine, but at least made it not so nappy that I could brush it.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipment, thank you!! I would buy from this seller again. This shampoo and conditioner set is about $30 online and this is a really good price.</li>
    <li> I bought a house in the country with well water about 2 years ago. Unfortunately, it took me that long to make the connection between my water and my horrible looking hair. I have straight naturally light brown hair that I highlight. My hair had always been long, shiny and beautiful. It became dry, coarse, and full of split ends. My blonde highlights were brassy and my natural light brown took on almost a grayish green tint. I tried all the expensive salon products and nothing worked. I kept cutting it shorter and shorter to try and make it look healthy, which didn&#x27;t work. I resorted to keeping it up in a pony-tail all of the time. Until I stumbled upon Malibu, I though my days of beautiful hair were over. I noticed a difference after my second use. Now, 2 weeks later, my hair is soft, shiny, and healthy looking. No more brassy highlights and grayish-green hair! Malibu is a MIRACLE!! I just ordered 12 more weekly treatments and a huge bottle of shampoo. I never want to be without this hair-saver! I still can&#x27;t believe my hair is soft and silky again!!</li>
    <li> Malibu products are the best if you have hard water.  I use the little pack of treatment about once every other month.  I only shampoo a couple times a week because I have thick, dry hair and horrible hard water.  My hair always feels so good, clean, silky and shiny after shampooing and conditioning with this stuff.  It smells great too!  Get it...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Too much iron in the water and this will take out the orange streaks left behind in my hair better than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, conditioner and treatment for well water.</li>
    <li> This item was wonderful. My water had always been hard but when there hasn&#x27;t been any rain it gets worse.  I noticed my hair was  turning orange like my tub from the water.  My hairdresser told me about this product and I ordered it. It has cleared my hair of the nasty red look and I am happily blond again!!</li>
    <li> Since I abuse my coarse hair daily with a blow dryer and curling iron, I&#x27;m always looking for products to soften and restore my hair&#x27;s health. After reading up on the problems with sulfates in shampoos, I thought I&#x27;d try a sulfate-free shampoo for the first time. They say sulfates, a detergent-like salt, are harsh for the hair and scalp and irritate eyes. They may even contribute to hair loss and permanent damage to eyes (not sure this is scientifically proven). This kit wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and since I&#x27;m just testing products, I didn&#x27;t want huge quantities to start. It was also recommended on a reputable website about haircare. This product claims to clean away mineral residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it is sulfates that create foam in cleaning products, including makeup remover and floor cleaners, so I expected little or no foam with this shampoo. But there was just as much as any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. I don&#x27;t know which ingredient makes this possible. My hair feels very clean after use. I was worried it had stripped off all of the oils, but after applying conditioner, my hair felt smooth and soft. The only big negative of the products is that they smell strongly like Juicy Fruit gum, and so did my hair, even the next day. Anyone who wears their own carefully selected cologne may not like the strong aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is very light and seems to contain a lot of water. I had to use a lot of it to get through my long, thick hair, so I&#x27;d run out of it way before I&#x27;d run out of the shampoo. Perhaps it&#x27;s better for short or thin hair. It didn&#x27;t make my damaged hair feel soft enough, so I returned to using my Dove conditioner instead (conditioners usually don&#x27;t contain sufates) . The combination of the Malibu shampoo and Dove conditioner really made my hair feel great. And the overpowering sweet smell I noticed before seemed to be tempered by the Dove conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried a packet of the crystals in the kit (100% vegan!) to remove hard water deposits, which it says to do once a week. You wet it and make a foam before applying to shampooed hair.  It sort of fizzed, and it actually stung a little on my scalp. I had a little stuck to my arm, and it stung there too. It did seem to leave my hair feeling very clean, but I&#x27;m not sure I need it too often, since the shampoo is supposed to perform a similar function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy the shampoo again, but I&#x27;ll be trying other brands too. Sulfate-free shampoos tend to cost more than standard shampoos, from $10 to $50.  My hairdresser didn&#x27;t think they were any better, but I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in the texture of my hair since using this Malibu shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve also found Giovanni shampoo and deep conditioner works great and makes my hair feel even softer!  The experiment continues.water deposits, which it says to do once a week. You wet it and make a foam before applying to shampooed hair.  It sort of fizzed, and it actually stung a little on my scalp.

    <li> This product really works to get the hard water stains out of your hair.  The conditioner is essential because the shampoo does leave your hair stripped.  I dont usually use conditioners but just use a small amount.  It isnt necessary to use the product everytime you wash your hair, just when you need that extra shine</li>
    <li> i have noticed that it dries my hair, definitely only use it once a week or once every 2....but my hair is brighter through the winter than would normally be.  I don&#x27;t color my hair and i have long blonde hair down to my middle back.  i take good care of it, very little blowdrying or heat styling.  it very well could also be the condition of my water as i try all sorts of different hair products that tend to either work for a time and fizzle or they are just DOA because i have hard water.  price isn&#x27;t bad because it will last you a while.  i still have yet to try the treatment that is included.  i will update my review when i get around to that.</li>
    <li> i have horrible well water and i&#x27;ve tried lots of clarifying shampoos and this product by far is the best! it gets all the nasty mineral residue out and leaves my hair the softest and shinest it&#x27;s ever been! hands down best product for its price. i do have to say though when i put the shampoo straight into my wet hair it didnt lather very well, but the next time i used alil of my old shampoo to help it lather and then the malibu shampoo, so there problem solved! love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this after my hair stylist recommended it.  She colors my hair, and my home has issues with hard water and sulfur at times.  I also use a lot of hair products on my hair when styling it.  This removes all the build-up and returns it to a nice natural sheen.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I am soooo happy with this product. It really makes a difference in the health of my hair. I will continue to use Malibu 2000 for water well systems so long as i live in the country. There is no better product.</li>
    <li> Smells like childrens chewable tylonal. If you can get past the smell its decent enough. But I just couldn&#x27;t...</li>
    <li> I just moved into a home that has really hard water and my hair looked terrible. While baking soda worked, it was a hassle and slightly rough on my hair (still better than the alternative) so I decided to try this and my hair looks normal again: it&#x27;s soft, not tangled, has body and shine. I highly recommend this although I&#x27;ve read how bad hard water is on all the plumbing so it&#x27;s probably a good idea to invest in a softener eventually.</li>
    <li> I recommend just getting the Hard Water packets because they really get the job done--the shampoo and conditioner isn&#x27;t really worth the money</li>
    <li> This set saved my hair. I am not kidding, I drove myself crazy over the last half year trying to find a solution to the hard water issue where I live that left my hair matted, stringy and dry. I wish I had just bit the bullet and bought this sooner. I don&#x27;t have problems anymore, my hair is super soft, shiny, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about matting or stringyness anymore! I&#x27;m not kidding when I say I will literally be buying this set for as long as I am living here. My only con to this shampoo in the long line of pros (It even smells good! Its orange scented) is that my hair doesn&#x27;t have much volume on its own if left to air dry. This is a pretty minor issue that can be fixed with a hair dryer, so I&#x27;m not crying over it. Five stars forever on this set, thanks Malibu!</li>
    <li> My parents have well water and after a time it was destroying my hair!! So I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. I was amazed at after the first use my hair felt normal again. This product works and is totally worth buying!!!! If I had anything negative to say about it, it would be that it dries your hair out a little after awhile but I use the crystals that come with this product once every couple of weeks and it helps with the dryness. I would definately recommend this product to a friend!!</li>
    <li> Like other shampoos where the sodium laureth sulfate (SLS) has been removed, this shampoo leaves my hair feeling tacky--not the desired effect if you have issues with hard water.  The hard water treatment product, however, (included with the shampoo and conditioner) is superb.  It leaves the hair feeling clean and looking shiny and healthy.  True even for greying hair.</li>
    <li> this shampoo cuts the brassines on my highlighted hair. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> After moving to a new city with hard water I have slowly noticed that my hair feels gunky and gross even when just washed.  This kit does the trick.  My hair is back to normal after a couple shampoos and the crystals also really made a difference as well.  It is expensive but it did not strip the color from my hair, which is color treated to cover grey, and left it soft and silky.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so much softer and it has body again! I would recommend this product to anyone with well water.</li>
    <li> This Saved Me From Having Unwanted Brassy Hair Due To Hard Water In A Temporary Housing Situatuon. The Weekly Treatment Is The Best!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Arrived very fast 3 days. Two washing&#x27;s and orange was gone without using additive, am saving it for when my hair turns brassy.Will buy again</li>
    <li> I ordered a product to make well water good for my hair and I received a product for swimmers.  Not happy with this product at all since I&#x27;m not a swimmer and don&#x27;t have to worry about chlorine in my hair.</li>
    <li> made a huge difference to my hair. highlights look awesome. no brassy tinges</li>
    <li> Only two days I&#x27;ve used this and my hair feels and looks way better if anyone has hard water and your hair is turning different colors this is a must have! even the miracle treatment is amazing!</li>
    <li> This product works well with keeping the rust/minerals out of my blonde hair...but too harsh for daily use. I was getting dry-badly damaged hair.  I only use this shampoo/conditioner once a week now and deep condition once a week as well.</li>
    <li> This works very well with washing away iron and other minerals from hair that is dulled by well water!</li>
    <li> The product both shampoo and conditioner provides great rejuvenation to hair after being exposed to harsh chemicals. The brown packets which are designed to take iron out did not do well for me because the iron in my hair is embedded in the strands deeply. In all fairness, I only tried one packet and with what is going on with my hair, I will most likely need to use three more and more processing time with heat to rid the rest of the hair of the iron build up. Overall, the entire product line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have hard well water.  This really helped my hair feel softer than other shampoo and conditioners.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  We have a lot of iron and mineral in our well water and being strawberry blonde you can imagine after a while what my hair looks like.  This makes my hair feel light and brings back the shine to it.  Great product!  And love the smell!</li>
    <li> Product works as described and removed the brassy tint from my hair with the first use of the crystal treatment. Be careful if you have sensitive skin, the treatment is fairly harsh and started to burn my scalp.</li>
    <li> Combined with the demineralizer weekly treatments, the shampoo and conditioner keep hard water deposits from building up on hair.  Color and highlights stay true until the next treatment.</li>
    <li> This works alright, if you have bleached your hair, it tones it out a bit more than I thought it would. My hair went from a yellow, to a very muted light ashe brown. And the smell of the shampoo and the conditioner is horrific. It just smells like really strong chemicals doesn&#x27;t leave your hair until you wash it out.</li>
    <li> My hair is definitely softer, not as frizzy, and look a lot healthier. The Shampoo and Conditioner smells good. I think it may have helped a little in lessening the brassy color that my hard water has been causing in my hair but no where near as much as I was hoping it would. Only downside to this product, it is actually harder to comb through my hair after getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> We moved to a home with a well and have hard water. I&#x27;ve been fighting the \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; hair from the iron and other elements in the water.  My hair was white when I lived in the city.  I&#x27;ve used several of the Malibu proucts trying to bring my hair back to the beautiful white color that it was. NONE of the Malibu products work on my hair.  I even had it applied professionaly and my hair was worse when I left the salon than when I got there.  The lady working on my hair even called a representative of the company for advise to no avail and I STILL had to pay for the treatment!  Needless to say I never went back and I absolutely do not recommend Malibu for white hair.  Sorry \\&quot;Mali-boo\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Dried out hair. Didn&#x27;t do what was promised . Regret purchasing. I Threw out packaging or i would have returned.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and the packets the most. Left hair very clean and even helped my other hair products seem to work better probably because it seemed to pull the build up on my hair off. Def recommend giving a try.</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with hard well water (copper) and tried all sorts of shampoos and home remedies and nothing seemed to help my hair, which was in poor shape. I tried this out and it was amazing, stripped all of the green copper and brassiness from my hair in one treatment. Thank you for a great product!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great - does exactly what it claims to do and results are apparent immediately. I stumbled onto this product after a Google search trying to figure out why my dark-brunette hair was taking on an orange shade since living in my current place. Turns out I have hard water (used a testing kit from Malibu Wellness and scored off the charts high), so I figured I&#x27;d give this stuff a try. Not only does it eliminate the orange hue, but it makes my fine, frizzy, curly hair nearly frizz-free and super soft. The shampoo and conditioner are great on their own, but the weekly treatments really amplify their effects.</li>
    <li> For a strawberry blonde the extra orangey stinky stuff that came out of my hair was unmistakably sulfur iron well water yucky! The brittle stick look was not working and after using the demineralization packet just once I could feel the soft wavy hair I thought was long gone. We also installed a kinetico well water filtration system and I still use these products for my hair with success. Not bad after going from hair salon to salon trying to fix my hair, bleaching it and cutting it 4 inches.</li>
    <li> I would give this product 10 stars if I could.  I&#x27;m not one to gush over hair products, but I&#x27;ve never had an experience this positive about any product where I just couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a review.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize how dull and brassy my hair had gotten over time due to well water, but my stylist said something about it and then recommended this product.  In one treatment, my hair became so much brighter and my highlights really popped.  I would go so far as to call it &amp;#34;luxurious&amp;#34;.  My hair is so soft and silky now, and the change was so dramatic, I feel like I&#x27;m wearing someone else&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s really that good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products I buy, however, this product actually exceeded my expectations.  Before buying, I read the reviews of others and most gave it excellent reviews.  I have iron in my water and even though I have a water filtration system it still leaves those deposits in my hair.  I have blond hair (with a little gray).  The water would turn it an orangey color, so every few months I would go get it colored or highlighted to help cover the orange shade.  But within a week the color would fade, or so I thought.  It wasn&#x27;t the water fading the color....it was the iron deposits covering my color.  Once I heard about this product I was excited to try it.  It truly performed as advertised.  The treatment packets are the star in this trio.  After one use, low and behold their was my blond hair again!!  I will definitely keep ordering this product and highly recommend it to anyone who is having the same issues I had.</li>
    <li> Always buy this with my hard water where I live.  The malibu packets take the rust right out of my hair.</li>
    <li> I live in an area with very hard water. I really hoped this would help. It smells wonderful but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and my hair didn&#x27;t feel as soft. I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste so I add a little bit to my other shampoo and conditioner (Fredderic Fekkai) and it seems to be a great mix.</li>
    <li> Wowza - great product that gets out water grunge. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have well water with a water softner...my daughter went to the beach and came home with the bottom half of her long blonde hair red. This takes it out and prevents mineral buildup in your hair.</li>
    <li> It does the job, cleaning the minerals especially iron.  It leaves your hair soft &amp; manageable. Good product with the price.</li>
    <li> love it works really  good nice looking great wonderful will order again good quality will recommend to friends that&#x27;s all</li>
    <li> I have hard well water and found that over time my blonde highlights would have a green tint. Trying other clarifying shampoos did not resolve this issue. My hairdresser actually used the product on my hair in the salon and it took care of the issue so I decided to make the purchase to have some at home. Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo!! Fast Shipping! Wonderful for highlighted hair, my color stayed fresh looking longer! Highly recommend to anybody that has hard water issues.</li>
    <li> Does the job....conditioner leaves hair dry....impossible to comb out...I have really long hair......and terrible water.  Otherwise it does the job with repeated washes.</li>
    <li> the treatment really works followed up by the shampoo and conditioner once a week for two weeks really works.  My hair does not tangle as much and is shinier and holds color better after it is dyed.</li>
    <li> Great sulfate-free product at an even better price! If you have well water, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but tangles my hair like crazy</li>
    <li> This product so far from what I&#x27;ve seen in the passed week of using it is amazing. My hair and scalp feel so much better. Not as dry, itchy or irritated as with other shampoos. I&#x27;ve only used the shampoo so far btw. My scalp feels like it can breathe again if that makes sense. It actually feels healthy. I hope and pray it stay this way. I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;ll feel after long term use but I must say so far I&#x27;m quite impressed. Thank you Malibu and thank you Amazon for selling this product as I have not seen it anywhere else. This is really good if you have hard water to help soften your scalp and  hair follicles. NOTE: most water nowadays is hard unless you live in places like Arizona, Florida and a few others that I&#x27;ve been to where the water was not hard.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t review products but I was impressed with the way this one worked.  After the first shampoo &amp; condition I felt a change. It removed iron an other minerals without stripping my hair of moisture.  The weekly treatment packets are a nice addition after swimming or spending the weekend at my boyfriends who has even worse water than I do. It keeps my blonde hair from becoming brassy or dark. Love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would have done without this stuff! If you have well water...try it! I cannot use any other shampoo than Malibu where I live. Well worth the price!</li>
    <li> The treatment seems to make a difference but the shampoo/conditioner - not so much. Ive gotten better results with other cheaper products</li>
    <li> the smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it works well</li>
    <li> I am highly impressed with this product! Even with a nice water softener and quality salt, my daughter and I were both experiencing a gross, sort of sticky residue in our hair. Hers was air drying crunchy, and we both had dull, lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after one use, we both look a million times better. Our hair is softer, and looks and feels healthy again! We used the crystals and the shampoo and conditioner, so I can&#x27;t say if it was one item or a combination of all. She has short hair and half a pack of crystals was plenty for her, while the whole pack was plenty for my long hair. I&#x27;m excited to use it a few more times and see if it gets even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the crystal treatment really aggrivated the eczema patches I have on the back of neck and behind my ears. It wasn&#x27;t bad enough to keep me from using it again, but it was an unpleasant surprise after using the shampoo with no discomfort. So beware if you have a bad outbreak on or around your scalp: it will burn!</li>
    <li> We have alot of sulfur and iron in our water and after using these products one time I could tell the difference. Good product at a very good price.</li>
    <li> We have hard water where we live and it takes the brassy color out of my hair ( I have blonde hair) it also makes my hair softer. I highly recommend this product if you have hard water where you live!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by my hair stylist and has helped to restore the shine and preserve the color from well water.&lt;br /&gt;The seller provided excellent service getting my order processed and sent with no delay.</li>
    <li> It did not work at all and I was only refunded 15.99 but I paid 28.99.  I absolutely would not recommend this product because it did nothing that it claimed and its going to cost you to find that out.  I won&#x27;t ever order anything from this place again!  RIP OFF!!!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this set but have been using the shampoo and conditioner for almost 2 months. I purchased them (for a MUCH higher price at my beauty salon). This price is very reasonable!&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser also has a well and she loves it. We&#x27;ve lived in our home for over 2 years (had city water before) and this is the first product that&#x27;s really made a difference in the condition of my hair (and I&#x27;ve purchased some expensive shampoos and conditioners trying to have just decent looking hair!) It is SO soft but still has all the body I&#x27;ve had in the past. I have fine hair and keep it highlighted. Before using the Malibu product, by the time I was ready to have my highlights done, I would have to have quite a bit cut off because of the damage. Now I can have just a trim and keep my hair a little longer like I used to. We had to have a water softener installed when we first moved in because the well water is so hard it was off the charts when we first had it tested. The salt from the softener is just one more mineral that added to my constantly dull hair.&lt;br /&gt;I know not everyone will benefit from this product because wells vary greatly. Hopefully, there are other products that you  can try that will be the answer to your well water problems.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have used every product under the sun for well water/hard water. Love, love this shampoo treatment, I use it every day. If you have well water, I recommend this product!!!</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning, falling out and breaking. It was very dry and brittle. After a few washes with this system my hair almost completely stopped falling out and it is much more manageable during the day. The softness has returned. Recommend to anyone with well water</li>
    <li> From my very first shower in our new home, which we bought in July 2011, I have HATED what the water did to my hair.  Within a week, I went to my hair stylist and asked her to chop off my long hair, since I could barely get a brush through it and it just felt terribly waxy and unmanageable.  She suggested I go get a shower water filter, which I did.  That helped a little, but I was still generally unhappy with how my hair felt and acted.  I have very thick, slightly course hair, and the hard water made it so I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it except for wear it in a pony tail (when it grew out again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while, but I got around to researching which type of shampoo might help with very hard water.  This Malibu shampoo came up in my search.  I read the reviews on Amazon, and decided to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my first shower, I immediately noticed a difference.  I could run my fingers through my wet hair in the shower, and it wasn&#x27;t a struggle to comb through it after!  With my second shower, my hair was left feeling much more soft, and it is shiny for the first time in over a year!  Why didn&#x27;t I look into shampoos for hard water sooner?!  I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo for a little over a week, and I love it.  I haven&#x27;t even tried the little packet that came with it, but haven&#x27;t needed to so far.  :)</li>
    <li> This product has good reviews and I think it depends on the kind of water you have and if your softener, etc. is working properly.  This shampoo smells good despite what some people said.  I cant honestly give a review because the water is not controlled yet and still having problems with the water itself.  I will say it did work a lot better than regular shampoo. Will try it again when the water system is fixed.</li>
    <li> This product dries out my hair... I was expecting it to mosturize my hair... Will not recommend it to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll throw my review on here as well! I moved from an area with great water. Our new place has really hard water with a lot of calcium and god knows what other minerals, but it blew out my zero water filter pitcher in just about nine days! I decided not to put a filter on my shower head because of that, and decided to give this shampoo and conditioner a try.  It took about three or four shampoos to notice a difference. I also used the packet and that is when my hair transformed! I can&#x27;t stop touching, it because it has never looked so good! I wash my hair every other day, and on the non wash days, it still looks shiny and clean! I&#x27;m very picky on the touch and feel of how shampoos work in my hair so that is why I decided to write a review, because normally shampoos have a lot of hype and no delivery, but this shampoo delivers! Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic!  Works great and smells good.  Helps to keep colored hair from turning brassy and brittle.  A must have for my hair care needs.</li>
    <li> This is the only hard water shampoo I have found that has been able to make my hair feel clean and fresh! After moving into a new apartment, I found the hard water made my hair feel greasy and dirty even after I just got out of the shower. This shampoo/powder works marvelously!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything to treat my well-water damaged hair. If anything, it stripped my hair of natural oils causing it to look fried. I&#x27;ll stick with regular clarifying shampoos and baking soda. Apple cider vinegar rinses does a better job than this kit.</li>
    <li> I use the \\&quot;weekly packets\\&quot; only about once every three weeks or before I color my hair.  If I use it weekly, it seems to lighten or remove my hair color.  We have a water softener and this seems to help remove any salt residue or mineral build up. My hair stylist recommended this product.  Some reviewers have mentioned how tangled their hair gets after using these products--I partially agree. I leave the packet of crystals on my hair for the full five minutes and follow the directions to use the shampoo and conditioner afterwards.  My chin length hair gets regular trims, but the ends still get dry--most likely from using haircolor and a flat-iron straightener. The ends get all tangled after the gel packet and shampoo, but the conditioner really helps. IMO, this product is best used before applying hair color or on a regular basis for non-colorers. Gel packets are NOT for natural gray hair. More frequent use &#x3D; better results/softer hair!</li>
    <li> Malibu Hair Care Making Water Well System Kit works well. The product really helped to improve the health of my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! we have well water where i live. After i tried this i have no problems. I recomend this to anybody with hard water.</li>
    <li> The water in my town was destroying my hair. This Malibu kit has helped to remove all of those harmful minerals. It can be drying if used too frequently, but necessary to get rid of that horrible build up.....for me, every couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve reordered this product many times!</li>
    <li> Not too impressed, I expected a better quality item. Disappointed with the shampoo &amp; conditioner. The products smell good but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this hair care product as our well water left her hair dry, course and stiff using her regular shampoo.  She is very happy that this product leaves her hair soft, shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> My hair felt great after just one use. It&#x27;s no miracle product, but I would say it&#x27;s the best thing for people with hard water and it has better ingredients that most shampoos.</li>
    <li> Bought these because we have very hard water. The shampoo lathered well. Hair felt very soft when dry. Package was sufficient and order came quickly.</li>
    <li> The Malibu hard water treatments (the small bronze &amp;#34;demineralizer&amp;#34; packets) really work. It corrected the brassy tones in my color-treated hair. It brightened and refreshed my look after one treatment. However, for me, the shampoo and conditioner did not boost any positive change for my hair. I used the Malibu shampoo and conditioner exclusively, with no treatment, for a couple of months. Maybe this was due to the type of hard water (city versus well) or my hair texture (wavy). My hair remained brassy until I finally used a Malibu hard water treatment packet. Then there was instant improvement. The effects lasted for about a week and a half, almost two weeks. I also tried a hard water treatment packet with another brand of shampoo/conditioner and had the same result. So in my case, the real winner was simply the treatment packets. (Seller: Intelligent Beauty Supply).</li>
    <li> Received this in no time, love the fruity smell. Lathered and rinsed out well and left hair soft and clean. Easy to comb out too! Hair does seem less brassy and brighter after just one use! Can&#x27;t wait to use once a week and see if it continues to get even better!</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s my situation:  I am living temporarily in a home that is on well water.  There is a water softener, but although the water feels &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s obvious there are lots of chemicals in it.  Salt and these other chemicals leave a residue on clothes, dishes, hair, skin.  I noticed that my hair was getting very limp, turning darker, and it felt like there was a coating on my hair.  I have brunette hair with gold highlights, and the highlights were turning orange.&lt;br /&gt;ONE use of the shampoo, treatment, and conditioner, and my hair came back to life.  My hair lightened up, was no longer limp, and you could see the highlights again.  The orangey color is disappearing after two washes.  I really like the treatment powder, but from the instructions it is only necessary to use once weekly, so I did not use it on the second wash.&lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased with this purchase and the total package costs less than the shampoo alone that I usually buy.  Another thing that&#x27;s nice is that it has a very subtle but nice smell, slightly citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering any woes from well water, or treated well water, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this.  If you color your hair, it does not harm your color; in fact, I think it helps.</li>
    <li> This item was did not work at all. It made my hair even more frizzy that it was to begin with. I would not suggest spending your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Only worked the first few times.  Then back to residue.</li>
    <li> After my hair was horribly damaged by hard water I found this and it transformed my hair within the first 4 weeks</li>
    <li> I really like the tropical scent of the shampoo and conditioner, the packets of treatments are a nice little addition but please leave in the bottled conditioner about 10 minutes after using the treatment or your hair will dry out!</li>
    <li> In 2 shampoos, my hair was as cleared of the old buildup which made it have no body. I will be a lifetime user.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how hard our water was until I started noticing orange ends on my hair.  After a salon treatment and highlights I started using these product religiously and my hair has not turned orange!  I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair in the bottom of the drain and my hair is fuller.  I also love the fact that there are no harsh chemicals.  Delivery could have come a little faster but I just need to plan ahead as this product is not sold in stores around my home.</li>
    <li> This product works well and works quick. I have used it on my daughters sandy brown hair and had immediate results. After the first packet, shampoo and conditioner, her blonde was back. We didn&#x27;t use heat with the packet, however I think it would be beneficial.</li>
    <li> I love the hard water weekly packets and have been using them for years.  I did not see any difference is the shampoo and conditioner.  my hair still turned somewhat brassy blonde with the shampoo but when I used the packets every 3 weeks I noticed quite a difference</li>
    <li> I moved to a state where hard water is an issue and this product worked wonders on the damage caused to my hair - I no longer need to use a detangler to brush through my hair after washing it and can notice that my hair color looks better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. Smelled nice though. Overpriced.</li>
    <li> I was hoping my hair would be softer but its not bad. Like the smell of it. Overall pretty good.</li>
    <li> I moved to an area that has THE worst smelly, iron filled, hard well water ever. For MONTHS and months my hair has had this weird waxy/oily build up around my scalp that made my hair look dirty, even after I washed it.  I always had to put extra dry shampoo or baby powder on my roots once my hair dried just to make it look somewhat presentable, that was helping to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;The  rest of my hair looked dull, limp and never really had any life or shine either and I could never figure out a fix. I tried clarifying , volumizing, thickening and anti-residue shampoos, nope, NOTHING worked. My hair looked TERRIBLE and was starting to turn ORANGE.&lt;br /&gt;After one use of the de-mineralizing crystals my hair immediately felt smoother, even while still wet, there were zero tangles.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner saved my hair, when I dried my hair, it had life, body, shine and no weird, waxy/oily build up around my scalp. My hair was so amazingly soft too and to my further amazement almost all the orange that was in my (dark brown) hair was gone!&lt;br /&gt;I was a little put off at first by the high price (over $40 +S&amp;H on the Malibu website) and unsure if it was really worth it, but if you have hard/well water this product is pretty much a must have to save your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is sold in the salon that I work for, I am very happy with it. And even more happy that it is much cheaper on Amazon!</li>
    <li> works well, did not really see results after first treatment even with the malibu but keep with it and you see results.</li>
    <li> The weekly treatment packets are great! The shampoo and conditioner are okay.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair feel so soft! I really like knowing that all the bad stuff in my water is being taken out by this product!</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves hair very soft and it&#x27;s natural! I would recommend this to anyone who has hard water. I noticed results after the first wash.</li>
    <li> My hair was turning orange/bronze thanks to iron in our water.  My hair stylist suggested this product and within a week, my hair looked and felt so much better!  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!!  It not only got rid of the ugly red tint, it made my hair so soft.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser suggested this as we have well water. She uses it before coloring my hair. It works excellent!</li>
    <li> My hair took a beating from all the hard water when I moved into my new house, and it began breaking off and collecting in large piles by the drain. Frightened and desperate, I tried this product because it had great reviews. However, it dried my hair out and made the breakage worse. Even the heavy conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough to balance the drying effects of the shampoo. It may have stripped my hair of the hard water, like it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it also stripped it of moisture and life. What I&#x27;ve learned from this painful hair experience is to avoid treating the result of the hard water and instead focus on treating the problem itself. I bought a filtered showerhead made by culligan and my hair is now back to normal. (I also have been using Redkin anti-snap leave in condition with protein to normalize my hair after Malibu left it so dry and brittle and course.)The shower head costs about 6 dollars more than this shampoo/condition pair and will last longer.  [[ASIN:B0006VVN1S Culligan WSH-C125 Wall-Mount 10,000 Gallon Capacity Filtered Showerhead, Chrome Finish]]. My advice is to just invest in the showerhead at the first sign of hard water damage and skip out on this product entirely.</li>
    <li> We have hideously hard well water, full of minerals and who knows what else. I used to have bright blonde hair before we moved to the house but my hair quickly turned green, dry, and brittle. So bad that my hair stylist had to cut me bangs just hide the breakage from the water and dye my hair darker to try and hide the green. It was a disaster. This stuff has been amazing. After one use, my hair was softer and my hair color was brighter and more natural looking than it&#x27;s been in over a year. It honestly feels like I have brand new hair, I am so relieved to have discovered this stuff, I will be a customer for life! (Or at least until we move somewhere with better water ;)....) My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture, this difference has been amazing.</li>
    <li> We had horrible water and this helped with keeping my hair from turning too orange.  Good product and a good price for all you get.  The packets work great.</li>
    <li> We have very hard water. I bought this shampoo and conditioner in the hopes that it would help condition and or moisturize my hair; however it did not seem to work for me and actually made my hair feel more stiff or dry.</li>
    <li> This product is actually just what I was looking for. I was considering buying an expensive, filtering shower head to help with my HARD well water but my father in law suggested I look for hair wash that helps with it. I ordered these and a little hesitant at first decided to try them. I must say I like the smell. I smell like Pinesol in the shower, but it&#x27;s actually nice and you get use to it. I do notice my hair smelling different. It just smells clean, but not like a chemical Pinesol clean. I started using it 4 days a week, and that is now too much so I use my Head &amp; Shoulders 2 days a week, and the other 2 days I use this. It is great and I will reorder again once I am out.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have very hard water and this lightweight, and vegan, product strips my hair of all of those heavy chemicals in my water!</li>
    <li> My experience with this has been no different from any other shampoo/conditioner. It wasn&#x27;t until I tried my free sample of Clear Damage and Color Repair Nourishing shampoo that my hair was soft and frizz free. I&#x27;ve since purchased a large bottle each of Clear Damage and Color Repair Nourishing shampoo and conditioner and thrown the Malibu in the trash.</li>
    <li> Great value and leaves the hair soft. A helpful tid bit of advice though, if you have wavy-curly hair use extra conditioner or have a good leave in conditioner on hand.</li>
    <li> I alternate weekly between this and Pantene for gray hair and love the results.  The fragrance is beautiful, too.</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery &amp; products performs as described.</li>
    <li> This product I really enjoyed. My hair was dry and rough feeling from the hard water and using this it made it softer and not so orange. It also smells really good :)</li>
    <li> I was very worried to order this &amp;#34;shampoo and conditioner&amp;#34; over the internet but it was recommended I do something for my &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34; hair by my salon. It was our well water reaking havic with my hair. I used this just one day and the &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; look and feel was GONE! Can&#x27;t wait to use it for a week to see the results. I do have highlights so waiting to use the weekly treatment and see if it helps the &amp;#34;blonde&amp;#34; not turn brassy.</li>
    <li> I am very happy this this kit! It smells great and sure helps get rid of the rusty color building up in my hair!</li>
    <li> I didnt like the feel of my hair after using this product. The smell was not too good either, my husband said it smelled like childrens bayer aspirin.</li>
    <li> I have highlighted blonde hair that turns yellowish due to well water.  I think because my hair is chemically lightened, this product dried my hair out a good deal.  I used the shampoo, conditioner and the packets of treatment as well.  It did take out the yellow tones, but as I said, it dried my hair out.</li>
