<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was chosen to test and review this product for free in exchange for an unbiased opinion. I needed a mirror for my shower. I have had some in the past and they get all fogged up and you can&#x27;t even see in them. This one isn&#x27;t like that at all. I can see in it the whole time I am in the shower. My husband uses it to shave and he loves it. We have it hanging from the shower head and it is perfect!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> ReflectXL by Mirror On A Rope is a pretty decent size shower mirror at a whopping 7 5/8″ x 5 5/8″. It is certainly one of the largest I have owned, though it is a really nice size for the shower wall. It is fogless, if you follow what the brand encourages you to do. They recommend rinsing it off with the shower head at the beginning and you shouldn&#x27;t have any other issues. I have not yet had it fog up on me.&lt;br /&gt;Each mirror comes with a stainless steel, long lasting hook, to hang the mirror wherever you wish in the shower on the wall. I found the mirror to be made with durability in mind. It seems strong and yes I dropped it once in the shower and nope, not a crack, scratch and it definitely didn’t shatter like I had expected. They do say it is shatterproof since it is made of an acrylic material, but you never know until you try it and then you have to worry. But I took the worry out for you. I accidentally dropped it and its perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;It was easily movable in the shower to be located where I needed it to be for different things. My boyfriend uses it everyday and loves it. It comes in four colors. A standard silver, green, red and blue. The one I have is the standard silver and I like the sleek, modern look of it.&lt;br /&gt;If you’re looking for a great fogless shower mirror that is durable and built to be shatterproof, I honestly think this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a shower mirror to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own.</li>
    <li> Mirror quality is good!  I used a glass mirror for a long time but never felt safe.  Good product; great value!</li>
    <li> This is so much more than a shower mirror. I got to Try this for my unbiased review at a discount. This is my 100% own review. This is not a glass mirror  but a hard plastic material so no need to worry about about brakes in the shower. It comes with a stainless steel hook that sticks to,the shower wall and holds very well. I likes to shave int eh shower so I had him try out the no fog part of this mirror. He said that if you follow the instructions and warm the mirror in the water first that it does work very well. I on the other hand like,this mirror because I can take it out of the shower and use it to pluck my eyebrows with.</li>
    <li> Useful tool. Should have 2 hangers instead of 1.</li>
    <li> This performs well in the shower as long as you keep the mirror close the temperature of the water. The size is just about perfect for me, I would assume my face is slightly larger than average which would make this good for most people.</li>
    <li> Decent shaving mirror does not fog too bad. Still has some shadows who shaving but Decent.</li>
    <li> I received the shower mirror and was very anxious to try it.  I have purchased other shower mirrors in the past, including some with radio combinations. and have never been satisfied as they never seem to last.  My husband likes to shave in the shower which helps to keep the sink less messy, so I was hoping this would be the solution.  I read the directions careful and peeled off the protective coating.  The mirror comes with a clip with backing and an extra long cord which can be adjusted.  We bypassed the clip and just adjusted the cord.  The mirror stayed fog free throughout the shaving process.  It gave a clear image and my husband claimed it made shaving so much easier.  Basically, he can play the radio separately as we have now found the solution to the mirror problem.  I would have never thought a simple mirror like this would have done the trick.  Bells and whistles are not necessary.  I recommend this mirror as it does the job.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> It is made of plastic, not stainless.  I&#x27;m not sure why I need to make up a required word count.  As Shakespeare said, &amp;#34;Brevity is the soul of wit.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The product description suggested a polished sheet of stainless steel, which I feel is commensurate with the price, but it&#x27;s just a piece of lexan with a reflective backing--hardly a product with an expensive manufacturing process justifying a premium price.

    <li> Needed something for shaving in the shower that wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; and yet large enough to fit my &amp;#34;face / mug&amp;#34; for shaving. This is perfect. Big enough to see and give myself a good shave. Yeah, it still fogs up - but a quick run under the warm water and it&#x27;s perfect. Very happy with it. And LOVE the rope idea - as I hang it from the shower head and then rest in on my Shower Shelf hanging below the shower head.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who likes to shave in the shower.  Seems to work well.  Removing the protective covering was a bit tricky but it came off easily after I was able to peel off a corner with the help of a pin.</li>
    <li> works great and is easy to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> This fogless mirror is awesome. It is nice and sturdy and has a nice and classy look. It comes with a hook to hang it on the shower. Also it has a long adjustable paracord to adjust according to the height. It is about 5&#x27; long. It if frameless and looks really great in your shower. It is fogless and shadow less when it used according to the directions stated in the package. the thread allows you to adjust and avoid shadows. It is made out a scratch resistance material which is very good, normally mirrors gets scratched and spoiled and unfit to use in the course of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower mirror is of good quality compared other fogless mirror. The fogless coating tends to go away After few days. But this works perfect. This is a great product for all those who like to have a mirror in their shower. I recommend this product to all. I received this product free in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Great for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a rather useful shower mirror. My husband loves it and shaves a LOT more since it&#x27;s easier for him in the shower. I really like it too and find it useful when using a facial scrub. It stays clear long enough and only requires a quick dousing once you&#x27;ve started.</li>
    <li> Good product. Mirror is very clear. The adjustable rope provides flexibility in placement and makes it easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s light so even if I hold it in my hand the whole time it&#x27;s nothing.  And the mirror is very clear.</li>
    <li> Works well! Only complaint, is the printed graphic on the back. I thought that it was actual metal, but it&#x27;s just a photo of stainless steel and has a slight pinkish tint to it. Hard to tell from the photo. I would have just preferred solid black or white instead. Hopefully it&#x27;s durable enough for regular use; if that decal on the back scratches, there goes your mirror. Basically a reflective decal stuck to plexiglass.</li>
