      <li>I am crossing my fingers that I will be able to continue buying this.</li>
      <li>Great hair product for asian hair - very strong hold with no shine.</li>
      <li>could I style my hair - all it did was put it full of electricity!</li>
      <li>Item arrived very quickly and as promised.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, shapable, and doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I need.</li>
      <li>The Concrete has a really good hold with a matte look.</li>
      <li>Good stuff, gives nice hold for all day, any day better than other cosmetic brands.</li>
      <li>i enjoy this a lot.  </li>
      <li>moreover, it&#x27;s LIGHT (plastic and the &amp;#34;concrete&amp;#34; itself)</li>
      <li>My hair looks full again and has style with a full head of hair!</li>
      <li>I have loved this for a long time and glad I can find it again.</li>
      <li>and I go for a pretty wacky style that requires a lot of hold</li>
      <li>Almost through my first jar, will be ordering more.  </li>
      <li>I mostly like it for the great natural looking hold, matte finish and clean with nearly no scent.</li>
      <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through more than 10 different types and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Product offers great hold with a natural looking finish.</li>
      <li>have recently gone to using natural products and this is great.</li>
      <li>provides a strong hold without the glossy finish, which gives it a natural look.</li>
      <li>works great and need only a little to apply for strong hold.</li>
      <li>This product works really well!</li>
      <li>Favorite hair product for short hair!</li>
      <li>You can also fix your hair right back into place if strong wind or something messes it up.</li>
      <li>It adds an awesome texture to your hair, doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or wet, and your hair isn&#x27;t gross the next morning when you wake up.</li>
      <li>I have fine, Asian kinda hair</li>
      <li>This product is absolute perfection, no exaggeration.</li>
      <li>it does its purpose very well, holds and not greasy.</li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair</li>
      <li>For hair like mine, this product really does the trick.</li>
      <li>It absolutely keeps your hair where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely keeps your hair where you wanted it,</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;ll more or less stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I went on an open speedboat and was able to fix my hair back into place after that.</li>
      <li>I need literal concrete for the hair miracles I want.</li>
      <li>stuff gives better hold than anything else I have ever used, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff like gel or hairspray.</li>
      <li>I love this product to add fullness at the roots and to tame flyaways where my hair is feathered towards my face.  </li>
      <li>So if you happen to walk through a major wind storm that messes up your hair, you can quickly put it back where you want it and it will stay there.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>hair is still soft.  </li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels natural.</li>
      <li>It leaves hair soft and re-workable.</li>
      <li>I love the scent (although I can&#x27;t describe it), and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product but not for hair that&#x27;s more than a few inches long.</li>
      <li>Very sticky but also a very dry look, like a clay.  </li>
      <li>It is strange using this at first due to the texture.</li>
      <li>I almost had a heart attack when I first found out they discontinued it, but they&#x27;ve brought it back from the dead, thankfully.</li>
      <li>It is increasingly more difficult to find heavy duty products to handle my super thick, straight hair.</li>

<li> Also it seems to not wash out completely meaning I can use less the next day.</li>
<li> Gives decent hold but is certainly not a super holding finish as other brands like Dfi are.</li>
<li> It works like a champ...adds body and thickness, holds without being sticky or stiff, allows you to restyle as the days goes on, doesn&#x27;t get shiny or crunchy and looks very natural.</li>
<li> I will continue using this as long as they make it.</li>
<li> gives that dry look.</li>
<li> I could not live without this product.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t end up with that greasy wet</li>
<li> However, you can get a wet look from it by applying to wet hair.</li>
<li> This one is stickier and harder to work with.</li>
<li> If it&#x27;s stubborn, just wet your fingers a bit</li>
<li> Exactly as expected and shipped on-time.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way,</li>
<li> Only problem is, it&#x27;s hard to shampoo out</li>
<li> and I am a selfish person who wants it to myself</li>
<li> and it can sort of weigh down and flatten my style now.  </li>
<li> No strong smells and it holds extremely well.</li>
<li> A little thicker than I had anticipated</li>
<li> and now I&#x27;m finding this product to be heavy</li>
<li> Once it gets past 2 or 3 inches it can get a little clumpy.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Favorite hair product for short hair!</li>
    <li> No strong smells and it holds extremely well.</li>
    <li> dont buy it.  That way I can have it all.  Cmon, please.  Please do not buy this because I like it and I am a selfish person who wants it to myself</li>
    <li> I almost had a heart attack when I first found out they discontinued it, but they&#x27;ve brought it back from the dead, thankfully. For hair like mine, this product really does the trick.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product for awhile so I am so happy to see the results today when it arrived! My hair looks full again and has style with a full head of hair! Love,love,love this product won&#x27;t ever be without it again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Thank you!</li>
    <li> A little thicker than I had anticipated and it can be a bit difficult to remove from hair if you have not worn it for long (8+ hours)</li>
    <li> Good product.  My hair looks and feels natural. Good hold. It doesn&#x27;t cause more static electricity for me, it helps that problem.</li>
    <li> The Concrete has a really good hold with a matte look. Only problem is, it&#x27;s hard to shampoo out and it doesn&#x27;t smell great. Other than that, great product.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately  I thought I was getting a &amp;#34;Putty&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;concrete&amp;#34;strength product. I purchased three jars; can I exchange two</li>
    <li> provides a strong hold without the glossy finish, which gives it a natural look. would buy again. as a guy with relatively short hair, this lasts me for around 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> It absolutely keeps your hair where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely keeps your hair where you wanted it, two days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are going to want to buy some clarifying shampoo, because this stuff does not come out.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells but it doesn&#x27;t come out of your hair very easily.</li>
    <li> i enjoy this a lot.  read reviews before buying and am quite satisfied.  moreover, it&#x27;s LIGHT (plastic and the &amp;#34;concrete&amp;#34; itself) so i can carry it around all day in my bag (eg gym bag) if i want.</li>
    <li> Has a semi matte finish on the hair. Gives decent hold but is certainly not a super holding finish as other brands like Dfi are. You can rinse in shower and recomb to reactivate the paste. Smells good but not quite the hold my son was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is most definitely my favorite hair product. I have very wavy hair and I go for a pretty wacky style that requires a lot of hold (I go for the David Tennant / Tenth Doctor look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff gives better hold than anything else I have ever used, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling stiff like gel or hairspray. It leaves hair soft and re-workable. So if you happen to walk through a major wind storm that messes up your hair, you can quickly put it back where you want it and it will stay there. If it&#x27;s stubborn, just wet your fingers a bit and it will style easily again! Also, this has a matte finish so you don&#x27;t end up with that greasy wet look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to decide between this and Alterna&#x27;s FORM sculpting clay from the Bamboo line - these are basically identical. The only difference I can find is the smell and the price. But both are fantastic!</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff!  Works great.  Almost through my first jar, will be ordering more.  Great hold but hair is still soft.  Wish I had this years ago!!!</li>
    <li> Item arrived very quickly and as promised.  Product offers great hold with a natural looking finish.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I need. I need literal concrete for the hair miracles I want.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, shapable, and doesn&#x27;t look greasy. Only use a tiny, tiny amount or things will get unruly.</li>
    <li> It is increasingly more difficult to find heavy duty products to handle my super thick, straight hair. This product works really well! I used to use Sebastian Xtah Crude Clay, but when that got switched around, I started using this and it works great. I am crossing my fingers that I will be able to continue buying this. If this one goes away, I have no idea what else I will use.</li>
    <li> I love this product to add fullness at the roots and to tame flyaways where my hair is feathered towards my face.  Have not found ANYTHING that works as good.  Thank goodness for Amazon because I can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
    <li> Good hold and adjustment after application. Also, it does feel or look greasy. However, you can get a wet look from it by applying to wet hair. I mostly like it for the great natural looking hold, matte finish and clean with nearly no scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product, I get it all the time now!  I&#x27;ve gone through more than 10 different types and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have loved this for a long time and glad I can find it again.</li>
    <li> Hemp aside, this stuff is in my opinion the best hair product for fine hair that there is.  Very sticky but also a very dry look, like a clay.  Not greasy at all.  You can basically style short hair however you want and it&#x27;ll more or less stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever stop making this stuff I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do.</li>
    <li> The only bad thing about this stuff is that it&#x27;s hard to get out of your hair. Seriously, that&#x27;s it. Beyond that, it&#x27;s the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It works like a champ...adds body and thickness, holds without being sticky or stiff, allows you to restyle as the days goes on, doesn&#x27;t get shiny or crunchy and looks very natural. A little goes a long way, so experiment as you go. Oh yeah, I do find it works better when my hair is a bit shorter. Once it gets past 2 or 3 inches it can get a little clumpy.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for asian hair - very strong hold with no shine.</li>
    <li> They discontinued this product a year or so ago and I just found it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is seriously the bees knees. It adds an awesome texture to your hair, doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy or wet, and your hair isn&#x27;t gross the next morning when you wake up.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a replacement for a beloved and discontinued product and this is the closest I&#x27;ve come to it.  I started using it when I had a very short pixie cut and it creates a nice piecey look.  However, I&#x27;m letting it grow a bit and now I&#x27;m finding this product to be heavy and it can sort of weigh down and flatten my style now.  I would recommend this product but not for hair that&#x27;s more than a few inches long.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, gives nice hold for all day, any day better than other cosmetic brands.</li>
    <li> one of my favorite hair waxes, smells good too!</li>
    <li> it does its purpose very well, holds and not greasy. i purchased another</li>
    <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
    <li> Great styling with this creme.</li>
    <li> works great and need only a little to apply for strong hold. gives that dry look. can get oily and hard to wash out tho.</li>
    <li> Works just like the the product I purchased in store.</li>
    <li> This product is absolute perfection, no exaggeration. I have fine, Asian kinda hair that&#x27;s thin. This product simultaneously holds my hair in place all day, gives it texture, body and a nice matte finish. You can also fix your hair right back into place if strong wind or something messes it up. I went on an open speedboat and was able to fix my hair back into place after that. Wow!</li>
    <li> Definitely NOT the same thing as the bamboo style product from Alterna. This one is stickier and harder to work with.</li>
    <li> Never used such a horrible hair product - no way could I style my hair - all it did was put it full of electricity!</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the Got To Be Glued hair glue that I have been using for years.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently gone to using natural products and this is great. It is strange using this at first due to the texture. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff like I was used to, this isn&#x27;t a bad thing, It allows me to re-form my hairdo if i prefer. Also it seems to not wash out completely meaning I can use less the next day. I will continue using this as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> If you have fine hair, this product thickens it up wonderfully. I love the scent (although I can&#x27;t describe it), and a little goes a long way. Been using this stuff for years. It holds like mad, and looks matte (not greasy). I pray they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I could not live without this product. Does amazing stuff on your hair.</li>
    <li> Been using this Hemp for about 25 years and love it. The price was the best I&#x27;ve seen in years.</li>
    <li> Exactly as expected and shipped on-time.</li>
    <li> Best product ever for short trendy cuts, memory hold, wear it, sleep in it wake up and go, time saver</li>
