<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Best styling product on the market!  Great for scrunch without stiffness</li>
    <li> I have always been satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;This time was no different</li>
    <li> I have short hair and Sexy Hair Balm makes styling my hair very easy, Just a little bit rubbed into your hair to shape and style and my hair is good for the day!</li>
    <li> i ordered the wrong thing but just kept it and it sucks! if you like rocker hair stay away from this crap, this will give you slick soft fairy hair!!  i was trying to order big sexy hair and it works great but its way way overpriced.  check out got to be glued.. its awesome for only like $4.88 at walmart.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a beauty product before. But this hair pomade is different and worth the money. For hair that isn&#x27;t as thick as it used to be, it creates a thick look. It&#x27;s a sort of gluey gunk; you have to wash it off your hands. But it makes medium length hair stand up (giving you \\&quot;high\\&quot; hair) without that stiff look. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Just realized I forgot to post a review for this product.  I love it!  I use to surf on the East Coast and totally love that this allows me to sport the same \\&quot;after surf\\&quot; look that I had for years.    I first thought that I would use up the small container quick, but it lasted for a few months.  DOPE.  Love it</li>
    <li> Another haircare product that has none of the powerful hold that the label implies, and it doesn&#x27;t come cheap. What a great scam, haircare products are.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product...I use it every day!!  It gives me definition and pizazz and if it ever goes away, I will just die!  (Not really...but I will be VERY disappointed)!</li>
    <li> Great product. My favorite hair product. Really helps to style the hair and keep it in shape for the day. And what a great price.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with a big/short and sexy hair product. No matter what product it is I am always satisfied!</li>
    <li> The consistency of this is sticky.  You don&#x27;t need much to style your hair but it does the trick!</li>
    <li> I went from long hair to a super short cut and I was looking for products to make styling my hair easy in the morning. I bought this balm and a bottle of gel foam from the same brand and I love them. I just slide this stuff through my hair and style. It holds throughout the day while my hair doesn&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s movement. Washes off easily with warm water.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend this to anyone...</li>
    <li> Just seriously do not buy this b.s. smelly, slimy, gross. I almost threw up when I opened it. I wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and excellent price!!</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended it to me and since then I have not bought any other product.  It is excellent.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this product. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
    <li> This product works awesome, on my fine hair.  Not to heavy or thick on my hair, works great!!!!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I recently got a pixie cut, after having had long hair all my life.  This opened up a whole new world of styling issues.  Having previously experimented with mousses, gels, pastes, and hairsprays, I was never quite happy with how my hair looked.  So I was pretty desperate when I came across this product while doing a search on amazon.com, and am so glad I did!  From the day I received this little jar in the mail, I have been hooked!  My hair looks fantastic!  It looks shiny and healthy, and falls exactly how I want it to.... I can even finger comb my hair throughout the day if I want to, without having to worry about residue forming on my hair like with some products.  I absolutely love this stuff!  (As a side note, when I walked in to see my hair dresser for a trim, she remarked on how good my hair looked and immediately asked me what product I was using!!)</li>
    <li> I love this product.... I have short thick hair and &amp;#34;Quick change&amp;#34; keeps my hair manageable.</li>
    <li> i use this on dry hair, rub in my hands and apply from the roots out. gives me lift and volume without being sticky, waxy or dull.</li>
    <li> Short Sexy Hair is a great product.  I have used it for years and love.</li>
    <li> A little drop can make thin hair full and piecey looking. Define and texturize. Why they discontinued this product baffles me, I couldn&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
    <li> Great sculpting, curls and set. Does take away some shine, though.</li>
    <li> I have longer hair so I use this to separate my curls when I want thick sexy hair. Plus it smells great and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel heavy</li>
    <li> I have used BED HEAD MANIPULATOR for years.  After I was a little disappointed when TiGi changed the formula, a friend of mine said to try this product because it is less expensive and about the same consistency.  It did not fill the HUGE shoes of my reliable Manipulator.  I returned the Sexy Short hair and ordered the Manipulator.  Even the new formula is better than the Sexy Short Hair.  The texture is thicker and it smells better :).  I did like the price of the Sexy Short Hair though!  Oh well - somethings are worth paying the money for.</li>
    <li> I have used Quick Change on my hair for years. It is no longer available in stores, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything that matched it. So when I saw it on Amazon with a good price, I ordered it right away. It was here 2 or 3 days earlier than had been estimated. I am so glad to have found it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a long tiime. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff . Works on short hair.!</li>
    <li> It seemed like the product was watered down compared to what I have purchased from Ulta.  I am still using it, it&#x27;s just not as thick.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and wanted a lightweight pomade that would allow me to refresh my hair style in the middle of the day. While Quick Change smells good and is easy to wash out of your hair, it is definitely not lightweight.</li>
    <li> I love the entire line.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that works in my hair and doesn&#x27;t make it feel or look greasy. it is great!</li>
    <li> I try not to be vain , but to no avail . I am one good looking man and I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of beauty products , but this is one of the exceptions. It makes my hair look and feel the way I want it ,(sexy), without being obvious I am using anything at all. It keeps my perfect hair looking perfect all day long , and sometimes several days long , ( my wife loves the manly smell of an un-bathed man). It not only works on my luscious mane , but I sometimes lather it on my chest and back hair to give it that &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34; look that drives the ladies crazy. So , finally , a hair product for the perfect man , who likes his hair to match his personality &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I like this product &amp; I would recommend buying it on Amazon as it&#x27;s more expensive in stores.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it.  One of my favorite things about this product is that when I fall asleep (and not showering before bed) I can wake up with some really cool looking second day hair.  I love great second day hair.</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the past and had a difficult time finding it in the stores locally.  I am using it on dry hair, as opposed to wet like I did in the past.  WOW....to my surprise out came the natural curl of my hair and it wasn&#x27;t all stiff and sticky!  You just need to use a very small amount, rub it between your hands then pat your hands together to get the fiber then apply sparingly!</li>
    <li> Bought 3 of these because it was such a good deal. Same as the ones sold in your local WM or beauty supply shop just a much better price. Arrived quickly as promised.</li>
    <li> I purchase Quick Change regularly.  Was told the product was being discontinued.  The consistency is normally thicker than what I received.  I  was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used SHORT SEXY HAIR QUICK CHANGE SHAPING BALM for two years. I have always bought it a local hair salon.  It&#x27;s typically rather thick and is tacky on the hands, but works magic when rubbed into my short hair.  HOWEVER, when I ordered this product from this particular supplier, the shaping balm that showed up was rather runny with very little ability to shape hair.  I ordered two containers because the price was significantly cheaper than the salon.  I tossed them and purchased a new container of Shaping Balm at the salon.</li>
    <li> When we purchased the product locally, it was great.  We purchased four containers from this provider because the price was so reasonable, but the product is not as thick nor effective for styling short hair.  We do not plan to purchase this product from this retailer again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, the product arrived on time, without any problems.</li>
    <li> LOVE this gel. Only use a dime-sized dab on hair. Helps it hold style for days.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  Work a tiny bit into short, damp hair for plenty of hold without looking greasy.  Looks natural and lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Sticky, runny, and completely useless.  I&#x27;ve liked their products in the pas but this was a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, great price!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by it.  He usually buys it elsewhere, but Amazon had better price and timely shipping.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Today was the first time that I have tried this. Believe that I put a little more than necessary,but I have had it on for about 5 hours now  and my hair still looks great.  When I realized that I had put on too much I grabbed my brush and restyled my hair. It went back exactly like it was supposed to be . I went from having long straight hair for the past 5 years to a really short style. I knew that I would need different styling products,and the market is flooded with soooooo many products, that it makes it crazy trying to figure out what to use.  After doing some research I decided to give this product a try.  Sooooo glad that I did. Btw, I have very thick and color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I just got my hair cut into a fairly short style because I was SERIOUSLY tired of my 45-minute routine of blow drying/flat ironing that it took when I had a bob. My stylist suggested this product, and, though I&#x27;ve only had the chance to use it once since it arrived, I&#x27;m loving it! It made all the difference verses the mousse I had to use while waiting for this to come in! It gave my hair much more body and hold once I&#x27;d styled it. Some water to dampen my hair, a dab of this balm, a quick blow dry, and a spritz of a spray my stylist also suggested, and I was good to go for the rest of the day! *LOL* For once, I was actually able to come fairly close to what I looked like when I walked out of the salon after my haircut! Again, this is only based on one use, so I&#x27;ll edit if necessary, but five stars so far!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Larger than I expected  too!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dry, using only a small amount this product made my hair greasy. Nothing like the paste which I&lt;br /&gt;love!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my short hair.</li>
    <li> I just received this product today.  Immediately, I washed and dried my hair, eager to try Quick Change out.  I am not disappointed at all.  This stuff made me love my cropped haircut.  It is not greasy or heavy.  Washed right off my hands with water, and holds my Halle Berry-styled hair in place.  Five stars.</li>
    <li> this product is the only kind available on the market and meets up to the name it implies.</li>
    <li> This has worked well on my short razored bob.  It keeps it straight and looking &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; all day.  My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, and it has a tendency to get some annoying waves in it.  This pomade helps tame those waves.  Be aware it is a very sticky pomade.  A little goes a long way. I apply when damp then blow dry.</li>
    <li> Ew smells like stink bugs..</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying I&#x27;m not fashion savvy, nor do I know how to style my hair. I recently got it cut off, 20 inches down to 3 inches of hair, so I figured there&#x27;s nothing to it. I don&#x27;t need to style my hair--there&#x27;s hardly anything there right?..WRONG. Apparently I have the worst case of bed head with this short do, so my stylist recommended this product for quick easy styling. It actually works, I just haven&#x27;t figured out how to NOT put a handful in, trust me you don&#x27;t need very much. It feels pretty gross at first, but surprisingly as you work it in it becomes almost lotion like and very soft on the hands, doesn&#x27;t stink either. Needless to say, it&#x27;s saved this town from a few horrendous hair days by yours truly. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, long or short hair. Why didn&#x27;t I find this sooner?..</li>
    <li> Very light and not greasy in the hair.  Easy to use also.  Love this product!  Good price also compared to shops.</li>
    <li> This product is a fabulous product for sculpting your hair.  It keeps everything in place, with lots of holding power.  Great delivery time.</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;quick change&amp;#34; for the first time, and was SO pleasantly surprised at the results. The other SSH I had was blue, but this one is white. It appears to provide a better hold. My hair co-operated better, and behaved according to my rules instead of what it wanted to do. I think I&#x27;ll order &amp;#34;quick change&amp;#34; again next time. Also, it&#x27;s less expensive.</li>
    <li> I used Rewind for years for my short, thick,layered curly/wavy hair.  I like the Quick Change better because: 1) It makes my hair as easy to style (wash and go) as Rewind does; 2)It does not dry out my hair like Rewind does; 3) It makes my hair shiny (Rewind makes it very dull). Plus, you can get it for a great price on amazon (It&#x27;s over $16 at salons).  I love this product!  If you have hair like mine, I suggest Redken Fresh Curls shampoo and conditioner, lightly towel dry, then apply a tiny amount of this. That&#x27;s another big advantage--it takes so little of this product. I estimate I apply, at most, 1/8 tsp. to my hair.</li>
    <li> This product  has light hold and great shine! I love all the sexy hair products! Buy it now while it lasts!</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have extremely fine, wavy hair. I can just rub this product in my hair, tousle it, and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
    <li> It must be old. Not good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Quick Change Shaping Balm for a few months now ever since switching from a medium-length cut to a very short cut. I love, love, love it! First, let me just say: \\&quot;Sexy Hair\\&quot; &#x3D; dumb, dumb brand name. But don&#x27;t let it put you off - they make good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and tends to get dry and frizzy without proper care. This sticky gunk does a great job of giving short cuts casual texture and definition and preventing frizz. The container is smallish, but you need only a very small amount each time. I usually apply it to damp hair, but it works extremely well on dry hair as well. I use a little dab - maybe half a teaspoon - and work it through roots to ends. If I want more control, I&#x27;d use a little more on the ends. It&#x27;s important not to use too much or your hair will feel a icky and look a little greasy. The trick is using just enough gunk to shape your style and contain fly-aways. What I love most about this product is that it provides a flexible, natural-looking hold that lasts all day. Amazing. Quick Change is white but is colorless when applied. I am in love with the fragrance: it&#x27;s sort of industrial-lemon. Fresh and zingy, but not overpowering or floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container looks different from what you see here. They really need to update the photo. The new container has a clear outer layer of plastic and if I fumble and drop it that external layer invariably cracks. I&#x27;ve noticed this brittle outer layer will crack in the mail, too, if not wrapped up securely. Small design issue there, but the product itself is in an inner compartment so it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
    <li> Works great and a great price.  I took a chance on this product because I have used other &amp;#34;SHORT SEXY&amp;#34; products.  This stuff works great it holds my hair without being really stiff, lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair either.  I&#x27;ve tried many products and this stuff works the best.  If you want to increase stiffness you can add the short and sexy &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; over this stuff, I have no need to do that.</li>
    <li> all the Short Sexy Hair products are great for short, fine hair</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I use it every day after styling my hair.  It gives my hair the &amp;#34;messy casual&amp;#34; look I like and replaces sticky hairspray! I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used MANY products over the years and this one tops them all.  I recently cut my hair short and knew I needed something to keep it tamed.  I do not like stiff nor sticky product...so one is perfect.  You can style it over and over again.  I do not use any type of heating element on my hair when I use this, fyi.  I can&#x27;t go a day without using it.  My only suggestion would be to start with just a little bit, rub your fingers together and lightly place through the parts of your hair that you want control of...then add a little bit more, if needed.  I wouldn&#x27;t start with too much.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every product of this type.. mainly high-end.  This puts the others to shame. It really does create your style and keep it in place.  It&#x27;s perfect in tandem with Short Sexy Play Dirty Spray.</li>
    <li> I will never go back to hair gel, this stuff is great and keeps my hair from getting &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; like it does with gel, but keeps it in place.</li>
    <li> Love how this teases my hair too. Very unique not like a gel, not like a mouse.  Works into my fair very well for a good styled look.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product.  Can style my hair without it looking stiff or greasy.</li>
    <li> I have never reviewed a beauty product before..It smells good! And it washes out very easily. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have uses this product for a couple of years now. I wear my hair short and spiked. It keeps the spikes up and is not greasy. Works the way I want it to.</li>
    <li> My order was shipped very quickly. I could not find it in stores. The reason I &amp;#34;liked it&amp;#34; was because it had a little more liquid in it than the normal Quick Change I had bought from local stores, but I do not think it was the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d be able to re-shape my hair as the day wore on.  That didn&#x27;t happen, as a matter of fact, this is a little heavy for my hair.</li>
    <li> This use to be my go-to, did they change the formula?  It was no where near the consistency I am used to with this product.  I had been using Matrix Fiber Shuffle, but once that was discontinued, I was looking for something new..</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product when I had my shoulder length hair cut VERY short. The price in our local Walmart was double the price of Amazon. I use it everyday. Perhaps the people who are disappointed are using way too much.It only takes a very small dot or two to create definition and pizazz. Apply to the roots with your finger tips and work gently through with fingers. Absolutely great product. Just experiment with very small amounts to see what works for you. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product in my hair for awhile and i really like it. My hair does what I want it to do and still stays soft to the touch and even washes out without a gallon of shampoo. Great Price!</li>
    <li> Recommended by my hair stylist!  Like it better than Pureology, which is too thick and sticky for me.  This is very light</li>
    <li> Excellent for spiked, chunky look.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a pomade after I recently got a short, spiked haircut; I&#x27;m a 60-year-old female. I LOVE this product, which I bought based on other online reviews. It&#x27;s extremely lightweight in your hair, keeps your cut looking defined, and holds your style well. Also, you hardly know you&#x27;re wearing it--no stickiness as with other products. And, because I sometimes only wash my hair every other day, I can get out of bed, run my hands through my hair, and the product still works nicely on Day 2! Finally, even though the container looks small, it should last a long time--you only need about a dime&#x27;s worth each use. Great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I love this product but it does take practice.  Use a little in the palm of your hand and if you&#x27;re like me flip your head upside down and start styling!  Very sticky so use this where you can wash it off!</li>
    <li> The short sexy hair quick change shaping balm did not do anything for me.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone else.</li>
    <li> This works so well I am shocked! I recently cut my hair short short (Jamie Leigh Curtis short) - Quick Change does exactly what it says, adds shine and body. I just decided to try it because it was an add-on - best impulse buy I have made in a while. LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Timely shipping</li>
    <li> Great for short hair.  I have been using this product for years and it continues to deliver on quality.  I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Adds volume to my hair, reduces need for hair spray. Where has this been all my life??? Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have a short hairstyle and needed something to smooth my ends and help me make it &amp;#34;piece-y&amp;#34; - this product does both perfectly. Be careful not to use too much or it can make your hair look greasy and weighed-down. I just rub a dab on my fingertips and barely touch it onto the ends of my hair. Great for controlling flyaways, too.</li>
    <li> Package arrived quickly! Very pleased</li>
    <li> I love styling my shorthair with this quick change product. I love the sexy look I get even in my 60s!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product...</li>
    <li> Everything was as good as expected. No Problems, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;The Product I ever have had!!!</li>
    <li> I have short hair and I do not like to style it with stiff products.  This styling was is just perfect. It holds with out sticky and stiff results and it gives my hair definition.</li>
    <li> Have been unable to locate this product in the stores.  So happy I found here.  It works great on hair.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect combination of hold and shine for my super short pixie like hairstyle. This creates separation and holds my hair in a faux hawk style or a spiked style. And it washes out very easily.  Love it!</li>
    <li> this item is being discontinued by manufacturer. my stylist uses this and get it while you can</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male with very fine hair, so I use lots of product and hairspray to work with it.  I love this stuff, most of the other products I use are sorta replaceable, but I haven&#x27;t found many other products (I&#x27;ve looked at them ALL) that have a similar texture to this.  This is thick, and very tacky.  Its great for piecing, twisting, and has a little bit of hold to it.  Its not too wet so it wont weigh the hair down.  One jar goes very far because you can use a very very small amount.  If you need some texture, if you have straight hair and want to make it a little more &#x27;messy&#x27; and textured - you need this.</li>
    <li> Gives my hair more texture to help style it. I would purchase the short sexy hair product again. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this again - I think it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for it. I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel and it didn&#x27;t seem to help hold my hair</li>
    <li> When I used this product for the first time I was hooked when I noticed how my very thin hair had so much more bendability! I use a gel first and dry my hair and with just a small amount of Quick change my hair looks fabulous</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I bought this with a lot of skepticism, but it&#x27;s a really good product for what it does.  Rub a small amount (SMALL, like a pea or half a pea) and quickly tousle your hair.  The nice part is that the stickiness seems to remain (without feeling sicky) and you can re-tousle during the day.  I don&#x27;t detect any residue after shampooing, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One jar is like a five year supply.</li>
    <li> It appears the  consistency has changed .&lt;br /&gt;It used to be like webs in your hands . Now it&#x27;s more liquidy &amp; loose.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it better before.</li>
    <li> Pretty stick and can feel a bit gross after being in your hair all day.  Rinses out easily and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product with baby fine hair. Just a little bit goes a long way. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> MYy hairdresser intorduced it to me. works great on my short cut and holds really great all day not sticky or heavy a little goes a long way. She was having difficulty finding it. I told her you have it. thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fine and I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years and I have never been disappointed! I have short, razor cut, pixie style gray hair. This product makes my hair shine. I get compliments all the time about my hair (no kidding). What I like is that a little goes a long way, it never feels greasy, it can be applied to damp or dry hair for different styling results. My hair stays in place but it is not glued to my head! This product is sold in some retail stores for 3 times the price that it is here.</li>
    <li> This is great for long hair too.  I use it to tame the flyaways and to help with keeping curls together.</li>
