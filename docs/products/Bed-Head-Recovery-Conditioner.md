      <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
      <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love this series of Shampoo/Conditioners.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>And, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different conditioners, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky!</li>
      <li>one smells like a tropical beach somehow and when it makes my hair feel more manageable.</li>
      <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels so soft, and I have a halo of beautiful fragrance around me all the time.  </li>
      <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my fine hair that is often dry from living in a desert climate.</li>
      <li>Just what I expected in the perfect time, package was neat!!</li>
      <li>It smells good, makes your hair feel clean and soft.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Sometimes the very intensive \\&quot;olive oil\\&quot; ones make my hair feel even more</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good enough to buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but won&#x27;t make it to my list of staple products or &#x27;must</li>
      <li>But I don&#x27;t want to stop using it coz its good on my hair so whenever that happens I just uses Selsun blue to get rid of that.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it :)</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and smells great.  </li>
      <li>it worth the money.</li>
      <li>I have very coarse hair from coloring it, and this softens it up nicely.  </li>
      <li>i used this conditioner for the first time and my damage hair look already more soft and shiny !</li>
      <li>This is conditioner has a thinner consistency and is suitable for co-washing, not deep conditioning curly or bleached hair.</li>
      <li>I have used a different shampoo for many years, and then my daughter-in-law recommended I try this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>the only shampoo and conditioner that I use love it</li>
      <li>Everyones different, so it might be ok on others scalp..</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I paid $15 for this large bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews and concur that this Level 2 (Recovery) is actually better at conditioning than the Level 3 product, which is a bit counter-intuitive.  </li>
      <li>opinion is that it smells funny, not bad just strange</li>
      <li>thanks I also bought the shampoo to complete the whole therapy.</li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and tamed after trying this conditioner!</li>
      <li>I was just surprised when I opened the box coz</li>
      <li>leaves hair feeling soft</li>
      <li>my hair use to be so dry specially by the tips, and so far this is the only one that helped.</li>
      <li>My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  </li>

<li> My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  </li>
<li> My hair has been processed a few times and this product really penetrates giving you the extra moisture dry damaged hair needs.</li>
<li> Sorry, but everything I use pretty much gets compared to Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie and the price.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t used it regularly to speak for any benefits with long term use, but it&#x27;s not a product that I washed out and saw instant improvement</li>
<li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the last couple of times I used it and let my hair air dry, it was still a little frizzy.</li>
<li> now have bleached ends dyed purple, and very long and curly, frizz-prone hair.</li>
<li> I have really dry hair</li>
<li> This helped it improve where it no longer looks or feels dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough, it&#x27;s the humidity, or if maybe it stops working after you use it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> So I guess it is the product for my hair but not much for my scalp.</li>
<li> I have thick curly highlighted hair and this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
<li> My hair had become very dry due to coloring and medications.</li>
<li> Conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
<li> I still have breakage but less breakage.</li>
<li> and it got dried out, this conditioner has done wonders.</li>
<li> I have thick, course, wavy, slightly oily hair.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not really sure this helped with the damage areas</li>
<li> So it&#x27;s $20 for 1 bottle whereas I usually get the pack of 2bottles at hair cuttery for $23 dollars.</li>
<li> /&gt;Definitely will buy again or at least try another Bed Head product.</li>
<li> If you have damaged hair and are looking for serious moisture, look elsewhere.</li>
<li> is broken when I received the bottle</li>
<li> Unfortunately thou, sometimes it gives me dandruff!</li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I used to dye my hair a lot and it got dried out, this conditioner has done wonders.</li>
    <li> Conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>

    <li> leaves hair feeling soft</li>

    <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner i use.  I buy it reg on amazon I cant find in stores</li>

    <li> This is conditioner has a thinner consistency and is suitable for co-washing, not deep conditioning curly or bleached hair. And, it&#x27;s okay. If you have damaged hair and are looking for serious moisture, look elsewhere. Sorry, but everything I use pretty much gets compared to Matrix Biolage Hydratherapie and the price. I paid $15 for this large bottle so I&#x27;m not disappointed. At regular suggested retail price, I wouldn&#x27;t be very impressed. I haven&#x27;t used it regularly to speak for any benefits with long term use, but it&#x27;s not a product that I washed out and saw instant improvement with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have bleached ends dyed purple, and very long and curly, frizz-prone hair. For shampoo I alternate between sulfate-free and Head and Shoulders, clarifying about once every 4 to 6 weeks with vinegar and water. So, I have not tried the accompanying Bed Head shampoo to say how it would work as a \\&quot;system\\&quot;. It&#x27;s good enough to buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but won&#x27;t make it to my list of staple products or &#x27;must-haves\\&quot;. $26.96 being the suggested retail price, you still get a lot for your money. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll buy when it&#x27;s on sale, but not something I just have to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 stars are the value for the sale price.</li>
    <li> Good deal wife loves it</li>

Unfortunately thou, sometimes it gives me dandruff! But I don&#x27;t want to stop using it coz its good on my hair so whenever that happens I just uses Selsun blue to get rid of that. So I guess it is the product for my hair but not much for my scalp. But maybe that&#x27;s just me. Everyones different, so it might be ok on others scalp..&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, I misunderstood the title of this product. I was just surprised when I opened the box coz I  thought it was for 2 bottles. So it&#x27;s $20 for 1 bottle whereas I usually get the pack of 2bottles at hair cuttery for $23 dollars.</li>
    <li> Amazing transformation to our hair. I love this product. Good shipping timr</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, course, dry hair that gets huge knots in it when she sleeps.  We&#x27;ve tried literally dozens of different &#x27;salon&#x27; products, and this is the only one that truly conditions her hair and allows her to get a comb through it after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some other reviews and concur that this Level 2 (Recovery) is actually better at conditioning than the Level 3 product, which is a bit counter-intuitive.  If you&#x27;ve tried everything and still can&#x27;t find a good conditioner this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I have thick curly highlighted hair and this stuff makes it so soft. My hair dresser even commented on how healthy my hair was! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Nice fruity smell. I also reviewed the shampoo. I&#x27;m not really sure this helped with the damage areas I still have breakage but less breakage.</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair from coloring it, and this softens it up nicely.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of different conditioners, and this is the best I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
    <li> Bed head shampoo and conditioner makes my over processed hair feel like hair again. Awesome stuff</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. It smells good, makes your hair feel clean and soft.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT !! Highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> this is the only conditioner that will settle my unruly hair!!</li>
    <li> This works great for me! It smells really good too! I have really dry hair and this helps moisturize and soften my hair.</li>
    <li> I have used a different shampoo for many years, and then my daughter-in-law recommended I try this shampoo.  I am a convert!  I love it!  My hair feels so soft, and I have a halo of beautiful fragrance around me all the time.  I am so glad to have had the recommendation!</li>
