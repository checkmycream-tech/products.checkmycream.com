    <li> Lauder for Men is not Metropolis,but good. I guess Lauder is not going to bring back Metropolis, so this will have to do.</li>
    <li> I have used this for so long, I can&#x27;t even remember.  20 years? Maybe?  People complain about the price, one single bottle should last you a year, easy.  Two sprays is more than enough, and lasts all day.  This is in the title, but bears repeating, when I was young, oh so long ago, women stopped me a lot to ask me what I was wearing.  Pretty much the only time women spoke to me but I will take what I can get.</li>
    <li> This Men&#x27;s cologne is my husband&#x27;s favorite but mostly my favorite. It&#x27;s difficult to find stocked at major department stores. This bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> I have worn Estee Lauder for Men for at least fifteen years and receive compliments on it from both men and women almost every time I wear it.  Spicy and masculine, yet light enough for warm weather wear. The fragrance mellows to a rich background note quickly so that you don&#x27;t hit the office and blow people&#x27;s allergies into overdrive.  What&#x27;s with the guys that put on so much scent that you can actually taste it the moment they enter the room or elevator cab?  This is a classy scent and I hope it stays in production for a good, long time.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best cologne for men. It is to women what catnip is to cats. Not all mens colognes are  suited to all men, this will work on any man.</li>
    <li> My husbands favorite!</li>
    <li> The is a great product and at a great price.  I have ordered this product over and aover again because I can&#x27;t be the price nor the time it takes to get the product to my home.  This product is for you.</li>
    <li> My dad has worn this (he says) for 40 years. Was my mom&#x27;s favorite. I continue to buy this for him every year; this year I bought it for his 94th birthday.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a matter of taste but this has been one of my favorite scents since it was first introduced in the late 1980&#x27;s. I personally love it and get compliments on it all the time and as a flight attendant that is telling.</li>
    <li> Quick and efficient service.  Great experience!  Will contact them again when I need more.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Husband loves this stuff because it turns me on.</li>
    <li> This scent is perfect for any occasion.</li>
    <li> I brought this item two years ago and still have just a little left and will order some more. I love it everyone comments me on it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne. It can be hard to find in the stores. This is one of those which has been around a long time, hopefully they will keep making it.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this cologne for many years. It is not usually available in any retail store in New England without special order.

    <li> the best smelling fragrance!  hard to find</li>
    <li> JUST BOUGHT BOTH FRAGRENCES AND THIS IS WAY THE INFERIOR OF THE TWO.  METROLIS IS A MUCH MORE APPEALING SMELL, THOUGH LONG OUT OF PRODUCTION.  THE BOTTLE I RECEIVED WAS STILL SMELLING JUST AS I REMEMBERED FROM NEARLY 15+ YEARS AGO.  LAUDER ON THE OTHER HAND IS THIN, FEMININE AND SITTING ON MY SKIN, I&#x27;M SIMPLY WISHING THE SMELLS WOULD TRANSFORM INTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND MORE MASCULINE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED ON A $60+ BOTTLE OF COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;Lauder By Estee for Men&amp;#34; for about 7 years, I&#x27;m female &amp; I&#x27;ve always worn men&#x27;s cologne. I&#x27;ve always loved this cologne, the price was the same as in the department store, there was no tax &amp; the shipping was free.</li>
    <li> This is a cologne that I have LOVED for almost 30 years now.  The VERY UNFORTUNATE thing is, Estee Lauder has reformulated it such that 1) it does not smell quite the same and 2) it has NO LASTING POWER AT ALL.  I fail to understand why these companies take a wonderful product and reformulate it.</li>
    <li> I have used Lauder for Men for about 20 years and never cease to get compliments about  it still to this day.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is the way to go it last about a year for me.</li>
