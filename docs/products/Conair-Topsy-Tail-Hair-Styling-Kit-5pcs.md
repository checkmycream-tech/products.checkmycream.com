<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these! Use them all the time in my daughters hair as well as my own. They are good for much more than the traditional topsy tail.</li>
    <li> Works really well. Two sizes came in the box.</li>
    <li> I love this. I&#x27;m starting a new job in the summer and wanted to look very put together and professional in the hot weather. Just make sure you read the directions, and this hairdo is a cinch</li>
    <li> I have Medium length hair and it works. Cute style. Lots of compliments. I bet its even better for longer hair too.</li>
    <li> Why did I never have this as a teenager?! Very easy to use. Comes in 2 sizes. You can use Youtube to find a lot of videos that show you how to do cool things. The instruction booklet isn&#x27;t 100% clear, but if I can understand it and execute 3 of the 6 things they demonstrate, I am one happy (and stylish) camper!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to complete a hairstyle tutorial I found on YouTube. While the Topsy Tail is a little pricey, it is definitely high quality. It&#x27;s easy to use and comes with a little guidebook for suggested hairstyles, although they aren&#x27;t that good. The main reason I bought this one is because other reviews said different versions broke easily. So I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love that they still make these decades later. Durable and does exactly what you need it to. Makes hairstyling easier!</li>
    <li> I have purchased the cheaper versions and with thick hair they break quickly.  This is the real deal (original product) that is thicker and does not break.  I would suggest the extra money be spent for quality.</li>
    <li> works great. pack is nice for me and my nieces hair.</li>
    <li> Great tool to make a regular ponytail extra cute!</li>
    <li> i have always problem with my long hair but after i use the Conair All In One Styling 5 pieces i feel greet</li>
    <li> Bought this product before and just buying a replacement bc I lost it. Long lasting and works magic.</li>
    <li> Great for styles on my young daughter! Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This item works ok, not too impressed.</li>
    <li> Does a pretty good job....but I have very thick hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as promised!  Great job, thanks</li>
    <li> easy way to make a simple poiny tail look really cute!</li>
    <li> hard to find anymore, works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s hair and I love it. Her hair is super thick and so we&#x27;ll never be able to do one big topsy ponytail, so I recouped some money by selling the large sized topsy to a friend of mine whose daughter has thin hair. Win Win for all!</li>
    <li> Bought this one as many reviews said the other ones were cheaply made and broke easily. This one is very sturdy and works very well. It comes with two different tools, one for larger ponytails and one for smaller ones. I do wish it had a \\&quot;tiny\\&quot; ponytail option as well. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I really liked the easy use of this item but of you have really thick hair it takes a bit of tugging and pulling to get a full pony tail through.</li>
    <li> While i like the product, i only got the big Topsy tail , even though it was supposed to come with a big and jr size one.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Shipped fast and arrived on time!</li>
    <li> This device makes it easy!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this.</li>
    <li> Never been able to figure out how to use this.  Tried on daughters silky hair and did not work. Sitting in a drawer not being used</li>
    <li> This is so awesome for little girls hairstyles for the hair challenged like myself. I throw my daughter&#x27;s hair up into braid and topsy turvy it for lovely all day hair that is out of her face</li>
    <li> I use this on my 5 yr. old daughter with long hair and we love the topsy tail look. It&#x27;s something different than the regular ponytail, pigtails, braids and it&#x27;s so easy that my Husband can use it. I&#x27;ve experienced with different looks and they have all come out looking great.</li>
    <li> Love this tool. Made to last</li>
    <li> received fast - just what I wanted - thank you</li>
    <li> Did not work for my hair it kept slipping through no matter what I did to it. I have baby fine hair I think that is the problem.</li>
    <li> Such a simple little thing but it&#x27;s hard to find in stores any more. Works great and I use it frequently on my granddaughters&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> I guess this might work for most people but I have very, very thick hair and this was not strong enough to work on my hair. This would probably work for most people but if you have very heavy, thick hair, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I had an original Topsy tail from way back in the 90s that broke, and I was pretty sad. I immediately got on Amazon to buy a new one and found this 5 piece. I really love the little one to use on my 3 year old&#x27;s hair. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t have the size adjuster like my old one did. This one is built well and sturdy. I hope it&#x27;ll last me a long time. The reason for the 4 stars is because when I use it for my own hair (which is wildly curly) it doesn&#x27;t slide through as nicely as it does through straight. No idea how the might fix that problem, but that&#x27;s the only down I could find. So if you have curly hair, try to make sure you have a nice hole to help you hair through.</li>
    <li> I love these. I don&#x27;t have a daughter, only a son, but I work with a little girl whose hair needs to be done each morning before school. I had the hardest time doing her hair before I got the Topsy Tail. Using the smaller one, I have been able to do her hair easily and quickly and it still looks so cute when I&#x27;m done. They are so easy to use, I have used them on myself too without a problem.</li>
    <li> I love this product...the Conair all in one hair stying tool with 5 pieces !. I was excited receiving it. It works great . .Wonderful product !  I&#x27;m very pleased with my order. The shipping was surprisingly very quick as well. I will save this company in my favorites . This company is a pleasure to deal with. I recommend them.</li>
    <li> The original topsy tail was a plastic coated wire that was run through a thin plastic tube which also allowed you to pull your hair into a bun, loosen one side of the wire leaving your hair in an updo.  Cool.  This is a fairly stiff one piece loop without much flexibility or variety of uses.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of these new copies and the manufacturers just don&#x27;t seem to get it.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice idea but it doesn&#x27;t work well with my naturally curly thick long hair, unless my hair is really wet.  Maybe my kid will like it.</li>
    <li> I had this when I was small so of course I had to buy one for my daughter. great product easy to use</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I use this almost everyday.  Very simple design, but very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what I purchased it for. Easy to use. Compact, takes up no room for storage.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it, simple way for you hair to look great.</li>
    <li> I use the smaller one to do my 2 year olds hair.  Makes it quick and easy to flip her little ponytails.  Really love it.</li>
    <li> Lame. Nothing you can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
    <li> If you have long hair like me, this makes your hair look pretty fancy but it&#x27;s super easy to do the styles. I usually get compliments when I wear my hair using this.</li>
    <li> I was online looking for some fast easy hairstyles for my daughter for school that wouldn&#x27;t take much time. When I came across the Conair topsy tail video,  ill admit I was hesitant at first but when I came on amazon and seen the price I thought what could it hurt to try it and i&#x27;m glad I did because Im able to do some cute hairstyles in her hair that take no longer than 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This comes with a big topsy tail for thick hair and a lil topsy tail for thin hair and a little pamphlet that shows a couple different hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed to keep all my girls hair out of their face for summer fun. Good sturdy product. Love the 2 sizes.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as expected fast service thank you</li>
    <li> The pieces work, instructions are simple. I had one before and bought this as a replacement.  Better with long and thicker hair.</li>
    <li> My husband stays home with the kids, and learning to do little girl hair has not been one of his favorite parts (my daughter is demanding and quick to express dissatisfaction loudly).  This thing makes him look like a pro. It really is as easy as a ponytail, but looks beautiful.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but over priced.</li>
    <li> Great product. Much easier on my daughters sensitive head vs me parting and flipping the hair through myself. Small size is perfect for little girls.</li>
    <li> Everything was the way it was supposed to be, the product works great. Love it.</li>
    <li> The 2 plastic pieces probably cost about 10 cents combine -- the box maybe another 15 cents.  Buy this at a garage sale -- you&#x27;ll pay what they&#x27;re worth.</li>
    <li> Great product and great service.</li>
    <li> Exactly as represented!! I love it!! Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Unless your hair is very thin or very silky, this thing doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On really thick and/or really long hair that isn&#x27;t straight, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the thing to &#x27;pull through,&#x27; and even if you can get it to yank through the loop, the hair-style doesn&#x27;t look nice because it messes up the style having to force it. I have tried to use these four times on my very coarse, long, and thick hair - didn&#x27;t work. It is now residing the trunk graveyard of my car. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great packing and great item. Love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar cheaper tools, but the Conair brand is the only one sturdy enough to pull my thick hair through with ease.  The elastic bands and bulky packaging are unnecessary, though.  If I could buy just the larger tool or the pair of tools for a cheaper price I would give it 5 stars, and probably purchase a couple more to carry in my purse and auto or leave in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> this worked great, a must have for anyone with long hair, worth the cost, would make a great stocking stuffer etc.</li>
    <li> I am glad it is not a fake product.</li>
    <li> The topsy tail&#x27;s are fine, but the package says five count, meaning two topsy tails and three worthless ponytail holders. It would be nice if the product description specified that.</li>
    <li> Love how it has different sizes works perfectly!</li>
    <li> Prompt and exactly what i wanted!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, good product! I wanted the trademark topsy tail and that&#x27;s what I got! Works really well and my hair is pretty thick.</li>
    <li> This product was less expensive at Target.  The tool itself is great and easy to use.  My daughter was pleased with the gift.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a Topsy Tail Kit for a long time.  I used to just &amp;#34;do it&amp;#34; myself.  The plastic &amp;#34;hoop/tail&amp;#34; makes it easier and neater.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for young girls, I make a smooth, sophisticated style that keeps my hair out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen in a long time , love that you can find the good stuff still</li>
    <li> Love this little gadget! My 4yr olds hair has been looking adorable! She has a lot of natural curls and even when a few hairs fall or it&#x27;s still adorable and we&#x27;ve been able to create a lot of new hairstyles with our Topsy Tail!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for another topsy tail for years, my old one is worn out.  This has 2, a regular sized one and a mini one yay.  It works very well.</li>
    <li> This is the styling tool I remember.  It creates perfect topsy-tails and lovely up-dos, making my hair is high-school-awesome in a tasteful and grown-up way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, so at first I thought the included no-damage elastics wouldn&#x27;t stay in my hair, but they do!  As a bonus, they also add a little volume to the pulled-up parts of my hair, so my styles have a little more impact.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I could not find this item in my local stores. I style my daughters hair with this new nifty tool.  It&#x27;s my new favorite.  I was doing these styles, w/o the tool, for so long and they were always a bit messy. This tool makes the style look clean and smooth.  So glad that I made this purchase.  Would love to buy this for all my Mama friends!</li>
    <li> Just bought this for my daughter, who is really into doing elaborate hair styles. She loves it!</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use! Love them! They are very sturdy. I love the smaller one for my little one.</li>
    <li> Works great. Easy way to do you hair.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  I&#x27;m rather rough with them but they aren&#x27;t brittle and don&#x27;t break.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t try to make a &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; one...These are essential for the arsenal of tools of a long-haired gal.  I use the little one regularly to  get that chic look of a hair-wrapped elastic for my ponytail.</li>
    <li> This is a great item for getting my daughter&#x27;s hair out of her face and keeping it looking beautiful.  Simple to use!  I have never been able to braid or do trendy hairstyles and my daughter always gets compliments when we use this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but I actually ended up using it more on my daughter. Helps with quick hairstyles to keep her hair away from her face at school. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  It works exactly as described.  For more styling uses for the topsytail check out the videos on youtube.</li>
    <li> It does not come out the way they describe it. I followed the instructions by the letter &amp; it does not come out the same way. It also messes up the pony tail when you attempt to put the hook through.</li>
    <li> For years I have put my hair in this style of ponytail with just my fingers. But this purchase was worth it because it is much more secure, tight and tidy. When I use the smaller one to tie a piece of hair around my ponytail elastic band, it lasts all day. Worthwile purchase.</li>
    <li> Love it. Works with all hair length.</li>
    <li> Talk about a childhood flashback! Tried to buy this in several stores, no one knew what I was talking about...I was so excited to see this set came with a full size and small topsy tail which is the perfect size for toddler hair styles!!</li>
    <li> Good quality plastic. Does its job really well.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and I can style my hair no matter what length I wear it. I like to use it on my mother and sisters hair too.</li>
    <li> I was looking for this because I had one a LONG time ago when I was a little girl. This is exactly what I remember it being. super easy to use and it came with a guide to do other hairstyles that I have never done before.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  Gave it to my daughter-in-law.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> For those who have long hair, this hair gadget is most useful.  The Conair is well made, strong, and will last a long time. A good buy!</li>
    <li> Verrrryyy happy with this product! I bought a different one off amazon a few weeks back and within a couple days it broke!! My daughters have thick hair and no other brand has worked better than this one!  I would highly reccomend this product to everyone! Even if your child has thick hair!! Im so glad to have found this again! Deffinatly like the original topsy tail!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Works for medium to long hair. The packaging as the instructions for 4 different styles of use which was great because I&#x27;m not very creative when it comes to hair styling. Easy to use and keeps my hair tidy and pretty all day!</li>
    <li> I use these daily. love how it makes my hair look like I really spent a lot of time working on my hair.</li>
    <li> Loved this in the 80s still love it now!  highly recommended for any hair thickness or length. Go for it</li>
    <li> Yes, this product is a bit more expensive than the flimsy ones from China, but it is A LOT more sturdy.  The box contains 2 &amp;#34;topsy tails&amp;#34; (a big one and a little one).  I pull these things through my own hair as well as through my toddler&#x27;s hair almost every day, and I can tell you for certain that the little one is just as tough as the big one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap ones; some things are worth paying more.</li>
    <li> I DIDN&#x27;T BUY THESE WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT BUT AFTER RECIEVING IT I WISH I HAD. MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING FUN DOING HER HAIR!</li>
    <li> Topsy Tail is perfect, and the service from amazon was better than perfect. Very happy</li>
    <li> Love this simple hair tool. Makes an elegant hairdo in minutes and you can get funky as well. Really worth the price for the lovely look. I get compliments all the time</li>
    <li> I have bought two of these sets for my girls and we use them nearly every day!  The larger size is perfect for half hair or full pony tails.  The small er size is great for growing out bangs or baby hair.  I also braid my girls&#x27; hair into crazy letters and shapes.  I use this tool to weave the tail of the braid into other braids or to hide hair tails under other pony tails.  Simple, cheap, effective.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER, AS SHE HAD A SIMILAR ONE WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER.  IT TAKES A WHILE TO MASTER HOW TO DO THE FLIP, BUT SHE LOVES IT.&lt;br /&gt;RUTH</li>
    <li> I guess it was supposed to come with ponytail holders but mine didn&#x27;t. I like the 2 sizes and we have had no problems. Got this about 3 months ago and they have not broken. We use them a lot.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the product breaking, and I like that it came in two different sizes, I gave my daughter the smaller one. It does cause some pretty awful tangles though if you try to do anything too fancy.</li>
    <li> My daughter Loves this! Great product!</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these growing up,  the one I had was way sturdier than this.  Not great quality</li>
    <li> I owned one of these as a child and loved it. I wanted to try something different with my hair for work and thought of this. This product is just like the ones as a child. Spend the money on this, the inexpensive ones are too fimsly and do not work. This also comes with some hair bands which is helpful for using the product. It also comes with a large topsy tail and a small one. I have hair that goes to about my bra strap in the back and is rather thick. The large one works great for a ponytail and the small one works great if I one pull the top half of my hair up. I have received many compliments when I wear my hair like this. Everyone wants to know if I went to the salon.</li>
    <li> High quality product. Has no problem being used in thin, thick, short or long hair.</li>
    <li> Wonderful gadget for pretty hair designs.  More expensive than others on Amazon but much better as it is strong and won&#x27;t break easily.</li>
    <li> Great product i recomend it ðŸ‘</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is simple but gives a wonderful, finished look.</li>
    <li> I works great. I was needing something to help make my hair look shorter and this works great. It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Love this tool - couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in any store for the one I&#x27;d lost. Easiest way to make your long hair look like something without a lot of fuss (or time).</li>
    <li> Gave it as gift and they love it, thank you :-)</li>
    <li> I &#x27;m happy to have one of these again, now that I have long hair. It works great, and I&#x27;ve even had compliments on how my hair is styled from using the Topsy Turvy.</li>
    <li> I had been parting my hair and dragging it through and this is much easier. I like this package comes with 2 different size instruments. The small one makes it easier when I do my daughter&#x27;s short, thin hair. I use the big one to do an inverted pony tail on my own hair.</li>
    <li> very easy and fast to fix my hair.</li>
    <li> This makes its much easier for a Dad to do something different with little girls hair.  Picked up a tip for hairspray flyaways on YouTube with this product which makes is much easier for shoulder length hair. Still goes to Mom for braiding and tougher stuff. I would say this product is  much better for hair down to shoulder blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quick within a week for Easter.</li>
    <li> Great and quick little tools especially when you&#x27;re trying to work with wiggly little girls.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it&#x27;s the best. I recommend it. It&#x27;s flexible and it&#x27;s perfect. I did many hairstyles with it and it doesn&#x27;t break. It&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a Topsy Tail, you should really try this styling tool. This is not one of the cheap dollar store knock-offs that break as soon as you use it. It&#x27;s a great way to transform a bad hair day into some cute and controlled styles that will keep you looking neat throughout the day. Add a little gel or spray and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I love this product I bought one at Walmart and it worked great I used to use my fingers, it would hurt and I would end up with loose strands on one side with this I had no loose hair. It does work on thick hair!! My niece has the thickest fullest hair in our family and very hard to style not only cuz of thickness but cuz it&#x27;s really long. She loves using this topsy tool and the hairstyles she comes up with.</li>
    <li> Works great! Can do lots of fun styles in my daughters hair and no pulling. I&#x27;ve told other moms about how great the mini one works in littles hair. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I use these to pull my hair up and get it off my neck so I am cooler. You can do a simple or an elegant look quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very good quality</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughters hair and makes my life easier with hairstyles for school.</li>
    <li> Helps tame my daughters long and unruly mane....even for someone with little to no skill like myself!</li>
    <li> This is actually a good product for medium to thin hair.  I need a larger one for my 4.5 daughter&#x27;s hair.  She really has thick hair, she is part Polynesian, so you can only imagine...when i would get ready to pull the pony through, she would protest in pain.  will need to get another bigger version.  I can only pull a half pony tail, and it still looks cute though</li>
    <li> It is great for my grandkids hair</li>
    <li> Why do they assume will know hiw to use and easy to do it yourself?????  It isnt. I have not used yet due to this</li>
    <li> Loved this product back in the day, still love it. Amazon has it all and I love them!</li>
    <li> I have had one for many years and love it. I bought this one for my 9 yr old granddaughter. It really &#x27;dresses up&#x27; her pony tail and love it!</li>
    <li> I have been trying this over and over and it does not do what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I do it exactly like the instructions say but not as easy as it looks. What a shame!</li>
    <li> Love it. I previously bought a cheapie one that broke easily. This is sturdy and seems to hold up well! I love that it comes with two sizes.</li>
    <li> great deal and they work great</li>
    <li> I wanted to avoid cheap imitation products that would break easily - this one is the real thing. It&#x27;s sturdy and works great in my long curly hair. The instructions/pictures are helpful if you&#x27;re unsure where to begin, but soon you&#x27;ll be making up your own styles and combinations!</li>
    <li> like Topsy Tail, it does just what it should.  I received the package in good condition, and it came quickly</li>
    <li> Works great. Arrived right on time</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Item as described. Thanks</li>
    <li> Been looking for this for years - does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought the original topsy tail, and it disappeared a few years ago. I&#x27;ve tried some of the replacements, and they&#x27;re not quite as good. This one is the real deal. And the small one is nice, too. The rest of the stuff didn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product I am satisfied with my purchase it just my hair is too thick and it is hard to use</li>
    <li> As expected, had styles to try with pictures and descriptions as well. Will definitely put this to good use</li>
    <li> Bought this to do our elementary school age daughter&#x27;s hair. She loves it, she says it makes her hair look &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34;. Easy to use and even her daddy can do a fancy hairstyle with no problem</li>
    <li> I used to have this item years and years ago, and I must say, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find again!  Such a great  way to dress up a ponytail!  Quality is excellent and instructions included are easy to follow.</li>
    <li> I have a long thick hair and wanted to do something different with my hair. Well I bought this and it worked. Although, my hair has to be dried before using it as it will not work with wet hair. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Have been  looking for this nifty little gadget for a long time.  Had a makeshift topsy tail for a bit but this one is so easy to use and results in a neat and pretty hair style.</li>
    <li> I know I&#x27;m quite capable of making a Topsy tail on my own, but this just helps make the styles just a little bit more polished. I use this on my 4yr old daughter an myself. It&#x27;s fun and I love doing the styles with this tool!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really do anything that I can&#x27;t do myself in less time. Also has a tendency to get tangled in longer hair.</li>
    <li> easy to use. mainly got it for something new to do to my daughter&#x27;s hair. Would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> This is fun.. my daughter and I both use it.. And I like that it gives you the extra styles to try too.  Works well, easy to do, anyone should be able to do it.</li>
    <li> This is a real Topsy Tail and is all one piece of molded plastic unlike others I&#x27;ve had that stretch and come apart. It creates a beautiful twist for pony tails large and small. There are two sizes but I find the small one works with any amount of hair and I have thick hair and use the small one even for a large ponytail using all my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is perfect for my daughter&#x27;s hair. Very helpful when we are in a hurry. I can create cute hair styles in no time! Shipping was super-fast! Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My five year is obsessed with putting her hair in pony tails, plaits, you name it.  She&#x27;s actually very talented at it!  She adores using this - it&#x27;s very easy for her to do it herself and although it doesn&#x27;t look quite as neat as it does when i do it for her, it&#x27;s a great bit of kit.</li>
    <li> Sturdy. It does its job, but I would have loved to see other forms of use.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use and dresses up any do.  I bought another one for my grandaughter and she loves it too.</li>
    <li> I had one of these when I was younger, and loved how easy it was to obtain a cute and sophisticated hairstyle in seconds. So when my daughter&#x27;s hair became long enough, naturally I wanted to see if I could find the Topsytail. Looking at stores, I was disappointed. I looked all over. But Amazon saved the day once again. We have used the Topsytail more times than I can count - it certainly got its money&#x27;s worth. We receive so many compliments on my daughters hair. If they only knew!</li>
    <li> It takes a bit to figure it out but it does work and looks cute.</li>
    <li> Nifty little tool for different styles.</li>
    <li> Requires a few tries to get it right. Not as easy as it is shown.</li>
    <li> love this for quick and easy styling.</li>
    <li> There are products sold by Amazon that state they are Topsy Tail, they indeed are not. This is the real deal, and I love it. The other products that we bought were cheaply made, broke during the first use, and made in China, pretty much summing it up. This product is much higher quality, we have used it regularly for over six months and it still is in wonderful shape. I love all of the different styles that I am able to create with this tool. Amazing and worth the little extra money to get!</li>
    <li> I love using this product in my daughters hair. We use it almost every morning to do her hair for school!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I used to use it when I was very little and I totally forgot about it I thought that they were not in production any more. I have mine for about a year now and is working great.</li>
    <li> This is just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s impossible to find in the store and I was so happy to find it. I get a lot of compliments too!! I ❤️This hairstyling tool!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time Cant get my hair to do anything with it</li>
</ol>
