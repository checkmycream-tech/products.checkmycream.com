    <li> Is my \\&quot;everyday\\&quot; fragrance. It smells very fresh and clean and is never overpowering!  It is a fantastic choice for an office setting because it is never \\&quot;too much\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> Pure Grace is just a clean fresh scent, that everyone loves.  It is not offensive to anyone, especially the people who have allergies to fragrances. I love it........[[ASIN:B00021B4ZW Philosophy Pure Grace]]</li>
    <li> The fragrance is fine but so faint.  I am thinking that perhaps this seller watered it down or this is a knock-off of Philosophy Pure Grace.&lt;br /&gt;My husband bought me one for Christmas from a different seller and it was wonderful.  Great scent that lasted through the day even though I used half the amount that I must use with this one.  I am so disappointed.  I guess I will have to go to a local store to purchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Feel like I have been ripped off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for a couple years, but was delighted over the great buy!  I was astounded at how quickly my package arrived on my doorstep!</li>

    <li> Wife Loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent. I get compliments ALL the time when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife.  Her co-workers told her that she smelled funny.  When they figured out it was the perfume everyone agreed scent didn&#x27;t work.  Can not really recommend based on this experience.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, lasting fragrance.</li>
    <li> I actually received the wrong scent but I liked it so I kept it</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I bought it as a gift and the person that received it loved it as well. It smells amazing and the scent lasts for a long time. It&#x27;s not one of those products that fades quickly and the scent isn&#x27;t so strong that it makes you sick. It&#x27;s absolutely perfect I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I love this scent but half way through my day I have to reapply. I don&#x27;t mind so much because I love the scent so much. So I will keep purchasing the perfume. The price I got for a 4oz bottle was a great value also...Will definitely purchase from this same seller again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that the scent isn&#x27;t just a bit stronger. Can&#x27;t detect that I have it on. I won&#x27;t buy this, again.</li>
    <li> Scent does not last long</li>
    <li> I love the clean, fresh scent. This is my go to perfume. It&#x27;s not overpowering but makes me feel great!!</li>
    <li> Perfect, and as described. Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> This is not perfume... it is alcohol with a hint of the fragrance. I HATE IT!!! I was expecting this to arrive anxiously, now I wish that it had been lost en-route!!! After a couple of minutes, the fragrance evaporates... can I get my money back?</li>
    <li> In a meeting, a grocery store, on the golf course....people come up to me and say \\&quot;You smell so good.\\&quot;  No one ever asks what purfume I&#x27;m wearing.  Philosopy fragrance products are excellent, and PURE GRACE is my absolute favorite.  I would recommend it with no reservation.</li>
    <li> Bought this instead of Amazing Grace by mistake, so I was disappointed. It does have a nice clean smell that I like but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fresh scent, like just having taken a shower.....the scent last all day</li>
    <li> this is one of my very favorite fragrances.  it smells clean and fresh, never overbearing and it doesn&#x27;t linger after leaving the room.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the others I have bought.</li>
    <li> We were able to surprise our daughter who thought that she would never get it because of the cost. After checking with several department stores. This seller had great value with less cost. We were very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the fresh out of the shower fragrance. This is the best price I have found. Get many compliments.  I have used this Philosophy Pure Grace for many years. I have been out for awhile. Not disappointed in the size. Very generous.</li>
    <li> This fragrance does what it claims--it smells like soap and water--incredibly clean scent.  I always get compliments when wearing it.  It is the only fragrance I have been using because nothing compares to it.  Also comes in shower gel and lotion so it can be layered.</li>
