      <li>It&#x27;s good for the price.</li>
      <li>In my eternal search for the perfect mascara I tried the waterproof version of this and loved it except for the fact that it was waterproof and took too much time and effort to get off.  </li>
      <li>Came so fast fsntastic true brand i love this stuff!!!</li>
      <li>.this is just OK--</li>
      <li>I really love this mascara.</li>

      <li>so I have nothing to complain about:)</li>
      <li>Also love the price.</li>
      <li>I really love what it does.</li>
      <li>Stilletto is my favorite mascara</li>
      <li>Pros: Great price &amp; fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Little to no</li>
      <li>This takes much more effort to extend the lashes and it wilts the curl you put in.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall a pretty good mascara.</li>
      <li>it stays on all day and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The waterproof version extends your lashes very quickly and hold the curl (from an eyelash curler).  </li>
      <li>It goes perfectly with eyeliner and lip gloss for a cute everyday look.</li>
      <li>I love that I got this and at such a great price.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and washes clean as well :)</li>
      <li>This mascara goes on smooth, no clumping and doesn&#x27;t make your lashes stick together.</li>
      <li>It definitely gave my lashes great length, but I accidentally order brown-black</li>
      <li>I was trying to find a cheap alternative and noticed this guy for sale for just a couple bucks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Can apply many coats for more drama.&lt;br /&gt;Gives my lashes a decent length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nothing special no added volume or length.</li>
      <li>Normally mascaras just go on but don&#x27;t really give it a good pop, But this one makes my lashes noticeable and stand out  </li>
      <li>not bad.</li>
      <li>Love it, got a great deal, was able to find brown/black which is virtually impossible to find at like Target and the like.</li>
      <li>Made my lashes twice as long, who doesn&#x27;t love that!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just the piece that I received or what, but this mascara is really lumpy.</li>
      <li>but that shouldn&#x27;t make that much of a difference, should it?</li>
      <li>Really lengthens lashes without clumping them.  </li>
      <li>It does make my lashes MUCH longer, but the problem is, it clumps up after a couple swipes.</li>
      <li>This mascara is good for bringing out eyelashes but not creating a super dramatic look.</li>
      <li>I notice there is a new bar code label on the back, covering up the original bar code.  </li>
      <li>It is a good mascara, but not great.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not that much product (but it also helped to make it not very wet or clumpy)&lt;br /&gt;Lashes not as thick/voluminous as I</li>
      <li>notice I bought a different color, brownish-black instead of black (getting too old for the harshness of black LOL)</li>
      <li>Would absolutely recommend to women who are looking for a different mascara choice.</li>
      <li>I like a thick mascara and am usually pleased with Maybelline . .</li>

<li> ( Not because it was very bad, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough for me to stick to this product.</li>
<li> sometimes if I want a little extra oomph!</li>

<li> I do use it as a base for a blackest black mascara and it works really well.</li>
<li> The brush is just a regular spooly type brush which disappointed me because I tend to hate using them.</li>

    <li> Love it, got a great deal, was able to find brown/black which is virtually impossible to find at like Target and the like. This mascara goes on smooth, no clumping and doesn&#x27;t make your lashes stick together.</li>
    <li> This mascara is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes very long. I use it as a second coat over a volumizing mascara sometimes if I want a little extra oomph! It goes on smooth and washes clean as well :)</li>
    <li> I like a thick mascara and am usually pleased with Maybelline . . .this is just OK--I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. Better than the loreal manga mascara. it stays on all day and easy to apply. doesn&#x27;t make your eyelash longer but does volume it up. not bad.</li>
    <li> It is a good mascara, but not great. Nothing special no added volume or length. The wave like curve on the brush takes a little getting used to.</li>
    <li> Normally mascaras just go on but don&#x27;t really give it a good pop, But this one makes my lashes noticeable and stand out  I really love what it does.</li>
    <li> This mascara is great! Does not clump, makes my lashes look longer, and is a great price. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara. It makes my eyelashes look amazing!! Would absolutely recommend to women who are looking for a different mascara choice. Also love the price. A+ for this mascara.</li>
    <li> Really lengthens lashes without clumping them.  Made my lashes twice as long, who doesn&#x27;t love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brownish black is pretty much black</li>
    <li> In my eternal search for the perfect mascara I tried the waterproof version of this and loved it except for the fact that it was waterproof and took too much time and effort to get off.  I was hoping that this would be the same except easier to get off.  It&#x27;s not.  The waterproof version extends your lashes very quickly and hold the curl (from an eyelash curler).  This takes much more effort to extend the lashes and it wilts the curl you put in.  You also can&#x27;t apply another coat because it clumps up.</li>
    <li> I love that I got this and at such a great price. Stilletto is my favorite mascara and I am soo happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just the piece that I received or what, but this mascara is really lumpy. It&#x27;s not easy to apply either.</li>
    <li> Came so fast fsntastic true brand i love this stuff!!! I definetlh reccomend this to anyone. These people have great customer service</li>
    <li> Although I ordered this over a month ago, I didn&#x27;t need it until this morning.  I&#x27;ve used this brand before and was very impressed with it.  Not so today though.  It seemed to come out of the tube with clumps on the brush and the tube felt empty, like there was nothing in there by the time I finished applying it. I notice there is a new bar code label on the back, covering up the original bar code.  I had wanted to contact Maybelline and see if it was an expired product but I can&#x27;t do that now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice I bought a different color, brownish-black instead of black (getting too old for the harshness of black LOL) but that shouldn&#x27;t make that much of a difference, should it?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big lover of Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real, but paying 20 bucks for mascara is so painful every time. I was trying to find a cheap alternative and noticed this guy for sale for just a couple bucks. Figuring it wouldn&#x27;t be much of  a waste if it was awful, I bought it. It&#x27;s awesome! Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It does make my lashes MUCH longer, but the problem is, it clumps up after a couple swipes. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great price &amp; fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;Little to no clumping.&lt;br /&gt;Not gloopy.&lt;br /&gt;Can apply many coats for more drama.&lt;br /&gt;Gives my lashes a decent length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit dry- seemed like it was kept on the shelf for too long&lt;br /&gt;Not that much product (but it also helped to make it not very wet or clumpy)&lt;br /&gt;Lashes not as thick/voluminous as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a pretty good mascara. Will I buy again? Maybe, but probably not. ( Not because it was very bad, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough for me to stick to this product. I&#x27;d rather try out some other mascaras)</li>
    <li> This mascara is great for every day use. It definitely gave my lashes great length, but I accidentally order brown-black so it&#x27;s not quite as pigmented as a like for a night time look. I do use it as a base for a blackest black mascara and it works really well. The brush is just a regular spooly type brush which disappointed me because I tend to hate using them. But the formula itself is really great!</li>
    <li> Great color. Curved wand gets at the corners. Only problem is that it does dry out and flake a bit by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Love this mascara and probably always will. Got it for a great price so I have nothing to complain about:)</li>
    <li> This mascara is good for bringing out eyelashes but not creating a super dramatic look. It goes perfectly with eyeliner and lip gloss for a cute everyday look.</li>
