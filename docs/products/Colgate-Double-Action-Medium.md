      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t use these myself</li>
      <li>I was happy to participate and happy to find toothbrushes reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>The price that amazon offers for these brushes is also very good.</li>
      <li>The best toothbrush you will ever have in your life, big brush that makes you want to brush more and the clean feel when you are done, LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I like the length, width and brush stiffness (medium) of these, they really are good at removing between teeth and at the gum line.</li>
      <li>These are a good price and fast shipping with Prime.  </li>
      <li>They suit me just fine.</li>
      <li>Great price and individually packed.</li>
      <li>Perfect for when your guest forget their toothbrush, retail, or even stocking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medium bristles are not overly firm but still hold up well use after use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to finally have satisfactory toothbrushes at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I like the way they clean my teeth and even &#x27;get into the corners&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I thought the quantity price could have been lower, but they are good brushes and may be the only toothbrush some of these children ever get.</li>
      <li>Cool bulk item, since I change tooth brush every 2-weeks, plus</li>
      <li>I just hope they&#x27;re still available a year from now when I run out of this first set.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These toothbrushes are comfortable to use, have the medium stiffness I need, are at a very acceptable price, and have a large, even head.  </li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush because it has a full long head.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first brush for almost a month now.  </li>
      <li>These toothbrushes are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Medium or Soft are always a safe bet to keep around for unexpected visitors!  </li>
      <li>Great full-head brush that gives you such a total dentist-feel clean each time you use it, especially when used paired with a tounge cleaner(I prefer an &#x27;orabrush&#x27;)</li>
      <li>I also do my best to keep several extra on hand for the numerous unexpected guests that show up at our house.</li>
      <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
      <li>I also bought the 24 pack of travel sized Colgate Total Clean Mint Toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I live with teen-agers!</li>
      <li>Most toothbrushes you see on the market today, have small heads on them.</li>
      <li>it comes in handy for scrubbing hard to get places, thank you!</li>
      <li>They give out personal care items and really appreciate having these.</li>
      <li>but I buy them in bulk to give to my local High school&#x27;s food shelf.  </li>
      <li>I found the head a little too long, so used some fine wirecutters to clip off the bottom two rows of tufts.  </li>
      <li>They are the right size for my mouth and not too hard or soft.</li>
      <li>I often knock my or my fiancée&#x27;s toothbrush around, and they generally land on the ground by the toilet.</li>

<li> You cannot get them in stores anymore or at least in stores in my area.</li>

    <li> We bought these for the Christmas Child Shoe boxes.  I thought the quantity price could have been lower, but they are good brushes and may be the only toothbrush some of these children ever get.</li>
    <li> Great Product. I would buy again</li>
    <li> These were a great value for the money. I purchased this as a donation for my child&#x27;s school. A teacher traveling to Ecuador requested toothbrushes to give to children in the community she was visiting. These are practical gift and small enough for overseas travel. I was happy to participate and happy to find toothbrushes reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> good toothbrushes, i like that they stay organized in the cupboard in this holder.  A little stiffer on the bristles but that&#x27;s how i like them</li>
    <li> great price nice tooth brush.</li>
    <li> Great full-head brush that gives you such a total dentist-feel clean each time you use it, especially when used paired with a tounge cleaner(I prefer an &#x27;orabrush&#x27;)</li>
    <li> This is the toothbrush that I like best to use. I also do my best to keep several extra on hand for the numerous unexpected guests that show up at our house. I live with teen-agers! Colgate toothbrushes just feel good on my teeth. They are the right size for my mouth and not too hard or soft. They suit me just fine.

    <li> Every time I go into a store to shop for toothbrushes I find a wide array of weird shaped, usually with too-small heads and always at prices that make me gag.  So I decided to go online and see if I could find a satisfactory alternative, and here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These toothbrushes are comfortable to use, have the medium stiffness I need, are at a very acceptable price, and have a large, even head.  I found the head a little too long, so used some fine wirecutters to clip off the bottom two rows of tufts.  Now they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the first brush for almost a month now.  It&#x27;s performed well and has not yet worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy to finally have satisfactory toothbrushes at a reasonable price.  I just hope they&#x27;re still available a year from now when I run out of this first set.</li>
    <li> I always have company from friends to family.  I like to keep spare toothbrushs on hand, just in case ppl need one. Medium or Soft are always a safe bet to keep around for unexpected visitors!  Colgate is always a safe brand to purchase because of its name/brand!  Colgate is a well trusted brand and I never had company complain!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush because it has a full long head. Most toothbrushes you see on the market today, have small heads on them. The price that amazon offers for these brushes is also very good. These toothbrushes were a very good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> For a men&#x27;s shelter...</li>
    <li> I like the length, width and brush stiffness (medium) of these, they really are good at removing between teeth and at the gum line.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m not picky about my toothbrushes and have never had a problem with Colgate.  These are a good price and fast shipping with Prime.  I also bought the 24 pack of travel sized Colgate Total Clean Mint Toothpaste.  It&#x27;s all going in the emergency supplies, so who knows when any of it will actually get used.  Hopefully no time soon.</li>
    <li> I use these for hobbies and cleaning also. Great for your tooth too!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the product ..</li>
    <li> I am a klutz. I often knock my or my fiancée&#x27;s toothbrush around, and they generally land on the ground by the toilet. Yuck. So I ordered this. We will NEVER run out of toothbrushes! This is great,  I could roll around in them and have plenty to spare! Awesome. -Eva</li>
    <li> Great price and individually packed. Perfect for when your guest forget their toothbrush, retail, or even stocking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medium bristles are not overly firm but still hold up well use after use.</li>
    <li> These met all expectations.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so firm, they&#x27;ll probably wear out my teeth if gentle care is not used. They&#x27;ll be marvelous for cleaning my boat &amp; truck engine parts. Last, the brush is too big.</li>
