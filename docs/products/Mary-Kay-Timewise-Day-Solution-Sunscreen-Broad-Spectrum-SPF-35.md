    <li> Great price &amp; fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great product. Works great. I can wear it under my make up. It does not irritate my skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen smell to it.</li>
    <li> Very good for your skin</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times so far, but I don&#x27;t break out from it, and that is already a major plus for me! I don&#x27;t like the smell of&lt;br /&gt;it that much, but as long as I don&#x27;t break out and it protects my skin from the sun I am good.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, but this is a new one with higher sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;which is fantastic and since I just got this new one, I will let you know latter. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with receiving my order after on a couple days.  Since MK switched to SPF 35 it has taken me awhile to adjust to the formula being so runny.  I do love MK and will stick with it, but they can improve on the consistency of this product.  Other than that, I would have given it a 5 rating.</li>
    <li> I have used ths product for years.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it through Amazon because it&#x27;s so convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Kay products are high quality!</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived on time. Fresh.</li>
    <li> This is the best daily sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t stink like other sunscreens, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it has 35 spf. I wear it everyday under my make-up. As others said, it&#x27;s a little runny, but who cares?</li>
    <li> I always use Mary Kay Night and Day solutions but now I realize that the amount of sunscreen differs in the Day Solutions so to get the maximum protection from the sun in the summer, I use the Day Solution with SPF 35 to keep from getting sunburned. I use the Day Solution with SPF 15 in the winter and this is working just fine for me. It offers protection and keeps my face soft and I feel pretty so this is a must have for my morning routine. I recommend it to anyone that has problems with dry skin, or oily skin it helps keep a balance with nature.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Cant say enough good things about it!&lt;br /&gt;I love Mary Kay products and Amazon makes purchasing products so easy and safe.  The cost is so affordable too!</li>
    <li> I have been using Mary Kay for 10 years now, and I will continue to use for as long as they have the Timewise . Leave me sink smooth and young.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
    <li> Bottle leaking everywhere.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for many years . I really like how it makes your face feel and look</li>
    <li> Love Mary Kay products.</li>
    <li> I was a huge fan of the Day Solution when it was SPF 15. I loved the way my skin looked and felt. When they switched it to SPF 25, I had to use it less because my face broke it. When they switched it to SPF 35 I had to throw it away. My face got red and splotchy and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting any &amp;#34;age fighting&amp;#34; at all. Just felt like my off-brand sunscreen. Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It smells great and feels great on my skin! The 35 spf is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Timewise line for Mary Kay. I can see a difference in my skin tone since I have been using it. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my skin!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that doesnt make my skin break out when I sweat.  I live in Belize and it is humid.  the seller was quick</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for  the past year and its absolutely my best choice. There&amp;#34;s no smell and it causes no breakouts. Blends great with any makeup.</li>
    <li> The 35 spf protection from the sun keeps my face from overexposure to the sun during routine driving and walking outside. I often get pimples when my face gets burned.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for years. I have tried others but return to Mary Kay products.  I love the way it smells and the way it makes my skin feel and look.  It also hav a 35 SPF.  To me its a positive with a 5 rating.</li>
    <li> I love this product too!  I like the way it helps keep my skin smooth and protected.  I also recommend this product along with the night solution.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic. I have sensative skin and it doesnt break me out unlike most sunscreens do. Its perfect for summer!</li>
