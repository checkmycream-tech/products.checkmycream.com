      <li>THAT QUALITY GIVES THE BEST GIFTS WHICH I MAKE AROUND CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAYS.</li>
      <li>I FIND THEM ALL  EXCELLENT PRODUCTS, WITH  TIMELY DELIVERY, AND GREAT PACKAGING,</li>
      <li>one of my favorite blends, use it blended into coconut oil as a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; People think I smell wonderful, my best friend now also using it</li>
      <li>It is now my signature scent.everyone always tells me I smell so good.</li>
      <li>The combination of oils sounded good to me</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this oil.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>While I don&#x27;t need anything &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; - I liked the list of oils on this bottle, so</li>
      <li>Lovely scent and price was good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of obnoxious if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>if you appreciate warm blends and the smell of an aromatherapy massage you should appreciate this.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just a nice sensual aroma that keeps me calm and in a good mood.</li>
      <li>The price was good, and if you like sweet florally smells, you might love this</li>
      <li>I thought it could be better.</li>
      <li>LOVE the scent.  </li>
      <li>HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE A FAVORITE BRAND OF MINE ---</li>
      <li>;.I am so glad I bought this ....</li>
      <li>and I LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>Not so sure about the name.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more earthy than floral.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t speak to whether this is an aphrodisiac, but it is a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>My hubby and I both liked the scent very much.</li>
      <li>but then I decided , well, let me go ahead and try it on a light bulb....</li>
      <li>I lean toward more crisp clean, herby, citrusy smells..</li>
      <li>&amp;#34;  totally makes you really happy and calm ..</li>
      <li>so this was to sweet..</li>
      <li>This one smelled great on me and other people as well as in the room where sprayed.</li>
      <li>and i rarely used it.</li>
      <li>At first the patchouli and the orange is a bit strong that i really let this just sit around</li>
      <li>someone else said in another review this smells very much like a peppered orange even when dispersed or added to a carrier oil.</li>
      <li>Very therapeutic!</li>
      <li>ALL THEIR INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIAL OIL BOTTLES IN ITS OWN BUBBLE WRAP SECURELY.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the smell though, but I agree with others that the scent is masculine.</li>
      <li>Now its my perfume  its extremely long lasting and it becomes very warm on my skin</li>
      <li>I love this blend so much I have purchased it multiple times.</li>
      <li>But I really like it.</li>
      <li>My daughter smelled it when I used one drop in the bath and said \\&quot;you smell really weird!\\</li>
      <li>Other essential oils I got smelled good in the bottle but not on the skin.</li>
      <li>modify.&lt;br /&gt;This was expensive but the amount is bigger than other ones I found that were cheaper, and it a great blend that everyone who smelled it in my office loved.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s strong enough to scent the room without overpowering (some oils you can barely smell when diffused - but not this one).  </li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this item.  </li>
      <li>This oil is VERY strong but the only smells that are overwhelming are the orange and a crushed black pepper smell.</li>
      <li>Also lovely to add a few drops to the bath.</li>
      <li>my  roommate and I were sitting  having a conversation and all of a sudden we are both sniffing strongly with our heads back</li>
      <li>I took a chance purchasing this scent without smelling it first , however, if I was in a store and smelled the bottle I would not have bought this , for it smells like a cross between tea tree and lavender....</li>
      <li>I love a few drops of these in my humidifier now during the winter!  </li>
      <li>Definitely has not attracted my honey any more or less.</li>
      <li>the listing of some more flowery/sweet scents I was expecting something a little different.</li>
      <li>You can also use them directly on your skin if you like a stronger scent, or rub a little on a light bulb before turning on a lamp.</li>
      <li>The smell is not strong nor offensive but nothing very sensual or intriguing either.</li>
      <li>AMAZON.COM-------I FIND THEIR ESSENTIAL OILS OF HIGH QUALITY AND USUALLY IS OFFERED WITH FREE SHIPPING</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am not loving the smell, but that is only my own personal preference..</li>
      <li>It is also strong so I can count on using less than other ones I bought.</li>
      <li>The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>

    <li> While I don&#x27;t need anything &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; - I liked the list of oils on this bottle, so I thought I&#x27;d try it... and I LOVE LOVE LOVE the scent.  I use it in my diffuser and it&#x27;s strong enough to scent the room without overpowering (some oils you can barely smell when diffused - but not this one).  And I also use it in my homemade hand soap.  I was expecting it to smell floral because when I think of sensual I think of flowers... but it&#x27;s more earthy than floral.  But I really like it.</li>
    <li> My hubby and I both liked the scent very much. It is a winner.</li>
    <li> I took a chance purchasing this scent without smelling it first , however, if I was in a store and smelled the bottle I would not have bought this , for it smells like a cross between tea tree and lavender....not something I would consider seductive and sensual ....I was very disappointed . but then I decided , well, let me go ahead and try it on a light bulb....my  roommate and I were sitting  having a conversation and all of a sudden we are both sniffing strongly with our heads back and our eyes closed saying  &amp;#34; Mmmmmmm&lt;br /&gt;........this smells soooooo goooooood !!!!!!!  Ahhhhhhhhh !!!!!!  &amp;#34;  totally makes you really happy and calm ..;.I am so glad I bought this ....it definitely is sensual .....goes to show you....don&#x27;t judge a book by its cover.....if you appreciate warm blends and the smell of an aromatherapy massage you should appreciate this.  Namaste people</li>
    <li> I love this blend so much I have purchased it multiple times. No one scent is overpowering...it&#x27;s just a nice sensual aroma that keeps me calm and in a good mood. Also lovely to add a few drops to the bath.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this oil. I can&#x27;t speak to whether this is an aphrodisiac, but it is a lovely scent. I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> While I don&#x27;t doubt the quality of the oil itself, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced of the blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like someone else said in another review this smells very much like a peppered orange even when dispersed or added to a carrier oil. It&#x27;s hard to notice any of the other scents in this blend but that&#x27;s not saying that it&#x27;s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the listing of some more flowery/sweet scents I was expecting something a little different. I enjoy the smell though, but I agree with others that the scent is masculine.</li>
    <li> Again purchased to test out different essential oil companies.. The combination of oils sounded good to me so I gave it a try..&lt;br /&gt;I am not loving the smell, but that is only my own personal preference.. I lean toward more crisp clean, herby, citrusy smells.. I wear Joe Malone amber lavender cologne... so this was to sweet..&lt;br /&gt;What I did with it: combined with a carrier oil and added some rosemary and basil essential oil to cut the sweetness and am using like that.. The price was good, and if you like sweet florally smells, you might love this</li>
    <li> Only after learning, reading and researching I realized I made a big mistake buying essential oils from this company. The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this item.  Lovely scent and price was good.  Will purchase again. Can be used in bath, as well as for aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> Not so sure about the name. I (male) have tried using it for two weeks now and has not increased my drive, strength (erection), nor my longevity. Definitely has not attracted my honey any more or less.</li>
    <li> At first the patchouli and the orange is a bit strong that i really let this just sit around and i rarely used it. Now its my perfume  its extremely long lasting and it becomes very warm on my skin</li>
    <li> I love this! It is now my signature scent.everyone always tells me I smell so good.</li>
    <li> I am experimenting with making perfumes with recepies I find online and modify.&lt;br /&gt;This was expensive but the amount is bigger than other ones I found that were cheaper, and it a great blend that everyone who smelled it in my office loved. the Lavender is the strongest component in this one. Other essential oils I got smelled good in the bottle but not on the skin. This one smelled great on me and other people as well as in the room where sprayed. It is also strong so I can count on using less than other ones I bought.</li>
    <li> PLANT THERAPY BRAND ESSENTIAL OILS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.COM HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE A FAVORITE BRAND OF MINE --- IN THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS, I PURCHASED THEIR LAVENDER, GERM FIGHTER, ROSEWOOD, AND RECEIVED JUST TODAY THE SENSUAL SYNERGY MADE BY PLANT THERAPY.  I FIND THEM ALL  EXCELLENT PRODUCTS, WITH  TIMELY DELIVERY, AND GREAT PACKAGING, AS THIS BRAND ACTUALLY GOES A STEP BEYOND IN THE PACKAGING AND WRAPS ALL THEIR INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIAL OIL BOTTLES IN ITS OWN BUBBLE WRAP SECURELY.  THEN, OF COURSE, THEY GET PACKAGED AND SENT OFF BY AMAZON.COM-------I FIND THEIR ESSENTIAL OILS OF HIGH QUALITY AND USUALLY IS OFFERED WITH FREE SHIPPING ---- THAT IS A BONUS AND HELPS.  I PLAN ON USING PLANT THERAPY ESSENTIAL OILS IN THE FUTURE PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.COM.  AGAIN, I USE ESSENTIAL OILS PERSONALLY AND USE THEM IN GIFTS I MAKE FOR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES ----- THAT QUALITY GIVES THE BEST GIFTS WHICH I MAKE AROUND CHRISTMAS AND BIRTHDAYS.</li>
    <li> a bit of a confused smell...not bad, but...undefined</li>
    <li> This oil is VERY strong but the only smells that are overwhelming are the orange and a crushed black pepper smell. It&#x27;s kind of obnoxious if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re looking for.
