      <li>Great product for a relatively low price.</li>
      <li>and I enjoy the shower gel and lotion as a bonus.</li>
      <li>Its a light fragance that stays with u all day.</li>

      <li>My mom was completely blown away!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells great!! one of my favorites fragrance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for 15 years and it is getting harder to find. This is a great value.</li>
    <li> it smells fantastic , love it</li>
    <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift; it arrived a day early, and was in perfect condition.  My mom was thrilled; all three products will last her a while.  The scent isn&#x27;t too heavy, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy, as has been my experience with other scented lotions.  Great product for a relatively low price.</li>
    <li> I wanted a new signature scent and had tried sample after sample but none seemed to stay with me. Then a couple weeks ago I tried my sample of Alfred Sung. I went shopping and stopped for lunch and the hostess that seated me asked what I was wearing. Then the waitress commented on what a great scent and asked for the name. That has never happened to me before. I love the scent, its light yet lasting.  I was tired of spending big bucks on something that smelled great but the aroma didnt even last til I got out the door. Finally something I can buy and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Came quickly!! Love the scent!!  Receive many compliments from women friends and men!!  That doesn&#x27;t always happen with other scents I have worn.</li>
    <li> i ordered this for my mother inlaw i had never heard of the fragrance but was told she loved it when she received it she almost cried... neatly packaged and arrived on time.</li>
    <li> i purchased this item with only by the reviews of people!and guess what?it has absolutely incredible smell,just believe what others tell,so long lasting so fresh so feminine everyone around me liked it ,if you want compliments from other people just purchase this item youll definitely wont regret,what i liked very much is that this gift set was too big and it\\&quot;s made in USA:))))))))brilliant thanks very much for such a good product for such  a low price,i feel cool when i am in the street or in the bus so fresh:)))))</li>
    <li> I gave this to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She has always worn this perfume since I can remember.  It arrived safely and appears to be authentic.  She loves it still!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is mild but stays with you! If you want compliments from people that \\&quot;you smell good what are you wearing?\\&quot; then Sung by Alfred Sung is the one to buy !</li>
    <li> i AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE OF ALFRED AND ALSO A GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE  i WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER ALFRED SUNG FROM AMAZON IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> But i love it. it is my Summer fragrance I started wearing this in the ninties and it is getting hard to find in the stores I lucked up the other day and found the gift set at Albertsons I got for my self for valentines day. Its a light fragance that stays with u all day.</li>
    <li> I never heard of Alfred Sung until one day at a major corporation&#x27;s P. R. reception in New York I approached an elegantly-dressed lady executive from our Ontario office to discuss an issue and I was overwhelmed by a divine fragrance. After I mentioned my kids to prevent giving an impression of hitting on her, I asked her what the fragrance was because (allegedly) my wife was into colognes. She said \\&quot;Alfred Sung, a Canadian creation not usually found in the States.\\&quot; Since then I have made both my wife and a few ladies happy by getting this fragrance for them. This particular packaging is exceptionally valuable because it allows the lucky lady to do layering: take a shower with the shower gel, then apply body lotion and finish with the eau de toilette. Such deep layering would sustain the aroma throughout a whole day.</li>
    <li> Mary loves the scent but it&#x27;s becoming more and more hard to get. I usually buy her a bottle of the Sung-by-Sung when she runs out and have been for years.</li>
    <li> my girl has loved this brand for years and I was able to find this combo pack a a great value</li>
    <li> I love Alfred Sung. This has been my signature scent for years. It&#x27;s the only fragrance I can wear that doesn&#x27;t make me sick to smell. It&#x27;s a lovely clean scent that&#x27;s not overpowering. The body lotion is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I assume this will be a 5-star rating, but I haven&#x27;t opened the product yet.</li>
    <li> Love the perfume &amp; thought it would be great to get the other products to make the scent last longer but both the cream &amp; the shower gel smell off.  Not like the perfume at all. I ordered 3 of these sets &amp; wish I had kept with the perfume alone.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my lady...  it is a fabulous product, at a great price...  the one draw back is many men compliment her on it...:)</li>
    <li> This fragrance reminds me of special times. The fact that I was able to purchase at such a reasonable price makes even better.</li>
    <li> My niece was wearing this when she visited recently. She stayed at my house for a week, and invariably she&#x27;d walk into the room and the scent was so beautiful, not overpowering or obnoxious.  I&#x27;d remark and ask what it was.  She said every time SHE wears it, people ask what it is.  She left for home this morning, and I decided I&#x27;d buy the Eau De Toilette for myself!  I hope it smells as good when I wear it.</li>
    <li> What can I say.....Sung smells delicious on me!!!!!!  I receive many compliments...</li>
    <li> could not find the item in my local department store. love the scent</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Sung by Alfred Sung exclusively for well over ten years. I get compliments every single time I wear it, and it is light but haunting.  I literally spray it lightly over me like a a quick mist for a second and I am done and it lasts all day. I have worn many other far more expensive scents that were lovely and far more well known-but once I started using Sung, it became my signature-I don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else-Alfred Sung may not like that this scent is not particularly well known-but I certainly do...</li>
    <li> I purchased this beautiful gift set for my mother for Christmas.  Sung is her favorite fragrance, but she&#x27;d been unsuccessful in finding the perfume over the past few years.  I didn&#x27;t know if I would find it, but thought if it was to be found anywhere, it would be through Amazon!!  I am SOOO grateful to have Amazon, you are my favorite shopping place!!  My mom was completely blown away!!!</li>
    <li> My Mom loves this stuff. Always get it for her birthday or Christmas. She loves it. It reminds her of when I was a kid and would get her a bottle of perfume (which she probably didn&#x27;t even like!)</li>
    <li> Great price for this hard-to-find Cologne! I got this set as a gift, then ordered one for my mother-in-law! Very classy scent.</li>
    <li> Pricing was good and the items most difficult to find anymore.  Still my favorite after 25 years!</li>
    <li> This is her signature perfume; it smells wonderful on her.  She loved this gift set. So great full to have found it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sung for years. Love it. The set is reasonably priced. All good.</li>
    <li> Loved the light fresh scent!  Will be ordering it again the future.  I have gotten many compliments on this fragrance.  Only complaint is I wish the shower gel and lotion was larger.  I loved the shower gel and lotion; the scent match the spray perfectly!</li>
    <li> I love Alfred Sung, and I had been ordering from a Perfume Co. they were so obnoxious I decided to just use Amazon I love the service you give with no problems</li>
    <li> Best smelling perfume ever.</li>
    <li> This is a long time favorite perfume that I wear every day.  It&#x27;s attractive and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t overwhelm in an elevator.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price, quick delivery, and a smile from my Mom on Christmas morning.  What more did I need?  Not a perfume I had purchased in many years but one I remembered never disappointed.  Would definitely order from this company again!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes, I love thanks fast service!! awesome price  will definitely buys again and recommend! I can&#x27;t thank you enough. definitely bookmarked!</li>
    <li> Perfume was weak. Was very disappointed..... it does not smell like the one that I constantly received compliments on before.</li>
    <li> Love it Love it Love it.  The whole collections was exactly what I was expecting and smelled fabulous - would order again anytime!!!</li>
    <li> My husband hated the smell so I gave it to one of my employees and she loved it.</li>
    <li> The scent of this perfume is perfect for my taste and I enjoy the shower gel and lotion as a bonus.</li>
    <li> I l;ove it. I wish I could buy multiple packs that have two or three or more bottles in it. It is just the greatest bath gel I have ever used</li>
    <li> great price, great product, easy transaction</li>
    <li> I just realize that when I received this product I got 2 body lotions WHICH is FINE by me cause I use lotions most of the time so I didn&#x27;t mind that.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know they had lotion, perfume (which the bottle is HUGE) and body gel?? I didn&#x27;t get the body shower gel......but who cares I&#x27;m using lotions :-)&lt;br /&gt;I love this perfume so much, funny though I am using more the lotions than the perfume itself.......:-)</li>
    <li> This I ordered as it will be my sister&#x27;s birthday soon and she just loves Sung by Alfred Sung and of course the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve used other fragrances, including other Alfred Sung fragrances, Sung has been my signature fragrance for years.  I always get compliments and I truly love it.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LOVE SUNG. THE SMELL IS WONDERFUL AND TO GET THE BODYWASH,LOTION AND PARFUME ALL IN THE&lt;br /&gt;SAME PURCHASE IS REALLY A BARGIN. IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE PRICE IS JUST RIGHT.</li>
    <li> It is a good scent for day time at work, lasts all day long and I would say that is a perfect perfum for a executive woman.</li>
    <li> This is probably amongst my top 3 perfumes because it is light and airy. Countless people compliment me on my lovely scent and ask all the time &amp;#34;what are you wearing?&amp;#34; It is not one of those very expensive perfumes but could be because of the quality of the fragrance. I have bought it over and over again and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend loves it,,, fast ship,, great price</li>
    <li> This is still my favorite scent but I do wish it came in a perfume instead of toilet water.  The powder and body lotion are nice, as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift to my wife based on the good reviews, but I had never dared to buy online perfumes or similar because I need to test the scent first. At the end she didn&#x27;t like the scent and honestly It was very unpleasant for me also. I guess is a matter of tastes; I like citrus or wooden scents like Acqua de Gio. Also, they said it was not possible to ship in return because of it flammable nature. The question is: how could they ship it then?.</li>
    <li> have wore this perfume for years, love it.i always receive compliments.</li>
    <li> I love Sung by Alfred Sung.  I am allergic to many perfumes and found that Sung does not bother me at all.  The bonus is that is smells divine!!!</li>
    <li> Especially clean and fresh, Sung is light and alluring. Wonderfully sunny and bright, it freshens up in a flash and adds light to any day.</li>
