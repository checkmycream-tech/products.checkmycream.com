    <li> Best facial cleanser I have used. Does not cause any break outs which is amazing for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years now.  I have dry skin and this is like my own personal spa treatment.</li>
    <li> Clarins Cleansing Milk is my favorite cleanser.  I&#x27;ve tried several other types and brands, but this one is really good for my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 20 years.  I did stop using it at one point and was using another brand from Macy&#x27;s, but my skin started drying out, so I tried something else.  This went on for a few months and my skin was red and blotchy.  So I finally decided to go back to Clarins and it cleared up in a week.  I have not switched since.  Super good price here from this seller also - trust me, I look everywhere for the best deal on Clarins and usually buy a few at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about 15 years on and off. I must say it is top notch. Leaves your skin clean and moisturized. Highly recommend it for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Been using Clarins for years and it always amazes me.  Love how smooth, clear and how my skin glows.  This eases my face with such refreshment.  Thank you so much! Customer FOREVER!</li>
    <li> Long time customer of this gentle product. Not greasy, leaves the face feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I recently started using the whole line of Clarins face products.  This does a wonderful job of cleansing and leaving skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  It treats your skin like a baby.  The extra cost of the product is worth it.  The facial skin is very important so pays to take care of it.</li>
    <li> It is usefull even to clean my eyes which a few cleansings do both: face and eyes!...I will use it again!.  You can trust in it.</li>
    <li> Powerful for waterproof makeup.</li>
    <li> Lovely feel and scent.</li>
    <li> You actually see results in 24 hours. No joke! I hope all always be able to afford the products from this line!</li>
    <li> I found this product to be good, but not great ! Would I buy again at that price, perhaps not. I do get frustrated with these manufacturers of skin care products though. As soon as I find something I really love, generally a cleansing oil (not lotion) they discontinue them ! What&#x27;s the point of that, if you already have happy, satisfied customers ?? Pet peeve for sure :-(</li>
    <li> This is a great facial wash from Clarins.  Buy it...you will love it.  It is made with alpine herbs and leaves your skin fresh and soft. Works great for normal and sensitive skin !!</li>
    <li> Best CleanserEver!!!!!!!!! I have dry skin &amp; this cleanser takes off all of my makeup but keeps my skin soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Clarins products on and off for years. I was searching for better value than the high street prices and I found it here.&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in the old style bottles, but the content is  the same as I&#x27;d get from a high street.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was not the fastest, but within the time frame specified by the Amazon retailer I purchased it from.</li>
    <li> I like this cleansing milk as I have very dry skin year round. It cleanses well and does not dry my skin as some milk cleansers tend to.</li>
    <li> great non-drying face wash</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Gets rid of my make up at night and it feels nice on my skin. And cheaper than buying Armani milk cleanser at Saks which is excellng but way to expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for more than 30 years. Love ths product. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft and smooth. Also love the Amazon price!</li>
    <li> Works great and get&#x27;s ALL make-up off even mascara! Leaves your skin clean and soft! Won&#x27;t use anything else and it is all natural!</li>
    <li> I am normally a huge Clarins fan. I truly do Not like this cleansing milk. It smells just like my grandmas Noxema and leaves your skin with the same greasy effect. Not what I look for by buying the pricier product. It&#x27;s not awful but I would never buy this cleanser again. I will stick with my regular 1-step exfoliator and 1-step facial cleanser with the refreshing feel and smell I love in Clarins products</li>
    <li> Thank&#x27;s rate is excellent</li>
