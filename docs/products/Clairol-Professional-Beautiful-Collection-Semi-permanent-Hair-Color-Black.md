      <li>It conditions the hair and works great.  </li>
      <li>This works, gives great coverage and a great color.  </li>
      <li>This is a really good rinse.</li>
      <li>This color is good for one day  </li>
      <li>Semi color should  be good atleast for  5 to 6days.</li>
      <li>The color is even, it smells good and the formula is moisturizing.</li>
      <li>although the product was easy to use the color did not take one bit!!</li>
      <li>Unfortunately loving care was discontinued</li>
      <li>This product is nice for blending gray hair.  </li>
      <li>When Loving Care disappeared, she tried everything.  </li>
      <li>The color is great and perfect for that time grey part is coming</li>
      <li>I am professional hair stylist and I use this all the time I love it!!!</li>
      <li>Her hair was bright red at one point (we are Indian - not so attractive).  </li>
      <li>My mother is allergic to most of the hair dyes on the market.  </li>
      <li>He has balding on top and it did not stain his skin either.</li>
      <li>but (in my opinion when looking at my mom&#x27;s hair) it could cover up her grey/white better.  </li>
      <li>I usually use Nice N Easy semi permanent hair color but after doing some research I thought the Beautiful Collection would be a great alternative</li>
      <li>The condition on the bottle was perfect but the color wasn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
      <li>This product is the alternative to henna, free of PPD</li>
      <li>Overall she is happy and is willing to pay for the price of this product plus shipping.  </li>
      <li>It shampoos out quickly though.  </li>
      <li>Provides me with a beautiful rich and deep midnight coloring, and yet it makes my hair look natural...</li>
      <li>permanent hair color, black is great.</li>
      <li>Wash your hair, deep condition with a plastic cap under a hood dryer or use a blow dryer, rinse in luke warm water.</li>
      <li>Not cold water because it will close the follicle and the product will not penetrate to the maximum effectiveness.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>Please be aware that this is not permanent color.</li>
      <li>I have salt and pepper hair, most of the white is around my face.  </li>
      <li>I actually do it first, leave it on for 30 minutes than I shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Color really didn&#x27;t take.</li>
      <li>The good thing is, if you think it is too dark, just wash it a number of times with a clarifying shampoo (or dish soap, hey his hair is really short, what the heck) and it wil readily fade for you.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend for those who have allergies to any other hair dyes and still want to dye their hair. :)</li>
      <li>Decent job for the price.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product with high hopes.  </li>
      <li>It roughly comes out to 8 dollars per a bottle... which is not bad.</li>
      <li>I used the product, following the directions explicitly, but after showering noticed that it really didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>so he is ready to leave it in longer next time.</li>
      <li>The hair comes out refreshed, soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Style as usual and enjoy your new color.</li>
      <li>I mean, it&#x27;s okay...</li>
      <li>Obviously, the less you use strong shampoo on it the longer it will last.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m naturally ash blonde</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did not cover my gray well.</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Very fast shipping.  Great deal for the money. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Maybe I am using it wrong, but WOW, I squeeze some into my part, when my hair is towel dry, blow dry my hair and that is all. The color is great and perfect for that time grey part is coming and you have no time to dye entire head. It washed out soon enough. Now, when my part is showing I don;t have to run to the salon! Saving me lots of money! It also makes my hair look really great with no damaging effects at all.</li>
    <li> I am professional hair stylist and I use this all the time I love it!!!</li>
    <li> Worst product on the shelf!!! If I could give this product no stars I would. I usually use Nice N Easy semi permanent hair color but after doing some research I thought the Beautiful Collection would be a great alternative but boy was I wrong. I&#x27;m naturally ash blonde but I color my hair black and although the product was easy to use the color did not take one bit!! It was such a waste of time. My advice is do not buy this.</li>
    <li> Awful.  Color really didn&#x27;t take.</li>
    <li> This color is good for one day  it washes away with next shampoo. Semi color should  be good atleast for  5 to 6days.</li>
    <li> This product is nice for blending gray hair.  Left it on my husband&#x27;s mixed black and gray hair for just 15 minutes and blended a lot but not all of his grays in.  He didn&#x27;t want a sudden obvious change.  Has lasted quite a few washes so far and no one commented on him coloring his hair so he is ready to leave it in longer next time. Obviously, the less you use strong shampoo on it the longer it will last.  He takes multiple showers a day but only washes hair with shampoo once every 2 days. The good thing is, if you think it is too dark, just wash it a number of times with a clarifying shampoo (or dish soap, hey his hair is really short, what the heck) and it wil readily fade for you.  He has balding on top and it did not stain his skin either.</li>
    <li> Decent job for the price.  It rinsed out after about three or four washes and I didn&#x27;t have an issue with it rubbing off on my clothes as others have stated. It does splash so cover your area with paper towel or newspaper do you don&#x27;t stain anything!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hypoallergenic.  My mom is severely allergic to hair dyes.  When Loving Care disappeared, she tried everything.  Her hair was bright red at one point (we are Indian - not so attractive).  This works, gives great coverage and a great color.  It shampoos out quickly though.  So she has to dye weekly, but that&#x27;s always been the case.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. Purchased black to cover my gray as ad said it would and followed directions to apply. Took solution to the shop and had my hairdresser to apply color. Bad news, it did not work. Would like a refund. What do I need to do? Waste of time and $$.</li>
    <li> This is the best product if you relax your hair and then have to color it. I learned the hard way, don&#x27;t mess around with anything else but Clairol&#x27;s Beautiful Semi or your hair will breakout.</li>
    <li> My mother is allergic to most of the hair dyes on the market.  Unfortunately loving care was discontinued so I had to look for something that was equal in effectiveness without giving her an allergic reaction.  She cannot go to the hair salon because she gets a reaction from the products used in the salon as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product does the job... but (in my opinion when looking at my mom&#x27;s hair) it could cover up her grey/white better.  Overall she is happy and is willing to pay for the price of this product plus shipping.  It roughly comes out to 8 dollars per a bottle... which is not bad.</li>
    <li> I bought this product with high hopes.  I have salt and pepper hair, most of the white is around my face.  I used the product, following the directions explicitly, but after showering noticed that it really didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is a really good rinse. The color is even, it smells good and the formula is moisturizing. The hair comes out refreshed, soft and shiny. It&#x27;s not drying at all. As a result I repurchase often in the color black to help blend with half wigs. Please be aware that this is not permanent color. It will gradually fade away with washes. It&#x27;s not damaging! Therefore you can&#x27;t get a blonde rinse and think your hair will come out blonde if you&#x27;re already brunette without lifting. When I had thicker, longer hair (about bra strap length) I had to use two bottles to saturate all the hair. Now I only need one for shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Activate the color with heat. Wash your hair, deep condition with a plastic cap under a hood dryer or use a blow dryer, rinse in luke warm water. Not hot water because it will dry out the hair and reverse the moisture from the deep conditioning. Not cold water because it will close the follicle and the product will not penetrate to the maximum effectiveness. Apply the product, get under the dryer again for 30 minutes and then rinse with the coldest water you can stand to close the follicle and seal the color in. Style as usual and enjoy your new color.</li>
    <li> Provides me with a beautiful rich and deep midnight coloring, and yet it makes my hair look natural...as if I do not have to color my hair at all!!!</li>
    <li> This product is the alternative to henna, free of PPD</li>
    <li> Clairol Processional Beautiful collection semi- permanent hair color, black is great. I like to use a lot. It is very good</li>
    <li> Ibought this to help make my color last.  I use  on the roots.  I actually do it first, leave it on for 30 minutes than I shampoo and conditioner.  I do not like the feel of my hair when i put it on after.  It conditions the hair and works great.  I have a lot of gray so I use it avery 2 - 3 weeks and color my hair every 6 -8 weeks now.  I will try the other one for grey hair.</li>
    <li> The condition on the bottle was perfect but the color wasn&#x27;t strong enough. I had blondish brown hair , the Clairol Profession Black just made it dark brown. Maybe if you apply it twice, the color will be black.</li>
    <li> I mean, it&#x27;s okay... It didn&#x27;t dye my hair black as advertised but it did make it darker. It only lasts about a week or two though. I like this product as I am severely allergic to other black/dark hair dyes due to the PPD in them, and this dye does not contain any harsh ingredients that would cause an allergic reaction. Would recommend for those who have allergies to any other hair dyes and still want to dye their hair. :)</li>
