    <li> I used this to set the Wolfe hydrocolors around my eye and it it didn&#x27;t fade at all. So far, I&#x27;m really pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Worked great and gave just enough shimmer but set makeup nicely not heavy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Ben Nye neutral setting powder for almost two years now, and I really like it. I usually apply it during the day time when my face gets oily and it really helps to absorb the oil. It doesn&#x27;t keep all of the oil away, but you can definitely tell the difference. It really smooths out my skin and blends my imperfections. Amazon sells it for much more than other websites, but with prime it came really quickly. I really like this powder. It has become a staple in my daily makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Love all Ben Nye products. I have the banana powder and wanted something to set my foundation with. This is perfect. It arrived quickly and just as described. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Awesome setting powder. Reduces oil as well</li>
    <li> Love it&#x27;!!! Better than makeup forever setting powder 3x more product and half the price</li>
    <li> I like this product. It was good. It really helped my life a lot. THank you for sending on time.</li>
    <li> stuff is really light, like a veil. doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and you only need a little bit to cover your whole face. My makeup actually stays all day and I have really oily skin.</li>
    <li> This power is white, yet it does not look white when applied. I put it on after my foundation and blush. As it says, it is a setting powder. It does help keep make up set, but it also gives a more finished look to face. I really notice a difference if I don&#x27;t use it. My face looks more even and for lack of a better word complete with this final step of Ben Nye setting powder.  The only thing I would change is the top. It is a little small. I shake a small amount in the cap and use a brush to apply, but it is a little tight. It last a long time, but I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I love all the Ben nye powders!  Fabulous finish every time! Cameo is great for brightening and translucent is perfect for finishing out your look!</li>
    <li> Love it! Helps me stay matte throughout the day!</li>
    <li> Best powder i am ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I never get oily anymore, it goes on so nicely. This is now my go-to powder</li>
    <li> the bottle was to small For its Price</li>
    <li> love thismakeup mu clients do too!!</li>
    <li> sets all your makeup needs especially troll makeup !</li>
    <li> I like this powder...it&#x27;s light and looks natural</li>
    <li> The price is not suit for the product that much but still okay. It&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> I perform outdoors in all weather and this setting powder has helped to keep my makeup from streaking and running, even in the rain!</li>
    <li> I thought I had read thoroughly  of the description of receiving a sample variety of different colors of Ben nye setting powders to only receive 1 &amp; it was translucent.  Which is too white &amp; cake for me. It dries so much under my eyes, it cracks &amp; looks like I have wrinkles. I just threw it away with disappointment. Prior to purchasing from this distributor, I&#x27;m pretty certain I read thoroughly like others that also made the same statement as this of receiving a variety of samples to end up receiving just 1, after the purchase the picture &amp; description changed. I should have sent it back, but it&#x27;s too late</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product,so far I&#x27;ve only used it to mattify my lipstick and it works like a charm! My lipstick stays on for hours even when I eat or drink any liquids:D</li>
    <li> Set my lipstick very well as well as my foundation it will last me forever and it was a great price</li>
    <li> I really like this powder. it really sets and completes my L&#x27;Oreal  true match foundation.</li>
    <li> Ben Nye Neutral Set is wonderful especially in the summer months when its hot and humid.  Sets your everyday makeup wonderfully.  Keeps it from sweating off. Running. Perfect in between mascara coats. Love this product!</li>
    <li> I love this. A little goes a long way, and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It even came earlier than expected.</li>
