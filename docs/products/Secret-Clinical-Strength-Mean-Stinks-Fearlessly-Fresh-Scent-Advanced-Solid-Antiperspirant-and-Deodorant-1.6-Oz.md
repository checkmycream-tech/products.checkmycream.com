### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent quality.</li>
      <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
      <li>My wife says that this is the best antiperspirant that she has found to work.</li>
      <li>wonderful solution for odor.  </li>
      <li>This is great for controlling wetness and odor - and smells great - so if you do get sweaty, you still smell good!</li>
      <li>i am one happy customer.</li>
      <li>love this.. great smell</li>
      <li>Excellent product, does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
      <li>I purchased this version and it smelled nice and applied to the underarm area well.  </li>
      <li>this is by far the best working deodorant i have ever found.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly and has pleasant odor.</li>
      <li>and I LOVE</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on Amazon, could not find it at our stores.</li>
      <li>But there are so many side effects - itchy underarms, burning, sometimes a rash...</li>
      <li>so was glad to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Lasted longer than most.</li>
      <li>Love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Been using this maybe a month, and nothing speaks to success like not worrying about my pits!</li>
      <li>I have legitimate BO despite being a clean girl and trying every type of deodorant.  </li>
      <li>but I am 43 years old :)  </li>
      <li>We swapped, since this one is more  clean than teen.</li>
      <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Sort of funny b/c</li>
      <li>I can only smell a light, fresh scent that I can tell is doing the job -</li>
      <li>Will find another way to get a product I can surely do without since I have done so for so long.</li>
      <li>Love the scent and keeps me really dry, and I smell ....</li>
      <li>I have tried everything - certain dri, crystal, men&#x27;s deodorant, every store brand....</li>
      <li>what a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that certain dri does work for me as well.  </li>
      <li>never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  </li>
      <li>but it did not do much for keeping the odor at bay.  </li>
      <li>that I am so much happier if I don&#x27;t have to use it.  </li>
      <li>It was very noticeable.</li>
      <li>and it dries clear on me!!!</li>
      <li>I can use my more natural deodorant and this one works still to keep me mostly dry.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone who feels like even the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; deodorants leave them sweating or with body odor.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me itchy (like some other clinical strength deodorants) lasts long and keeps me dry and smelling great.</li>
      <li>Not a juvenile scent, which is what I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>I hope that Secret keeps this product around because it is amazing and works so well.</li>
      <li>Came just as expected and right on time.</li>
      <li>Tried lots of deodorants to cut down on perspiration but this product works better than any other that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Just wish it was clear, it&#x27;s too white and leaves marks if you are not careful.</li>
      <li>This summer, I wanted to try the clear gel, as the solids can leave white residue on clothing.  </li>
      <li>I started wearing the Secret Clinical Strength maybe 2 years ago and this is my favorite scent of the bunch.  </li>
      <li>Would purchase again because it is the better than the Clinical Strength Secret for me.</li>
      <li>I switched back to my soft solid.</li>

<li> Secret has a money back guarantee, so I wrote to tell to let them know their formula needed tweaking.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Secret deodorants.  </li>
<li> I tired them all</li>
<li> for some reason secret products just stopped working for me!  </li>
<li> it had some ingredients that were potentially dangerous.  </li>
<li> It does get rid of bad oders</li>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work on me at all!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything - certain dri, crystal, men&#x27;s deodorant, every store brand....and I LOVE this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply at night, and I know it works because I don&#x27;t have to think about it again. With other deodorants, at some point in the next day I find myself checking my pits to make sure it is working, and often I realize the odor of the deodorant has only masked my sweat or mixed with it to create a really gross smell that is somehow worse.  Not so with this!  I can only smell a light, fresh scent that I can tell is doing the job - what a relief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that certain dri does work for me as well.  But there are so many side effects - itchy underarms, burning, sometimes a rash...that I am so much happier if I don&#x27;t have to use it.  Been using this maybe a month, and nothing speaks to success like not worrying about my pits!</li>
    <li> have switched to this exclusively and all version like it scented or not.  wonderful solution for odor.  never had problem with too much sweat, just offensive odor.  absolutely no problem now.  this price is unbeatable in stores</li>
    <li> Love the scent and keeps me really dry, and I smell ....this is the only one that works  The scent is floral without being too perfumy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long-time user of Secret deodorants.  When their Clinical line was released, I switched over to that, using their soft-solids.  This summer, I wanted to try the clear gel, as the solids can leave white residue on clothing.  I purchased this version and it smelled nice and applied to the underarm area well.  It kept the area fairly dry but it did not do much for keeping the odor at bay.  Secret has a money back guarantee, so I wrote to tell to let them know their formula needed tweaking.  I switched back to my soft solid.</li>
    <li> Came just as expected and right on time. Love this deodorant. Doesn&#x27;t make me itchy (like some other clinical strength deodorants) lasts long and keeps me dry and smelling great.</li>
    <li> Not a juvenile scent, which is what I thought it would be. I bought this for my daughter and another scent for me. We swapped, since this one is more  clean than teen. Plus, application will last a couple days. What I mean is if I apply today, and shower tomorrow, my underarm still is dry even after a few soap ups. I can use my more natural deodorant and this one works still to keep me mostly dry.</li>
    <li> I got this product thinking it would keep up with my activity level. I started to noticed I would stink during my workouts and I never noticed it before.  It was very noticeable. I realized it happened after I switched to this deodorant. I bought my standard secret and will see if that was the reason.</li>
    <li> What a rip off!!  It does get rid of bad oders but I was so pissed off at the quantity you actually get!!  You have to twist in order to get a creamy textured stuff to come out.  By the time it does you are already at just half of the actual size of the plastic distributor!!  I feel I&#x27;ve been cheated.  Will find another way to get a product I can surely do without since I have done so for so long.</li>
    <li> Tried lots of deodorants to cut down on perspiration but this product works better than any other that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I tired them all and none works as well Secret Clinical Strength Deodorant.  So glad I found it on Amazon, could not find it at our stores.</li>
    <li> I have legitimate BO despite being a clean girl and trying every type of deodorant.  I even had a Drysol prescription until I found out it had some ingredients that were potentially dangerous.  This deodorant actually is the only one that works for me.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who feels like even the \\&quot;clinical strength\\&quot; deodorants leave them sweating or with body odor.  I have been looking for it in the drug stores and haven&#x27;t found it lately.  I am ordering it online so that I do not run out.  I hope that Secret keeps this product around because it is amazing and works so well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> love this.. great smell</li>
    <li> Secret Clinical Strength Mean Stinks Advanced Solid Antiperspirant and deodorant works fantastic. This stuff really does work! Best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> My wife says that this is the best antiperspirant that she has found to work. It does not leave a visible residue on clothing.</li>
    <li> This is great for controlling wetness and odor - and smells great - so if you do get sweaty, you still smell good!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
    <li> Buy this, it works.  Just wish it was clear, it&#x27;s too white and leaves marks if you are not careful.</li>
    <li> Lasted longer than most. Dries quickly and has pleasant odor. Would purchase again because it is the better than the Clinical Strength Secret for me.</li>
    <li> I started wearing the Secret Clinical Strength maybe 2 years ago and this is my favorite scent of the bunch.  Sort of funny b/c it looks like it&#x27;s marketed to teens (name &amp;#34;Mean Stinks&amp;#34; and design of box) but I am 43 years old :)  But I like the scent so who cares.  I have had trouble finding this in stores recently so was glad to be able to order it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> for some reason secret products just stopped working for me!  makes me wonder if they reformulated their products or what but i&#x27;ve spent $$$ on all the different types (gels, solid, semi-solid) and all the different scents and none have worked!  super frustrated!  i went out and bought arm and hammer brand and viola!  it works all day all night!  plus, it&#x27;s about $3 vs the $8 i spent on this.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best working deodorant i have ever found. and it dries clear on me!!! i am one happy customer.</li>
