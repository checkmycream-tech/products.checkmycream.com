      <li>Its better for your own health, and better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only is this lotion amazing for moisturizing it has the best smell.</li>

      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Always a favorite.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell and the creamy richness.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Plus I have to use more than with Nubian Heritage Mango Butter.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;The problem with Emulsifying Wax is that it&#x27;s not just one chemical, but a cocktail of many....</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>Love thus lotion.</li>
      <li>This stuff right here smells very good and has a real creamy texture.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin soft and is great for all skin types.</li>
      <li>My 35 year old skin looks great post delivery.</li>
      <li>It smells delicious, like oranges and other citrus and the smell lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>Their other products are wonderful as well.</li>
      <li>They burn my skin, and they are packed full of carcinogens!</li>
      <li>They burn my skin, and they are packed full of carcinogens!</li>
      <li>I love the smell it&#x27;s got a clean scent ,It&#x27;s not overpowering  </li>
      <li>This company makes a truly wonderful product .. just which they could do it a little cheaper?</li>
      <li>I specifically ordered this because i thought it was the original version.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on to your skin very smoothly and moisturizes very well.</li>
      <li>Smells yummy, and if you are looking for a better, more natural lotion than you will find at your local mall or grocery store, this is a good step up.</li>
      <li>And it really does make my skin feel so much better in the morning.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this lotion, it&#x27;s very fruity and sweet.  </li>
      <li>This lotion works great to prevent stretch marks due to pregnancy.</li>
      <li>I used this once a day before bedtime from the time I found out I was pregnant until delivery.</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells it makes my skin so soft ALL day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m young and able-bodied and I have to take the cap off to be able to squeeze the lotion out.</li>
      <li>It didnt really do anything special though...</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>Lotion make skin fee smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>So much yum!</li>
      <li>Thick, lasting, smells AMAZING!!!</li>
      <li>Sound harmless enough, right?</li>
      <li>Thick and rich with a nice smell.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is thick and feels good on skin</li>
      <li>As of yet, 100% pure brand creams and Dr. Bronners products are the only lotions I have found that are TRULY all natural and FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I would give it a full 5 stars if it came in a bottle that actually worked to deliver the lotion.  </li>
      <li>I have tried the other Nubian Heritage lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>whenever I&#x27;m putting it on, anyone near me wants to know what it is.</li>
      <li>My intent was to purchase something brand new, not a never-been-used bottle of lotion that can no longer be sold in stores because of it&#x27;s dated packaging and has undoubtedly sat in a warehouse for years...    </li>
      <li>If regular cocoa butter and shea works for you i wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this honestly.</li>
      <li>Try all natural products, remember that your skin absorbs what you put on it!  </li>
      <li>However, I am only interested in truly natural products, and this one has an ingredient that has me turning away:</li>
      <li>It should certainly be packaged in a different container.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Making little changes in your beauty products to more natural ingredients can make a big difference in how you feel.  </li>
      <li>think we need to definitely support smaller businesses that are making a more natural product than you would usually buy.</li>
      <li>This yields about one ounce, enough to last at least a week or more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve discounted most lotions not only because of some of their ingredients but because they only moisturize for a few minutes since I have very dry skin.  </li>
      <li>While the container may have little bearing on the quality of the contents - assuming the ingredients in the lotion are not perishable/do not have an expiration date - it is still very misleading and a poor business practice on the part of the seller to use a more current image of the product than what will actually be shipped to the consumer.</li>

<li> Mango Butter Lotion is very thick.</li>

    <li> Not only is this lotion amazing for moisturizing it has the best smell. Smells like a dreamsicle!</li>
    <li> Not the same bottle pictured. It says &amp;#34;body lotion&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;. I specifically ordered this because i thought it was the original version. The sellers are intentionally being deceptive, as i already alerted them over this issue. The bottle in the picture i have attached is not what you will receive...</li>
    <li> This lotion works great to prevent stretch marks due to pregnancy. I used this once a day before bedtime from the time I found out I was pregnant until delivery. I used this on my stomach, waist, upper thighs, and breasts and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks! My 35 year old skin looks great post delivery. This stuff really works!</li>
    <li> very nice product, ove the scent&lt;br /&gt;will be trying other items in this line</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed with this purchase because the product that I received is obviously in a much older style container than the one pictured here. Mine actually came in a bottle w/ this design and label: [...]. I reported the image as inaccurate, so hopefully this will be remedied soon. While the container may have little bearing on the quality of the contents - assuming the ingredients in the lotion are not perishable/do not have an expiration date - it is still very misleading and a poor business practice on the part of the seller to use a more current image of the product than what will actually be shipped to the consumer.

On the plus side, the lotion does have a very pleasant smell and feels nice on my skin, so not a total loss.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion, it&#x27;s very fruity and sweet.  The scent retains all it&#x27;s notes as time goes on and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache like scents from the big lotion store found in every mall.  I alternate between this and another lotion for my hands at bedtime.  It&#x27;s very thick and creamy and moisturizes well, it&#x27;s not greasy and a little goes a long way.  I would give it a full 5 stars if it came in a bottle that actually worked to deliver the lotion.  The bottle is very thick plastic and the lotion is very thick making it nearly impossible to squeeze out.  I&#x27;m young and able-bodied and I have to take the cap off to be able to squeeze the lotion out. I anticipate that I&#x27;m going to have to use a tongue depressor or something to scoop the lotion out once it gets about half empty.</li>
    <li> Obsessed. This stuff is literally like butter. Like smoothing on butter that smells like mango. A little goes a lot further than lotion. So much yum!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product. Purchase it over and over again. Leaves skin soft and is great for all skin types. Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Lotion smells wonderful, and is nice and smooth. Can even use on your face. Love the product. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, I reccomend you do. It&#x27;s like a body butter.</li>
    <li> This stuff goes on to your skin very smoothly and moisturizes very well. The mango scent is amazing. It reminds me of the smell of Starburst candy or Skittles candy! Nubian Heritage&#x27;s Lotion is the only lotion I ever use!</li>
    <li> Love this brand. The lotion is thick and feels good on skin</li>
    <li> This company makes a truly wonderful product .. just which they could do it a little cheaper?</li>
    <li> One of the best lotions out there. Thick and rich with a nice smell. Their other products are wonderful as well.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I used to purchase it in stores and am greatful I can purchase it online!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the creamy richness.</li>
    <li> I love the smell it&#x27;s got a clean scent ,It&#x27;s not overpowering  and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  Feels good when you put it on</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells it makes my skin so soft ALL day</li>
    <li> I have used this product repeatedly, despite the difficulty to get it out of the bottle. it&#x27;s wonderful . Sue wish they&#x27;d put in in a jar</li>
    <li> This stuff right here smells very good and has a real creamy texture. It didnt really do anything special though...If regular cocoa butter and shea works for you i wouldn&#x27;t waste the money on this honestly.</li>
    <li> Another top of the line lotion... Scent is not overpowering.. rather relaxing.  Lotion make skin fee smooth and soft.  You&#x27;ll be happy with the purchase.  also,  Product was sent sooner than I had expected.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell works great</li>
    <li> I want to like this lotion but it is thicker than mud.  I am having a really hard time just getting it out of the bottle.  It should certainly be packaged in a different container.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discounted most lotions not only because of some of their ingredients but because they only moisturize for a few minutes since I have very dry skin.  Plus I have to use more than with Nubian Heritage Mango Butter. Mango Butter Lotion is very thick. If you turn the bottle upside down, none will leak out. The only downside to the thickness is that once the bottle is almost empty I have to saw the bottle in half with a sharp knife so the remaining lotion can be scraped out. This yields about one ounce, enough to last at least a week or more. I have used this lotion literally from head to toe for several years.  It smells wonderful and whenever I&#x27;m putting it on, anyone near me wants to know what it is. I can honestly say that this lotion has re-texturized the skin on some areas my body though this is not a claim that the company makes.  As long as they make this lotion, I will be buying it.</li>
    <li> Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter*, Deionized Water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter)*, Stearyl Alcohol (Palm Kernel), Ceteareth 20 (Emulsifying Wax), Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter*, Vegetable Glycerin, Jojoba Oil*, Essential Oil Blend, Carbomer, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Orange Oil, Allantoin (Comfrey Root Extract), Lonicera Caprifolium (Honeysuckle) Flower , Lonicera Japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) Flower extract&lt;br /&gt;*Certified Organic Ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is about the same as for their coconut papaya lotion. Smells yummy, and if you are looking for a better, more natural lotion than you will find at your local mall or grocery store, this is a good step up. However, I am only interested in truly natural products, and this one has an ingredient that has me turning away: emulsifying wax. Sound harmless enough, right? I found this information on the chemical of the day section of Bubble and Bee organic website (an awesome website to turn to when you can&#x27;t figure out what ingredients are good or bad)&lt;br /&gt;..\\&quot;The problem with Emulsifying Wax is that it&#x27;s not just one chemical, but a cocktail of many....Cetearyl Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate 60&lt;br /&gt;PEG-150 Stearate&lt;br /&gt;Steareth-20\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not what I want in a lotion, so I am not repurchasing it. It irritated my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we need to definitely support smaller businesses that are making a more natural product than you would usually buy. Its better for your own health, and better for the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not the best. As of yet, 100% pure brand creams and Dr. Bronners products are the only lotions I have found that are TRULY all natural and FANTASTIC. However, I only use Nutiva organic hemp oil for my face and body, its luxurious and fantastically moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making little changes in your beauty products to more natural ingredients can make a big difference in how you feel.  Try all natural products, remember that your skin absorbs what you put on it!  I worked for years at a nation chain beauty store that specializes in lotions, creams, etc. and I can&#x27;t even use anything we sell! They burn my skin, and they are packed full of carcinogens! Do a little research on the ingredients of your beauty products, you might be surprised at what you find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my review of the seller, B&amp;M Global Distribution: I received my lotion in a padded envelope.

    <li> I have tried the other Nubian Heritage lotions and this is by far my favorite. It smells delicious, like oranges and other citrus and the smell lasts for hours. It is also extremely moisturizing. I put it on after I shower and my skin is moisturized the entire day!! I don&#x27;t see myself ever using any other lotion.</li>
    <li> Thick, lasting, smells AMAZING!!! The BEST hand lotion you can buy :)) I have very dry skin and hate to reapply repeatedly all day so this is my run to winter lotion</li>
    <li> This smells so good! And it really does make my skin feel so much better in the morning.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite.  Absorbs well, never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It is thick and moisturizing but not greasy!</li>
    <li> Love thus lotion. Delivered on time. Still using it. Great for my nails</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
