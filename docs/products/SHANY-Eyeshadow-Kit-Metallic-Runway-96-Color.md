<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought 3 of these. Gifts for my neices on Christmas. They love all the different colors. Very good price for the product.</li>
    <li> Well, to start out, it took almost 3 weeks to receive. Then when it DID come, several eyeshadows were broken. To top that off, NONE of the colors look like the picture. They aren&#x27;t bright and vivid - they&#x27;re dull, neutral, and almost all of them look the same. This is THE worst palette I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It LOOKS cheap. I&#x27;ll be returning it and ordering the NYX palette instead. I know NYX holds up to their color swatches.</li>
    <li> hay i received my shany eyeshadow palette the other and I was in serious like with it. However; several of the colors were broken ....7 colors to be exact that turned my smile upside down. What&#x27;s up with that?!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim i was just looking for some new fun colors of eye shadow. I received the product quickly and in excellent condition. Very beautiful colors and so many choices! I love the metallic finish of all these colors and you get quite a bit of ever color i have been using it everyday and have yet to repeat a color combo  I will absolutely order from Shany again i cannot say enough good things about this product! you get way more than you would expect for a cheap price!</li>
    <li> Eye shadows were all broken    I opened package and it was really packed safe, but when i opened the box with eye shadows  , they were all cracked ..i was really upset ..the colors were nice thou ..</li>
    <li> Excellent product, has a box easy to use and is very compact when closed. It has many colors, besides being a very solid makeup, which made my wife very happy with this.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my order today. It was fully intack.. no broken colors! The colors all look very bright and shimmier, and the brushes are all there. The shadows are a nice size, not too small.. you definetly get enough! It all folds into a very nice little compartment, which is easy to open once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my little sister for xmas and she really loved it!!  The colors are great and they last all day.  The only problem i had was that 2 colors were broken when  received them.</li>
    <li> I ordered this palette because of the beautiful colors shown in the picture (pinks, blues, etc..) When I received it, it wasn&#x27;t the same colors as pictured.. It&#x27;s mostly browns, golds, etc.. However, I am truly in love with shany cosmetics &amp; have ordered almost every single palette! Giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s nit as pictured, but shany&#x27;s the best, &amp; I love the palette..</li>
    <li> This palette is nice not the best bought it for 16.99 now its 25 dont think its worth that much....</li>
    <li> My order came in with two broken colors, but its okay because there is a lot more to choose from. The eye shadow goes on nice and smooth and its easy to blend :)</li>
    <li> I love Shany cosmetics &amp; have ordered several from Amazon over the past few years. I ordered this kit recently, and although the colors are nice &amp; there&#x27;s quite a big selection (especially for the price!) a few pots of shadow were broken up &amp; had spread into each other when it arrived. I don&#x27;t THINK this is due to anything Amazon did, as the product was packaged nicely, but just a heads up that these shadows do seem to be crushed &amp; bleed into other colors pretty easily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this due to the cost and variety. I have had it for a few months and I still cant use every color so many amazing ones! They all have a faint shimmer but the quality is nice. I always use their base colors since there is more of a matte look. The blues/greens/purples/browns are my favorite and they really make your eyes pop. I could care less for the others but the amount of great ones more than pays for this. the reds are very red and prominent.</li>
    <li> Great packaging and great product! It arrived early and was in great condition the colors are bright and looks great on. You can also tell it&#x27;s not cheap makeup as well great work! thank you!</li>
    <li> Okay so this palette arrived with at least 6 of the total eye-shadows broken into unusable pieces. Most of the colors which were broken were on the bottom level of the kit. I still give this kit 4 stars (would have been a 5) because of the beauty of what remained. Many of these shades can be blended with heavier colors or worn alone for a shimmery effect. I only wish that the package had been well wrapped like other SHANY products- this is my third eye shadow kit from them and I also have two of their brush kits (glorious brushes I say again) which were well padded and double wrapped. This product came in an amazon box and the original package alone- no bubble wrap noted. Again I cannot rate this palette poorly- it is not bad at all- it is honestly very impressive. Would recommend easily to anyone.</li>
    <li> i was kind of unsure in purchasing this product because the colors on the pictures looks so bright. Im just not sure if i can wear it on a day to day basis. When I received it i tried it on right away, played with the colors and it brightens my eyes but not in a way that it grabs people&#x27;s attention. It does not look like a cheap looking makeup when applied.. smooth and many colors u can choose from.. What i like about this palette the most is that it prevents my eyes to look like its tired.. it goes also with every outfit.. :)</li>
    <li> Great price, great product. Very natural but still noticeable. So many possibilities due to the large number of colors. I love it!</li>
    <li> eyeshadows are smaller then expected, nice colors has less then 96 though but WHAT I HATE is opening the thing IT TAKES FOREVER TO OPEN nd breaks my nails off took 1 whole star off for that -_-</li>
    <li> I love it...It arrived early then i was expected,my order came with 3 broken colors but it&#x27;s ok cause theres a lot more colors to choose from.The color was the same on the pictures!!</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this product. My sister bought it first and experimented with mixing the colors to match her outfits. I started noticing how awesome her eyes looked so i asked her what she was using. She told me about this palatte and the great price on Amazon. So i bought my own and loved it. I even told a friend, who then bought one for herself. The colors are great, the combinations are infinite, and the make up doesnf cake or smear. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item arrived today and I was pleasantly surprised by the sleek packaing and the beautiful selection of shimmering colors.  Since it is a gift for my daughter, I did not try the eye shadow on myself, so I&#x27;m hoping previous reviews about the quality are accurate.  The kit was very well packaged in layers of bubble wrap with a warning to open with care.  I was happy to see that none of the color circles were cracked or broken.  I am giving this item four stars (intead of five) for two reasons only:  1.  The kit itself is a little tricky to open.  It took me several trys to get it unlatched to open.  I guess on a positive note, the kit won&#x27;t open on its own if it&#x27;s tossed in a suitcase or overnight bag.  2.  There are only four double-sided shadow applicators in the whole kit.  For having 96 colors, 16 sides of an applicator seems inadequate.  However, for the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t expect 96 applicators, but a few extras would be nice.  Overall, it appears to be a great product and I expect my daughter to enjoy it.  Thank you Amazon for offering this product.</li>
    <li> I was leery of buying this at first for many reasons, unknown brand, buying a product sight-unseen online, etc. I was very impressed with the quality of the eye shadow. Normally I don&#x27;t bother to come back to write reviews, but that&#x27;s how surprised I was with what I got. As a point of reference I&#x27;m a 20-something that absolutely must match my makeup to what I&#x27;m wearing.   I received it in perfect condition. I saw reviews talking about how it&#x27;s difficult to open, I wouldn&#x27;t even bother mentioning it if it weren&#x27;t for those complaints. The secret to getting it open is to get a fingernail under the little tab that holds it closed, after that I just didn&#x27;t close it all the way so there&#x27;s no issue there.  The colors go on vibrantly, even the dark colors only require one swipe. The powder almost seems more like a cream/powder, it&#x27;s very smooth. Highly recommended for the price, definitely much better quality for your money than what you&#x27;ll get on the holiday aisle in places like Wal-mart.</li>
    <li> i Absoloutely LOVE This palette !  the Colors Are VERY Pigmented , Blend VERY Well , &amp;&amp; Are All FUN Bright Colors !  i HiGHLY Recommend If Your A Fan Of Vibrant , Bright Colors :)  Although Some colors Are repeated You Cant Go Wrong !   P.s. Im A Girl &amp; use Mt Brothers Account haha</li>
    <li> This palette is definitely worth $15.  The color is rich and well saturated.  I use eye primer before shadow application, and I know this helps make the color pop and last.  There is a nice variety of color, and the metallic really shimmers on the eye. The one complaint I have is that the trays do not slide well.  They are very temperamental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen kits like this for more than double this amount.  It really is a good buy.</li>
    <li> I am tired of receiving broken pallets. I have to return it for the third time today. NEVER AGAIN. If number three comes back broken I will be requesting a refund due to very very poor packaging and I believe it is broken before it ships from the facility. I am annoyed. I do not recommend this product to anyone esp. if you do not have patience to deal with the stupidity.</li>
    <li> Just got it today 7 colors were broken. Luckily colors I wouldn&#x27;t normally wear on an everyday basis and there are similar colors. Giving it 2 stars based on the fact that the packaging was terrible. They did nothing to make sure the colors wouldn&#x27;t break. I read all the reviews and decided to take my chances. Buy at your own risk. If you don&#x27;t mind cleaning a little mess for some overall pretty colors then it&#x27;s not a bad deal. But most likely will be broken.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeshadow. My mom has had it for awhile and everytime i went over i would put some on! I mentioned to her how much i liked it and she suprised me with it today! It came intact no broken colors and I do love how its not bulky so it will fit into my makeup box! If you love metallic eyeshadow this is a great deal!</li>
    <li> When I got this in the mail 2 of the eyeshadows were broken and of course it made a mess in the case! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Within 10 minutes I had the mess cleaned up and the rest of the eyeshadows (95 I think) were still all perfect!&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of colors, they do shimmer, and they are long wearing &amp; it is not sheer color. I love them! Two broke shades did not make me want to return this set and I am a picky person! Lol&lt;br /&gt;Just know when you buy these you are taking a risk that some colors may be broken, but the colors that remain are GREAT!</li>
    <li> great colors great size great price the three top things your looking for in makeup just got a whole lot easier, with this makeup pallet, you&#x27;ll be sure to make a huge enterance</li>
    <li> This is a great palette. It&#x27;s super shimmery, but not in a bad way. The colors are so gorgeous, I have trouble picking out what to wear. When I&#x27;m just playing with it, I have my eyes with different eyeshadows, just because there are too many beautiful colors. They are buildable a color is not as pigmented as you like.</li>
    <li> I love this palette for a few different reasons. One, it&#x27;s so affordable, and secondly it&#x27;s got just about any color you can think of and then some. This is great for any artist that travels, or beginners. Great quality!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I ordered the eyeshadow so I knew that I was running the risk of having to get a replacement based on broken eyeshadow but I was not expecting what I got. The amazon box from the outside looked perfect and the inside packing material was undisturbed but when I pulled the shany box out of the amazon box a corner of the shany box was crushed. The eyeshadow comes in a plastic case with a attached mirror, the end of the plastic case and the entire mirror was broken as were 5 eyeshadows. Based on other reviews I thought that I would be able to get a replacement, not so. Amazon says I can&#x27;t get a replacement because it happened before shipping, I need to get ahold of the distributor, but guess who I ordered it from? Yep, I ordered it from amazon using prime. If you want to see exactly what I was shipped I posted it in the pictures, it&#x27;s the one with the busted mirror. Love the eyeshadow, not so happy with amazon.</li>
    <li> But they are not as metallic as indicated. Some of them definitely fit the bill but for the most part these are flat shadows with a pearl/metallic sheen over the top of them. The shadows tend to get powdery once you place a brush onto them and the \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; sheen goes away. A lot of the colors seem to be the same or very, very nearly the same so I&#x27;d go with about 85 different colors, not 96. A few of the colors work well and I do love using them. Mostly though I let my 10 year old daughter play with it with her friends. For that reason, it is an excellent palette. However, if you wish to have some great metallic colors for yourself, this probably isn&#x27;t the best palette for the job (though if you&#x27;re just learning to use eye shadows then this is a good starter palette as well). Shipping didn&#x27;t cause any damage with the product, not a single broken shadow. 3 stars because it&#x27;s fun and colorful and I get enjoyment out of it. It would have been 5 if the colors had all been different and if they were actually metallic.</li>
    <li> Great colours. Good texture for spreading evenly. I was looking for a little more glitter but this also good for daytime wear.</li>
    <li> Love this pallet. Very long lasting makeup. Goes on smooth. Shipped fast and received fast. One circle of color was broken upon arrival but i just crushed it more and made it a mineral like texture. still love it!</li>
    <li> AMAZON EMPLOYEE(S) obviously  incapable of preparing a fragile item for shipment not only was the eyeshadow broken the mirror was shattered and I really appreciate the cut on my hand! Good job guys.. you should be awarded for lack of common sense no padding,no bubble-wrap and Styrofoam popcorn  protection for eyeshadow..thrown in box with 2 boxes of bar soap ...(and no concern for customers health and safety.. can anyone say lawsuit waiting to happen resulting from AMAZONS CARELESS SERVICE )that has a case with GLASS MIRROR directly above eyeshadow....when I send it back someone should be made to apply the GLASS-SHADOW to the lids on both THEIR EYES...who is  dumber than the employee(s) that prepared the order just so you know it reflects badly on you AMAZON as you hire and pay inept employees, problems in house...not with the seller .....maybe AMAZON just don&#x27;t care how it reflects on the seller  but really HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH YOUR SERVICE ..buyer beware unless you are actually going for bloody-eye trend instead of metallic-eye or smokey-eye look!</li>
    <li> When I received this product all the make up was broken up and falling out. I called them and tried to get another one to replace it and I was told that it hadn&#x27;t looked like that when they shipped it. I was furious, because they didn&#x27;t pack it well enough to make the trip to my house in one piece.</li>
    <li> this is one of my favorite palette i own.  i love everything about it.  the colors, the easy to store case and the pigments are beautiful and long lasting   love shany cosmetics and the best part is that they are cruelty free :)</li>
    <li> I was a little too happy at first. Once I got, some of the eyeshadows were destroyed. I literally had to clean out half of the palette. Don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s to blame, if UPS or Shany. But I do have to add, that the shadows that were untouched, are amazing. All the golds and blues are beautiful. I have gotten a lot of good compliments out in the street.</li>
    <li> If you decide to order this, know that if your product arrives in tact, you will LOVE it. Shany makes some good eyeshadows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in my case, it was a super bummer that 14 colors in this palette arrived completely demolished!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s surprising, because I felt the packaging was really good. (I ordered several items that came together in a large Amazon box. Inside the large Amazon box, any extra room was taken up by bubble wrap or large inflatable plastic wrap. This specific product had its own Shany product box, obviously. The outside of the box was covered with its own pocket of bubble wrap. Then, on the inside, the case was wrapped in more bubble wrap! Somehow, this wasn&#x27;t enough, as 14 of the &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; were just absolutely demolished and got powder EVERYWHERE on the inside. It&#x27;s not just the &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; on the top, either. Some of the ones in the secondary layer were wrecked.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to contact customer service, and they explained that the product&#x27;s ordering is fulfilled by Amazon, but it&#x27;s ultimately from a 3rd party. That 3rd party ships the product to Amazon, and then Amazon ships the product out to its customers. So somewhere in that whole process, the eye shadow got dropped, or blew up, or something.  It&#x27;s not just that the eyeshadows were cracked, or a little chipped.  They were completely demolished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to reach a resolution with Amazon, but it&#x27;s a bummer because I can tell these colors would have been fantastic, but I am hesitant to order again, as it was very disappointing to not be able to use the product, and in addition, what a mess to clean up! Shimmery powder EVERYWHERE. It&#x27;s not just that 14 pots broke, and oh well, you just can&#x27;t use those 14 colors, but you have 82 left. The powder gets EVERYWHERE, all over every color remaining within the palette, and when you open the palette up, the powder goes EVERYWHERE and gets all over your fingers. The eye shadow, because it&#x27;s not a matte, has a bit of oiliness to it (not a bad thing, that&#x27;s just the texture of the powder), so it really sticks to wherever it makes contact. So getting the dust off of the in-tact &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; is NOT an easy thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been my ONLY problem with a Shany product, and I have ordered a BUNCH of them (no, seriously, if it&#x27;s a Shany eyeshadow, I probably own it), and I should mention that this has also been my only Shany product fulfilled by a 3rd party. I don&#x27;t know how to suggest to  prevent this from happening again to other customers, since, as I previously mentioned, the packaging was definitely satisfactory and quality packaging and packing.</li>
    <li> I really like this set, the pigments are strong, and I have dark brown skin (caramel mocha to be exact) and the colors show up pretty strong, and last pretty much all day, of course with minimal sweating. Great price for the product, the one downfall is that there are duplicate colors, so it&#x27;s not really 96 more like 86. If you&#x27;re like me and run out of your favorite shades quick, the duplicates wont be a big deal.</li>
    <li> the metallic shades in this kit are gorgeous i&#x27;m excited for all the pretty looks to be made! and the kit definitely gives off a professional vibe</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a neutral color kinda girl, but I love adding a little sparkle and \\&quot;umph\\&quot; to my night out look. With all these metallic shades its super easy to get a great night out look :)</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful set. This is ideal for nights out when you want something fun and shimmery, without all the glitter. Very pigmented and very blendable.</li>
    <li> Very good packaging! I really like how this palette is able to slide! Saves a lot of space! With 96 different shades, I can create many looks! Perfect for a gift! This is the eye shadow palette you will ever need! :) Plus, it is affordable!</li>
    <li> All I can say is, \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;. These colors are fantastic. I love the little shimmer they have to them, making them great for a really glammed up look.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Shanny cosmetics eye palettes but I think I love this one the most because all the colors are so vibrant and bright</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;this was an organized way to put in all the colors&lt;br /&gt;it was a great casual way to do so&lt;br /&gt;96 colors are a lot!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in the shipping of the product. It was all broken and some of the shadows were not even useable. Two of the shadows were fine and care was taken when packed.I am not sure why only one the Shany eyeshadow Palette Ultra Shimmer Studio Colors for Smokey Eyes# B003VSBY94.</li>
    <li> I have this and I really like it! the colors are great and it stayed on for most of the day, even without a lid primer!</li>
    <li> I love how this kit is so small and can be fit in a purse or carry on bag for traveling. The price is just right for this product!</li>
    <li> Unable to use...had to return due to item was broken upon arrival and I got my money back.  I am sorry...</li>
    <li> this item came at a decent time...but it was damaged when I received it. about 5 or 10 of the colors were broken up beyond use. a bit upsetting to not be able to use some of the colors. but its been a good product.</li>
    <li> These shadows is very beautiful and wonderful and beautiful colors seem obvious in use&lt;br /&gt;But some colors do not look so good</li>
    <li> There are many colors to choose from, and I like that, but several of the colors were broken upon arival, and spread into the other colors, which has caused quite the mess. I still like them and use them, but I am disappointed that so many of the colors are unusable.</li>
    <li> when I opened the package I was sadly disappointed because 6 of the eyeshadows were crumbled and crushed to a chunky powder.... One good thing though, these eyeshadows do go on softly, the pigments are very good and they stay very very well.... if the package didn&#x27;t come damaged, I would have given this product a 5 star rating... :(</li>
    <li> I was so excited until I opened it and there were a lot of broken colors. buy at your own risk.</li>
    <li> About 4 colors were smashed, but not completely obliterated.  I did also have to take a wet wipe to it because of the smashed colors, and one of the trays wasn&#x27;t set on the track properly but after 10 minutes of fiddling around, I managed to get it back on.  However the colors are VERY pigmented.  I personally was expecting something of a &amp;#34;barbie makeup artist&amp;#34; quality where you&#x27;re not even on the 2nd coat and it won&#x27;t show.</li>
    <li> Almost all of the colors look the same. Not that it matters, because half of them were broken when they arrived anyway. Horrible packaging. The METALLIC description is what I bought this for. That&#x27;s a total lie. There is a pearly sheen over each of the colors, but after using them once, there is no more sheen (or metallic-ness, for lack of a better word). It is just dull colors underneath. Absolute horrible purchase. Colors represented in picture are not truly comparative to what you actually get. Also, product is much smaller than it appears. Each of those circles of color are maybe the size of a dime. Yeah. Never again.</li>
    <li> When my make-up kit came in, i was very pleased after reading the other reviews about it, i can honsetly say that i cant complain. It came in before the actual arrival date. It wasnt hard to open at all(gotta be use to opening make-up kits). And not 1 of my colors was broken or messed up. I even enjoyed wearing the different colors with all my outfits. If i can just find anything bad to say about it was the fact that it only has 4 brushes for 96 different colors, but other then that it was great!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase any brand of makeup I&#x27;d never heard of before but I read so many great reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The shany cosmetics have good pigments that stand out and I received my makeup perfectly with no broken pallets or parts. That wad my main concern if I was gonna get my makeup all in one piece but I did. It&#x27;s good to read the reviews for the sender or seller so u can decide if they  have good ratings for delivering products.</li>
    <li> I have this eye shadow kit and i love it! so many shadows to choose from! I love the metallic shimmer that are on the colors!! I love the case its in! so pretty!</li>
    <li> I received my palette and the colors are wonderful. The eye shadows have great pigmentation. They&#x27;re super vibrant. They have specs of glitter in it. Some people might want to try to avoid wearing these eye shadows, when taking professional photographs, because of the glitter in them; that depends on your preference.</li>
    <li> Love the colors in this collection.  The metalics really work well with my skin tones.  Especially in the summer months.  These colors are highly pigmented and last very well. I use brushes to apply my makeup and the colors spead very easily, evenly, and stay in place for a long time.  Which means less touching up.  All women can appreciate a makeup that cuts down on time touching up, especially if you are in the work place.  The working woman knows how a day can suddenly go from good to long in a second.  At least makeup isn&#x27;t a major worry if higher ups are around. This definately a good buy.  Linda W.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it came with several pans of the shadow broken and spilled throughout the box.  I returned it and gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it again.  The second box came today, and again it had pans broken and spilled throughout the box.  I am sending it back and I doubt I will try to order it again.  Very disappointed.  The colors all looked amazing.  This product really let me down.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PALETTE!! VERY VIBRANT AND PIGMENTED EYESHADOWS!! DUHHH ALL SHANY EYESHADOWS ARE VIBRANT AND PIGMENTED!! THIS SET IS PERFECT FOR TRAVEL AND I WOULD RECOMMEND 100%</li>
    <li> so good for the shimmery eyeshadow lover. the individual colors look beautiful as an all over lid color for those lazy mornings an the lighter shades do amazingly at highlighting and brightening the eye area.</li>
    <li> I love this because there are so many choices and sometimes I take forever to choose and it&#x27;s great quality you will love it</li>
    <li> I love most of your products.  These are a great addition to any kit or collection.  As a make up artist, you can never have too many eye shadows.  These add just the right pop to a matte eye shadow!</li>
    <li> I  bought this product because the company boast the product is 90% natural. I guess the other 10% include Talc and Parabens. Those are not good for you. I only bought this because I thought it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t contained Parabens and Talc. Apparently I was wrong. I am going to return this</li>
    <li> these metallic shaddows are another makeup lovers must have. Great pigmentation and beautiful shaddows. :-) :-) :-) i reccomend this product to every makeup lover.</li>
    <li> I have purchased eye shadow palettes similar to this one in the past by Coastal Scents and Profusion. Those are both great and the same price as this one, the eye shadows are also similar.  This palette arrived promptly but once I opened it I found several of the eye shadows broken. Pearl eye shadow everywhere, very messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but I only gave it three stars because of how it arrived. Overall okay, but I would not buy again, I would go with Coastal Scents or Profusion over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Variety of colors, compact size-great for travel. Nice applicators. Mirror. Cons, pretty cheap eye shadow and case, delicate-they break apart easily.</li>
    <li> The shipping was not .. the eyeshadow stays on all day. That is nice in todays busy world. I don&#x27;t have time to touch up my makeup nor do I want too. I want it to stay. The eyeshadows do just that. But when I opened the box upon arrival, quite a few were broke. That isn&#x27;t what I wanted or expected to see. Especially when the colors that broke were 3 of the ones I really like. You win some you lose some.</li>
    <li> This product came so fast when I ordered it! I love it so much its so neat how it opens up and the colors are so perfect! My favorite part is how the pink and grey sit right next to each other! Easier access!</li>
    <li> Product was much more shimmery/metallic than I had anticipated.  One of the colors had shattered during shipping.  I am sure I could return it with no problem but felt it was more work than necessary. Other than that, the colors are good and saturate well enough.</li>
    <li> this was a lot of fun it took me a few minutes to figure out how to open it all and when i did i was in awe, such pretty colors and they go on nicely</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for my granddaughter.  When I opened it, some of the colors were broken and powder was everywhere.  I cleaned it up best I could and my granddaughter (13) appeared happy with it.</li>
    <li> I MUST SAY THERE WAS SO MUCH ANTICIPATION FOR MY EYESHADOW. i THOUGHT IT BE BIGGER BUT THAT&#x27;S OK BECAUSE IT MAKES IT EASIER TO TRAVEL WITH AND IT HAS VERY PRETTY COLORS.</li>
    <li> i love this kit! it look alike i was wearing 100 dollar makeup but really it was only $17! these colors are super pigmented and they apply so well i couldn&#x27;t have gone wrong with this product and wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!</li>
    <li> i love these long lasting bright colors! usualy when i put on eye shadow, i would need to carry some with me because they fade away, but these are just perfect all day long!</li>
    <li> I was very upset when I got the package and they had 2 colors broken. I bought them as a Christmas gift for my best friend but they did not make it :( The colors are very nice tho but hope that they arrive not broken</li>
    <li> I purchased this product fully aware that based on the reviews it could potentially come with many broken colors. I ordered it and took my chances anyway. Sure enough, many of the colors were broken despite the bubble wrap protection; my guess too is that they&#x27;d been broken for a while and sitting on a shelf. They really need to figure out a new way to protect this product because I&#x27;m not too happy about paying full price for a broken item.</li>
    <li> Eyeshadow greatness...this metallic kit is just beautiful and thrilling...I love these colors!  I will reccommend this product because it is of excellent quality! :-)</li>
    <li> This is the most beautiful palatte of colors. Packaging was great &amp; it arrived early. I&#x27;m so happy I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> Makeup arrived in one piece and in perfect condition, always love my shany makeup. Colors are vibrant and wear well.</li>
    <li> This palette is awesome for shimmery bright looks! This isn&#x27;t for matte lovers! These colors really make your eyes sparkle and great color pay off.</li>
    <li> These eyeshaddows are really good quality for what your paying! I use them all the time, theres lots of shimmer shaddows which are perfect for nights out :)</li>
    <li> I had to send this back.  When I received it, it was not packaged well enough to take an impact from the packaging company (no amazon).  It looked like it had been dropped before Amazon packaged it and about half of the color pods were broken.  Some to the point that it was just powder inside the case.  To bad.  It looked like it would be fun to use.</li>
