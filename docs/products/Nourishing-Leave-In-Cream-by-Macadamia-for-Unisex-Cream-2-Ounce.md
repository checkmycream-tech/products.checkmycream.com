      <li>The only issue with this is that I wish it would do a bit more for frizziness in my hair.</li>

<li> It certainly does not dry it out like one of the other top oils does to me, and a few other people who have said they had that in common as well</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the real deal and for half the price!</li>
<li> Very light-only use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I only put on the length of my hair and not near my scalp.  </li>
<li> I had recently dyed my hair and it was sort of dry.</li>
<li> This product somehow managed to leave my hair greasy and dry all at the same time.  </li>
<li> and you let your hair air dry over night then in the morning style.</li>
<li> I pair it with the macadamia healing oil and put it before I dry my hair.</li>
<li> When my hair is dry, my ends will dry and split and my hair looks frizzy, but this product keeps the moisture in my hair.  </li>
<li> It protects my hair when I use the flat iron and other heat</li>
<li> I  over bleached my hair, it was very  dry and  brittle</li>
<li> This little bottle will last me a while</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not really a leave in conditioner or a smoothing cream but a combination of the two.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> I straighten my hair every other day and it was fried.</li>
<li> so the cream tended to weigh it down</li>
<li> so this holds it down and bye bye split ends</li>
<li> I try hard to use things that have as few ingredients as possible and I was a bit off</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s also not something I want to smell everyday</li>
<li> Upon touch my hair felt like an oil slick but the ends felt like hay</li>
<li> def told all my friends addicted to the hair straightner and the wand to use this everytime before the use of heat , works in 2 ways holding your hair down</li>
<li> We all have really thick hair.  </li>
<li> This leave in cream is seriously nourishing for my hair.</li>
<li> After wearing a sew in for a year, my hair grow but was damage my hair was lifeless and in bad shape, after using this product the life of my hair is back.</li>
<li> My hair is thin</li>

    <li> This product Is amazing and my hair loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order one in a bigger size and def keep stock of this cream and the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This leave in cream is seriously nourishing for my hair. I use it straight after the shower and when it sets in, my hair is incredibly soft.</li>
    <li> I really liked this at first, but the more i use it the more i feel like it leaves a sticky residue</li>
    <li> It does help smooth my hair and control flyaways but the smell is overbearing. It&#x27;s not gross but it&#x27;s also not something I want to smell everyday</li>
    <li> I ordered the oil and the mask alongside this product.  It is a nice quality product and would be ideal for people with thick, dry hair.  My hair is thin so the cream tended to weigh it down, however I still used it because it was so moisturizing.  I prefer the oil (and the mask is great, if anyone is wondering) but I would use this again.  It smells a lot sweeter and fruitier than the oil which I don&#x27;t like.  I prefer the musky scent of the oil.</li>
    <li> I have used Macadamia leave-in cream on my dry color treated and relaxed hair before styling and it assist with leaving my hair soft.  When my hair is dry, my ends will dry and split and my hair looks frizzy, but this product keeps the moisture in my hair.  It protects my hair when I use the flat iron and other heat and it keeps my hair from drying out. For the price, it is very comparable to Moroccanoil Hydrating Cream which is 4 times the price of Macadamia.    If you want soft, un-frizzy, and shinny hair without paying a lot of money, this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; smells good too</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brand! It makes my hair sooooo silky smooth! I first discovered this brand because my mother in law was getting rid of some products she didn&#x27;t like. Luckily she didn&#x27;t hang on to the deep conditioning macadamia cream because when I tried it out I was HOOKED! From there I bought the shampoo and conditioner and then this leave in conditioner. It works amazingly well for me and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I would give 10 stars. After wearing a sew in for a year, my hair grow but was damage my hair was lifeless and in bad shape, after using this product the life of my hair is back. I now use this entire product line.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal and for half the price! Love the way this makes my hair feel ...so soft and healthy. Love love love it!</li>
    <li> i love the smell of all the macadamia oil products. so clean, serene, and spa feeling smells. it is a bit pricey, but def worth it. my hair feels so much softer now.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use this product on myself and my family. We all have really thick hair.  I really like the manageability it creates with our hair and the softness. It smells really good too!</li>
    <li> This product somehow managed to leave my hair greasy and dry all at the same time.  Upon touch my hair felt like an oil slick but the ends felt like hay and it smelled like grape flavored medication.  Definitely dissapointed.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Very light-only use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair, leaves it soft but not weighed down.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it keeps my hair in shape and its a styling creme. I try hard to use things that have as few ingredients as possible and I was a bit off put by the mount of ingredients but the results were still wonderful and my hair hasn&#x27;t suffered so far (2 months in). It works well when you are heat styling and you let your hair air dry over night then in the morning style. The style lasts all day and longer.</li>
    <li> I am an African american. This product is AMAZING on two strand twists along with the macadamian oil treatment. Conditions and moisturizes hair for days. Gives my hair a nice slinky feel and great shine.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the leave in cream make my hair feel heavy and sticky other wise its a great product...</li>
    <li> * This leave-in treatment worked well for my normal/dry, med-thick, med-length hair, I liked how my hair looked hydrated  * I only put on the length of my hair and not near my scalp.  * A great find for the price.  You can also by the oil and add to any conditioner or shampoo of your choice.</li>
    <li> I really REALLY enjoy this product. I had recently dyed my hair and it was sort of dry. I bought this product and on the first try it literally made my hair and ends softer and smoothe. I am really pleased with this leave - in cream. I would buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this product so of course I wanted to try it. First off, when I went to squeeze the bottle it exploded all over my mirror from the bottom. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Personally, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair. No point in using it again. If it works for you, that&#x27;s awesome, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> My family decided to invest in Macademia hair products. My hair was falling from the roots, I can&#x27;t say it has helped to stop my hair from falling, but the texture feels good, and it has a pleasant smell.. I would not discourage any one from buying, but for me, I can&#x27;t afford it. This is a rather expensive line.</li>
    <li> I seen this on a youtube video about hair and instantly looked to amazon for it. The price is perfect and this product realy saved my hair! I straighten my hair every other day and it was fried. I tried a lot of leave ins and sprays but nothing really worked. This little bottle will last me a while and I am absolutely in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> love it!! def told all my friends addicted to the hair straightner and the wand to use this everytime before the use of heat , works in 2 ways holding your hair down i tend to have a little frizz on the top so this holds it down and bye bye split ends</li>
    <li> For me.....I didn&#x27;t think it did much for my dry hair, will have to keep looking...the word &#x27;nourishing&#x27; is what caught my eye to purchase.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! I pair it with the macadamia healing oil and put it before I dry my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner! It helps to soften and detangle my hair nicely. It also smells really fresh and nice. Kind of like banana. I love all of Macadamia Natural Oil products! Very nourishing and moisturizing leave in cream. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> it is good leave in cream but very exp compared to the size&lt;br /&gt;yet it is nice using it with the oil</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!! I got a tiny bottle of the oil as a gift, and likes how it worked and smells yummy!!! So tried this leave in and I think it is the better of all the oils you could moisturize your hair with. It certainly does not dry it out like one of the other top oils does to me, and a few other people who have said they had that in common as well......so this is 5 stars in my book.</li>
    <li> I really love the smell and my husband does too. If there was a perfume of this smell I would totally buy it. I also use the shampoo and deep conditioner then this and it works really great. I&#x27;m thinking of buying the oil after this is done. Would definitly purchase again.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Its fabulous for my dry hair. it keeps it soft and beautiful. If you love soft shiny hair try it!</li>
    <li> Too start off, the smell is amazing. I  over bleached my hair, it was very  dry and  brittle, i became  pretty depressed about it so  i did  some research and  i found  macadamia nut oil  products so i thought i would give it  a try, i couldn&#x27;t  afford  the masque so i bought this and it  really  helped me. i recommend this to every one it  saved my hair</li>
    <li> It smoothes my hair and makes it soft and supple.  It&#x27;s not really a leave in conditioner or a smoothing cream but a combination of the two.  So you can use it instead of two different products!</li>
    <li> I use this product on my damp hair evey time I wash it and it really makes a difference. It makes my hair look healthier and shinny.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product, and how it makes my hair feel after I put it in. I have fine to normal hair, and this doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all. I&#x27;m overall satisfied with my purchase, and I just bought the larger size of this product. The only issue with this is that I wish it would do a bit more for frizziness in my hair.</li>
