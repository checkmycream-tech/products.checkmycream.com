      <li>However, it also happens to be a very good product.</li>
      <li>Orgasm is an incredibly wearable peach/gold shimmer and is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!  </li>
      <li>Orgasm is the perfect \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shade that looks good on everyone.  </li>

      <li>It looked great on her (close-up shot)</li>
      <li>Very very pretty!!!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this blush!!</li>
      <li>finish was very nice.  </li>
      <li>I have fair skin, and this color is great for me.</li>
      <li>Like many people, I heard that NARS Orgasm was the Best.</li>
      <li>the shimmer is the best quality and looks sophisticated and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been told darker skin tones can&#x27;t wear bright blushes, which I find untrue.  </li>
      <li>so I checked it out in the store and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Mata Hari, Desire, and Angelika will look gorgeous on you.</li>
      <li>do your self a favor and use GOOD tools to apply it.</li>
      <li>I am fair skined.</li>
      <li>Both are absolutely gorgeous.</li>
      <li>No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so impressed that I would purchase this blush in another color, although I&#x27;m not disappointed in the investment.</li>
      <li>With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin and light reddish hair</li>
      <li>This add a nice pop of colour to the cheeks, great for those who like a bit more colour.</li>
      <li>I love many of the products in (Francois) Nars line and these gorgeous blushes are no exception!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>MY FAVORITE!</li>
      <li>This tried and true blush is still my favorite out of perhaps the thousands I have tested and still the best in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I wanted to stray away from rose and baked colors, for more daring looks like bright peaches and summer pinks.</li>
      <li>Everything I read said that Nars Orgasm was the best blush ever, in the whole world and on and on...</li>
      <li>The compact is nice looking</li>
      <li>I am \\&quot;white\\&quot; but I have a warm yellow-toned almost \\&quot;Asian\\&quot; skintone and I have come to find that \\&quot;Mata Hari\\&quot;</li>
      <li>it and to be honest</li>
      <li>and ive found a ball of cotton works really well for applying and blending the perfect</li>
      <li>I LIKED</li>
      <li>Crazed can be used by anyone of any skintone, as well as Deep Throat and Gilda, and Lovejoy is a beautiful bronzer for a a very fair caucasian woman or a natural-looking blush for a darker skinned woman.</li>
      <li>Ok, so its nice.</li>
      <li>Though since it is a warm tint it is better suited for summer.</li>
      <li>This is definately the best blush I have tried so far, and I would definately purchase it again.</li>
      <li>After removing some, I got the wonderful, natural, blush look</li>
      <li>It gives a great golden sparkle, NOT clown-like,</li>
      <li>Deep Throat, Orgasm, Glida will suit you best because they are not too overwhelming  If you are FAIR SKINNED with PINKish hue/undertone:    </li>
      <li>I wear it every day and it looks amazing on my super fair skin.</li>
      <li>I am a very fair Caucasian woman, and find that most cheek colors are too intense for my skin.</li>
      <li>Reds will look fine on you!</li>
      <li>if you travel make sure you pack an applicator for this.  </li>
      <li>I also like \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; during the summer when I&#x27;m a bit more tan.  </li>
      <li>I truly love this blush...</li>
      <li>top three favorite shades..</li>
      <li>I love these two colors.</li>
      <li>I think I like the YSL products a lot more than Nars.</li>
      <li>They are sure to be a knockout.</li>
      <li>also pleased with this product.  </li>
      <li>Speaking of shimmer, Albatross is also a favorite color.  </li>
      <li>Ok.....</li>
      <li>(YSL products also smell better than Nars products)</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator because I love to apply with a MAC foundation brushes.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a excellent quality product such as this-</li>
      <li>5 stars because I have yet to find a better product.d a better product.</li>
      <li>I tried Nars blush in &#x27;Orgasm&#x27; and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have olive skin and during the summer I am darker than the winter..:)</li>
      <li>I love the rubberized compact, and that they don&#x27;t bother with a brush</li>
      <li>I love the texture, and I prefer the shimmery ones.  </li>
      <li>Like many people, \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; is my favorite</li>
      <li>that most women would think \\&quot;Bozo the Clown\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>/&gt;ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I&#x27;m an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really wear makeup, but I found \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; to be very nice.  </li>
      <li>Darker medium (with any skin tone) goes best with bronzed or flat colors (like brown-red, Zen, Douceur)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easily blendable, and the Orgasm shade gives my extremely fair skin a very pretty flush.</li>
      <li>I own deep throat and its a beautiful pinkish peach color.</li>
      <li>The first color I bought was Taos and when I opened it it was this bright rosy rust color.</li>
      <li>It is Richly Pigmented, Creamy, Blendable!</li>
      <li>Overall I have a great experience, I dont like the fact I have to buy a separate brush, esp when travelling, it would be nice to have a brush included in this packaging</li>
      <li>Deep skin tones goes best with light bronzy or red/purplish colors  </li>
      <li>Until they create a new type of blush that can honestly withstand 8 hours, Nars is still my favorite blush!  </li>
      <li>Avoid bright, intense reds.</li>
      <li>For more cool toned skin I would recommend \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; (a more hot-pink color).</li>
      <li>I bought my first NARS blush in Orgasm a year ago, I wear it every day and love it!  </li>
      <li>These are so exquisitely milled and pigmented that it&#x27;s not irritating to my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This color in the container looks like a natural honey shimmer and it gives the most gorgeous sun touched glow, almost like a bronzer.</li>
      <li>as much more intense- amazing pigment means apply with a LIGHT touch:</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought 2 of these: Orgasm and Torrid and after hours of researching swatches I came to the conclusion that there&#x27;s a way to maximize the experience with these blushes.  Rule of Thumb:  Fair skin (any skin tone) goes best with peach/pink colors  Medium skin especially those with yellow undertones goes best with light red/coral red  Darker medium (with any skin tone) goes best with bronzed or flat colors (like brown-red, Zen, Douceur)  Deep skin tones goes best with light bronzy or red/purplish colors  If you are VERY fair skinned with little to no hint of any pinkish color:    Pick a light pink color. Deep Throat, Orgasm, Glida will suit you best because they are not too overwhelming  If you are FAIR SKINNED with PINKish hue/undertone:    You can pick lightpink- darker pink colors. Torrid, Orgasm, Glida, Deep throat. You can also wear slightly bronzy colors such as Madly and Sin for a more sun-kissed look.  If you are FAIR with YELLOW undertone. (Asian women with very light skin)    You can wear colors such as Orgasm, Sin, Madly, Torrid. AVOID very intense colors such as Mata Hari (which is almost purple), Dolce Vita, or anything that is not LIGHT reddish or pinkish. Having fair skin allows you to wear light pink colors, but yellow undertones go best with reddish colors.   If you have Medium skin with Yellow undertone (Asian women with medium skin. Not tanned but not light)    Torrid will look great on you! Avoid bright, intense reds. Coral reds and slightly bronzy colors such as Armour and Zen will suit you. Avoid Taos, which is too intense.  If you have TANNED skin with yellow undertone (Southern Asian women)    You can wear almost any color! Reds will look fine on you! Avoid lighter pinks for a more natural look. Taos, in this case, is perfect for your skin tone. You can also wear Torrid, Madly,Deucer and any darker reds/pinks/bronzy colors. Just avoid purple or hot pink colors unless you have darker skin.  If you have DARK skin with any undertone     I&#x27;m jealous! You can wear the fun colors such as Gina and Exhibit A. I highly recommend Gina for women of dark skin because reds and golds look SO beautiful on them. Wear colors that \\&quot;pop\\&quot;, avoid colors like Zen or Sin because you want a color that contrasts while complimenting your skin tone. Mata Hari, Desire, and Angelika will look gorgeous on you.</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE! A Fabulous cream blush: I love this in \\&quot;TURKISH RED CREME\\&quot;!-- A little goes a long way with a shade of this depth, allowing you to customize your own color to suit: Add a touch more for evening time, a touch less for daytime wear! It is Richly Pigmented, Creamy, Blendable!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years.  I saw a photo in a magazine of Julia Roberts and they talked about her makeup and said she was wearing Nars powder blush in a shade called \\&quot;Orgasm.\\&quot;  It looked great on her (close-up shot) so I checked it out in the store and loved it.  I bought it and have been wearing it ever since.  It is light in texture in terms of how it feels but it is also light in how it looks, light and natural.  When I wear this I always get compliments on my skin -- like the color is natural and coming from me. (And I don&#x27;t tell them otherwise!)  But for a product this light feeling it seems to stay on really well.</li>
    <li> This tried and true blush is still my favorite out of perhaps the thousands I have tested and still the best in my opinion. The soft, texture makes it easy to apply and with this blush, there is no need to worry about your cheeks looking like you just got ready for a junior high prom..the shimmer is the best quality and looks sophisticated and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;My top three favorite shades..&lt;br /&gt;Deep Throat&lt;br /&gt;Orgasm..(Orgasm blended with Mata Hari is GORGEOUS!)&lt;br /&gt;Sin</li>
    <li> I would recommend avoiding the shades with glitter! I used to use Orgasm before I used it on my sister&#x27;s cheeks for prom and all that glitter looked ridiculous!! I threw it away that very day. I am \\&quot;white\\&quot; but I have a warm yellow-toned almost \\&quot;Asian\\&quot; skintone and I have come to find that \\&quot;Mata Hari\\&quot; is the color my cheeks blush naturally. I think people with warm toned skin would normally pass a color like this up because it looks almost purple/pink in the pan. However, with the right application it looks really natural on. And by right application I mean very very little product b/c this blush is one of the most pigmented formulas I have ever encountered. It will last you a very long time!! For more cool toned skin I would recommend \\&quot;Desire\\&quot; (a more hot-pink color). Or, \\&quot;Amour\\&quot; if you are looking for more of a warm peachy pink cheek color. There are others, but those are the ones I know of without glitter.</li>
    <li> A lot of say that NARS blush, especially the Orgasm shade, sells like hotcakes just because of the name, and that&#x27;s probably true. However, it also happens to be a very good product. The blush is a very fine powder and goes on well with a large brush. It&#x27;s easily blendable, and the Orgasm shade gives my extremely fair skin a very pretty flush. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> First time I purchased NARS and I am exceedingly pleased. Selecting your particular shade is the most difficult.  I purchased Mata Hari (pink yet suttle).  I also purchased the Lip Gloss in &#x27;chihuahau&#x27; also pleased with this product.  Only complaint is NO BRUSH and the products are extremely expensive for my blood.</li>
    <li> After reading all the rave reviews, how great the color is etc. I went out to but it and to be honest i hate the color. While the peachy-ish color is nice but nothing special what I hate is the color of the shimmer. It&#x27;s like a weird goldish color. I regret buying this</li>
    <li> I bought this blush after reading about it in a magazine.  The color I use is orgasm.  It gives a natural glow to my fair skin and wears fabulously.  I can go from day to night and usually don&#x27;t need a touch up.</li>
    <li> I reinvented my makeup looks recently. I disposed products I wasn&#x27;t happy with and products with pigments I am ready to retire. I wanted to stray away from rose and baked colors, for more daring looks like bright peaches and summer pinks.I bought the NARS orgasm blush because of all the hype. You would think it was liquid gold in a compact.   I am nineteen years old. I have rich tan skin that is combination. My forehead, and chin is acne-free. My cheeks tend to break out.I&#x27;ve always been told darker skin tones can&#x27;t wear bright blushes, which I find untrue.  I LIKED HOW NARS ORGASM LOOKS ON ME.  It is a bright peachish pink with flecks of gold.  Good points and Bad Points....    1. The packgaging is sleek and compact. It doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator. I like it doesn&#x27;t come with an applicator because I love to apply with a MAC foundation brushes.  2. The color is buildable. A big kabuki brush works wonders for subtle color, but you could also get your cheeks almost doll-like.  3. It lasts long, it lasts long on your face, it lasts long in the compact, money lasts long in your wallet.    Bad Points  1. the flecks of gold seemed to irritate me and break out my skin  2. I prefer the big tin of Cargo blushes, because it gets less messy</li>
    <li> I discovered NARS and its vibrant colour line about three years ago, and the brand has been one of my favorites ever since.  I love vibrant, colorful make-up that makes a statement.  When I saw \\&quot;Exhibit A\\&quot; at my local Sephora, I could only reach out to buy it immediately, both in its blush and lipstick forms.  This vibrant tomato red with a mix of deep orange has to be the hottest summer shade available.  Think of hot summer days, with the bluest of skies and the sun shinning high in the sky until it is time for the most idyllic sunset when you are trying to get in the mood to wear this colour.  Because the shade is so intense, a little goes a long way.  You will need only a minimal amount of \\&quot;Exhibit A\\&quot; to spark up your cheeks with a vibrant rouge that will let everyone know you are a woman who enjoys your life, and looks happy and radiant in her own skin.  Be sure to take your \\&quot;Exhibit A\\&quot; blush and lipstick on your next beach vacation!  They are sure to be a knockout.</li>
    <li> As a makeup lover, I have to say this is the highlight of NARS&#x27; entire line. The blushes come in a range of flattering shades for every skin type. To find makeup that is universally flattering for almost every person in the world is hard to do. As an african american female (NC 45), I have been able to find at least 5 shades that are perfect.     Taj Mahal: I believe that this is a must have for women of color. Its a brighter golden orange and looks scary in the pan. All you would need is a small bit on the cheeks and it instantly warms up the skin.     Exhibit A: Another scary color in the pan but looks great on skin. It is a matte red and again, all you need is a touch.     Torrid: To me this is the blush that is Orgasm for women of color. Orgasm on darker skin looks like a pinkish highlighter and doesn&#x27;t deposit much color on the face. Torrid is a darker (darker than Orgasm) peachy pink color that I use to give my face a nice flush.     Mounia: A darker plum color with shimmer, looks great on the darkest of girls, a great option for sultry or glamourous looks.     Taos: A darker dusty rose color with some gold. This blush is a nice option for days I want to try something different.     Albatross: Not a blush but a highlighter, it goes on the tops of your cheekbones to define and highlight that area. Looks white in pan but goes on the skin like a gold shade, creates a candlelit glow to the face.    I would definitely say to try out at least one NARS&#x27; blush as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll likely find one that you love. They are extremely pigmented, which is why you only need the tinest amount, and long lasting. To me they&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I purchased this blush in Orgasm...just like everyone else on the planet. It is a really great color, and I use it everyday...it&#x27;s great with my ultra-pale skin &amp; dark hair. While it is nice, and will last apparantly until the end of time, I don&#x27;t think it has lived up to all the hype-- the price is a little steep for a starving college student. I&#x27;m not so impressed that I would purchase this blush in another color, although I&#x27;m not disappointed in the investment.</li>
    <li> I am a very fair caucasian (northern european, actually) and I bought this blush in Taos. This add a nice pop of colour to the cheeks, great for those who like a bit more colour. This mimic perfectly a post work out glow. Though since it is a warm tint it is better suited for summer.</li>
    <li> After trying NARS blush over 4 years ago, I will never go back to any other blush!  This blush is so high quality, and really turns out beautifully on all complexions.  There are so many different color choices.  I myself have probably 4 or 5 different shades, for a base color, to a pop color, and summer shades, and just highlighters.  Although these may be a bit pricier, they last for a long time, and are resistant to cracking and crumbling.  I&#x27;ve dropped mine several times and it has been fine.      Strongly recommend this product to everyone, and all other NARS products!</li>
    <li> I love many of the products in (Francois) Nars line and these gorgeous blushes are no exception!  Orgasm is an incredibly wearable peach/gold shimmer and is beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!  Sin is another shimmer color only it is a plum/dark pink color and is equally stunning.  I have had a lot of experience with cosmetics, makeup artists, modeling and fashion---this one is a winner! You&#x27;ll want one of every color.  (and the black rubberized, mirrored snap case is ultra hip!)</li>
    <li> Ok.....I&#x27;m jumping on the band wagon. This stuff is awesome!! The first color I bought was Taos and when I opened it it was this bright rosy rust color. I thought it was going to make me look like a clown. Wrong!!! It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter which color you buy, they all look soooo natural. I just lightly tap my brush on the color and blend onto my cheekbones. Gives the prettiest flushed look. I just recently purchased Silvana and I can&#x27;t say enough. This color in the container looks like a natural honey shimmer and it gives the most gorgeous sun touched glow, almost like a bronzer. Very very pretty!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really wear makeup, but I found \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; to be very nice.  I have fair skin, so it worked well for me, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem like a color that all skin tones can wear. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The finish was very nice.  Almost a velvety feeling.  I did not notice the shimmer that other people were talking about, but I apply blush very sparingly, so that might be the reason. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I think that the product is great, but the price is a little high.  You do get your money&#x27;s worth, but I suggest trying the colors in person, and then buying the color that you like online.</li>
    <li> I got a gift certificate to Sephora for $25 and wanted to use it on something I would normally not buy (which is hard to do in Sephora because I want to buy EVERYTHING!!) Anyway....I wanted to try NARS blush, but didn&#x27;t know which one to pick. I told the salesperson I was trying to streamline my makeup routine, wanted to look natural, but polished. I told her I only want to use mascara, blush, and gloss for my day look and asked her to pick out a natural looking blush. She picked Taos and brushed it on my cheeks....I was running late and had to get back to work, so I got it and left.  This morning I used my regular blush brush and immediately had to wipe the blush off--way too much pigment. After removing some, I got the wonderful, natural, blush look I was going for. The blush pulled my face together and even though I was wearing less make-up, I looked polished and professional. Will definately recommend and repurchase!</li>
    <li> I was reading what the NARS make-artist was saying in the other review, and I agree. I am fair skined. This blush works beautifully for me no matter what colors I&#x27;m wearing. It&#x27;s the only one I use, it gives me a nice touch of color without looking \\&quot;done up\\&quot;. I only use the color \\&quot;orgasm\\&quot;. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the only thing that would make it better is if it actually did give you an orgasm :)</li>
    <li> NARS blush is by far my favorite! As a medium-toned caucasian woman, Orgasm has been my color of choice.  The colors really last, and I love the shimmery undertone.  Speaking of shimmer, Albatross is also a favorite color.  It gives a great golden sparkle, NOT clown-like, to anyplace you want to apply it.  They may market it under &#x27;blush&#x27; but I use it to highlight my brow bone, and the inner corners of my eyes.  On special occasions I sweep it across my collar bone with a blush brush.  I definitely recommend these products, and even love the more vibrant colors, but feel that I&#x27;m too fair-skinned to really pull them off.</li>
    <li> I have medium toned skin and bought lovejoy. It has been wonderful. This is a very lightweight make-up so it feels like you are not wearing anything at all. The blush gives a very, very natural look. It doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, but it makes me glow and feel beautiful.     I would buy it again and recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love it! I got the duo of Nars Orgasm and Nars highlighter. Both are absolutely gorgeous. Not too strong and not too light. It&#x27;s a little bit expensive for blush, but I think it will last a while!</li>
    <li> I tried Nars blush in &#x27;Orgasm&#x27; and I love it. I have fair skin, and this color is great for me. Before this, I used Perscriptives blush in &#x27;China Doll&#x27;. Orgasm is similar in color, but goes on much smoother and a little darker. This is definately the best blush I have tried so far, and I would definately purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I own deep throat and its a beautiful pinkish peach color. The one draw back is the intense sparkles. I was not prepared for them. Not being twelve anymore they make me a little paranoid that I may appear to work at a strip club on my days off. As long as you go easy on the application this sparkle problem will not bother most.</li>
    <li> Everything I read said that Nars Orgasm was the best blush ever, in the whole world and on and on... I ran out of blush so I got a Nars blush in the Orgasm color ... Ok, so its nice. The texture of the pressed powder is very fine, and it goes on smoothly with a big sable brush.  The compact is nice looking but it has no applicator, so if you travel make sure you pack an applicator for this.  &lt;BR&gt;I like the blush, but I don&#x27;t think I just HAVE to have it again. I really like the Yves Saint Laurent Blush Variation 11, and the new YSL Touche Blush that has the applicator built into the bottle. I think I like the YSL products a lot more than Nars. Nars tends to skimp on applicators - and make it difficult for you to use their products if you travel.  I have their eyeliner in a bottle with a separate applicator - a pain to travel with too.  (YSL products also smell better than Nars products)</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and light reddish hair so this blush is perfect!!!  It&#x27;s a great color for us pale people.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that there is no applicator.  However, I have so many other applicators already that it&#x27;s not really a problem.  Just don&#x27;t forget to carry a brush with you!</li>
    <li> I trust Nars when it comes to blush.  The only reason I gave their blush 4 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t always stay on my face as long as I would like, but that goes for just about ANY blush on the market.  Until they create a new type of blush that can honestly withstand 8 hours, Nars is still my favorite blush!  I love the texture, and I prefer the shimmery ones.  Like many people, \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; is my favorite and I use it everyday since I have a fair complexion.  It&#x27;s the only blush that doesn&#x27;t make me look like a cartoon.  I also like \\&quot;Sin\\&quot; during the summer when I&#x27;m a bit more tan.  I think everyone should trust Nars when it comes to blush!</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I have Orgasm. There&#x27;s definately a reason. I LOVE this blush!! I wear it every day and it looks amazing on my super fair skin.</li>
    <li> I love these two colors. I have olive skin and during the summer I am darker than the winter..:) Overall I have a great experience, I dont like the fact I have to buy a separate brush, esp when travelling, it would be nice to have a brush included in this packaging</li>
    <li> I finally tried NARS Blush in Orgasm after hearing so many rave reviews about it.  I now see what all the fuss is about!  Orgasm is the perfect \\&quot;neutral\\&quot; shade that looks good on everyone.  Perfect for every skin tone.  The powder blush is the perfect consistency and glides on easily and blends perfectly.  No streaking and or hard lines.  Now that I&#x27;ve tried it, I can&#x27;t imagine using any other brand or color.</li>
    <li> All the magazines rated Orgasm blush by Nars to be the very best and I personally didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is very washed out- I have blonde hair and blue eyes and very fair skin, and i need to reapply this several times,  during the day.  It gave me NO color at all.  I don&#x27;t wear alot of blush, but you need to see \\&quot;some\\&quot; color!  I was very disappointed with this one!</li>
    <li> I am a makeup artist for NARS, and one thing I always emphasize to my clients it that NOTHING is for everyone, Orgasm blush included. If you are not used to wearing blush, or only a little, then Orgasm will be flattering, but still only to a fairer woman. If you are more comfortable with makeup or color, then I recommend colors that look to the naked eye as much more intense- amazing pigment means apply with a LIGHT touch: Exhibit A for a very fair caucasian or asian woman, Taos for a light-skinned black woman, a Latina or South Asian woman, and Taj Mahal for a darker-skinned black woman. Crazed can be used by anyone of any skintone, as well as Deep Throat and Gilda, and Lovejoy is a beautiful bronzer for a a very fair caucasian woman or a natural-looking blush for a darker skinned woman. Nico diffuses and softens anything (or tones down a rushed blush job), and Sin and Outlaw are two beautiful shimmery shades for fairer women. Universally, the pigment is full and remarkably refined, and the application process- with no brush- is always a little awkward for those of us who travel (or put our makeup on in transit.)</li>
    <li> Like many people, I heard that NARS Orgasm was the Best.Blush.Ever.  So I tried it.  Best blush ever? Not so much.  I&#x27;ve got yellow-toned skin and the Best.Blush.Ever. didn&#x27;t really show up on me.  However, thanks to Sephora&#x27;s generous sampling and return policy I was able to find a host of other great NARs blushes.  I love the rubberized compact, and that they don&#x27;t bother with a brush - I never use the brushes that come with make-up, anyway.  This product lasts a long time.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever see the bottom of the pan.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the price  $32.  But even that&#x27;s not so bad when I consider that, at the rate it&#x27;s diminishing (not at all) this blush will probably last for years.</li>
    <li> This blush has a silky texture, allowing it to blend well. I bought the color \\&quot;orgasm,\\&quot; and I like it a lot. I am a very fair Caucasian woman, and find that most cheek colors are too intense for my skin. This color gives me the look of having just worked out at the gym. The packaging is very sleek and pretty, but really they should have included a brush. Even a small travel size brush would have been better than nothing. That omission makes it difficult to carry the product in my purse - I don&#x27;t want to carry my makeup brushes with me! So, while I really like this blush, it&#x27;s one that I use only at home.</li>
    <li> This is such a great blush, I can use it, my teenage daughter can use it and it really looks good on almost all complexions. It is worth the price, because although the color isn&#x27;t heavy the pigmentation is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually save money on this blush, because prior to the wonderful color I had to mix a sheer peach and pink blush. It is well worth the expense, it won&#x27;t end up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jillian@AmericanBeautyAdvisor.com</li>
    <li> Where would i be without my Nars for the last 8 yrs!?!?! far less rosey that&#x27;s for sure! Ahh... yes orgasm is a beautiful color, but as one other reviewer said... not for everyone.. I use Torrid i am tan with olive tones and Torrid gives me the perfect coraly blush look, which in my opinion should be a subtle pink tint on your cheeks as if you were \\&quot;blushing\\&quot;. Ive had a few other colors as well and Nars blush in general is just a silky fine powder that is VERY pigmented. The way it looks in the case is basically what it will look like on your skin- so you must tap that blush brush before you apply ladies- unless you are a clown and like that kinda thing. I think this really shows the quality because there is nothing more frustrating than bringing home a powder makeup that either wont stick to your skin or just wont achieve the color you thought it was based on how it looked in the packaging..  not the case with NARS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see people have been complaining about no brush being included... I prefer this actually. Think about it, if they throw in a brush with every product it has to go somewhere so the package gets bigger and the price goes up for a mediocre tool which who can blame them? why include high quality tools to be thrown away? you pay for what you get. If you are looking for a excellent quality product such as this- do your self a favor and use GOOD tools to apply it. you wouldnt use Sherwin Williams paint with a roller from the dollar store would you? I know the paint is the best but its not going to hide the chunks of your roller that fall apart on your wall. Anyways, If you must leave your bobby brown brushes at home... a cotton ball is an excellent substitute- again this blush is REALLY pigmented and ive found a ball of cotton works really well for applying and blending the perfect amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend any Nars blush because bottom line it is a long lasting high quality product that goes on smooth and stays there! 5 stars because I have yet to find a better product.d a better product.</li>
    <li> I heard about this blush so much and always wanted to try it, and to tell you the truth am glad i did, i purchased Nars blush in Sin, its kind of dark pink with a shimmering effect,it gives me the perfect glowing flushed look, whether I am tanned or suffering from a winter pale look!!!</li>
    <li> I bought my first NARS blush in Orgasm a year ago, I wear it every day and love it!  I still have not found the bottom of the blush yet so it is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I am not a big fan of blush. Usually whenever I wear it it looks fake or too pink. When I walked into Sephora looking for a natural color, a lady helped me pick out the blush/bronzer duo in Orgasm and Laguna. It looked perfect on my skin. Very subtle, and with a very subtle glittery effect on my face. The bronzer also helped accentuate my jawbone and make my face look deeper. It is definitely flattering on any skin shade!</li>
    <li> I truly love this blush...the texture is so silky and the color is so beautiful and it lasts for hours...but it makes me break out! I am so dissapointed! As soon as I use it, a couple of hours later, I have a zit on my cheek! I have switched to Bare Escentuals blushes, which are also pretty, and I have not broken out. I so do wish Nars would create a oil-free version, then I can go back and start using it again...</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Orgasm\\&quot; definitely works well for most fairer/medium skintones. One woman commented on how I was glowing- even though I was jetlagged from  an international flight! Thank you, NARS.</li>
    <li> These are so exquisitely milled and pigmented that it&#x27;s not irritating to my sensitive skin. I also only need a very little to make my cheeks pop, so it lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORGASM may be the holy grail of blusher for many fairer women, but I&#x27;m an NC44 Latina (med-dark olive tone) and that color would not make a showing on me. I did find that two colors have become my staple blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For warm-tone days, I use EXHIBIT A, a matte blush that is scary in the pan (so brightly orange-red) that most women would think \\&quot;Bozo the Clown\\&quot;. No, it works beautifully on my tone, brightening me (we olive toned women can look sallow and blah without a color pop). Fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cool days (and by cool I&#x27;m talking my color choices for clothes and lipstick, not weather), I like  MATA HARI. It&#x27;s a matte cool pink tone that is deep enough to show on my cheeks and give me a look that says \\&quot;Healthful\\&quot; or \\&quot;just went for a quick jog and has blood circulating well\\&quot;. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try CRAZED and TAOS, which seem to be shimmery cousins to my two faves (ie, one is warmer, one is cooler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the thing is to head to a store like Sephora and just try the shades. With the array of beautiful colors, you will find a couple or more colors that make you feel and look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: You really need a quality brush to get just enough pigment and deposit not too much pigment. That&#x27;s my recommendation. These blushes do not come with little cheapo rough brushes like so many do. No, get a good blush brush--a MAC one, or a Sephora, etc. I use the MAC duo-fiber brush, smaller one, and it works very well with these strong shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, pricey. But I&#x27;ve gone through so many disappointing blushes in drugstore brands and even from some name brands, that it&#x27;s a relief to find blushers that WORK for me and make me happy and don&#x27;t make me itch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hurrah for NARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
