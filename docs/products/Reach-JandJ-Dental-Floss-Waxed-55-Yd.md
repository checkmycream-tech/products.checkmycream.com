      <li>Good price for the 6-pack!</li>
      <li>Ordering online is a great solution.</li>
      <li>Great that it&#x27;s waxed too.</li>
      <li>I was so happy.</li>
      <li>Quality is great too, doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
      <li>I am sure it is perfect dental floss too.  </li>
      <li>I can never find it in stores and the price seems good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good brand name, too.</li>
      <li>Not as good as the ones I buy from &amp;#34;the store&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>cheap and works well!!</li>
      <li>nice that it comes in a multi pack</li>
      <li>strong floss and good waxing helps the glide.</li>
      <li>I have noticed it tends to shred more than it did years ago...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and will buy again when these 6 are gone.</li>
      <li>Waxed works much better than un-waxed.</li>
      <li>I would rather have the &amp;#34;easySLIDE&amp;#34; from REACH, but this is the next best thing</li>
      <li>I like the Reach floss and don&#x27;t like all the flavors most folks offer.  </li>
      <li>many stores J &amp; J products (first aid supplies, floss etc.) have been discontinued and replaced with their own brand.</li>
      <li>On lone makes it easy</li>
      <li>And the order came very quickly.</li>
      <li>It was exactly the kind of dental floss I had been trying to locate.</li>
      <li>Yet, it still slides between the teeth just fine.</li>
      <li>I needed some light weight strong waxed string, and dental floss fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>There is a huge difference between these and the ones from supermarkets.  </li>
      <li>both choices are available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Thankfully it is still available here</li>
      <li>This is such a great deal for the price.</li>
      <li>Good solid floss product all thing considered.</li>
      <li>They seem to shred very easily and our teeth haven&#x27;t shifted significantly in our old age.</li>
      <li>In super markets their brand of floss and another national brand are all you can get.</li>
      <li>Good small pack that fits easily for travel.</li>
      <li>Came, exactly what I needed, and arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>Not tape style right?</li>
      <li>The dental floss was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>I came here as a last resort and found that I&#x27;m not alone in my love for this product and my difficulty in finding it.</li>
      <li>The ones from supermarkets are a lot richer in wax which makes the floss slide way better and feel sturdier overall.</li>
      <li>All these reviews pretty much say exactly what I feel.</li>
      <li>If such an admittedly small thing matters to you, this is good waxed unflavored (Yay!)</li>
      <li>Thanks, Preferred Mart.  </li>
      <li>This is very helpful for those who have bridges.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>If you are lucky enough to find J &amp; J floss</li>
      <li>For some reason , this superior floss and tape has become very hard to find in northern California, since the CVS of this world want us to buy their inferior house brands.</li>
      <li>It seems as though a good product like this is now very hard to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Purchasing it this way is way cheaper then buying at the store around where I live.  </li>
      <li>I have very tight contacts between my teeth, but this floss is easy to use and really gets the tartar off and the food particles out without shredding.</li>
      <li>It removes more food debris than ordinary dental floss.</li>
      <li>As you can see, it has many purposes and it comes in a small roll which easily fits inside a small tin can.  </li>
      <li>I use no other.</li>
      <li>Thin enough to fit between crowded teeth, but not easily broken.</li>
      <li>I know it sounds crazy, but it is good for cordage.  </li>
      <li>one thing I like about this floss that hasn&#x27;t been said by others is that it&#x27;s not super slippery, so when you wrap it around your fingers it doesn&#x27;t slide out of your grip like other super slippery flosses.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are just what you get in the grocery or drug store. You just get 6 of them and have a few spares. I don&#x27;t have to reorder for a long time, and I appreciate that. My store is often out of what I need.</li>
    <li> It seems as though a good product like this is now very hard to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many stores J &amp; J products (first aid supplies, floss etc.) have been discontinued and replaced with their own brand. CVS is one example. In super markets their brand of floss and another national brand are all you can get. If you are lucky enough to find J &amp; J floss it is flavored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully it is still available here and so I stocked up...which I suggest y&#x27;all do.</li>
    <li> Perfect - I just needed floss, and now I have a bulk pack. Came, exactly what I needed, and arrived quickly. Very happy.</li>
    <li> The product was as advertised and delivered on time.</li>
    <li> On lone makes it easy</li>
    <li> It was exactly the kind of dental floss I had been trying to locate. I was so happy. And the order came very quickly. I was very impressed. .</li>
    <li> This is one of the few remaining flosses that doesn&#x27;t come in mint or cinnamon. Great that it&#x27;s waxed too. The wax doesn&#x27;t come off during the process so that&#x27;s another plus. Good small pack that fits easily for travel. It does fray slightly but only towards the end of the process. Good solid floss product all thing considered.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why it isn&#x27;t sold in drug stores, but it&#x27;s not.  The quality is excellent.  I dislike the flavored stuff, so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> This is such a great deal for the price. Almost 1/3 of what you pay for in store, and since it&#x27;s in bulk, I don&#x27;t have to order for a while. Quality is great too, doesn&#x27;t shred.</li>
    <li> I would rather have the &amp;#34;easySLIDE&amp;#34; from REACH, but this is the next best thing</li>
    <li> This is the best floss there is. I had been frustrated by not being able to find this in stores anymore. It doesn&#x27;t even show up on the J&amp;J Reach web site--so maybe they&#x27;re getting rid of it? I find it hard to understand why they seem to have abandoned this product when it had been the ubiquitous industry standard. I came here as a last resort and found that I&#x27;m not alone in my love for this product and my difficulty in finding it. All these reviews pretty much say exactly what I feel. You people are my family! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I like about this floss that hasn&#x27;t been said by others is that it&#x27;s not super slippery, so when you wrap it around your fingers it doesn&#x27;t slide out of your grip like other super slippery flosses. Yet, it still slides between the teeth just fine.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommends this floss and I swear by it. Thin enough to fit between crowded teeth, but not easily broken. Good price for the 6-pack!</li>
    <li> I use 2 kinds of floss everyday due to the tightness of my teeth.  I have used this one for years.</li>
    <li> The dental floss was exactly as described.  It works really well</li>
    <li> Great price! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is very helpful for those who have bridges.  It removes more food debris than ordinary dental floss.</li>
    <li> Works like floss should.</li>
    <li> For some reason , this superior floss and tape has become very hard to find in northern California, since the CVS of this world want us to buy their inferior house brands. very happy to find it with you, and at a great price. flawless performance. Thanks, Preferred Mart.  Jack McLaughlin</li>
    <li> I have very tight contacts between my teeth, but this floss is easy to use and really gets the tartar off and the food particles out without shredding.</li>
    <li> this is MY floss. I use no other. No flavor no fuss no muss! I can never find it in stores and the price seems good.</li>
    <li> I like the Reach floss and don&#x27;t like all the flavors most folks offer.  Just want the plain stuff, which is what this is.  Just wish they still had those older style larger dispensers so there would be less waste.</li>
    <li> Tough to find in stores, which now carry dozens of flavored flosses.  What&#x27;s up with that?  When I finish eating a great-tasting meal, and reach for floss, I don&#x27;t want a flavor -- I just want hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;This product is made off-shore -- who knows what oversight there is regarding its manufacture and materials.  I have noticed it tends to shred more than it did years ago...  Wish it was still made in the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> There is a lot of dental floss with buy. You take these small packages of floss anywhere you need to keep floss when you need it.</li>
    <li> So great to find the non-mint flavor!</li>
    <li> They are not of the same quality that they used to be.  They seem to shred very easily and our teeth haven&#x27;t shifted significantly in our old age.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find these in the stories</li>
    <li> Not as good as the ones I buy from &amp;#34;the store&amp;#34;.  Like Wegmans for example.  It says waxed but come on.  There is a huge difference between these and the ones from supermarkets.  These (from amazon) are of way way lower quality than the ones I find at the supermarkets.  And I am all for online purchases.  Dont know why it&#x27;s not the same product.  The ones from supermarkets are a lot richer in wax which makes the floss slide way better and feel sturdier overall.</li>
    <li> We have used the waxed dental floss for years and, over the last several years, were constantly frustrated trying to find  this product in the stores as it was always out of stock. Ordering online is a great solution. This seller delivered the product promptly and as promised.</li>
    <li> This is simple dental floss.  It meets all my needs, it doesn&#x27;t break, doesn&#x27;t have much wax buildup, and doesn&#x27;t have any serious problems.</li>
    <li> strong floss and good waxing helps the glide. cheap and works well!! nice that it comes in a multi pack</li>
    <li> Is this dental floss blue and white striped? Not tape style right? I have been looking for this FOREVER. can someone confirm?</li>
    <li> Waxed works much better than un-waxed. Great price here!</li>
    <li> It has become next to impossible for me to find unflavored dental floss locally. Whether waxed (which I prefer) or unwaxed, all floss--no matter the brand--has some sort of flavor. As a last resort, I checked out Amazon, and lo and behold! both choices are available. It&#x27;s a good brand name, too. If such an admittedly small thing matters to you, this is good waxed unflavored (Yay!) dental floss--just what I was looking for. Standard size, standard length--Exactly what you&#x27;d expect when ordering. I&#x27;m satisfied and will buy again when these 6 are gone.</li>
    <li> It shreds between my close-contact teeth.  I&#x27;ll use it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dental floss for something other then dental floss.  I am making a survival kit that fits into a tin can the size of an altoids can.  I needed some light weight strong waxed string, and dental floss fits the bill.  I know it sounds crazy, but it is good for cordage.  I am sure it is perfect dental floss too.  Purchasing it this way is way cheaper then buying at the store around where I live.  So, I took the spool out of the container it comes in, and I have 55 yards of emergency fishing line, thread to mend my cloths, gear, or myself should I get cut that bad.  It can also be used to hold a emergency shelter together or make a snare trap.  As you can see, it has many purposes and it comes in a small roll which easily fits inside a small tin can.  Anyway, that is why I purchased this dental floss.</li>
