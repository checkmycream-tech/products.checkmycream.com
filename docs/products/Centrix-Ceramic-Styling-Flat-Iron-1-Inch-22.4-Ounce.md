      <li>This iron is well worth hundreds of dollars.</li>
      <li>It straightens but somehow provides more body and fullness to fine hair instead of ironing it so flat as others do.  </li>
      <li>i liked the flat iron so much that i am now purchasing another one!!</li>
      <li>I now wear my hair about 4 inches shorter, right at shoulder length.  </li>

      <li>I love the long chord.</li>
      <li>I am absolutely beyond satisfied with this flat iron!</li>
      <li>It gives my hair a good amount of volume which is nice since I have thin, flat hair.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It works really well</li>
      <li>Received very promptly.</li>
      <li>It never fully heated up &amp; didn&#x27;t make my hair straight and silky.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This flat iron works really well. I have naturally curly hair and this iron has worked better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. It glides down your hair without any pulling or snagging. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a professional grade flat iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; flat iron purchase... my previous one cost only $30 and did the trick but this one is definitely a case of you get what you pay for.  It works great and is easy to use.  I only wish it came with an auto-off feature... would have used that already!</li>
    <li> Heats up quick.  Easy to use.  I do not use it for straightening but instead to create curls.  The only reason I removed one star from my rating is because it does sometimes leave \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; in your hair when you use it to create curls.  Otherwise, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  I bought my first from my hairdresser.  I  find this second one not quite as hot as the first one.  But still a great product.  Heats up great especially since I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this over my CHI flat iron.  It straightens but somehow provides more body and fullness to fine hair instead of ironing it so flat as others do.  It smooths as well as the Chi brands, but works even better on fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this iron for almost a year now and I love it, it&#x27;s dependable, which is very important in my line of work.</li>
    <li> Bought this product from professional salon for about $160. Lasted about one year. Now only one of the ceramic plate heats up. My $30 Revlon lasted longer than this.</li>
    <li> The Iron is of Great quality. It was recommended to me by my hair stylist. I love the long chord. It Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this straight iron for at least 3 years, it has finaly quit working so I purchased a different one, but I&#x27;m returning that one to buy another one of these.  My hair stylest said it would only last about a year so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the 3 years I got out of it.  It works really well I have thick hair and this iron does a great job, plus I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair either.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for spending just a little more money! My mom has the same one and I love it! Definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to break the bank but are looking for a nice iron! Does the job!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever had.  It does not cook or snag my hair and gives it shine.  I love it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything they said it would be and more!!!! Leaves my hair silky soft and silky smooth. Love how it shines!</li>
    <li> I purchased this straightener through my stylist about 5 years ago. It still heats up fast and works perfectly. People always compliment how silky smooth my naturally curly hair is when I have straightened it with this. The swivel cord is awesome and the cord is very long compared to any straighter I&#x27;ve had. I am finally replacing mine because the cord has began to fall apart.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely beyond satisfied with this flat iron! I had been searching for a flat iron for some time now, and this was recommended by my stylist. Gets super hot in less than 10 seconds, with a great range of temp. settings reaching up to 400+ degrees. No snagging at all, and leaves a super shiny sheen to my hair. I have super wavy/thick hair, that my CHI struggled to tame. (Need I make mention of Louisiana humidity, too?..ugh) No need going over the same pieces of hair over and over! This iron is well worth hundreds of dollars. This is a must have..and for this price?!? It&#x27;s a STEAL!! I can not recommend this product enough. Get it!!!</li>
    <li> We have purchased two of these since 2010. The first one lasted a year, this one made it 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it worked, it did a great job...then POOF, they both have died with no warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return policy allows for returns with full refund in one month. Returning the last bought one for \\&quot;partial refund,\\&quot; whatever that amount may be and doing so at my own expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO manufacturer warranty support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> Nothing special.  It works well but I see nothing that sets it apart from any other high-end flat iron.  It works great but no different then my GHD flat iron did. It heats very quickly and it does not caught my hair while straightening.  Overall a good purchase.</li>
    <li> I hate being duped into buying cheaply made goods. The Amazon product summary and description both say that this flat iron is made in Italy. The box clearly states that it is made in Korea. Amazon owes me an apology -- and a refund.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a few years &amp; my daughters and I love it!! We&#x27;ve tried many different flat irons but this is the only one that really straightens thick hair that tends to frizz easily. I had to buy another one since my daughter took mine with her to college! You&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very good flat iron. Salon worthy no doubt. There are better flat irons out there but the price was perfect for this model. Couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron. Gets nice and hot. Can turn it down if you want. Extra long chord is a nice feature.</li>
    <li> I really like it although my hair seems frizzy after so I use some styling stuff but over all good product Thank u</li>
    <li> I have sort of curly, sort of wavy, collar-bone length hair.  I gave up on flat ironing about 10 years ago.  They always made my fine hair look flat, fried, and lame.  I usually bought the $20 kind and didn&#x27;t think the expensive ones would be any better.  But then I saw on Pinterest that you could use flat irons to curl and shape hair, as well as straighten.  I decided to try flat irons again.  I searched for the best one for fine hair and found this one by Centrix.  It&#x27;s listed at $119 on some well-known beauty websites, but I got it for less than $50 on Amazon.    I am not a natural when it comes to using hair tools...but I was able to use this one with great results!  It&#x27;s super lightweight, the ceramic plates are \\&quot;floating\\&quot; so they fit together gently but firmly, and there was no snagging of my hair along the way.  I also like the adjustable temperature so I can use the least amount of heat needed to get it straight.  The higher quality of this iron definitely makes a difference.  I was able to straighten my hair without having to go back over the same sections, and my hair was smooth but still had body and wasn&#x27;t crispy.  I&#x27;m still working on the curling and other techniques but it seems possible with this iron.    **6 month update**  I now wear my hair about 4 inches shorter, right at shoulder length.  I&#x27;m able to use this flat iron to put beachy loose waves in my hair.  The key for me was to use smaller sections.  If I&#x27;m not careful it will do a weird flippy curl, but with the right technique it&#x27;s actually cute.  There&#x27;s lots of how-to tips on Pinterest and videos on YouTube.</li>
    <li> Simply, way better than my GHD (gold series), and for half the price. I encourage anyone who&#x27;s thinking of buying this to buy it. One of my favorite purchases in a while. :)</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. This is the second one I have owned and I only bought another one because my cord was all messed up. Great product.</li>
    <li> I already knew this flat-iron was going to be awesome.  My stylist uses a similar one by Centrix.  She raved about hers.  This model warms up quickly.  It smooths hair instantly and I love the adjustable settings.  Definitely would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Got this on recommendation of my stylist....best ever!!!!  Worth much more than this........you cannot go wrong with this flat iron...</li>
    <li> This is my favorite flatiron. Quality is better than a CHI anyday. And I&#x27;ve been a hairstylist for over 16 years. The past few years I have been using this flatiron and suggesting it to my clients.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only one I use.</li>
    <li> Love it, love the long cord and love the temp control!</li>
    <li> I bought my wife another brand, and she forced me to buy this one due to its superior quality.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> Honest to God the best flat iron that you will EVER find!! one of my friends recently moved &amp; took this mine to Florida with her  i have a feeling i will not be getting it back! i liked the flat iron so much that i am now purchasing another one!! leaves your hair perfectly straight &amp; smooth,, what move can you ask for!!</li>
    <li> I bought this in part because online here at Amazon it said, &amp;#34;Made in Italy.&amp;#34; Yet it has arrived and is clearly labeled, &amp;#34;MADE IN KOREA.&amp;#34; I do not like being hoodwinked.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron and so do my clients. Glat to find it at a cheeper price on amazon!!  Love the temp control that the chi does not have. Been using the centrix for  5 years!!</li>
    <li> Worked for a while, but quit getting as hot as it was when I first purchased it. Sad, but true</li>
    <li> This flat iron lasted me over 5 years. I loved it! I am debating on whether to try something new (i get bored) or to just buy this one again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Received very promptly.However on receipt, I didn&#x27;t expect the item to have an american plug ! Cost me a further £29.99 to buy a transformer deemed safe to change the voltage suitable for use with a ceramic iron (all to do with rapid heating)&lt;br /&gt;I would have preferred to be aware i was purchasing an american voltage product.No where indicated this info.That said,- product is great.</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I have really thick hair so I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair 2 and 3 times like I do with some flat irons.</li>
    <li> I had perviously owned this straightener and it was amazing!! So I decided to buy it again when my first one was stolen. It was no where near as good. It never fully heated up &amp; didn&#x27;t make my hair straight and silky. I then called Amazon to try an return it and the lady who helped me said she emailed me the return tag. She lied, she didn&#x27;t send anything. I still have the straightener but don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron for fine hair.  Doesn&#x27;t pull and cleans easily with just a damp rag.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Sleek, easy to take anywhere, cools down quickly, love it more then a Chi Flat Iron I use to have.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I&#x27;ve had so far. It doesn&#x27;t damage my fine hair, like previous straighteners have. May depend more on your hair type, though!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener that tames even my frizzy wavy hair!  I will never buy another!</li>
    <li> I love how smooth the plates are, my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught as it did in other name brand our cheaper brands.  It gives my hair a good amount of volume which is nice since I have thin, flat hair.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because the cord gets in the way when straightening my hair.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have had. Previously I purchased Chi&#x27;s, and decided to give this one a chance after my latest Chi broke. I have had it for about a month so far. This flat iron is the perfect size, it is light weight, and has an adjustable temperature that can get VERY hot (hotter than my Chi ever got) which is good for my thick hair, but can be adjusted to a warm temperature as well. It also has an amazing cord. The cord is very long, and does not tangle easily (if you have owned a Chi, you know that those cords are very hard to deal with). Love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
    <li> My little sister has had one of these straighteners for about 3 years now and it is fantastic! I have naturally curly hair and used the Chi straighteners, but they always ripped my hair out and my hair always curled back up before the end of the day. This straightener feels like it&#x27;s actually good for my hair. It makes my hair sleek and smooth after use and straightens my curliest curls! Also, it stays straight all day and I live where there&#x27;s high humidity. I had to buy my own after using hers a few times, and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money for a good straightener, and this is a really good, professional straightener. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for...I have used the cheaper irons from the drug store before and this works much much better! I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am very dissapointed in this Styling Iron.  It leaves my hair feeling like straw.  The iron does not slide down hair with a smooth stroke, instead it hesitates leaving the hair stuck togethere like straw.  I would not recommend this iron to my worst of enamies.</li>
