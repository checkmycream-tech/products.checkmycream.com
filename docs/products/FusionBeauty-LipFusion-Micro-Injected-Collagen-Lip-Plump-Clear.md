      <li>Fantastic.</li>
      <li>Xl 2x Micro-Injected Collagen Advanced Lip Plumping Therapy]]</li>
      <li>If this plumps I can&#x27;t really tell, I may get this product again because it&#x27;s a nice lip gloss, and it may plump, but I cant tell.</li>
      <li>This is great for dry lips to get better really fast, and after couple of applications lips heal super nice.</li>
      <li>I was excited about this product.</li>
      <li>but I have tried the other similar products from department stores and drug stores and this is the best of its kind - except for the paraben issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I used to by this for full price at the Sephora.  </li>
      <li>to- that the tinted versions aren&#x27;t as effective as the clear.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes, smooths wrinkles and mildly plumps up aging, thinning lips-like mine!&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
      <li>I like the clear one better than the colors</li>
      <li>First of all, this product will not give you full lips if you never had them to begin with -</li>
      <li>but didn&#x27;t seem extremely fresh or &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so probably won&#x27;t use it.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t at all feel like the first bottle I bought - which made my lips tingle when I put it on.  </li>
      <li>The first time was at a retail store.  </li>
      <li>I used to wear City Lips advanced formula in clear color and it helped plumping my lips.</li>
      <li>I do not like it really</li>
      <li>Not really about the plumping effect for me, more the lip color and feel on the lip.</li>
      <li>However the reasons I really like it don&#x27;t have to do with its performance as a plumper.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It does really work -</li>
      <li>There doesnt seem to be much in ithe tube.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Using this every day has kept my winter weather dry lips from becoming chapped.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the company and the product.</li>
      <li>I am in my 40s and this brings back my original lip contour</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll be buying it again as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended it.  </li>
      <li>I have glossy lips that are a little more plump than normal.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I am also laughing at how the same girls made fun of me for being \\&quot;pale\\&quot; and not tanning).</li>
      <li>have also used the XL version and the new &#x27;infatuation&#x27; line (that does NOT have parabens)</li>
      <li>This adds just the right amount of sheer natural looking lip color.</li>
      <li>So I ordered two replacemts and the picture of the product looked exactly the same.</li>
      <li>Not sure if this plumps up lips or makes them appear fuller because it fills in creases, but I love what it does.</li>
      <li>It is the only lip plumper I have found that stays on, does not have an oily feel or funny smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick enough to stay and feel smooth, but not so liquid that it wears off quickly or feels slimy.  </li>
      <li>Lots of people like the glossy clear color</li>
      <li>Keeps my lips soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>It also gives lips a natural color.</li>
      <li>but it seems that the product I recevied is old.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a clear gloss that can stand alone or go over your regular lip color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>even I only wore it twice a day, early in the morning &amp; before bed.</li>

<li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t take someone with very thin lips and render them with a totally juicy pout, but it will add a bit of volume for sure with regular use(I would estimate 15-20%</li>

<li> Waste of money.</li>

    <li> I used to wear City Lips advanced formula in clear color and it helped plumping my lips. The con is it is sticky, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much bcs of great result even I only wore it twice a day, early in the morning &amp; before bed. Bcs I was tired of paying over $30/tube so I purchased FusionBeauty 1 1/2 months ago to replace it. What a mistake, wasted my money, it only works like a regular moisturizer. Chapstick Hydration Lock Moisturizer &amp; Renew works the same and only $3!</li>
    <li> This lip plumper lives up to its promises! It moisturizes, smooths wrinkles and mildly plumps up aging, thinning lips-like mine!&lt;br /&gt;Plus it tingles and feels refreshing- the effects last all day. It leaves a clear gloss that can stand alone or go over your regular lip color.&lt;br /&gt;The container lasts a long time.[[ASIN:B0009M0C5W FusionBeauty LipFusion Xl 2x Micro-Injected Collagen Advanced Lip Plumping Therapy]]</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t experience any difference in lip texture, plumping, moisture, nothing.  Tingly?  Yes.  Anything beyond that?  No.  Could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off.  Applied it, left it on as long as possible but eventually had to remove what was left before applying lipstick.  Applied at night before bedtime. No noticeable difference for me.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like the lipfusion XL much better, should have gotten this in a color, my bad.  Both r good products for me though.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Subtle plumping, moisturized lips.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, and I have also had temporary fillers in my lips, the last time being about 4 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the fillers may have stimulated my own collagen, since I have used this product I don&#x27;t feel the need for injected fillers. It does really work - but it is subtle and it takes time. You may see a slight difference immediately but over time if you use it consistently (best at night), you will see a difference in your lip fullness, but it will never approach what you get from injected fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t take someone with very thin lips and render them with a totally juicy pout, but it will add a bit of volume for sure with regular use(I would estimate 15-20% increase).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey but I have tried the other similar products from department stores and drug stores and this is the best of its kind - except for the paraben issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used the XL version and the new &#x27;infatuation&#x27; line (that does NOT have parabens) and I haven&#x27;t found either as effective as this version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also noticed - as  has others Ive talked to- that the tinted versions aren&#x27;t as effective as the clear. I don&#x27;t know why, but that has been my experience.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the only lip plumper I have found that stays on, does not have an oily feel or funny smell.</li>
    <li> Great product but didn&#x27;t seem extremely fresh or &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; so probably won&#x27;t use it.  In the future I will just purchase it from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this product at Costco a couple of years ago and&lt;br /&gt;Loved it. It was a sort of lip gloss looking stuff. So I ordered two replacemts and the picture of the product looked exactly the same. When I received the product it was totally different product. This stuff is like a very stiff chap stick. I do not like it really but, of course, I had tried it and accidentally used the one I had stuck in my purse so I did not return them. It was a very expensive misadventure.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and still find it to be the best lip plumper out there. I get Juvederm in my lips and this helps make it last longer</li>
    <li> Fantastic. It works !!!!I don&#x27;t know why is no more saled in Europe. My lips are bigger and hidratated . Thanks</li>
    <li> I like this product, and the plumpling last for hours.  at least 4 or 5 hours, which is a lot. I like the texture too, it is not stiky at all. I used to use Lancome plumpling, and it was way more expensive, the effect lasted a lot less that the lip fusion&#x27;s. So 4 stars for this one.</li>
    <li> Love this lip gloss!  I take it everywhere with me!  One application lasts for hours!  Lips stay full and glossy :)</li>
    <li> Not sure if this plumps up lips or makes them appear fuller because it fills in creases, but I love what it does. I put some on my finger before putting it on as I do not want the wand picking up lipstick pigment.</li>
    <li> As my title says that all these items marketed to women are basically total waste of money PERIOD. Women dont get it, PLZZZ Stop we men dont care about this crap.</li>
    <li> I used to by this for full price at the Sephora.  I always wonder if I might be getting a knock-off when ordering on-line for a less than what it is in the store, but what I received on Amazon is the same product. I&#x27;m happy I got a good deal!</li>
    <li> Not as sticky as many others. It also gives lips a natural color. Best of all my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck to my lips when the wind blows.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  I am a big fan of FusionBeauty products.</li>
    <li> FusionBeauty LipFusion Micro-injected Collagen Lip Plump Gloss should be an essential part of your beauty routine... Why? Because it actually works!</li>
    <li> I love this gloss and was happy to see it listed on Amazon.  It&#x27;s the prefect sheen and consistency.  It&#x27;s thick enough to stay and feel smooth, but not so liquid that it wears off quickly or feels slimy.  I like it better than the all silver container version of this product (think that one&#x27;s called XL?).  This one is thicker and has a nicer effect.  Nothing works miracles and it certainly doesn&#x27;t plum my lips like collagen might, but I&#x27;m happy with this product and find that the container lasts for years of intermittent use.  I like the clear one better than the colors and I&#x27;ll be buying it again as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
    <li> This is great for dry lips to get better really fast, and after couple of applications lips heal super nice. I will recommend this product to every one who had dry lips, and OTHER lip related discomforts. Try this for couple of days, and you will see this product will heal your lips, it does so much more then just plumping lips.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product will not give you full lips if you never had them to begin with - I did have pouty lips (the &#x27;mean girls&#x27; in school int the pre-Angelina days actually used to tease me about it, but who&#x27;s laughing now..)  I am in my 40s and this brings back my original lip contour (I am also laughing at how the same girls made fun of me for being \\&quot;pale\\&quot; and not tanning). However the reasons I really like it don&#x27;t have to do with its performance as a plumper. This is one of the few lip products that doesn&#x27;t have vanilla flavor in it (which I find gross). It is also one of the only glosses that doesn&#x27;t make my lips flake and it lasts a REALLY long time, at least for me. I got a tube of clear in 2005 that I used as a base for my lipstick or by itself every time I went out at night (at least four times a week) and it lasted three years. Granted, I am not big on reapplying, but still I was impressed.</li>
    <li> Performs very well as a moisturizer - thick and clingy - lasting for hours.  It plumps lips by way of a stinging chemical.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have glossy lips that are a little more plump than normal.&lt;br /&gt;Using this every day has kept my winter weather dry lips from becoming chapped.&lt;br /&gt;Pleased with the company and the product. Will use again.</li>
    <li> I will consider buying this product again.  I highly recommended it.  Lots of people like the glossy clear color and I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times before and have loved it.  But this is not the case this time.  It dried out my lips so bad that everytime I used it my lips would peel for about 2 days.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just this batch or what.  But I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product. It got here on time but it seems that the product I recevied is old.  There doesnt seem to be much in ithe tube.</li>
    <li> Lip fusion with injected collagen is a very good product... Effective, nice shine and resistent. I like it a lot!</li>
    <li> hard to find now, Sephora used to carry this but no longer does. This adds just the right amount of sheer natural looking lip color. Not really about the plumping effect for me, more the lip color and feel on the lip.</li>
    <li> This is the only lip plumper I have found that works and does not irritate my lips. Perfect as a light sheer lipgloss or with lipstick on top!</li>
    <li> If this plumps I can&#x27;t really tell, I may get this product again because it&#x27;s a nice lip gloss, and it may plump, but I cant tell.</li>
    <li> Keeps my lips soft and shiny.  I think the plumping is working.  Like all glosses, it does get sticky, but this one resists it more than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> As many other have said, if you have thin lips, this is not going to do a miracle.  But this product did restore my lips to the &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; I enjoyed in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> i see results  will continue to order product</li>
    <li> A friend swore by this so I tried it, saw no results.  I have had better luck with cheaper products.</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this product. The first time was at a retail store.  This seems to be a different formula - or possibly inauthentic.  It doesn&#x27;t at all feel like the first bottle I bought - which made my lips tingle when I put it on.  This one is just sticky lip gloss.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the XL version. but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says. she gave the rest of it to a friend.</li>
