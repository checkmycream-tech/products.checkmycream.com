<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this for the first time on 6/29/13. It literally made my hair super soft and I could run my fingers in it from root to tip! That&#x27;s not easy for me as I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed to natural hair. I love this and will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I believe I used this product previously and the results were fine however, I used this product recently and received terrible results.  I wash my hair weekly and the first 1 or 2 days after washing my hair it is usually unmanageable but then begins to retain it&#x27;s natural moisture and is good the rest of the week.  However with this product, the first day it was normal unmanageable but then never improved. My hair was dry like straw and it was lighter in color because it was so dry.I actually had my father in law and husband comment on my gray hair the same day and I noticed my gray way more pronounced after using this. I would not recommend this and will never use it again. Other products are much more consistent in results</li>
    <li> This conditioner did absolutely nothing to my hair except make it even more frizzy than I&#x27;ve ever seen it. It also smelled a little funky until I remembered that banana was involved. I guess that the combination of ingredients doesn&#x27;t improve the matter. I feel that it was a huge waste of money and effort. This item was in my subscribe and save cart and is now deleted from it.  Good riddance.</li>
    <li> I have used just about everything from the ORS brand (Organic Root Stimulator) and I havent been disappointed yet so I was so eager to try the HAIRepair line upon seeing the print ads for the line in numerous magazines.I already own and love the HAIRepair Polisher. Such would be my luck that my local BSS didnt have any of the HAIRepair line so I ordered off Amazon. When I saw the great ingredient listed in the HAIRepair Nourishing Conditioner I knew I was in for a treat. It has banana extract which is very moisturizing for your hair and bamboo extract which helps to strengthen hair against breakage. I was soeager to try this conditioner &amp; I was thrilled with my results. The conditioners smells fabulous! The consistency is almost like a banana pudding. It glides through your hair easily. If you are a fan of the ORS Olive Oil Replenishing Pak/conditioner you already know how my hair felt upon rinsing.....like butter! Soft,easily detangled,moist and almost no hair in the comb during the detangling process. The moisturized soft feeling didnt leave my hair after my hair was dried. The feeling lasted for days. IMO ORS has  another staple product in my hair care arsenal. I will repurchase. You wont be disappointed with the companion HAIRepair products .</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner. It leaves the hair really soft and silky,detangled, and smells great. Definitely recommend it for people with dry damaged hair as an overnight deep conditioner , with a plastic cap on. Your hair will be whipped like butter the next day.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is great. It really leaves my coarse hair very soft and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Right now my hair is transitioning (natural roots and straight ends..going all the way natural) My hair gets unbelievable tangled. However, the second I put this product in my hair it instantly felt silky smooth and I literally was able to run my fingers through my hair with absolutely NO BREAKAGE! !!! I sat with a plastic cap on my head for about 15 minutes (no heat) and my hair was even softer!!!!! And my hair stayed soft even after I rinsed the product out of my hair. I&#x27;m totally in love with this product!!!</li>
    <li> I am relaxed and I&#x27;ve used plenty of conditioners and I must say this is one of the best. I would definitely recommend this product. It softens the hair shaft effortlessly. I have so much slip when I combed out my hair I&#x27;m sooooo amazed. Hardley any shedded hair in the comb. Ladies or gentlemen you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This product will definetly be a part of my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> I just actually deep condition my hair with this overnight and I can admit I love it love it love it  someone else mention it is drying after but I have high porosity hair which I have to do the loc method in order to keep the moisture in due to high porosity meaning damaged hair this product absolutely makes you feel like you do not have any damage the best product ever found since creme of nature intensive organ oil deep conditioner great products</li>
    <li> I love all ORS Hairepair products for my dry, curly hair.  It really helps my hair to feel softer and more silky.  It is much more manageable and is breaking less.</li>
    <li> This is my second week using the conditioner and I think I&#x27;m in love. :)&lt;br /&gt;Last week I left it in my hair (natural 4b) for around 1 hour under a plastic cap w/no heat. Today I&#x27;m doing an overnight DC with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. I am VERY impressed with my hairs condition after using this product. I hope it will be available soon in the bottle size, and that the formula stays the exact same.</li>
    <li> Update 1/10/14&lt;br /&gt;I used this stuff once when I was relaxed and it was pretty good. Now I have my curly hair back and this stuff is trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product once or twice and remember it worked well for me when my hair was straight. I bought new packs and tried it again a few days ago, and I can no longer recommend this. It curls my hair, but doesn&#x27;t provide adequate moisture. Also, it&#x27;s rather waxy, and leaves a gross thick film over my thick curly and coily hair that I later had to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is like a pudding. It isn&#x27;t too thick but isn&#x27;t too thin either. I had to be careful when putting it in my hair or some product would slip from my hand. It does smell like banana but it isn&#x27;t overbearing. When hair dries it still smells like the product, but it went away once I moisturized my hair. Once you let it sit on your hair under a plastic cap, it runs down from the hair and onto your face! It&#x27;s really annoying because it tastes gross and feels waxy on my face...It moisturizes just OK, I&#x27;ve had much better conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never try this again and am tossing out my other pack.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had before and after pictures to show how much my hair has transitioned from a being short dry brittle damaged hair to the healthy shiny growing head of hair that I have now. Two years ago I had to start taking medication and it just wreaked havoc on my hair...I tried everything...went on youtube to hear about regimens that other girls were using and tried weaves and braids and nothing brought my hair back. My hair stylist ever two weeks was cutting my hair shorter and shorter and shorter until I just stopped seeing her all together. Well this year I finally found a hair regimen that I would say was practically a miracle. The thing that I learned that if you really want healthy hair and skin you have to work from the inside out. So I went to a naturopathic doctor and addressed my nutritional deficiencies with supplements like vit C, Biotine and the Omega 3,6,9 and collagen. I began eat more fruits and vegetables especially the leafy greens (even thought my overall diet sucks). I increase my water intake so that my urine is clear. Here&#x27;s the kicker I stopped wearing weaves and braids (all though I loved them) and I also stopped the blowdrying and flat ironing of my hair. Now I go to the Dominican salon once a week (because I work out and my hair gets very sweaty). I switched to a sulfate free shampoo and every week I deep condition with Organic Root Stimulator Hair Repair Conditioner. Every three weeks I will switch and do a protein conditioner and then rotate back to this super smelling...super moisturizing condition. After the deep conditioner I roller set and wrap and spray a little oil sheen and immediately wrap my hair up. When I unwrap my hair its straight shiny and bouncy! I still relax my hair every 6-8 weeks and only clip my ends every other relaxer. My hair is sooo healthy and its growing long! When my hair begins to develop a lot of new growth...that&#x27;s when I will wear half wigs and I will moisturize and braid my hair down the back in one cornrow leaving some hair out in the front for blending and rock my half wig...sometimes I will also do a pony tail but I never use gel to slick my hair back only products like jam. I promise you I am so happy my hair is begininning to look like it did when I was 20 years old! I know I didnt start seeing the difference until I started incorporating this product into my healthy hair routine!</li>
    <li> I have been using ORS products for a number of years now. I have never stuck to one routine, which is why I have not been able to maximize the full potential of the ORS line. A year ago I decided to stick to the Olive oil products and just pay attention to what my hair has been telling me for years. I have relaxed hair. I wear weaves, braids and roller sets. In October I cut my hair to get rid of split ends and any other damaged pieces. The Olive oil shampoo and replinishing conditioners have been wonderful for my hair. I recently seen a review on Amazon about the new (new to me anyway) ORS Hairepair line. I went to the local supply store and bought the norishing conditioner, anti breakage creme, intense moisture creme and the sheen spray. I must say the norishing conditioner has made my hair feel amazing! I intend to purchase the invigorating shampoo. I will continue to use the olive oil shampoo as well. My hair has always been dry and somewhat hard to manage. I hope the HaiRepair line continues to WOW me. The intense moisture creme did weigh my hair down a little but that was due to me applying too much. The directions say use a little and that is acurate. I sat under the dryer for 25 minutes with a cap on. I hope the norishing conditioner is available in a bottle soon like the replinishing conditioner eventually did. Great product keep up the good work ORS! I rated the product with 4 stars due to me only using it once.</li>
    <li> Not something I would recommend and definately not repurchase.  Did nothing for my hair.  I have tried other products from ORS and wasn&#x27;t that thrilled.</li>
    <li> This hair repair treatment and my hair fell in love at first application.... The smell smells so yum yum.... After doing my hair rinse it helped me a lot giving my hair the proper nutrition it needed  to be successful....</li>
    <li> Worked really well on my new hair color treatment.  Left it soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not sure what happened.  i really loved it when i first started using this, now, it does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;it might just be my hair though, same thing happened with hairveda moist condition, so...</li>
    <li> This is a NEW staple in my long relaxed hair journey. I purchased in OCT, so I&#x27;ve been using for a while now.  I use this once a week, it leaves my hair silky, with so much slip! And tangle free! My fingers and comb glides right thru my hair with ease. I&#x27;m referring to my 4c 10 weeks post relaxed hair too! I recommend it. I can&#x27;t wait until its in a bottle. I have to use 1 and half of the small packs.</li>
    <li> Absolutely AWFUL -&lt;br /&gt;I am growing out my hair to donate, so I am constantly looking for conditioning treatments to keep my hair as healthy as possible. This one is NOT it - I followed the directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; - the result?!?! It left a thick, sticky, waxy build-up in my hair... that&#x27;s it... one week later, I&#x27;m still trying to wash the stuff out!! To make matters worse - it has an awful, fake-banana smell that doesn&#x27;t quit... NEVER never never again... ugh... so glad I only bought one treatment pouch!</li>
