      <li>We are pleased with this purchase that also arrive soon after the order was placed.</li>
      <li>I love love this massage cream.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many creams in my 20 plus years of integrating mind, body and soul work.</li>
      <li>Also I love that it is vegan.</li>
      <li>My clients don&#x27;t feel greasy after and love the organic ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>Most of my clients prefer it over any oil.</li>
      <li>New packing would be great for ease of use without opening jar but love the product.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect cream for those dry areas...</li>
      <li>glides easily without being slippery and has no scent of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The cream is vegan, easy to absorb, does not have harmful ingredients.</li>
      <li>Add in that it&#x27;s vegan, hypoallergenic, paraben and nut free, with healing herbs and scent free, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
      <li>This quickly became my favorite massage lubricant, but I didn&#x27;t want to switch from the pump to a jar to take advantage of the bulk pricing.</li>
      <li>I tried a number of cremes--many are more like lotions and absorb too quickly.</li>
      <li>It is GREAT for deep tissue as well as Swedish type massages.  </li>
      <li>and it is fragrance free.</li>
      <li>I really like it because it is gluten free, so it is safe for me to use without me breaking out in a &amp;#34;gluten rash&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Not too greasy good slide for deep work</li>
      <li>LOVE this cream so much, that I pay out of my pocket to use it at the spa I work in.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely and very emiolient massage cream.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled to have found a great substitute for my previous cream at a far better price and quite frankly, a far better product.  </li>
      <li>However, Sacred Earth sells this creme in a 21 oz \\&quot;super pump\\</li>
      <li>Completely unscented, fabulous glide and traction, doesn&#x27;t cause my cuticles to split the way most creams do (including Biotone</li>
      <li>My mother, sister and I have enjoyed this very smooth and soothing dry skin cream.  </li>
      <li>In my 10+ years as a massage professional, I have not found anything better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a professional massage therapist and absolutely love this</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t worth saving money....</li>
      <li>&quot; that is amazingly powerful and reliable.</li>
      <li>I always use it for delicate older skin, the best I&#x27;ve found for senior massage as it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
      <li>At my massage school I was taught to combine oil and lotion, adjusting amounts of each to get the right \\&quot;glide\\&quot; for each situation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and of course and there are several I use depending on the clients needs, but this is the one I use the most by far.</li>
      <li>I have not used this cream very much yet</li>
      <li>Nurturing to client&#x27;s skin, works in quickly, but lubricating enough upon first contact with skin, so the therapist can perform a  few great effleurage swipes, and end with deeper, clinical soft tissue work, which requires more friction than glide.</li>
      <li>It is nearly fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>I love it for deep tissue and Swedish both.</li>
      <li>It felt OK only.  </li>
      <li>Company is aware of the problem.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and love this product</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time.....</li>
      <li>Well, everyone was so positive on Sacred Earth</li>
      <li>The feel is silky, yet strong and lasting, if that makes sense.  </li>
      <li>Unscented, and gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>Also, fragrance free so nothing about it interferes with the essential oils I use during massage.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating massage cream.</li>
      <li>recommend it highly!</li>
      <li>but you need special skills to open it to refill.  </li>
      <li>love this stuff, we use it for dry skin, it is not greasy, but makes your skin feel oh so soft.</li>
      <li>so you didn&#x27;t have to keep reaching for a bottle, it was not runny or oily but stayed much better, hence, used less product, for a massage.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to ALL tree nuts, which it is very hard to find good product for your body that does not contain any but products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>The smell is minimal, which is a huge plus for me and my clients.  </li>
      <li>This massage cream has a nice glide, you only have to use a little bit</li>
      <li>It is not good for deeper work but is great for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I filled up my massage bottles but as the cream gets half way</li>
      <li>Leaves my clients soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>None, in my professional opinion, has compared to the purity and consistency.</li>
      <li>And I was TIRED of making my own.</li>
      <li>The company that I had been purchasing my Amber Cream from upped the price and shipping charges so high that I finally had to force myself to try a different brand.  </li>
      <li>Have noticed a big change in my skin, so soft.</li>
      <li>As far as massage lotions and creams go, Sacred Earth is the only one I will buy.</li>
      <li>I have chemical sensitivities and was unable to find ANYTHING out there that I could use unless I made my own.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super lightweight, non greasy, unscented and a little goes a long way.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really love this product.  It was introduced to me in massage school and now I can&#x27;t practice without it.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely and very emiolient massage cream. It is not good for deeper work but is great for very dry skin. I use this cream as a moisturizer for myself as well as for relaxation massage at work. It is relatively very expensive but because of its richness, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I learned on Sacred Earth Massage Cream at National Holistic Institute from a teacher using it for a Swedish demo.  I loved that it stayed put on your arm so you didn&#x27;t have to keep reaching for a bottle, it was not runny or oily but stayed much better, hence, used less product, for a massage.  New packing would be great for ease of use without opening jar but love the product.</li>
    <li> I love SEB cream!  Great glide, comes out of sheets nicely, and has a pleasant, natural aroma.  In my 10+ years as a massage professional, I have not found anything better.</li>
    <li> My mother, sister and I have enjoyed this very smooth and soothing dry skin cream.  It has a very subtle and pleasing smell without affecting our allergies.  We are pleased with this purchase that also arrive soon after the order was placed.</li>
    <li> This cream suits my needs.  It is nearly fragrance free.  It soaks in nicely and does not stain clothing.  I have purchased it before, and use it often.</li>
    <li> I Love this massage cream. We used it while in School (I think the instructor &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; it with some type of oil, but I don&#x27;t) I really like it because it is gluten free, so it is safe for me to use without me breaking out in a &amp;#34;gluten rash&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using the same massage lotion, Amber Green Tea and Mint, for 10 years now.  In my mind there was nothing comparable to it, until I was forced to try Sacred Earth Massage Cream.  The company that I had been purchasing my Amber Cream from upped the price and shipping charges so high that I finally had to force myself to try a different brand.  After making the agonizing decision to switch I headed off to Amazon to check out the reviews of all the creams.  Well, everyone was so positive on Sacred Earth I couldn&#x27;t help but give this one a try.  I am so HAPPY that I did.  This cream glides perfectly for my deep tissue massages, lasts forever and does NOT leave any sticky or oily feeling on my clients skin.  The smell is minimal, which is a huge plus for me and my clients.  The feel is silky, yet strong and lasting, if that makes sense.  I am thrilled to have found a great substitute for my previous cream at a far better price and quite frankly, a far better product.  Please try this if you are hesitant like I was.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My son is a massage therapist and claims this is the best lotion.</li>
    <li> I opened the enormous jar, appled it to my painful legs and massaged them.  It felt OK only.  I&#x27;ll try it again and if it&#x27;s better than 3 stars, I will improve this review.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the deal. Everything was good.</li>
    <li> I love love this massage cream.  It is GREAT for deep tissue as well as Swedish type massages.  A little goes a long way.  My clients don&#x27;t feel greasy after and love the organic ingredients.</li>
    <li> I loved this massage cream. Its not oily and the grip is perfect. Also I love that it is vegan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional massage therapist and absolutely love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;It glides easily without being slippery and has no scent of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> This massage cream has a nice glide, you only have to use a little bit and it is fragrance free. I will get this again for my business</li>
    <li> This is my number one choice when it comes to giving a massage as a massage therapist.  The cream is vegan, easy to absorb, does not have harmful ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect cream for those dry areas... Hands, elbows, feet...  Our daughter loves using this cream in her nightly routine!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Sacred Earth Massage CREAM!  I have chemical sensitivities and was unable to find ANYTHING out there that I could use unless I made my own.  And I was TIRED of making my own. So I searched and searched.  All the searching paid off with Sacred Earth Massage Cream!&lt;br /&gt;Unscented, Vegan.  Great for my health and the health of my Clients.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this cream so much, that I pay out of my pocket to use it at the spa I work in.  It has great glide, doesn&#x27;t make anyone oily or sticky.  Leaves my clients soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping and I cannot speak highly enough of the Sacred earth massage cream. Nurturing to client&#x27;s skin, works in quickly, but lubricating enough upon first contact with skin, so the therapist can perform a  few great effleurage swipes, and end with deeper, clinical soft tissue work, which requires more friction than glide. 5 Stars. Great seller!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s vegan and safe but it&#x27;s real thick.  I filled up my massage bottles but as the cream gets half way it is so hard to squeeze creame out without shaking the bottle so that the cream can roll down to the tip.  I recommend a bottle with a pump</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just the best cream I have ever used.  I highly recommend this product.  I find it non-greasy and absorbs well into the skin. A little bit goes a long way.  Love it!</li>
    <li> The cream absorbs into the skin nicely, without a greasy feeling. I use it daily and love this product Have noticed a big change in my skin, so soft.</li>
    <li> I have not used this cream very much yet but when I have I have enjoyed it and so have my clients.</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time.....I loved it.....Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t reorder it when I needed more, due to finances...I picked a different product that melted off my arm and fell onto client....wasn&#x27;t worth saving money....I am going to reorder this now....and never choose any other product for a cream.</li>
    <li> At my massage school I was taught to combine oil and lotion, adjusting amounts of each to get the right \\&quot;glide\\&quot; for each situation. I didn&#x27;t really care for the messy process or the outcome. I tried a number of cremes--many are more like lotions and absorb too quickly. Not this one. It&#x27;s so thick that it can&#x27;t be dispensed with a normal pump. However, Sacred Earth sells this creme in a 21 oz \\&quot;super pump\\&quot; that is amazingly powerful and reliable. This quickly became my favorite massage lubricant, but I didn&#x27;t want to switch from the pump to a jar to take advantage of the bulk pricing. A person behind the counter at a now-defunct massage supply store told me that the pumps can be opened and refilled, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use a couple of lighter Sacred Earth lotions for hands, feet, and faces, but this is my go-to product and I&#x27;m happy to be able to buy it in the bulk format.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating massage cream. Lots of slip for deep tissue massage.</li>
    <li> My go-to massage cream.  Thick, so a small amount lasts a long time.  Unscented, and gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many creams in my 20 plus years of integrating mind, body and soul work. None, in my professional opinion, has compared to the purity and consistency.</li>
    <li> Completely unscented, fabulous glide and traction, doesn&#x27;t cause my cuticles to split the way most creams do (including Biotone dual purpose)...&lt;br /&gt;Lasts well.  Beware the refillable pump - great machine but you need special skills to open it to refill.  Company is aware of the problem.</li>
    <li> Very good product. No lasting smell. Very easy to work with.  Caution for anyone purchasing this product.... a little goes a LONG way. I have found that I need to use very little of the product as compared to other creams. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star product is it leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> One of the best massage creams I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over two years in my practice. It&#x27;s super lightweight, non greasy, unscented and a little goes a long way. Most of my clients prefer it over any oil. Love it!</li>
    <li> love this stuff, we use it for dry skin, it is not greasy, but makes your skin feel oh so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products and of course and there are several I use depending on the clients needs, but this is the one I use the most by far. I love it for deep tissue and Swedish both. It has great smooth glide and yet works nicely for deeper work. I always use it for delicate older skin, the best I&#x27;ve found for senior massage as it doesn&#x27;t get sticky. Add in that it&#x27;s vegan, hypoallergenic, paraben and nut free, with healing herbs and scent free, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> I use this as a body lotion. I am allergic to ALL tree nuts, which it is very hard to find good product for your body that does not contain any but products.</li>
    <li> Perfect cream! Not too greasy good slide for deep work</li>
    <li> As far as massage lotions and creams go, Sacred Earth is the only one I will buy. It has good glide and absorbs well into the skin. Also, fragrance free so nothing about it interferes with the essential oils I use during massage.</li>
