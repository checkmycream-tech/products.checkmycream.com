      <li>very much better.  </li>
      <li>However, for the money (~$6/tray), I&#x27;d hope for a tray that could conform to my teeth better.  </li>
      <li>I just purchased the 20% pf gel and am hoping for better results with that % and the custom trays I had fitted years ago.&lt;br</li>

      <li>The trays didn&#x27;t fit as well as the tray I had ordered from the dealer.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product for the price.  </li>
      <li>I was excited about this product because the trays are prefilled so I bought it.  </li>

      <li>clearly states that the item must stay refrigerated and then allowed to warm to room temp before use.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d estimate that my teeth lightened about 1 full shade after using the 10 trays.  </li>
      <li>- it lightened my teeth about 1 full shade.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The very first time I used the tray, I had SEVERE pain in one of my teeth.  </li>
      <li>If you want nice, bright white/celebrity white teeth, then look no further, this product is for you.</li>
      <li>Just be careful when you use it the first time and make very very sure you don&#x27;t bleach your gums as well as your teeth!</li>
      <li>Easy to use and so much cheaper than what you&#x27;d have to do at your DDS.  </li>
      <li>I used my fingers to smooth the inner tray on my teeth to make sure I get the maximum coverage</li>
      <li>Does not leave teeth sensitive, easy to use trays ...</li>
      <li>Very fast.</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to this product by a rep from ultradent which is the company</li>
      <li>I have used Opalescence numerous times and have been pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Overall I thought it was just OK</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve now switched to Go for my occasional, touchup teeth-whitening and am confident in recommending it to others.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this unless you don&#x27;t mind your gums burning to a crisp.</li>
      <li>I had pretty severe gum irritation for the first 4 or so times</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase more in the future.</li>
      <li>the tray was MUCH too big in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, \\&quot;sucking in\\&quot; the tray causes the gel to push up onto your gums even more than leaving it alone.  </li>
      <li>I am getting a crown on a front tooth next week and want to ask if it&#x27;s a good idea to keep a box of these trays and use one or two a year to maintain my current shade.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this product I bought it from my dentist and paid 3 times as much as what I paid on Amazon.</li>
      <li>If this is the real deal then someone bought a bunch from their dentist and is reselling them or they are a knock off.  </li>
      <li>Rep said they are only available for sale thru a dental office.</li>
      <li>So much cheaper here through Amazon.  </li>
      <li>Really works for whitening your teeth.  </li>
      <li>thus making brushing very pauinful</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The burning pain was so intense.  </li>
      <li>particular product is unique because unlike the traditional systems where you would need syringes and custom made trays at $250, this system comes with pre-filled plastic film that sits within a tray to help you apply the film to your teeth.</li>
      <li>I was not sure how effective this was going to be having experienced several disappointments in the past.  </li>
      <li>I used it for 13 nights (1 1/3 boxes - only 10 in a full box) and my teeth do look whiter than before</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
      <li>The first application produced noticeable whitening, and it got a little better for the next couple of uses.  </li>
      <li>I have very proportionate and straight teeth, so I&#x27;d imagine that if I had a problem, someone whose teeth aren&#x27;t that straight would have a harder time getting the tray to sit well and whiten evenly.  </li>
      <li>There was no pain or gum bleaching after the first application, no sore spots that hurt when I brushed my teeth after a couple days.</li>
      <li>recently removed the first application and noticed some whitening of the gums that has persisted 30 minutes after removal of the product.</li>
      <li>I noticed a big difference just on the first application.</li>
      <li>Not only is the product&#x27;s delivery system improved, but this 15% works much faster and seems to resist new stains (coffee!)</li>
      <li>I like the outer-and-inner tray system they use; you pop the whole thing in your mouth and suck to get the inner tray to adhere, then toss out the outer tray.</li>
      <li>Thank you, Amazon, for having the same product for a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I think I developed a tolerance to it, as when I got to trays 7-10, I could whiten on consecutive days with no</li>
      <li>so far i&#x27;ve done two treatments of it.</li>
      <li>MAKES GUMS TOO SENSITIVE.  </li>
      <li>I think by doing this I may have discharged the whitening gel directly onto my gums which caused the burning and gum whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My dentist&#x27;s office recommended it because I have crowns and a wide smile</li>
      <li>white - Dentist charged 3 times this price for the exact same thing.</li>
      <li>the only thing I would recommend is to make sure you have a current dental exam and no outstanding work needed at whitening can aggrevates existing issues.</li>
      <li>I used it five times, but I&#x27;m not sure the last two made much difference,  The directions are not very specific,but they are still easy to follow.  </li>
      <li>This is pharmaceutical grade whitening, and generally a product you have to get at a dentist.</li>
      <li>I could barely brush my teeth</li>
      <li>they are now very sensitive, even to warm and cold drinks</li>
      <li>However, there are a few distributors on Amazon who sell this directly to the public, so makes it much easier to purchase, rather than going into a dentist to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a pretty heavy coffee drinker</li>
      <li>Had a little sensitivity, but went away fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was first introduced to this product by a rep from ultradent which is the company the supplies these whitening kits to dental offices. I am a dental office manager and he gave me 3 sets of trays to use as a trial. I noticed such a difference in the shade of my teeth after just 3 uses! I love this product the only thing I would recommend is to make sure you have a current dental exam and no outstanding work needed at whitening can aggrevates existing issues.</li>
    <li> Work like magic in one or two applications! Does not leave teeth sensitive, easy to use trays ... best over the counter system yet.</li>
    <li> clearly states that the item must stay refrigerated and then allowed to warm to room temp before use. Product does not work otherwise. The items shipped from here come in regular mail and ruin the gel so it does not work.</li>
    <li> Whitens teeth without sensitivity.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> Great product &amp; easy to use.</li>
    <li> Good results but burns</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product and the results.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product!  I bought this product from the dentist&#x27;s office and it cost me$70.00. Thank you, Amazon, for having the same product for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Bought it for the wife. Will continue to buy for both of us.  I snuck two treatments for myself and couldn&#x27;t believe the results.&lt;br /&gt;Home Run.&lt;br /&gt;Yes Buy this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Made my teeth whiter than they ever have been.  Had a little sensitivity, but went away fast.</li>
    <li> It is very effective and it does what it is suppose to do!</li>
    <li> Did an excellent job. Will definitely use again when needed.  Did make my gums a little sensitive, but that dissipated after a few days.</li>
    <li> Opalescence&#x27;s &amp;#34;Go&amp;#34; is, indeed, an improvement to the Treswhte.  Not only is the product&#x27;s delivery system improved, but this 15% works much faster and seems to resist new stains (coffee!) very much better.  I&#x27;ve now switched to Go for my occasional, touchup teeth-whitening and am confident in recommending it to others.  (Please note:  Go is made to be used for 30 or so minutes, because over-extending the treatment time WILL result in burnt gum tissue.)</li>
    <li> FIND I CANNOT USE 5 DAYS IN A ROW.  MAKES GUMS TOO SENSITIVE.  WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND.  ALSO, DO YOU MAKE A STRONGER GEL FOR A ONE TIME USE ONLY?  PS  WONDERFULLY EASY INSTEAD OF FOOLING WITH PERMANENT TRAYS.  WHAT DO DENTISTS CHARGE FOR A PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT THROUGH THEIR OFFICE OR AS A TREATMENT PROCEDURE??</li>
    <li> I purchased Opalescence Go 15% via my dentist and just completed my 10th tray this evening.  Overall I thought it was just OK - it lightened my teeth about 1 full shade. I just purchased the 20% pf gel and am hoping for better results with that % and the custom trays I had fitted years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used the tray, I had SEVERE pain in one of my teeth.  I wondered if my dentist missed an open cavity and had to call the dentists&#x27; office.  They told me that the tooth in question probably had lost some dentin on the top of the tooth, resulting in the pain.  I did continue whitening, and it did not happen on subsequent whitening sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trays are alright - they aren&#x27;t as \\&quot;form fitting\\&quot; to my teeth as I would have thought.  I imagined it would have been some sort of tighter foam that molds to your teeth, but it isn&#x27;t that at all - they&#x27;re flimsy plastic-type trays.  You&#x27;re supposed to suck in to ensure the product moves up from the bottom of the tray and adheres to your teeth, and if it doesn&#x27;t tap/gently push down.  The problem with that is that if you push down in one area, the tray will gap in another.  I have very proportionate and straight teeth, so I&#x27;d imagine that if I had a problem, someone whose teeth aren&#x27;t that straight would have a harder time getting the tray to sit well and whiten evenly.  I had the most problem with my bottom teeth - the tray was MUCH too big in the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, \\&quot;sucking in\\&quot; the tray causes the gel to push up onto your gums even more than leaving it alone.  I had pretty severe gum irritation for the first 4 or so times I used it - my gums turned white between my teeth, and then the tissue peeled off (painful and unsightly if you got close enough to look).  I ended up waiting 2-3 days between whitening to alleviate this. I think I developed a tolerance to it, as when I got to trays 7-10, I could whiten on consecutive days with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it&#x27;s just an OK product.  I&#x27;m a pretty heavy coffee drinker and I&#x27;d estimate that my teeth lightened about 1 full shade after using the 10 trays.  However, for the money (~$6/tray), I&#x27;d hope for a tray that could conform to my teeth better.  My recommendation would be as other reviewers have stated on other Opalescence reviews - have your dentist make a custom tray for you and then buy gel via a syringe.etty heavy coffee drinker and I&#x27;d estimate that my teeth lightened about 1 full shade after using the 10 trays.

    <li> I met with the rep from Ultradent and was told that NONE of their products are ever sold online.  If this is the real deal then someone bought a bunch from their dentist and is reselling them or they are a knock off.  Rep said they are only available for sale thru a dental office. Buyer beware.  *** If you are buying it thru your dentist then I would give this a 4 star for effectiveness and ease of use.</li>
    <li> I was not sure how effective this was going to be having experienced several disappointments in the past.  Fantastic product for the price.  I will certainly purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my dentist.  Within three minutes my gum started burning, after 10 minutes I had to take them out.  The burning pain was so intense.  My lower gums were bleached white and started to bleed in 10 minutes from this product.  I will go back to using crest whitening strips.</li>
    <li> Sorry but store brand from Walmart is better design and cheaper. Results pending.</li>
    <li> The trays didn&#x27;t fit as well as the tray I had ordered from the dealer. I am wondering if they were sold as knock-offs.</li>
    <li> CAme in about 3 days. Very fast. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This did a great job on my teeth.  Yes, it can be a little uncomfortable, and your gums will get a little tender.  What I did was use them for 3-4 nights then rested a day or two and then continued on another 3-4 days, rested and then finished up the box.  My teeth were noticeably whiter and it lasted well over a year.  I now get them to keep just to refresh my teeth once every 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I got these from my dentist. I am only doing 5 of them. so far i&#x27;ve done two treatments of it. my teeth do look whiter but holy crap do my gums sting and in spots i had white gums which are now raw. thus making brushing very pauinful i think i will be finishing the last three up a few days apart</li>
    <li> After my whitening treatment at the dentist&#x27;s office this morning failed (it was a uni-tray and the way my teeth sit, there was not enough coverage to whiten properly), I was given a box of these Go! 15% pre-loaded whitening trays as an alternative. I am using the first one now, and I do feel the burning sensation on my gums as others have mentioned, and some moderate random tooth pain (my teeth are sensitive). I like the outer-and-inner tray system they use; you pop the whole thing in your mouth and suck to get the inner tray to adhere, then toss out the outer tray. I used my fingers to smooth the inner tray on my teeth to make sure I get the maximum coverage (Warning! I think by doing this I may have discharged the whitening gel directly onto my gums which caused the burning and gum whitening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently removed the first application and noticed some whitening of the gums that has persisted 30 minutes after removal of the product. Overall sensitivity has increased drastically, including one spot that was so sore I almost couldn&#x27;t brush my teeth. I am hoping these immediate results are temporary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after completing the whitening process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist noticed that my teeth had lightened up a bit (a shade or so he said), though I don&#x27;t have any before/after pictures to share. The very first time I used the tray, as I said above, was very painful and I damaged my gums. I waited a few days before I used another tray. There was no pain or gum bleaching after the first application, no sore spots that hurt when I brushed my teeth after a couple days. I am getting a crown on a front tooth next week and want to ask if it&#x27;s a good idea to keep a box of these trays and use one or two a year to maintain my current shade. Would use again for sure if I wasn&#x27;t having dental work done so soon! Just be careful when you use it the first time and make very very sure you don&#x27;t bleach your gums as well as your teeth!</li>
    <li> Not as expected. Whitening Strips work just as well.</li>
    <li> Bye bye stained teeth</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you don&#x27;t mind your gums burning to a crisp. The trays cover not only your teeth but also the gums causing terrible pain on the gum tissue afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> These trays turned my gums white and even made them bleed at times. I tried taking a break from them as someone recommended and that seemed to help heal my gums a little. I could barely brush my teeth my gums hurt so bad. Good thing about the product, I did notice my teeth to whiten noticeably but was a painful process getting them there.  My friend used the Peach version and it was10% and had no problems.</li>
    <li> I was definitely pleased with the results this product produced. The first application produced noticeable whitening, and it got a little better for the next couple of uses.  I used it five times, but I&#x27;m not sure the last two made much difference,  The directions are not very specific,but they are still easy to follow.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  It does say on the box that it does not work on everyone.  I used it as prescribed on my upper teeth only, leaving my lower teeth untreated.  Afterwards, no one could tell which teeth I had used the product on.</li>
    <li> Really works for whitening your teeth.  Was recommended by son&#x27;s orthodontist.  So much cheaper here through Amazon.  Have purchased this whitening system twice now.  Easy to use and so much cheaper than what you&#x27;d have to do at your DDS.  By a huge amount.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my husband and they&#x27;re easy to use, do not taste bad and his teeth are whiter every time he uses them.  I will buy these again.</li>
    <li> My dentist reommended these and they work great. Sometimes they make my teeth s little sensitive and even leave little white spots on my gums, but that&#x27;s very temporary (like half an hour). I made the mistake of paying $100 at my dentist&#x27;s office for these twice before checking Amazon. I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li> I have to use it at least once a month to keep teeth white - Dentist charged 3 times this price for the exact same thing.</li>
    <li> Meh. It&#x27;s ok. Not as strong as I expected.</li>
    <li> Been using for about a month maybe once or twice a week.  Depends.  My husband said he could see a difference in the shade of white.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product because the trays are prefilled so I bought it.  The instructions says leave in trays 15-20 mins. After 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;I felt burning on my teeth and gums.  I removed the trays after about 15 mins. my teeth looked whiter so I tried for two more days using the product for 15 mins each application, again there was burning.  I have noticed brushing my teeth they are now very sensitive, even to warm and cold drinks&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed my teeth are sensitive which I have NEVER EXPERIENCED.</li>
    <li> I havent tried Treswhite Supreme.  The Opalescence Go works great!</li>
    <li> I have never used a teeth whitening product other than toothpaste before so I have no means of comparison.  My dentist&#x27;s office recommended it because I have crowns and a wide smile and she said that the whitening process would be gradual, which it was in my case.  I used it for 13 nights (1 1/3 boxes - only 10 in a full box) and my teeth do look whiter than before and my crowns are not a different shade, at least not to the naked eye.  I am satisfied with the outcome.  Wearing lipstick does not give my teeth a brown tinge anymore since using this product.  I was told to use for 20-30 minutes for 3 nights in a row after 3 months to restore from any staining.  I drink coffee daily and an occasional glass of wine.  I purchases an extra box of 10 so we&#x27;ll see if 3 nightly treatments will be enough to restore my teeth to what initially took 13 treatments.</li>
    <li> Wife and I both used this product- no results seen after several uses. 2 stars only for the amazon price, which is lower than dentist</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product I bought it from my dentist and paid 3 times as much as what I paid on Amazon. I noticed a big difference just on the first application. You do have to be careful that the product doesn&#x27;t touch your gums. I see some people have had problems but I have not. I would recommend this too everyone that still has their own teeth.</li>
    <li> Opalescence is on the top of my list when it comes to products for whitening your teeth. This is pharmaceutical grade whitening, and generally a product you have to get at a dentist. However, there are a few distributors on Amazon who sell this directly to the public, so makes it much easier to purchase, rather than going into a dentist to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is unique because unlike the traditional systems where you would need syringes and custom made trays at $250, this system comes with pre-filled plastic film that sits within a tray to help you apply the film to your teeth. Now, you might that this could be messy to use, but it&#x27;s actually not at all. We&#x27;ve all had bad experiences with trying to apply Crest Whitestrips, and I assure you, this is nothing like that at all. The film applies neatly and evenly to your teeth, and in such a way that the peroxide is applied to your teeth and not your gums. It works beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the whitening is amazing. If you want nice, bright white/celebrity white teeth, then look no further, this product is for you. I&#x27;m on my 5th box over the course of few years. I use them regularly to maintain my white teeth.</li>
    <li> i think 10% would be best.... these made my gums hurt and sensitive... :(</li>
    <li> I purchase the same product from my dentist, yet the cost was was a lot less from Amazon.  I will purchase future whiting trays on line.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Immediately noticeable.</li>
    <li> Excellent teeth whitener-----very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have used Opalescence numerous times and have been pleased with the results. My gums are not super-sensitive so I don&#x27;t notice the uncomfortable side affects that others have mentioned. It is best to keep the Opalescence box in the refrigerator until all of the whitener trays have been used. The Opalescence whitener is now my go-to whitener.</li>
