<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the Bentonite Clay. I have normal to dry skin so I don&#x27;t use it as often. Probably once to twice a month during my &amp;#34;sensitive/problematic&amp;#34; skin time before my period. I mixed it in with a little bit of Apple Cider Vinegar to dissolve the clay into a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34;, and apply a thin layer that&#x27;s just enough to cover my face for a deep cleansing. After the clay dries out, I could notice a clearer complexion and my pores would shrink. If I remember to do it before my monthly breakout, I could actually notice a difference!! Remember to moisturize up after the mask if you have dry skin! This s a great alternative to the super expensive glamglow.</li>
    <li> Worked great, pulled all the underlying dirt out of my skin, my skin did break out after use but it was purging all the built up bacteria.</li>
    <li> Feels great using it as a mask. Not sure how much it&#x27;s doing right now. Maybe will post more later.</li>
    <li> This works great. As soon as I put it on, I could feel it drying, &amp; pulling toxins out of my skin.</li>
    <li> This product arrived well packaged, along with an incredibly full inside! Sometimes beauty products that include liquids or powders seem to be missing product ha. I haven&#x27;t always used face masks, but this one is awesome! The directions of how to mix the mask are clear and easy to follow, with a great ending result. My face feels so fresh and clean after every time I use this product. I would definitely recommend the purchase, y&#x27;all will like it!</li>
    <li> Good treatment weekly.  Leaves skin soft.  Somewhat messy to mix and use.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much! Talk about a great facial mask. My face feels so refreshed after using this. It&#x27;s a must get product.</li>
    <li> I love the Bentonite Clay for detox purposes. I have used it in the past and am a true believer in it.  My favorite use though is using it as a facial mask.  I have pretty sensitive skin and break out often.  The Bentonite clay helps clear up my break outs and leaves my skin feeling refreshed!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t love the product. Haven&#x27;t used it that much to see the actual results. However, I can say it&#x27;s soooooooo messy. I don&#x27;t love using it and prepping everything.</li>
    <li> I really like this mask. I&#x27;ve tried many store brand masks but never FEEL anything besides it drying. I can actually feel my face pulsing as it&#x27;s drying. My face feels cleaner when I am done. I used apple cider vinegar instead of water. I little powder goes a long way and I think it will be a while before I need to buy another mask. I won&#x27;t give this 5 stars till I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and see results it promises to give.</li>
    <li> I was very reluctant about trying out the Bentonite Clay. I received this and when opened it looked like a big jar of dirt lol! Boy was I wrong! I have tried the clay a couple of different ways as I will explain further. I am heading to Florida in a couple of days so I have been using the Bentonite Clay trying to fix my winter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have taken a couple of baths with the Bentonite Clay and water plus adding 1 cup of apple cider vinegar which the instructions allow. My skin loves this clay and it&#x27;s not gritty like some cleaners. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use some cleaners or lotions. The clay doesn&#x27;t have a smell and that&#x27;s fine with me. I also have very oily hair and washed my hair in the water with the clay and it totally cleaned my hair from the roots. My daughter and I have done the masks together although we look crazy it was very invigorating. I look forward to continue to use my clay and I will be buying more! Hope to see more results the more I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are tons of uses for the Bentonite clay. You can injest it for nausea, vomiting, morning sickness(check with your dr first).  Great to use as baby powder, oral rinse, eczema, burns, cuts, and stings. Can&#x27;t wait for summer to see what else we can use this clay for! I was able to buy this at a discount during a promotion and am happy to share my experience</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that helped with my skin issues! Loved the quick shipping!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of bentonite clay in beauty recipes.  The first thing I noticed about this clay is how smooth it is.  There is no gritty feel at all when it is mixed with water.  I am so please with this product!  I used it for a facial mask, this bentonite clay will be my go to clay from now one.  I love the texture!</li>
    <li> It is a great product.  I love the feel of my skin after I use it.  Made a great girls night addition.  I will need to keep playing with it to get the correct mixture, but I love that it gave me manufacture and use by dates.  Great size for the price!</li>
    <li> Great mask and cleanser.  Love that it is all natural. I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. This gave me NO trouble. Skin felt so very soft after. I have used on elbows and heels to soften them.</li>
    <li> Love love love this clay. Amazing how it feels on the skin and it makes my skin look so amazing afterwards.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love this Clay. I use it in my bathwater and I use it for a facial mask as well. This is been an absolutely wonderful Clay!! I will purchase again when I run out!</li>
    <li> I didnt have a great experience with this mask. It made my face red, and itchy and took forever to wash off. Im not sure if i used it right, but it definitely wasnt what i imagined. Also a powder, and went all over the place when i first opened it.</li>
    <li> Wow! This product made my skin so smooth and flawless, I will definitely be getting more when this runs out, but that may take a while as it&#x27;s in powder form. Ordered another for my best friend I loved so much! Order was received/delivered on time! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Mixes easily and feels very refreshing when first applied. I should have recorded myself as I&#x27;m sure it was hilarious. It began to tighten and I could feel my face tingling, it felt like it was sucking my face off lol. It washed off easily &amp; left my skin feeling completely clean &amp; detoxed. My face was really red for just over an hour but I hear that is normal. I will be using this clay on a regular basis now. I love the results.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. It makes my skin feel so good and refreshed after I use it.  Can be a little messy, do it around a shower time and not just washing up at the sink</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very soft...</li>
    <li> Pretty cool. I love this stuff. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be powder but it was. So be careful opening it. But other than that it&#x27;s a great mask. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the bath yet. But the mask does it for me. Left me feeling refreshed</li>
    <li> Love the way it feels. Works great!</li>
    <li> this is such a great mask, and the powder will last forever! so happy with this purchase my face feels so clean</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! I can feel my skin tightening and firming up from the second I put it on. Leaves your face silky smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> This is a really good clay mask that I use to keep my face so smooth. It comfortable on my face when it dry it&#x27;s my like those mask that tighten up and hurt. I&#x27;ve rarely had any acne outbreaks since using my Indian clay mask so highly recommend this to anyone having an acne problem that needs to clear up.</li>
    <li> This is a powdered product that you can mix to produce a mask of the consistency you want.  The first time I mixed it, I used entirely too much and had quite a bit left over.  I was surprised at how big a pound of this stuff actually is.  A pound of this clay will last a long time, and is quite a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying and letting dry, instantly I felt my skin get tighter.  My skin was smoother for the next few days.  This clay is very drying, and would be ideal for people with oily skin.  It&#x27;s a much more pure product than many cosmetics out there.</li>
    <li> Pros: They give you a lot of powder in this jar. Cons: it&#x27;s very messy &amp; a pain in the butt to get the right consistency. I&#x27;ve tried twice and still can&#x27;t get it right. I will try again &amp; update any new news.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic! From the US, packed 5 days before I received it and it&#x27;s good for 5 years. Just add some water to make a mask that will leave your skin feeling great. It&#x27;s a big container so it will last for a good, long while.....but when that happens I&#x27;ll be buying some more!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, packaging is durable and I appreciated the manufacturing date as well as shelf life information. Did not come with any sort of mixing utensils. I used a coffee scoop from my kitchen drawer and mixed 1 part clay to 2 parts water in a simple kitchen bowl. Was more than needed for my mask. Mix was very clumpy and therefore difficult to spread on my face. Perhaps more water will help with this issue. I used my fingers to apply, but using a medicine stick might provide for a more even spread. Took approx. 10 minutes to completely cover my face and get to an even distribution. Waited for the noted average as listed in the container (about 10 minutes). Product does tingle on the skin as it dries and tightens the skin slightly. I did notice mild itching along the outer edges of my face - likely due to drying on the skin. Clean up was fairly messy. Thinner areas of the mask flake and while thicker portions peel off. I don&#x27;t recommend taking it off in your bathroom sink since the larger chunks of clay did clog my drain. Also be wary of jewelry - I had to scrub my rings because I didn&#x27;t think to take them off prior. Overall,  a decent product. Would have given it higher marks for more consistent blending and application and lack of scoop to mix the mask.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and she likes it. She says it&#x27;s a bit messy to use but made her feel like she just got a spa treatment on her face.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for her happiness with the product.</li>
    <li> Was a pretty good face mask. I use a lot of different face masks and all though I would call this one out of this world it did make my skin feel smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVED this clay!! It came exactly as pictured. Clay was a light gray color. I used it as a cleansing/detoxifying hair mask for myself and my daughter. Mixed with apple cider vinegar, the bentonite clay helped to get our hair clean, soft and shiny, and it helped to maintain moisture, which is highly important for natural hair.</li>
    <li> So this product comes as a powder that you have to mix yourself to make the clay mask. This I like as it makes the product last longer. It took some time to find the right ratio of powder to water to make the clay as there are no instructions on the container. I eventually found what works.  So I have used it a couple times and have left the mask on for 15-20 minutes at a time. I did notice that it made some of my blemishes less noticeable but I haven&#x27;t seen a HUGE improvement just yet.I guess only time will tell.</li>
    <li> This was my first time to use Indian Healing Clay. I&#x27;ve heard great things about it, but had just never given it a try because I was a little skeptical about how good it could be. When the opportunity arose to try this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest review, I ordered right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this on my face as well as in my bath since receiving it. I was able to follow the directions on the jar for use on my face, but wanted to do a little more research before putting it in my bath. I looked up the benefits and how you are supposed to mix it. I&#x27;m glad I did, because I might not have been as impressed as I was if I hadn&#x27;t researched it first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a facial, it feels like any mud mask when it&#x27;s on. I have very sensitive skin and Rosacea. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new products in an effort to perfect my beauty routine. This mask performed well, but did not blow me away. I had no redness or dryness afterwards. It&#x27;s easy to apply and pretty straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it in the bath is an entirely different story. As I said earlier, I&#x27;m glad I researched it first or I might have been disappointed. I found out that it&#x27;s easier to mix the clay before getting in the bath rather than dumping the powder in the bath water by itself. Basically, I mixed it with water in a bowl to make it the consistency of mud. I then rubbed it all over my body and got into the tub. It mixed very well with the water doing it this way and there were no clumps that didn&#x27;t mix. I stayed soaking in the bath for 20 minutes which was what I read was recommended. My skin was soft and smooth after getting out of the tub and I was feeling pretty relaxed. I then went to bed. After waking up, I discovered a few pimples (?) that I didn&#x27;t have before. I got right back on the internet to look this up. Apparently, it&#x27;s pretty common when you initially start to do this because it draws the toxins in the skin to the surface. I wasn&#x27;t really happy about the pimples, but I was excited about the toxins being released. The next day the pimples were almost gone. The day after, they were gone altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be continuing to use this product as part of my beauty routine.imples, but I was excited about the toxins being released.

    <li> Used in a homemade deodorant recipe and it works great!</li>
    <li> Although the product does what it says, the prep process is kind of messy.  I prefer a product that is ready to use.  I have to say that I didn&#x27;t read the &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; before buying it.</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. I have acne prone skin that is very sensitive to different formulas. This is gentle enough to Clean and minimize pores bUT tough on oil and dirt.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so soft and healthy. I dont know if it detoxified my face or not, but it certainly made is soft and lightened my acne scars. Cant wait to see what else it can do!</li>
    <li> GREAT GREAT GREAT mask, my face feels FANTASTIC after this, you mix some of the clay (powder form) with water to a paste and apply, leave on til it dries then was off. I havent used it any other way yet but i will</li>
    <li> I was not sure when I ordered this if it was going to work or not, but I love this stuff! It keeps my skin feeling like a baby!</li>
    <li> Amazing product, I have very sensitive skin and this product was perfect for me, it was effective but gentle enough for regular use. You can definitely feel the mask working when it is on (tingly, tightening sensation) and once removed your complexion looks a lot healthy, soft and vibrant.</li>
    <li> This Indian Healing Clay is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to find something natural and easy to use with gentle results. I have used it on my son for his eczema with a wonderful outcome. I also use this clay on my daughter who is starting hormonal changes.  Because of the different skin demands, I am really glad that I found this one product all our soothing, cleansing, detoxifying and revitalization needs. The fact that it is naturally charged with electromagnetic properties means it draws heavy metals, free radicals, and toxins from the surface of the skin, all while being gentle and soft for all of our skin types. I really like that it is guaranteed pure and clean. My son would tell me it wasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, you just mix one part clay to two parts water. I have also used fresh coconut milk to mix.. Makes it smell wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Then apply to your skin. I use it on my son on the insides of his elbows and knees as this is his biggest problem area. He is 4 and actually sits still for it to sooth and protect. He really likes the experience!&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on for 10 minutes or more. I keep it on my son for about 10 minutes then follow with a nice calming oil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this Indian Healing Clay is perfect. I have purchased other bentonite clays in the past and remember the price very steep. I am very impressed and will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this Indian Healing Clay soothes and heals cuts, bruises, rashes, blemishes, insect bites, and more makes this clay a very necessary product in our home. For me, the tightening and toning of my skin and the skin glow that comes with healthy, happy skin is just an added benefit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product guarantee means that this company stands behind its product because they believe in it. Now I am a believer too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bentonite clay provided by Ommm Health and Beauty Products&lt;br /&gt;review by She-ra</li>
    <li> I was so happy to be able to get this product during a promotion. My wife is a big fan of clay and she uses it all the time for her skin.  This one in particular is now her favorite.  She uses it every other day when in relax mode.  According to her it makes her skin feel fresh and new.  Definitely buying again.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a wet mask type product. It was actually a nice powder which allows you to mix with water as you wish so you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth on this product! So far so good!</li>
    <li> Great for reducing the size of your pores.</li>
    <li> I really love this product.  I have used it a couple of times now and it works great.  Even had my 13 year old son try it and it helped with his acne.</li>
    <li> I have used this clay as a face mask on myself, my son and my daughter.  I have not tried it in the bathtub as a soak, which is one of the uses available.  This tub arrives as powder, and does not have any recommended dosage for using.  I ended up just dumping a bit out into a bowl and adding water till it reached the consistentency that I desired.  It was definitely a trial and error process and I will say that a little bit of clay powder goes a LONG way.  I put enough in the bowl that I thought I&#x27;d have a mask for myself, and ended up being able to treat both kids, and still threw away about 2/3 of the product in the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the mask was applied I did notice an almost instant difference.  After washing off my skin felt softer and refreshed.  It also seemed &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; when looking in the mirror, maybe taking a few years off the aging process that lasted about 5-7 days after usage.  My son said the mask burned a bit while he was waiting to wash it off, but I didn&#x27;t feel that sensation and neither did my daughter.</li>
    <li> I like this product. I didn&#x27;t expect that it will be in powder form but I still find it a good product nonetheless.  I dilute it with apple cider vinegar and warm water and it help my face cleared up from pimples.  :)</li>
    <li> I used this once as a mask and a couple of times in my bath.  It&#x27;s a bit messy to mix as the instructions say to use a scoop of the clay, however there is no scoop.  At least not in the container I was sent.  So very light clay everywhere when trying to dispense. It seems to make my skin softer and feel cleaner.  I cannot attest as to whether or not it removes toxins obviously, but I am pleased with how my skin feels after use.</li>
    <li> This worked great and left my face feeling nice and smooth. It was easy to mix and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit this can be messy to use but the results make it worth it.&lt;br /&gt;My face felt cleaner and firmer after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week for my at home spa treatment.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin so refreshed and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Bentonite Indian Healing Clay. I was offered this Ommm Health and Beauty brand of clay at a promotional price and asked to offer my opinion in return. I must say this is fabulous! This is used to detox your skin and I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a better chance and time to try this product as I&#x27;m in the process of a detox. Just follow instructions on how to prep it and u will be fine. I have lots of pores and I can definitely see the difference.</li>
    <li> Even though my product did not have a blue label on it I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first thing I noticed is that there is allot of clay and a little can go a long way. It is very easy to use and does wonders for my hair and skin. I made a simple hair mask and discovered it made my hair very shiny and did not take out any color. My hair now feels softer and is for sure shinier. Then I tried it on my face and discovered it helps with my skin. I am very happy with this product and will be ordering more in the future. I recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
    <li> For some reason the jar that arrived says &amp;#34;argan oil&amp;#34; on it, but nevertheless it contains clay. This stuff is awesome! I love the consistency that it blends to when you combine it with either water alone, or with water and tea tree oil (I also add some Vitamin C from a capsule I empty). I find that different brands of healing clay consist of essentially the same experience of using them, but (maybe just placebo effect) some result in better/worse skin after-effects. This is one of my favorite ones. My skin tends to have more of a tingle after I rinse this stuff off, and the products I apply after this mask just seem to seep in easier. I do this mask in the evenings about 1-2x per week, and follow with toner, essence, serum, vitamin C/hyaluronic acid treatment, and moisturizer, and on the days when I start with this mask, things just tend to sit better on my face, and I wake up with my skin looking more plump in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I see this product being a part of my regular skincare routine in the future, as I think it seems to make a difference so far.</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time buying any kind of healing clay product. I purchased this product in hopes of it improving the condition of my skin. The one huge issue I managed to look over was that this is a powder. The product page doesn&#x27;t really include that information. If it would have been included in the title, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. I like my beauty products ready to use. No messy prep. I learned the hard way it was powder when upon opening the jar, it went everywhere includes my clothes. That was a bummer. The product does do what it says, however. It cleanses the skin and leaves it very smooth after use. Just make sure not to leave it on too long as it can be very drying. Clean up is kind of a pain since you will be washing bowls/brushes that are required for correct application. I&#x27;d recommend this product only to the people willing to put in the work towards correctly utilizing this product to get the full benefit of its qualities.</li>
    <li> I have used this clay about 3 times a week for the last 3 weeks. I am suffering from terrible cystic acne right now. It&#x27;s easy to mix, doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant odor, and the price is a great deal. As a cosmetologist, I know that this price is amazing for the quality you will receive. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> My face feels great after I put this product on! It dries up pretty quickly and leaves my face smooth after I wash the product off. I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a great price for a lot of product. It&#x27;ll literally last you a long time!</li>
    <li> amazing product!  Leaves my skin feeling incredible.  I use it as a face mask.</li>
    <li> Bentonite Clay is the best product to have ever been put on my skin! It is a pretty heavy canister and when I opened it thinking it was going to be a grainy cleanser like scrubs and such, but once opened I realized it was a powder which is to be mixed with a little bit of water. I used it while in the bath tub and then my sister used it on her skin and we both found it to be very relaxing. This is definitely the way to go.</li>
    <li> Very interesting. It comes in powder form and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to start with but with enough mixing and rubbing, I was able to apply it to my face. It dries quickly. I used pap wet clothe to rub it off, it gives off an odor much like dirt. I have pretty good skin so I don&#x27;t see a difference. It did irritate my nose a bit, I think it may have broke the skin when I was trying to get it off my skin. But if you are looking for a good clay mask that will last a really long time, this would be the one. Happy Detoxing</li>
    <li> Great quality stuff and packaged very well. This product is great on the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Tightens my pores and smooth out my skin. A must have beauty secret.</li>
    <li> I only just got this, and I&#x27;ve only been able to use it once. If you leave it on too long out makes you face really itchy, but it made my face really soft and it was nice.</li>
    <li> When I first received this, I assumed that it would be a solid (aka clay). When I opened it up, I discovered that it was a powder as I dumped half of the jar on my bathroom counter. It was a complete mess, but I proceeded with application. When mixing with water, the clay powder did NOT mix well. When I applied it to my face, it did not spread well and clumped; never applying evenly. While my skin felt great after leaving on for 10 min and then rinsing off (which is why I gave it a couple stars), clean up was a disaster. It took forever to get all of the clumps of clay down my drain. I unfortunately will not be using again. The cons definitely outweighed the pros.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! The only product that helps clear my acne. I use a homemade bentonite clay soap daily and this clay mask at least twice a week. My acne had greatly reduced, not completely clear by its getting there.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! It comes in a powder form. I mix a little powder in a bowl with water and than slather it on my face, neck and shoulders about 20 minutes before I shower, than rinse. I only gave it four stars because its a pain in the butt to mix.</li>
    <li> Maybe the best detoxing product I have tried.  Once you get the right mixture- it is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I thought it would come as clay but it&#x27;s actually in a powder form and you add water. Love this stuff</li>
    <li> I am happy with this Indian Healing Clay by Ommm Health. I have used this a couple of times and I have liked how it makes my skin feel afterwards. It was pretty simple to use and apply to the face. It is a pretty big jar so it will last me quite a while which I like. Being fragrance free is a big plus. I also I pretty sensitive skin and breakout prone so I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I look forward to using this mask more.</li>
    <li> This bentonite clay is some of the best I have used. I have used it on my face as a mask once a week. I also intend on using it on my hair once a month.</li>
    <li> Great product works amazing, was a little confused when it arrived with a &amp;#34;100% Argon Oil&amp;#34; label when it did indeed have Indian healing clay in it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this clay in my three year old daughter&#x27;s bathwater.  She has really bad eczema and this clay is part of her many treatments.  I noticed it is really working on healing her scratches and soothing her itchiness.  Overall I think this is a great product and I highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> While I got some funny looks when I made a mask out of this and wore it around the house, it was well worth it. Even the two year old laughed at me. My older girls though felt my face after I took it off and they wanted to use it with me next time because my face was so soft. It did itch a little when it was drying because it would crack and the edges of the cracks were causing the itch. Glancing through some of the other reviews I noticed different places to check out for ideas on how to use this. I will be doing some more research because if it did that for my face after just one use I know this can make my skin better in so many other ways.</li>
    <li> I thought that I would receive a &amp;#34;Ready to Use&amp;#34; clay mask, but it actually comes in powder form.  Not a big deal though, just need to add water to get a mask consistency.  I tried the mask on my face.  After use, my skin felt amazing, my pores appeared smaller, face felt smooth and refreshed.  Treat yourself to a simple,yet wonderful &amp;#34;At-Home&amp;#34; Spa treatment.</li>
    <li> Love it I use it for my face and it honestly leaves my face nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this on my face twice and love the way it feels as it dries.  My skin feels smoother and it really helps clean out the pores to reduce those awful blackheads.  It says you can use it on your hair, not sure I am brave enough to try that yet.</li>
    <li> This comes as a powder and you mix it with water to make clay.  It seems to make my skin feel tighter and I think that it has help remove impurities from my pores. It is too soon for me to tell if it will help with wrinkles or other skin issues but I will continue using this and update my review after a little more time.  I need to tell you that I did purchase this file at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and review, but I have not let this discount affect my review. My goal is to let consumers know what to expect from products so that no one wastes their money on products that don&#x27;t work because I really hate when that happens to me!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works awesome!</li>
    <li> I got this clay in last night and have already used it. I was very impressed with this clay. I have been very interested in trying this. It is a power, mix with water follow instructions on package. I mixed this in a small sup and applied with an old make-up foundation brush.  This stuff works wonders!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I try this product . I love it. It leaves my skin super soft</li>
    <li> With my first use of this clay I noticed that my skin felt a million times better.  I made a paste out of it and used it as a face mask and it made my face feel better than I can remember it feeling ever!  I also used some on a breakout that I was getting on my chin and it healed it before it ever had a chance to surface!  My daughter got a slight sunburn at the beach so when we go home she took a cool bath with a scoop in the tub with her and it healed her burn and left her skin fabulous too!  I have only been using it a few times so far but I am already ordering more because this stuff is AMAZING!  I can&#x27;t wait to see all the uses it has in my life.</li>
    <li> I am IN LOVE with this clay detoxifying mask!!!  I am native american and have super oily skin, which results in acne, blemishes and clogged pores. After using this mask twice a week for the last month, my skin is so much clearer and my acne has healed tremendously.  My skin also doesn&#x27;t feel as oily underneath my make up as normal.  I highly recommend this clay mask if you too want clear and beautiful skin!!!</li>
    <li> Great product; face felt awesome!</li>
    <li> Seems to work especially for impurities</li>
