      <li>I would suggest you looking for a better price online.</li>
      <li>Okay, I will say it...</li>
      <li>But as soon as I opened the bottle, I fell in love with the smell...</li>
      <li>Plus since no measured amount of progesterone was disclosed, and I read highly reputable literature stating the recommended amount.</li>
      <li>But am sleeping better.</li>
      <li>I really love this oil.</li>
      <li>I have used many progesterone creams over the years.  </li>
      <li>I felt sure I had a hormone imbalance, based on all the reading I did.</li>
      <li>Within 3 days I was symptom free!</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t a cheap product to begin with!  </li>

      <li>For the hormone depleted, this is a great natural way to buck them up.</li>

      <li>I am glad to say I finished chemotherapy 2 months ago, just had a full mastectomy and the cancer is gone.  </li>
      <li>This product is awesome but the seller should be shut down for the price of this item.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Mind you, she really does not care for the smell (I love it!)</li>
      <li>and I must say that I am a huge believer.  </li>
      <li>I figured, if nothing else, I could enjoy that.</li>
      <li>Great 3rd party Company.</li>
      <li>I felt better within 24 hours of its first use.  </li>
      <li>My husband wants us to invest in even more of these oils.</li>
      <li>My cycle was delayed tremendously.</li>
      <li>My husband thanks us for using this regularly since we are more cheerful and more ourselves.</li>
      <li>you are a woman in your thirties or older, I suggest trying this product for two months, 7 drops on the neck once daily, and seeing if you sleep better, have fewer cramps, and have more regulated periods and moods.  </li>
      <li>My advice if you do decide to try it is don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t notice improvement right away.  </li>
      <li>It really does!</li>
      <li>Has helped with the hot flashes but still waiting on it to help as a sleep aid.</li>
      <li>I am still not sleeping consistently though the night.</li>
      <li>Most with this gene mutation will never get cancer, but there are numerous things that could trigger the mutation to morph into cancer, and I 100% believe this did it to me.  </li>
      <li>I applied the serum inconsistently for the first month and didn&#x27;t notice any results.  </li>
      <li>This stuff actually works :)</li>
      <li>I did not buy mine through Amazon, their price was much higher.</li>
      <li>then the hot flashes started up again.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and lasts a very very long time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because I love progessence plus .I&#x27;ve been regularly using it for about 5 months and my whole family can tell the difference.</li>
      <li>I was BRCA positive</li>
      <li>I did like this product as I felt it helped with sleep; although not as much for the hot flashes.</li>
      <li>My journey is not over, I still have to complete radiation, finish reconstruction, and have a full hysterectomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For full disclosure I will say I got a slight rash on certain parts of my body, but as long as it&#x27;s not horrible I will deal. :)</li>
      <li>Not only does it keep my hormones in balance which I can tell from better skin, less PMS symptoms, and an overall more healthy feel.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have endo, though, because most women have too much estrogen and not enough progesterone, particularly once we get into our thirties.  </li>
      <li>At certain times (felt like always)</li>
      <li>Sells the pure product, no gimmicks.</li>
      <li>First of all, I highly recommend purchasing from a YL distributor and not Amazon, as you never know what you are getting, and the product isn&#x27;t guaranteed.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These guys sell the Real thing.</li>
      <li>Bought this bottle fast delivery thank</li>
      <li>In 6 months it&#x27;s gone up by that much?  </li>
      <li>Periods were much lighter and shorter (5 days instead of 7).</li>
      <li>used as prescribed and it made a difference -- too much.</li>
      <li>Everything I expected and more.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I have now grown very used to the fragrance and am no longer bothered by it.  </li>
      <li>The essential oils in this combine synergistically to the natural progesterone to make it the most absorbable form of progesterone that I know about on the market.  </li>
      <li>(I eat pretty healthy and I am moderately active), as well as high blood pressure.  </li>
      <li>have the Young Living catalog in front of me right now.</li>
      <li>Plus, it smells great and can worn be as a perfume, making it easy, at least for me, to remember to put it on everyday.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have been taking it for two weeks so far and am very grateful for the relief it has given.</li>
      <li>I developed noticeable, frequent hot flashes.</li>
      <li>an unexplained inability to lose weight despite healthy eating and moderate exercise.  </li>
      <li>Upon the recommendation of an older sister, I started using another well-known natural progesterone product...</li>
      <li>It did take a few weeks of consistent application, but I am once again able to sleep through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is lasting longer than I expected (at first I was applying too much)...</li>
      <li>only getting extremely hot at night when I slept, but it was affecting my sleep.</li>
      <li>Not with any Young Oils!</li>
      <li>2nd time I bought this lost the first bottle.  </li>
      <li>I was having problem sleeping and constant hot flashes and sweats day and night .</li>
      <li>Initially the strong smell of the essential oils was off putting to me as I have tried to go scent-free with my personal care products.  </li>
      <li>One reason women feel vital during pregnancy is they have up to 400 times the normal amounts of progesterone in their bodies; it is known that symptoms of endometriosis go away with pregnancy (likely because of the high doses of progesterone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My daughter and I use this to balance our moods and clear our skin and counter toxins in our environment.</li>
      <li>I purchased this through a Young Living associate and ordered it directly from the company.  </li>
      <li>Can be topically applied anywhere and absorbs very well.</li>
      <li>So far it seems to help.</li>
      <li>Young Living does not sell on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I think this should be used with professional guidance.</li>
      <li>Plus about 5 months ago (just 3-4 drops massaged onto my neck at night, or my abdomen when I have cramps) and have noticed a DRASTIC change in nearly all of my symptoms.</li>
      <li>like it because it is a natural way to balance hormones.&lt;br /&gt;I was having difficulty sleeping and this helped.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am 36 years old.  </li>
      <li>Only ordering with a Young Living distributor guarantees the integrity of the product, and that it is truly Young Living and not something containing an inferior grade or additives.</li>
      <li>I was quite skinny before getting pregnant, and never had any trouble maintaining my weight.</li>
      <li>Young Living distributors agree not to sell on third party sites.</li>
      <li>I was willing to give this a try because I was suffering from severe, exhausting hot flashes that would strike numerous times throughout the day and caused me to wake up repeatedly throughout the night.  </li>
      <li>In the last couple of weeks not only has the fluid retention decreased, somehow I dropped 4 pounds and my blood pressure is doing soooo much better.  </li>
      <li>First of all, I&#x27;m in my upper 20&#x27;s and suffered from periodic migraines, heavy periods, and (ever since my son was born 2 years ago)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great 3rd party Company. Sells the pure product, no gimmicks. If you need this stuff b/c Young Living is out of stock (which is SO frustrating) These guys sell the Real thing. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Great oil that you can buy for $40! Don&#x27;t get ripped off. The pricing here is OUTRAGEOUS!</li>
    <li> Did not get to use long enough to see a difference....</li>
    <li> Okay, I will say it... this is what keeps my wife sane! I don&#x27;t mean it in a negative way, so please don&#x27;t take offense. She takes a drop when she is feeling &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; (grumpy), and her mood is instantly changed. Mind you, she really does not care for the smell (I love it!), so I know it is not some sort of aromatherapy or psychological alteration. This stuff actually works :)</li>
    <li> This product is awesome but the seller should be shut down for the price of this item.&lt;br /&gt;Just from one dist to another.</li>
    <li> Quality progesterone in essential oils base…bio-compatible with female hormones.  Because there is no soy you do not have to rotate application sites on the body,</li>
    <li> I do believe it works, Im also using doTERRA oils with it... Im postmenopausal and am looking for hormone alternatives. .dont want to do the HRT..so I will continue and see</li>
    <li> For the hormone depleted, this is a great natural way to buck them up. This is a precursor to progesterone.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I use this to balance our moods and clear our skin and counter toxins in our environment. It&#x27;s amazing, smells great, helps sleep patterns, clear up acne, balance moods. My husband thanks us for using this regularly since we are more cheerful and more ourselves. We are not debilitated with PMS symptoms or women trouble. There is NO reason for gals to experience those monthly troubles! Stock up on this oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This is the best progesterone I have tried.  It is very easy to use and lasts a very very long time.</li>
    <li> The product works well, however I gave it a 1 due to the price you can get it from young living for 44 plus tax.... so I don&#x27;t understand why is 62+</li>
    <li> 2nd time I bought this lost the first bottle.  It was in 104 degree whether and I was not sweating, then I lost that bottle.  Thought maybe it was a fluke then the hot flashes started up again.  Bought this bottle fast delivery thank goodness.  I,m back on the bottle again.  Yea</li>
    <li> This kind of made me sick.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the way it made me feel I used it for a month and stopped&lt;br /&gt;Did not help with my awful menses/cramps at all.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit boring too. Nothing great..</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year. I did not use it for a month, as I was traveling and did not bring the oil with me. I developed noticeable, frequent hot flashes. I then realized I had stopped using this oil and that might be the issue?  With just one application the hot flashes cut in half, seriously. By day two of using this oil they were infrequent. I am sure a believer now. I will forever be a user of this oil. I would suggest you looking for a better price online. I did not buy mine through Amazon, their price was much higher.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more.  I felt better within 24 hours of its first use.  Still getting used to the smell, but it&#x27;s not offensive so I can deal with that.</li>
    <li> Did not work for my needs.</li>
    <li> This oil has saved me from deep and dark depression caused by hormonal imbalance following pregnancy. No side effects! So grateful for an affordable and safe alternative to anti-depressants!</li>
    <li> Has helped with the hot flashes but still waiting on it to help as a sleep aid.</li>
    <li> I was suffering with horrible hot flashes. My massage therapist suggested Progessence along with a generic OTC estrogen (ie Estroven). I take one Estroven tsblet daily &amp; 2 drops of Progessence twice daily to the back of my hand or inside of wrist. Within 3 days I was symptom free! If I skip 24 hours symptoms return.</li>
    <li> I did like this product as I felt it helped with sleep; although not as much for the hot flashes. I would continue to use the product but it&#x27;s very frustrating when the price doubles. That&#x27;s not the way to motivate loyalty from customers.</li>
    <li> Great product that helps to normalize your progesterone . If taken with kelp tablets, this product helps gets rid of fibrositic breast disease.  It really does!</li>
    <li> Can be topically applied anywhere and absorbs very well. Will stay with this form of progesterone. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Thought I was going to loose my mind due to hormone in balance. This saved my life! Tried other form s of progesterone and had allergic reactions. Not with any Young Oils! Thanks</li>
    <li> I have used many progesterone creams over the years.  This is hands down the best of the best.  I rub three drops into my neck before bedtime and it helps me sleep through the night.  When I don&#x27;t use it I immediately experience a less restful night.  Initially the strong smell of the essential oils was off putting to me as I have tried to go scent-free with my personal care products.  I have now grown very used to the fragrance and am no longer bothered by it.  I gave my almost empty bottle to a friend to try who similarly could not sleep through the night and it worked equally well for her.</li>
    <li> I was willing to give this a try because I was suffering from severe, exhausting hot flashes that would strike numerous times throughout the day and caused me to wake up repeatedly throughout the night.  I purchased this through a Young Living associate and ordered it directly from the company.  After putting up with these symptoms for over a year I was pretty desperate and ready to ask my doctor for some hormones.  I applied the serum inconsistently for the first month and didn&#x27;t notice any results.  The second month I decided &amp;#34;what the heck...I already spent the money I might as well give this a try&amp;#34;.  I applied 3 drops on my forearms each morning and each evening and by the end of the month noticed my hot flashes greatly diminished.  I still have an occasional minor flash but the severe, sweating, flushing episodes and waking up at night are gone!  I&#x27;m not sure if this is a coincidence or not so I will have to update this review in the future.  My advice if you do decide to try it is don&#x27;t give up if you don&#x27;t notice improvement right away.  Give it a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and I was having self-diagnosed symptoms of peri-menopause...only getting extremely hot at night when I slept, but it was affecting my sleep. No actual sweating, but in the middle of winter, I just could not cool off. Upon the recommendation of an older sister, I started using another well-known natural progesterone product...unfortunately, I did not like the feel once applied, nor did I like that I had to rotate the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was admittedly skeptical to try Progessence Plus since no measured amount of progesterone was disclosed, and I read highly reputable literature stating the recommended amount. But as soon as I opened the bottle, I fell in love with the smell...I figured, if nothing else, I could enjoy that. It did take a few weeks of consistent application, but I am once again able to sleep through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is lasting longer than I expected (at first I was applying too much)...If I continue using the current amount (the maximum recommended 4 drops/day), I estimate roughly 2 months per bottle. It&#x27;s hard to estimate as I was mistakenly doubling the product during the first week. I currently apply 2 drops to either side of my neck prior to going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do hope this review helps - good luck!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I was diagnosed with endometriosis.  It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have endo, though, because most women have too much estrogen and not enough progesterone, particularly once we get into our thirties.  One reason women feel vital during pregnancy is they have up to 400 times the normal amounts of progesterone in their bodies; it is known that symptoms of endometriosis go away with pregnancy (likely because of the high doses of progesterone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman in your thirties or older, I suggest trying this product for two months, 7 drops on the neck once daily, and seeing if you sleep better, have fewer cramps, and have more regulated periods and moods.  The essential oils in this combine synergistically to the natural progesterone to make it the most absorbable form of progesterone that I know about on the market.  (I know this sounds like a commercial! I&#x27;m just a health nut with no financial interest in this product.)  Plus, it smells great and can worn be as a perfume, making it easy, at least for me, to remember to put it on everyday.  If you want to know more about endometriosis, I write about what I&#x27;ve done to treat it on my website GreenLightHeidi.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this 5 stars because I love progessence plus .I&#x27;ve been regularly using it for about 5 months and my whole family can tell the difference.One,I&#x27;m not as moody anymore! But this price is horrible!!! Anyone can buy it from YoungLiving.com for $49.34.I have the Young Living catalog in front of me right now.</li>
    <li> I started using this oil because I was having some hormone issues.&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it is a natural way to balance hormones.&lt;br /&gt;I was having difficulty sleeping and this helped.&lt;br /&gt;It also brings a calming effect and ability to handle stress.</li>
    <li> Progessence is one of the few things that have helped alleviate symptoms of menopause.  A great alternative to hormone treatment.</li>
    <li> I really love this oil. Not only does it keep my hormones in balance which I can tell from better skin, less PMS symptoms, and an overall more healthy feel.</li>
    <li> Young Living does not sell on Amazon. Young Living distributors agree not to sell on third party sites. Only ordering with a Young Living distributor guarantees the integrity of the product, and that it is truly Young Living and not something containing an inferior grade or additives.</li>
    <li> I am 44 and starting what seems to be menopause. I was having problem sleeping and constant hot flashes and sweats day and night . As soon as I applied this oil to my neck before sleep, my flashes greatly decreased. I still get them . But went from  roughly ten a day to three. I am still not sleeping consistently though the night. But am sleeping better. I have been taking it for two weeks so far and am very grateful for the relief it has given.</li>
    <li> I have been using this item for a while now and believe my sleep has improved.</li>
    <li> Edited:  I have been undergoing treatment for cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, please heed the warnings.  I gave this 5 stars over a year ago, shortly after I started having weird reactions such as rashes, metabolism issues, etc.  6 months after I left this review, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I am 36 years old.  While I can&#x27;t conclusively say that this caused it, I had no issues prior.  I found out I was BRCA positive which is a breast cancer gene (mutation).  This product could&#x27;ve triggered the process for the cancer.  Most with this gene mutation will never get cancer, but there are numerous things that could trigger the mutation to morph into cancer, and I 100% believe this did it to me.  I am glad to say I finished chemotherapy 2 months ago, just had a full mastectomy and the cancer is gone.  My journey is not over, I still have to complete radiation, finish reconstruction, and have a full hysterectomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, please, please be careful&lt;br /&gt;_____________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this for over 3 weeks and I must say that I am a huge believer.  It took a few days for me to see a difference, but once I did, it was like a 180.  I had all the symptoms of low progesterone and for years felt I had a hormonal imbalance. At certain times (felt like always) I made everyone in my house miserable, including myself with my mood swings and fatigue.  I have also had a difficult time losing weight that is unexplained (I eat pretty healthy and I am moderately active), as well as high blood pressure.  In the last couple of weeks not only has the fluid retention decreased, somehow I dropped 4 pounds and my blood pressure is doing soooo much better.  This sounds like a fairy tale and I still am in disbelief that something as simple as this has drastically changed my life.  My husband wants us to invest in even more of these oils. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was a skeptic about this oil helping, a realist by nature, I thought $45 lost if it didn&#x27;t work (which I didn&#x27;t believe it would).  I literally have tried almost everything (GOOGLE is my friend). For full disclosure I will say I got a slight rash on certain parts of my body, but as long as it&#x27;s not horrible I will deal. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to cut this review short, I just wanted to share my story for those it could help.  $45 is a lot or not enough dependent on who you are, but I would pay 10 times this price for what is has done for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Also, be careful of the vendor you purchase from.  There are definitely fakes out there.**</li>
    <li> used as prescribed and it made a difference -- too much. My cycle was delayed tremendously. Thankfully I was working with a Naturopath. I think this should be used with professional guidance.</li>
    <li> This product is an excellent product, it smells gorgeous, it definitely balances hormones (I have estrogen/progesterone imbalance), it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found which restores balance, and I&#x27;ve spent 20 years trying to find something.  I really like it.  I wasn&#x27;t overwhelmed at paying $42 for it though, I thought it was a bit steep.  However, it was hard to get on Amazon for awhile and now that it&#x27;s back I notice it starts at $180!! In 6 months it&#x27;s gone up by that much?  It wasn&#x27;t a cheap product to begin with!  I think that&#x27;s outrageous and heartbreaking as it now makes it completely inaccessible.  Crying with disappointment.  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;m going to cope now.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference</li>
    <li> So far it seems to help.</li>
    <li> First of all, I highly recommend purchasing from a YL distributor and not Amazon, as you never know what you are getting, and the product isn&#x27;t guaranteed.  I&#x27;ve returned items to YL and they have excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I can get to my review. First of all, I&#x27;m in my upper 20&#x27;s and suffered from periodic migraines, heavy periods, and (ever since my son was born 2 years ago) an unexplained inability to lose weight despite healthy eating and moderate exercise.  I felt sure I had a hormone imbalance, based on all the reading I did. I was quite skinny before getting pregnant, and never had any trouble maintaining my weight. Post-partum was a different story - I read up on post-partum estrogen dominance and found that it&#x27;s quite common. I started using Progessence Plus about 5 months ago (just 3-4 drops massaged onto my neck at night, or my abdomen when I have cramps) and have noticed a DRASTIC change in nearly all of my symptoms. Headaches were gone. I don&#x27;t mean less frequent, I mean totally and completely GONE. No headaches at all while I use this stuff. Periods were much lighter and shorter (5 days instead of 7). Weight came off much more easily (I&#x27;m down 11 lbs from when I started using this) but don&#x27;t use it as an excuse to not exercise or eat well - this is a supplement, not a miracle weight loss drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was down in the dumps when they ran out of stock. They had been out for months when they finally got it back in this week and I ordered more right away! I have a migraine headache as I type this (had one yesterday too), and I can&#x27;t wait to get rid of them again.</li>
