      <li>Hey this is just my own opinion just saving you time and money.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
      <li>It does not give a shiny sleek finish on its own as suggested on TV.</li>
      <li>The advertisement is good to watch in reality it is not as easy as it seem.</li>
      <li>Also, its very easy to get burn, so you cant go to close to the hair root</li>

      <li>and we love it.  </li>
      <li>The best thing I like about it is that it already has brush, I can style my hair with only one hand.</li>
      <li>But the InStyler is great because it really does work well for those on the go.  </li>
      <li>My hair is finer and I love the way it looks</li>
      <li>I have a jade straightening iron that works much better.</li>
      <li>It heats up fast and works great.  </li>
      <li>and i love it.</li>
      <li>but if you must have one like I did don&#x27;t pay more than $60.  </li>
      <li>They advertise $14.99 trail when the price is more.</li>
      <li>Glad I did</li>
      <li>My hair is shiny, smooth and as curly as I want it to be!</li>
      <li>The Instyler does that and so much more because it allows me to be versatile in my styling.      </li>
      <li>I was satisfied with the price</li>
      <li>I have it and know many people that have it as well.</li>
      <li>I love the comb that comes with it,</li>

      <li>You might find something better at a Beauty Supply Store.</li>
      <li>and she is in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Instyler!!!!</li>
      <li>To be honest with you I took one section of hair and straightened it exactly 14 times before I got a semi straight fly away look.  </li>
      <li>and if i dont like it i can get full cash refund!</li>
      <li>It is efficient,  easy to use</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>This InStyler smooths out their hair and it stays smooth even with the humidity.  </li>
      <li>and then smooth it over with the Instyler.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately, I purchased this from a company that gives refunds - no questions asked.</li>
      <li>Cheap.    </li>
      <li>I will never go back, truly LOVE the Instyler!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to inadverently grab near it while styling your hair and touch your skin resulting in yet more burns.</li>
      <li>because, because it&#x27;s my new favorite hair tool!</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, it doesn&#x27;t heat up very much at all, but I thought Ok, the ads on TV said that so maybe it will still work.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The only reason people love the chi is because they love to fry their hair &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>Go with the original.</li>
      <li>and they informed me that they would not honor the warranty unless I had the original sales receipt, even though I sent in the warranty card registration.</li>
      <li>On clean, non product hair I sectioned off 2 to 3 inch sections I attempted to straighten my hair...</li>
      <li>This is the best product I have ever spent this much money on.  </li>
      <li>Just stick with a good flat iron and you will be fine.</li>
      <li>I would suggest waiting until a better model comes out to pay that much</li>
      <li>As with all informercials you MUST read the fine print ;)</li>
      <li>Eventually I settled on a name-brand 1 1/2\\&quot; hot iron that was available at drug and beauty supply stores.</li>
      <li>I love my new Instyler.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that for the first time in my life I have a CHOICE of having full hair or smooth, flat hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very thick, curly, unruly, often frizzy hair. Over the past 20 years I have spent untold amounts of money on appliances to straighten my hair. And I&#x27;ve given away boxes and boxes of tools that were just useless to me. Eventually I settled on a name-brand 1 1/2\\&quot; hot iron that was available at drug and beauty supply stores. When I wanted to straighten my hair, I would spend a little over an hour in front of the mirror and would have to press the outer part extra hard against the barrel on the highest setting to get the job done. This would cause my arms to ache and I&#x27;d end up taking a break halfway through. I&#x27;d really need to be motivated for a special occasion. Also, the handle would break because of the pressure I needed to use so I replaced that exact model at least 5 times. It was the only thing I could find that worked.    The InStyler has changed everything. I can use it every day and at my curliest, my hair is still done in about 20 minutes using just the middle heat setting. It gets very hot very fast so I recommend trying lower settings if you&#x27;re used to ordinary irons. I don&#x27;t need to apply added pressure. I used to straighten my hair only when I was going out at night. Now the only time I don&#x27;t straighten it is when it&#x27;s raining outside.     The only drawback I can think of is that I like to play music while I&#x27;m getting ready and the InStyler is a little noisy - have to turn the tunes up louder. But I&#x27;m done so quickly, that hardly counts as a drawback. If I used a blowdryer, I&#x27;m sure it would be worse.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome...however the rotating barrel...doesnt last very long...mine is about 5 months old...not used everyday and has already broke. There is no external parts to &#x27;mess up&#x27; so it broke internally. Too expensive for the amount of time I was able to use it.</li>
    <li> After friends bought and loved this item, I decided to try it.  My hair is VERY thick and VERY long and VERY curly, but I figured that this product might be the one to tame it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it doesn&#x27;t heat up very much at all, but I thought Ok, the ads on TV said that so maybe it will still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, my hair got caught in the edge of the barrel between where it was rotating and where it wasn&#x27;t rotating, and the thing RIPPED my hair out, probably about 12 strands or so before I could disengage the thing from my head.  If your hair gets caught in there by the way, the only option you have is to rip it out or cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, at the end of my session of doing my entire head, my hair ISN&#x27;T straight OR smooth.  It looks just like it always does after I tame it down with hot rollers (no soft curl, not straight, not smooth, not shiny, just slightly less frizzy).  The thing doesn&#x27;t work on my hair, it is just a dry-looking and unmanageable as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends who have shorter, less curly, less frizzy, and less thick hair LOVE this product, it&#x27;s just not working for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She used as per instructions, we may have received a faulty unit. She would have to start heating it before she took a shower so it would reach heat level 2 by the time she got out. Then it would only mantain temp for about 2 swipes through her hair before having to wait several minutes for another swipe at it. Took about 1 1/2hrs to do her hair because she had to go back through w/ her old straightener to get near her scalp.     Pros: Plenty of time for me to catch up on the DVR/wash the car/cook a turkey before going out..    Will be returning..</li>
    <li> i didnt buy from this seller, but i did get an instyler for christmas and used it exactly 3 1/2 times on the last time i got one strand straight and the item shorted out and just quit working, it worked great when it worked but that just completely pissed me off! i took it back and never bought another one.</li>
    <li> The sent my mom 2 instyler&#x27;s and she gave me one and I have ti say this is the best gift any one has given me. I have really thick long wavy hair and this makes my hair so smooth and soft. I can&#x27;t live without it. I even do my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair with it. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> After reading all of these reviews i want to tell you I bought an instyler and i love it more than a chi! The only reason people love the chi is because they love to fry their hair &#x3D;] I have curly hair that i can never get perfect, but i found this at Ulta beauty store and i love it. Ulta even told me I have 60 days to try it out and if i dont like it i can get full cash refund! If this is so crappy then why would a store back this product?! Since using this product my hair has became thick again, my hair is not fried, and before this i could wear my hair either curly with hair product or i would have to straighten it because i could never just leave it natural is was that fried from my chi. now i can walk out of the house with nothing done to my hair and not look ridiculous. i love how healthy my hair is again!!</li>
    <li> So on the first try I was disappointed similar to other reviewers but that is before I actually followed the instructions and demonstrations and used it correctly for my hair time. I have medium thick wavy/curly hair and personally I hated the ridiculously flat effect that traditional flat irons gave me. I like volume! Once I set my Instyler on a higher heat setting and sectioned of smaller sections of hair the results were amazing. I&#x27;ve even learned how to create amazing bouncy curls with it. Its a great tool.     Drawbacks? The motor is loud! But, its a small price to pay for a great result. I agree that you should use little to no product. Water-based products cause MORE frizz, especially with curly-haired girls.     I would definitely recommend giving it a try. With an Instyler you get volume, shine and straightening, what beats that? Not to mention with less heat and damage meaning if you do decide to wear your natural curls again they won&#x27;t be damaged beyond repair.     P.S.   For the readers complaining about the $14.99 trial it clearly states on the infomercial $14.99 for a 30-day trial. As with all informercials you MUST read the fine print ;)</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron for my granddaughter. I was satisfied with the price and she is very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and now she can&#x27;t go a day without it. She loves it so much she gave it as a gift to several friends and family. It&#x27;s been a huge hit with everyone! Our relatives and friends are giving them as gifts to others. Now we use it as our go-to gift of choice. It takes my wife five minutes and she looks like she just had her hair professionally done. I&#x27;m telling you... Life Saver.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the Instyler and I was not impressed by it at all. The Rolling Iron I feel is too wide for women with thin hair. My hair is medium long and it is hard to use on your hair in the back. I had trimmed my bangs and burned my forehead twice. Just stick with a good flat iron and you will be fine. The advertisement is good to watch in reality it is not as easy as it seem. Remember to use a mirror while using this product. Also the sound of the iron is a little hard to get use to so dont let that bother you while using it. This product is worth a least $19.99. You might find something better at a Beauty Supply Store. Hey this is just my own opinion just saving you time and money.</li>
    <li> This product is a life-saver!  It is efficient,  easy to use and I use it every day without fail.  I have thick unruly hair and until now could not find an iron that was hot enough to tame it...The Instyler does that and so much more because it allows me to be versatile in my styling.      Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I do not have any type of afflialtion with the Instler company.  I just got this 2 days ago and I like it alot.  I am african american and I had braids in my hair and took them out the day this arrived (perfect timing).  Usually after I wash + dry my hair (medium, thick)  it comes out puffy and I can&#x27;t curl it.  I tried the Instyler and it tamed the beast.  So I figured after all the reviews I read I will try it again and it reminded me of how my hair dresser (she moved away) would wrap my hair and it was impressed. As usual there are some drawbacks such as it ot being able to stand on it&#x27;s own so I use a towel a suggestion that I read in 1 review.  It is a little arkward the first time.  The second time was way easier.  And it can only do small portions at a time. I didn&#x27;t pay $100 dollars for this and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to pay that much.  I would suggest waiting until a better model comes out to pay that much but if you must have one like I did don&#x27;t pay more than $60.  That&#x27;s just my opinion. But other than that I can do my own hair with salon results everyday.  I know this is just day 2 but I will keep you posted in 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and it worked great for 3 months.  I called InStyler and they informed me that they would not honor the warranty unless I had the original sales receipt, even though I sent in the warranty card registration. InStyler customer service is sadly lacking and the product is poorly made.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift; as far as I can tell it is still working; the first impression about the InStyler that it is a cool gift, and it saves time; my wife used it; need to be careful using it, since the rotating bar is hot and not covered; the brush maybe a little short/soft.    I am planning to buy a second one, for home use.</li>
    <li> In-styler has been the first curler/hair straightener that I purchased. My hair is pretty straight, yet I wanted to add some curls and possibly get rid of frizzy hair. I am very pleased with it. I use it on wet hair for best results, but it also can be applied on dry hair yet it takes more effort to give the hair extra shine, then. You have to be very careful if you want to use it on the fringe if you have any. I got burned while I was using it and almost gave up. I then went to do brazillian gloss, but it did not last very long, so I resumed my experiments with in-styler. After all, it cost me only 75 bucks, not $300 as for the perm. It is fairly quick and easy to use, not sure how it works for oleft-handed people, but I figured out how to hold the device pretty easily. For best results, I just bend down and straighten my hair, it gives my hair enough volume. The best thing I like about it is that it already has brush, I can style my hair with only one hand.</li>
    <li> Actually it&#x27;s not a good product, but the sellers gave my money back at the time I told them that I have issues with the product.</li>
    <li> I received this product from \\&quot;Clothes Galore\\&quot; and it was advertised as a NEW trademarked item.  I suspect that the item is a knock off and not as advertised and have been trying to obtain warranty information from \\&quot;Clothes Galore\\&quot; since I received it.  They will not answer emails.    I haven&#x27;t used the item because I want to return it due to lack of warranty but \\&quot;Clothes Galore\\&quot; will not respond to my requests...</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both have the InStyler and we love it.  I have shorter hair but my daughter has long hair, mine is thin and fine and my daughters is thick and curly, it works well with both.  I am ordering another one for a girlfriend who has really curly hair and I let her try out my InStyler for a few days and she is in love with it.  This InStyler smooths out their hair and it stays smooth even with the humidity.  They can&#x27;t believe it works so well!</li>
    <li> The Instyler Rotating Iron is a great new hair tool that surprisingly works just the way it does in the commercials. I have it and know many people that have it as well. We all love it! I was skeptical at first but gave it a chance after reading some really positive reviews online. Glad I did because, because it&#x27;s my new favorite hair tool!</li>
    <li> They advertise $14.99 trail when the price is more. Tried returning and they refuse returns.    One month later the end of the rotating end fell apart and it cannot be used. Cheap.    Bad service when you call in. My wife is not happy.</li>
    <li> This product was a waste of my money. I have thick very frizzy hair and it takes something special to tame it. I thought that this product would for sure do the trick. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. I have a jade straightening iron that works much better. I am sorry I ever bought this thing.</li>
    <li> Bought this product last year, have only used once or twice.  Sometimes the barrel turns slow or not at all, hair can get caught in the barrel, made my hair frizzy, takes forever for product to cool down so it can be put away.  I don&#x27;t think it was at all worth the money and I only paid $60 when I purchased it brand new.</li>
    <li> Not realizing this InStyler was not made by the orignal InStyler company I ended up with this this Knock-off imitation InStyler by Tre Milano is horrible and doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this item.  Go with the original.</li>
    <li> This was an expensive hair styling device, which during the first use, was broken.  The unit kept turning itself off.  It is being returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I paid for a new item BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT... REALIZED IT WAS A STINKY USED ITEM!!!    I am very pissed since it suppose to be a gift for my girlfriend...     DON&#x27;T BUY IT... BEWARE OF THOSE SCAMMERS!!!</li>
    <li> I love my new Instyler.  I don&#x27;t know how I could ever live without it again!!  Nothing short of a miracle for my hair. My time is valuable and this makes styling my hair so much easier, quicker and fun.  What a great item for anyone on the go.  Thanks Instyler!!!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, I use it everyday.  I also have the pink version!  I cannot tell you how much time and energy this little wonder has saved me.  I often let my hair air dry and then smooth it over with the Instyler.  It looks exactly like I took the time to blow dry it out with a round brush.  I am seriously in love with this.  I use to use a flat iron but it does just that, made my hair flat.  I will never go back, truly LOVE the Instyler!!</li>
    <li> The rotating cover slipped off and is impossible to align correctly. The Instyler rotates off axis and is useless.   The company that I ordered it from has not responded with their return information so I&#x27;m stuck with a bill and nothing to show for it.</li>
    <li> After years of using hot rollers and curling irons I was skeptical of the rotating iron being able to curl hair. But it does a great job! My hair is shiny, smooth and as curly as I want it to be! I can get height and fullness for a dressy look or soft and sleek for everyday. I really love my InStyler Rotating Iron!</li>
    <li> I would not order from Blue Sky again. It took over two weeks to get my order and now I want to return it and can&#x27;t any communication from Blue Sky. They won&#x27;t return emails. Stay away!</li>
    <li> it worked just for a day, then it broke, i am still waiting for the answer of the resellers to get my money back, not recommended</li>
    <li> My sister bought this item (as a matter of fact, she bought 2) I first used it on her and her hair is finer than mine, but it was awesome! I loved it right away! It makes your hair soft and definately shiny. My hair is thicker a bit course because I have curly wavy hair. I used it on my hair and I thought it was the best product on the market today. I would definately purchase one, althought I find it a bit pricey but well worth it. I would rather use this product than have my head under a helmet dryer anyday.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED FROM SAFARI STORE BIG MISTAKE THE INSTYLER DOES NOT HEAT UP! THE PRODUCT CAME WITH NO RETURN INFORMATION NO INVOICE AND THE BOX IT CAME IN IS IN SPANISH. I HAVE SENT 4 EMAILS TO THEM TO TRY TO GET INFORMATION ON HOW TO SEND THE DEFECTIVE INSTYLER BACK TO THEM FOR A REFUND,THEY HAVE NOT ANSWERED ME. I HAVE NOW RESORTED TO AMAZON COMPLAINT DEPARTMENT TO TAKE ACTION ON MY BEHALF, THEY HAVE UNTIL TOMORROW 4/30/11 TO MAKE THIS RIGHT OR I WILL NO LONGER BE ORDERING THRU AMAZON!! THEY (AMAZON) SHOULD NOT RECOMMEND SAFARI STORE PRODUCTS TO ANYONE!!!   BUYER BEEEEWAAARREEEE!!!!! OF SAFARI STORE!!!!![[ASIN:B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> My mom requested this for her birthday.  She got it, used it, and likes it so far.  She says it works on her hair (she&#x27;s african american) and it&#x27;s not to hard to use.</li>
    <li> when i got this product on a re-used box, i should have known i was in for a crappy product. after using it for 2 months, it has worked ineffectively (sometimes it gets hot, sometimes not). but everytime i was thinking of returning, it would work again for few days so i held-off returning this. but after the 5th month, it just stopped working! for a price that&#x27;s almost $100, you would think it would work for atleast a year. but it did not. what&#x27;s worse is i&#x27;ve contacted amazon customer service and learned there&#x27;s no phone number for this seller and that my only option is to email (which would have been fine if the seller responded to my email). no response until today and i don&#x27;t think they ever will. do not buy from this seller!</li>
    <li> My daughter got me this on Amazon for Christmas last year. I tried it, it didn&#x27;t work for me, was cumbersome, just didn&#x27;t like it. So it sat in the bedroom for a year, and I decided to sell it on ebay. Tre Milano had my auction pulled off ebay 3 times and would not reply why. Ebay told me not to relist it. Also, someone stole my credit card last year and ordered one of these (sent to me), weird, but ok, so I called Tre Milano who charged my card the same day (I get emails when charges are made to this card). They would not stop the processing of the order, even though it had not shipped. I had to file a chargeback against them and refuse the item when it arrived, rather than having them just stop the shipment in the first place. This company STINKS, and so does the product!</li>
    <li> The Product is wonderful, I got all the parts i was suppose to get, and it came sooner then i thought it would. Im very happy with my purchase.[[ASIN:B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever spent this much money on.  I have very long hair (past my waist) and wrongly got a perm that doesn&#x27;t do what I want - using this has straightened my hair without breakin off the ends like using a brush and the hair dryer.  It will also curl the ends perfectly.  I&#x27;m very happy with this tool and recommend it to everyone I know.  [[ASIN:B002L5THSI The Original InStyler Rotating Hot Iron Hair Straightener]]</li>
    <li> The instyler is not a good product. On the commerials it looks great, however after I bought it and tried it, WASTE of your money.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  It&#x27;s nice to know that for the first time in my life I have a CHOICE of having full hair or smooth, flat hair.  Works like a charm.  Also, the Amazon price was well below the Walgreen&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I bought the InStyler a couple weeks ago and it works alright.. so far. It gives my hair added bounce and volume which I like but the texture of my hair becomes quite dull and dry. It does not give a shiny sleek finish on its own as suggested on TV. Also, its very easy to get burn, so you cant go to close to the hair root and if you have short hair you would have to be very careful when using it. There is hardly anything spectacular about this product..it is not worth all the hype.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial on TV and decided to give the InStyler a try. I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve tried many similar hair products but nothing else works quite as well as the InStyler. Every woman should have one!!</li>
    <li> First off I have long, thick, semi curly, course hair.  I purchased my Instyler from Walgreen&#x27;s instead of Amazon, it was an impulse buy - I was looking for a nail buff and happened up on it and since I have been curious since I first saw the late night infomercial I purchased one.    I watched the dvd and followed the directions completely.  On clean, non product hair I sectioned off 2 to 3 inch sections I attempted to straighten my hair... I got frizz.      To be honest with you I took one section of hair and straightened it exactly 14 times before I got a semi straight fly away look.  My Chi straightener straightens my hair in one swipe, two at most and with no fly aways or frizz and looks shiny and so does my IQ straightener that I got at Sally&#x27;s for less than half the price.  I paid $99 for my Instyler and what I got was frizzy hair that smells like it has been burned.    To be fair I tried it on my mothers hair which is very short and fairly straight.  She got a cute curl and some nice volume however the curl and volume did not last very long but she did like the results so I gave her mine.    My opinion:    It might be fine for those women who have medium to short hair that is fairly straight already.  My concern is that your told not to use any product but any hair stylist will tell you to protect your hair with a thermal protector.    If you insist on buying this product at least get it from Amazon since I saw it on a minute ago for $69.00.      Good luck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a mom of 2 and never have time to spend on my hair let alone blow drying it.  But the InStyler is great because it really does work well for those on the go.  It heats up super fast and is ready to use within seconds.  I have stick straight hair but the InStyler makes it smooth and shiny and gives it a little oomph so it looks polished.  I love that you can spend as little or as much time you want on your hair with this product because it truly does work and it&#x27;s so easy to use.  I&#x27;ll never have an excuse for a bad hair day again!</li>
    <li> It works but not near as amazing as it&#x27;s made out to be in the commercials. It does straighten but not without causing frizz, I can&#x27;t get it to curl my hair more than a slight wave. And it does flick but you can&#x27;t count on it staying flicked for very long. I stopped using it and went back to my $20 flat iron, it works better for me.</li>
    <li> I loved this product as I was able to get some volume from my fine, thin hair. However, the end cap on the rotating barrel fell off while in use. The screw that holds it all together is inside the cap so even my handyman husband could not fix this. Fortunately, I purchased this from a company that gives refunds - no questions asked. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. It is also easy to burn your head if your hair is short.</li>
    <li> I took a risk getting this because I read a few mixed reviews, however, this product is amazing! I have extremey curly hair and with the Instyler its done in less then 45 minutes. Its not as amzing as it looks i nthe commercial, but pretty close! I love the comb that comes with it, its so nice! I dont like the noise, but its so great i dont mind. i promise you, once you use the instyler, you will never go back to your old hair straightener!</li>
    <li> Straightens hair wonderfully. My neighbor borrowed it. She has real thick curly hair. It straightened it. My hair is finer and I love the way it looks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I got around to trying it myself and immediately burnt my forehead. The rolling barrel is not encased and is extremely hot and dangerous. It&#x27;s also very easy to inadverently grab near it while styling your hair and touch your skin resulting in yet more burns. I burnt my forehead, back of my head, ears, fingers. Also, there is no safe way to put it down onto your counter or dresser. It does not have a unit prop or stabilizer for lack of words. I would definitely think twice before buying this again. I actually wish my daughter hadn&#x27;t destroyed the packaging because I probably would have returned it. There are other products out there that give the same sort of result that are not such a burn hazard.</li>
    <li> I like the product a lot. It heats up fast and works great.  However, it took longer than they said for delivery.</li>
    <li> The person/company that i purchased from sent a faulty styler, mine never heats up. wouldlike to send it back but dont remember where it came from. Is there any way to track this via amazon?</li>
