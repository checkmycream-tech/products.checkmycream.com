      <li>I LOVE THIS WIG.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Its cheap!</li>
      <li>The top part of the wig had textured pieces (crimped???)</li>
      <li>and it was unopened until i was able to retrieve it...</li>
      <li>Not what I was expecting, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the wig was supposed to come this way.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve told so many people about it already</li>
      <li>Takes a while to style but is easy to wear.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I was able to sell it to a friend for a costume party.</li>
      <li>i guess when you purchase a cheap wig thats excatly what you get.</li>
      <li>Shipping was a month early which was really good.</li>
      <li>And it can be fixed to look gorgeous.</li>
      <li>It is beautiful it looks real and the hair type is soft.</li>
      <li>the wig out for the first time and it was actually more comfortable than my $200 lace front wig.</li>
      <li>, I might have to buy a spare just in case they run out because I love it so so much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long and the top layer is nice and silky.</li>
      <li>It gives the top a lot of volume: way too much volume that can&#x27;t be tamed.</li>
      <li>The seller quickly resolved the problem.</li>
      <li>I tried to wash it to straighted it but its so finely crimped that its pretty much ruined!</li>
      <li>But still isnt worth the money</li>
      <li>just right I will update my review.</li>
      <li>,It is amazing &amp; long</li>
      <li>The long layers and nice, too....</li>
      <li>but if you want an everyday wig spend 10 more bucks for something better.</li>
      <li>I received the wig 2-3 days after I ordered it, the shipping was super fast.  </li>
      <li>and it went into a low ponytail easily, but it would not be good for any other styling.</li>
      <li>There was a lot of shedding on the first brushing, but it still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;2012:&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset about it</li>
      <li>I absolutely recommend buying this wig!</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;bob&amp;#34; top layer hair is crimped (!)</li>
      <li>The color is beautiful, the texture feels real and the length is a little too long but that can be cut, the thing that got to me was the wig came packaged fine</li>
      <li>As i try to show in my picture,  the layer beneath the top is a strange, crimped and fuzzy material.</li>
      <li>the parts that are actually straight are really pretty.</li>
      <li>I got it the day it was suppose to get to me &amp; that wasnt long at all,I put it on &amp; fell in love with it</li>
      <li>It was very shiny, straight, and pretty.</li>
      <li>The color is fine, so is the length, but the only thing that confuses me is the textured part of the wig.</li>
      <li>It is a very scene style wig.</li>
      <li>Over all, I am very unsatisfied.</li>
      <li>underneath the straight layers.  </li>
      <li>It makes the top of my wig around my face extremely spherical and i can&#x27;t make it lay</li>
      <li>Like I said it can fixed to look pretty.</li>
      <li>It came in the mail extremely early, and at first I was so shocked and happy ; upon opening it up though I was QUICKLY PISSED because it was NOT what I ordered.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I checked the reviews and didn&#x27;t see anyone mention this, so I contacted the seller to ask whether this was normal or if it was just... funky and meant to be that way.</li>
      <li>I also have a large round head, so perhaps I&#x27;m just accustomed to wigs making my head look huge.</li>
      <li>It looked very natural.  </li>
      <li>The hair on the wig is very soft and silky.  </li>
      <li>I am ordering another wig from them hoping its just straight this time and that I can use it daily.</li>
      <li>What I got was only one of the two, but VERY</li>
      <li>The wig is thick and full, it covers well and is a higher quality</li>
      <li>There are two distinct layers that look extremely unnatural together.  </li>
      <li>I ordered under the impression that it would be two things; long and straight.</li>
      <li>The top layer was much shorter than the rest and had this weird crimpy texture underneath (assuming it was for volume)</li>
      <li>My daughter said :When i got the wig , the hair texture , was very strange and not natural at all , i didn&#x27;t like it at all , it got tangled and messy very easily  , i wouldn&#x27;t recommend  this wig</li>
      <li>But on the top underneath a very small section of straight hair is just a bunch of crimped, frizzy mess.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend said it was pretty scary how real it looks, and my friends who know what my real hair looks like thought I was wearing extensions.</li>
      <li>The wig is really sheddy and tangles because its so long, and when you try to comb it, big clumps fall out leaving the net showing.</li>

<li> with other long hair wigs, it looks great out of the package, but once you wear it, the part from the neck down can tangle and is difficult to comb out.  </li>
<li> The wig is long and straight, not full at all.</li>
<li> The longer lengths of the wig are very thin - would love to see something fuller for the longer lengths.  </li>
<li> important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig understanding that it would be long, but it was actually VERY SHORT.</li>
<li> Maybe two ponytails or braids, so long as they are low to the nape of the neck.</li>
<li> flat-</li>
<li> Feels like human hair except for on top layer were it is awkwardly crimped.</li>

<li> that was highly visible and not cute at all.</li>
<li> but I waited too long to go retrieve it.</li>
<li> cuz it was kinda too long for my struture of my face.</li>
<li> I have been getting endless questions lately about where I buy my wig (after I said it was, in fact, a WIG, and NOT my real hair!)</li>
<li> it is very long.</li>
<li> it gives me a very strange look to wear this to work like I have to.</li>
<li> It lasted pretty well through a sci-fi convention in a very humid and sweaty hotel environment and didn&#x27;t rat up too badly.</li>
<li> I returned this wig because as soon as I opened it, the wig was not straight as described.</li>
<li> It makes the wig very puffy so if you order this wig expect to have to thin it out.</li>
<li> I knew buying this would be a risk, since other reviewers were having problems with the wig being singed or \\&quot;crimped\\&quot;.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The color is fine, so is the length, but the only thing that confuses me is the textured part of the wig. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it.</li>
    <li> The color is beautiful, the texture feels real and the length is a little too long but that can be cut, the thing that got to me was the wig came packaged fine but the wig has two layers the top layer is kinked! Like someone crimped it! I tried to wash it to straighted it but its so finely crimped that its pretty much ruined! I&#x27;m pretty upset about it actually I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this wig!!! Its cheap!</li>
    <li> It had random chunks of kinky hair in it!! I would wear a hat with it! You get what you pay for!!</li>
    <li> The wig is thick and full, it covers well and is a higher quality then I was thinking for the price, but is darker and not quire cut as the picture looks.</li>
    <li> This wig is beautiful for the price. And it can be fixed to look gorgeous. However it does have some issues. It has krimped hair in it. It makes the wig very puffy so if you order this wig expect to have to thin it out. Also if you try to pull the wig back, say in half a pony tail the black lining of the cap is very visible. It&#x27;s also very heavy! It&#x27;s more of an auburn or wine color vs. A brown which I didn&#x27;t mind because I think it&#x27;s a gorgeous color. Like I said it can fixed to look pretty. I cut a few inches off as  it is very long. I would say for a night out to dinner or just to hang out. But I wouldnt recommend this very daily use. It&#x27;s way to heavy and inconvenient to wear if you are active. It did show up on time and neatly packaged. I am ordering another wig from them hoping its just straight this time and that I can use it daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what people are talking about with the crimped bits. I didn&#x27;t find them to be all that intrusive. I also have a large round head, so perhaps I&#x27;m just accustomed to wigs making my head look huge. It was very shiny, straight, and pretty. Good chocolate brown color. I used this for a Lara Croft costume and it went into a low ponytail easily, but it would not be good for any other styling. Maybe two ponytails or braids, so long as they are low to the nape of the neck. It lasted pretty well through a sci-fi convention in a very humid and sweaty hotel environment and didn&#x27;t rat up too badly.</li>
    <li> Feels like human hair except for on top layer were it is awkwardly crimped. It is a very scene style wig. Takes a while to style but is easy to wear. Can&#x27;t wear it without a hat or bandana or else it looks pretty fake :/ Maybe for some cosplay or something but if you want an everyday wig spend 10 more bucks for something better. Shipping was a month early which was really good.</li>
    <li> No adult I know can wear it because it is too small. I think it would be great for kids costumes if you want to get creative with the hair.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS WIG. I ordered under the impression that it would be two things; long and straight. What I got was only one of the two, but VERY important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this wig understanding that it would be long, but it was actually VERY SHORT. It barely goes past my eyes!!! I knew buying this would be a risk, since other reviewers were having problems with the wig being singed or \\&quot;crimped\\&quot;. Well nope, mine wasnt EVEN that - I&#x27;d rather ave the wig frizzy so that I could at least FIX it, but this wig is too freaking short!!! It came in the mail extremely early, and at first I was so shocked and happy ; upon opening it up though I was QUICKLY PISSED because it was NOT what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either the guy sending this stuff out got it wrong, or he just doesn&#x27;t care. I sent the seller a message and still have not gotten a reply. I am so pissed that I don&#x27;t even know what to do with the wig. It&#x27;s not even usable like I have no freaking use for it and it doesn&#x27;t suit my face at all. DO NOT BUY.</li>
    <li> I got it the day it was suppose to get to me &amp; that wasnt long at all,I put it on &amp; fell in love with it,It is amazing &amp; long haha :D I say anyone that is thinking about getting this wig should, its worth it! :D</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WIG. MY FAVORITE WIG SELLER! I have been getting endless questions lately about where I buy my wig (after I said it was, in fact, a WIG, and NOT my real hair!) My boyfriend said it was pretty scary how real it looks, and my friends who know what my real hair looks like thought I was wearing extensions. I absolutely recommend buying this wig! I&#x27;ve told so many people about it already, I might have to buy a spare just in case they run out because I love it so so much! XD</li>
    <li> Update 10/2013:&lt;br /&gt;Worn the wig out for the first time and it was actually more comfortable than my $200 lace front wig. It fit my head very nicely and did not slip or move once. A lot of wig caps are too large for my head, but this one was great. There was a lot of shedding on the first brushing, but it still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;2012:&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t worn it out yet, but it is definitely a good quality wig. As with any wig there is always initial shedding coming out of the package, so once I get it just right I will update my review.</li>
    <li> this wig was great but when i moved my head the hair would get in real bad tangles. Ive tried and tried to get the tats out of it. They always come back. i guess when you purchase a cheap wig thats excatly what you get. Atleast now i have halloween hair. But still isnt worth the money</li>
    <li> This is the second wig I&#x27;ve bought from Amazon, and I am very disappointed. The color was as pictured and the parts that are actually straight are really pretty. But on the top underneath a very small section of straight hair is just a bunch of crimped, frizzy mess. I actually tried to return it, but I was having issues with UPS. Since the time to return it has expired all I can do is throw it away, try to sell it online, or cut all that frizzy crap off and buy wefts to sew in. Over all, I am very unsatisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought it to wear in a show.  It looked very natural.  People thought it was my own hair!&lt;br /&gt;As with other long hair wigs, it looks great out of the package, but once you wear it, the part from the neck down can tangle and is difficult to comb out.  Not sure what you can do to avoid it.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.  There are two distinct layers that look extremely unnatural together.  The &amp;#34;bob&amp;#34; top layer hair is crimped (!) wig filler and the longer hair is nicer but looks terrible when paired with the shorter layer.  I&#x27;m really disappointed and I&#x27;ll never ever wear this wig.  No one ever should.  Not even for a costume.  The photo is misleading and I&#x27;m just beside myself with disappointment.</li>
    <li> The style of this wig was very different than described. The top layer was much shorter than the rest and had this weird crimpy texture underneath (assuming it was for volume) that was highly visible and not cute at all. I was very disappointed. Luckily, I was able to sell it to a friend for a costume party.</li>
    <li> It is beautiful it looks real and the hair type is soft.</li>
    <li> Fantastic for the price!</li>
    <li> I had it sent to the wrong house and it was unopened until i was able to retrieve it... I opened the package and the wig was in a complete mess.. half the hair was bent and unfixable and had to be cut out of the wig.. I would send it back but I waited too long to go retrieve it.</li>
    <li> Wig took awhile to get here and I haven&#x27;t worn it out of the house yet but it seems to be nice quality and I am happy with it. Seller&#x27;s communication was prompt. It&#x27;s a gorgeous wig and I will post pictures as soon as I wear it out somewhere.</li>
    <li> My daughter said :When i got the wig , the hair texture , was very strange and not natural at all , i didn&#x27;t like it at all , it got tangled and messy very easily  , i wouldn&#x27;t recommend  this wig</li>
    <li> The wig is long and straight, not full at all. Best wig I HAVE ORDERED.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE the quality. Color is great. I have straightened the bangs to do a flip.&lt;br /&gt;Worked out nice. I had a problem receiving the wig...The seller quickly resolved the problem.</li>
    <li> I returned this wig because as soon as I opened it, the wig was not straight as described. The wig looked like someone had taking a crimping iron to it, so I didn&#x27;t even take it out of the netting or the box.</li>
    <li> Packaged well,beautiful color.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s long and the top layer is nice and silky. The long layers and nice, too.... But then you get to the underneath layer. As i try to show in my picture,  the layer beneath the top is a strange, crimped and fuzzy material. It gives the top a lot of volume: way too much volume that can&#x27;t be tamed. It makes the top of my wig around my face extremely spherical and i can&#x27;t make it lay flat- it gives me a very strange look to wear this to work like I have to. &#x3D;/ Rather disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> I received the wig 2-3 days after I ordered it, the shipping was super fast.  The hair on the wig is very soft and silky.  The longer lengths of the wig are very thin - would love to see something fuller for the longer lengths.  The top part of the wig had textured pieces (crimped???) underneath the straight layers.  Not what I was expecting, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if the wig was supposed to come this way.  I checked the reviews and didn&#x27;t see anyone mention this, so I contacted the seller to ask whether this was normal or if it was just... funky and meant to be that way. The seller was very nice and offered me a refund immediately.  So five stars to the seller, two to three stars for the wig itself.</li>
    <li> The wig is really sheddy and tangles because its so long, and when you try to comb it, big clumps fall out leaving the net showing. The description says that it has skin-like top but it only has skin like stuff the size of a dime! also mine had a bob cut so it looked like a grown out moulett. Terrible wig!!</li>
    <li> I love it but it sheds. Your gonna have shedding with any wig though. Its a good buy. Had to cut a couple of inches off cuz it was kinda too long for my struture of my face. Either then those it a good wig.</li>
