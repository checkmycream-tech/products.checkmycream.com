      <li>Good old BAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like baby powder scents or Ban original scent, though.</li>
      <li>What I love most about this deodorant is that it washes off as easily as it comes on, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and it just has an overall light feel to it.</li>
      <li>It just smells like clean laundry.</li>
      <li>I like the clean fragrance</li>
      <li>I recommend the Fresh Cotton by Ban, If you like gel, the Power Gel by Mitchum in Sport scent, &amp; if you like a solid the Clean Control Scent by Mitchum is a great choice as well.</li>

      <li>and i had to pay full price, I&#x27;d almost cry.  </li>

      <li>Luckily it is a scent that</li>
      <li>It is long-lasting and it smells wonderful without being nauseating like some Secret scents.</li>
      <li>This is the only kind of deodorant that works for me.</li>
      <li>My family and I have sensitive skin and most deodorants irritate us.  </li>
      <li>went from 0-60 chicas in just two rolls of a Ban anti-perspirant Fresh Cotton thingy.</li>
      <li>but most stores only carry original scent now.</li>
      <li>This deodorant has a really nice, fresh clean scent and provides protection all day even with heavy activity.  </li>
      <li>I also like Mitchum&#x27;s Advanced Control (Invisible Solid) in the Clean Control</li>
      <li>It is just a nice, clean, fresh scent that either male or female can wear.</li>
      <li>Have used this personal care product for many years for its effectiiveness and ease of application.</li>
      <li>Most deodorants do their job, but I wanted one with enough scent to allow me to tell whether I&#x27;d applied it without feeling perfumed.</li>
      <li>I like the roll on deodorant the best, but it&#x27;s always $5-7 at the store, which is way to expensive.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and get major headaches if they are strong.  </li>

      <li>Good amount to last for months even with everyday use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ban since high school.</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to scents - the scent is mild enough to not give me a headache.</li>
      <li>leaky--go to your local store and buy fresh</li>
      <li>Ban deodorant is an old stand-by for me, and since they came out with the fresh cotton scent, it&#x27;s the only Ban I use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;A reliable, clean-smelling deodorant and antiperspirant from the &amp;#34;good old days.&amp;#34;  This is a liquid roll-on and the roll-on ball</li>

    <li> I LOVE the smell, SO FRESH! I have loved this deodorant since I was 16, and I am now 24. Keeps me fresh most of the day. What I love most about this deodorant is that it washes off as easily as it comes on, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and it just has an overall light feel to it.</li>
    <li> Like I said in the &#x27;header&#x27;, &amp;#34;Its a deodorant&amp;#34;.  Excellent price for a major national brand.  Do recommend, quick shipping!</li>

    <li> This deodorant rolls on easy and so far hasn&#x27;t left any noticeable marks or residue on my cloths. I am on the sweaty side, but it keeps me relatively sweat free... it isn&#x27;t as good as the thick white solid stuff, but it&#x27;s good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice. I&#x27;m a man but it isn&#x27;t too feminine. It just smells like clean laundry.</li>
    <li> Been increasing my automatic shopping list. Lot cheaper are my everyday products I use on Amazon.</li>
    <li> leaky--go to your local store and buy fresh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ban since high school. Others give me a rash. I don&#x27;t like baby powder scents or Ban original scent, though. This has a nice light scent that I like, yet doesn&#x27;t smell too girlie for my husband to use.</li>
    <li> Great in theory, but magnetic strap doesn&#x27;t hold case together when my cards are all inside.  Color is great.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to scents - the scent is mild enough to not give me a headache. Lasts through out the day. Good amount to last for months even with everyday use.</li>
    <li> i love this scent so much but most stores only carry original scent now. trust me if you like ban roll on this scent or satin breeze are to killah not to buy.</li>
    <li> Good old BAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A reliable, clean-smelling deodorant and antiperspirant from the &amp;#34;good old days.&amp;#34;  This is a liquid roll-on and the roll-on ball is about twice the size of typical deodorants, so coverage is quick and easy.  I like the clean fragrance (not quite sure how to describe &amp;#34;cotton&amp;#34;--suffice it to say it smells clean and natural, not sweet or intrusive).  Doesn&#x27;t sting, even after underarm shaving.  The Subscribe &amp; Save price here at Amazon&#x27;s an excellent deal for a two pack; I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> I like the roll on deodorant the best, but it&#x27;s always $5-7 at the store, which is way to expensive. Here I pay $4 a pack + I get &#x27;subscribe and save&#x27; savings because I have this set to resend every 4 months.</li>
    <li> No mess, no fuss, no stinky weird girl or boy smell ... lasts all day ... even in the Texas heat playing Soccer!</li>
    <li> I was looking for something comprable to the Ban dedorant that until very recently was sold at the Dollar Tree.  It worked well and the price didnt&#x27; hurt.  Be advised, this isn&#x27;t it, not sure why but this version of a roll on Ban doesn&#x27;t quite do the &amp;#34;job&amp;#34; for me.  I was disappointed, could be a matter of body chemistry but I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
    <li> I am so loving the fragrance of this roll-on!  It is very fresh and doesn&#x27;t compete with my favorite perfumes.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Works great.</li>
    <li> I used to stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even break a sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from 0-60 chicas in just two rolls of a Ban anti-perspirant Fresh Cotton thingy.</li>
    <li> Been using Ban deodorant for over 25 years..the price was great..what a deal</li>
    <li> Best deodorant ever, especially for women going through hormonal changes.</li>
    <li> Have used this personal care product for many years for its effectiiveness and ease of application.</li>
    <li> Mi esposo suda mucho, y este desodorante ha sido el único que lo ha ayudado con eso. Es muy bueno, y el olor es rico, aunque es mejor el azul.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s to say. I&#x27;s deodorant.I buy this deodorant because it&#x27;s one of a few that don&#x27;t give me a rash. That&#x27;s not to say that other&#x27;s may not get a rash. It&#x27;s individual.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is a great deodorant. It is the only one my husband wants to use. Unfortunately it is VERY difficult to find in stores anymore. Luckily it is a scent that Amazon carries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This anti-perspirant/deodorant does a very good job. It is just a nice, clean, fresh scent that either male or female can wear. I used to always use this as well but when we started having problems finding it I went with Mitchum. I use the men&#x27;s variety (Mitchum) in the Power Gel (Sport Scent is my favorite although I have used the Mountain Air too). I also like Mitchum&#x27;s Advanced Control (Invisible Solid) in the Clean Control scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe Ban &amp; Mitchum are some of the best anti-perspirants/deodorants available. If you like roll-ons I recommend the Fresh Cotton by Ban, If you like gel, the Power Gel by Mitchum in Sport scent, &amp; if you like a solid the Clean Control Scent by Mitchum is a great choice as well. I think all of these provide 24+ hours of odor protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE any deodorant that smells of Baby Powder which you often find out there. I prefer clean, fresh scents. Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Most deodorants do their job, but I wanted one with enough scent to allow me to tell whether I&#x27;d applied it without feeling perfumed.This has a mild, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> My family and I have sensitive skin and most deodorants irritate us.  Ban is the only deodorant that we can use without any problems.  It does it&#x27;s job without any irritation even after shaving.  I love the multipacks.</li>
    <li> Like the deoderent, works well...BUT.....it is not invisable as stated on the bottle.  It leaves white residue on your clothes:(  Will not purcahse again.</li>
    <li> We both use it. Checked with Dermatologist, as both are cancer survivors, and she recommended Ban. We buy it through Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program to save 15 percent. Living in the deep South we depend on Ban.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a really nice, fresh clean scent and provides protection all day even with heavy activity.  I like how simple it is to apply too.</li>
    <li> The best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used! I already knew the ban trademark for a while, and the Fresh Cotton worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> well this is just not one of the good old guys.  been using ban for decades but this one sucks.</li>
    <li> This is a good price, and this product has always been effective for me.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and get major headaches if they are strong.  This scent is pleasant and very mild.</li>
    <li> I have been using Ban for years but i love buying this on Amazon in subsribe and save 2-packs because i not only save money, i get it delivered to my door. I love Ban. It works and it does not leave stains or white marks on your clothing. This was a scent i had not seen in my stores, Cotton. I will keep buying this as long as Amazon offers it. It is a great product</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I have found, next to Avon-which I will not buy again because of an obnoxious design flaw. It is long-lasting and it smells wonderful without being nauseating like some Secret scents.</li>
    <li> Ban deodorant is an old stand-by for me, and since they came out with the fresh cotton scent, it&#x27;s the only Ban I use.  A nice, subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower your senses and it works great!</li>
    <li> Works great and the scent is nice.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Item is just as described. Thank-you.</li>
    <li> Have never liked any other deodorant/antiperspirant better in over 40 years. Works better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> good price...only brand I use</li>
    <li> This is the only kind of deodorant that works for me. I have tried many that have not worked. I must have a weird PH balance because I only sweat when I am cold. I am so glad I bought these.</li>
