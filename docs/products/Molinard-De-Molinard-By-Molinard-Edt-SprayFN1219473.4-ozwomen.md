      <li>The price was in our budget and now we have one happy Mom .</li>
      <li>I had sort of forgotten about it and then remembered what a great scent</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with the shipping time and purchase (❍ᴥ❍ʋ)</li>
      <li>that happy memory!&lt;br /&gt;( ˘ ³˘)</li>
      <li>She is very satisfied with it and me too.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne!</li>
      <li>He received so many compliments from co-workers, his sisters, and his mom!</li>
      <li>One of my favorite fragrances ever!</li>
      <li>excellent product and shipping was fast</li>
      <li>tell me how nice my parfume is.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find my signature fragrance available at Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love the scent it leaves lingering in my closet as well as on my skin.</li>
      <li>This has always been my favorite.</li>
      <li>My favorite fragrance .</li>
      <li>Got many compliments.</li>
      <li>&quot; I detect, but it is a sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>I love it..</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>this is not the original in any way shape or form!</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad it is still available.</li>
      <li>Feels fresh, settle and warm.</li>
      <li>(perfumes in Ross would not come in protective cases as they do now) and decided it was strong, oriental, yet retained a soft pleasant aroma.</li>
      <li>I firmly believe that beautiful fragrances do endure!</li>
      <li>It was delivered as promised and I am thrilled to find a new source for my special perfume!</li>
      <li>The original Molinard has a fantastic fragrance that everybody comments on, whenever I wear it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is strong at first but through out the day becomes much a more gentle and lovely aroma</li>
      <li>It truly is or was an original</li>
      <li>I wore it regularly and LOVED it.  </li>
      <li>I always liked the scents from the house of Molinard de Molinard, and this is one of my old time fragrances.</li>
      <li>I do use it at other times because for some reason I feel great when I wear it.</li>
      <li>only that it makes me feel more &amp;#34;holidayish&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>This is my to go perfume right now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, when I got this, it smelled like Right Guard.  </li>
      <li>I am not quite sure if it is just a different display box</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Perfume Emporium\\&quot; here in California, which has consistently sent me the REAL Molinard de Molinard.</li>
      <li>it is a gentle and very feminine scent.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-No damages, perfume aroma was new and crisp, factory sealed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was a complete Molinard de Molinard addict in the eighties.  </li>
      <li>It is a heavy scent but not at all sweet.  </li>
      <li>So when I was very young (about 8,9,or 10) I found and purchased Molinard (the only Molinard I saw on the shelf) in a Ross store as a gift for my father.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a scent that is not cloying or cheap smelling.</li>
      <li>It is really good for when the weather turns cold.</li>
      <li>again, not sure if its just the box that changed, if it is a true Molinard or a knock off</li>

    <li> excellent product and shipping was fast</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a scent that is not cloying or cheap smelling. This has always been my favorite.</li>
    <li> I always liked the scents from the house of Molinard de Molinard, and this is one of my old time fragrances. I love the scent it leaves lingering in my closet as well as on my skin. It truly is or was an original and I&#x27;m glad it is still available. I cannot describe the \\&quot;notes\\&quot; I detect, but it is a sophisticated scent. I firmly believe that beautiful fragrances do endure!</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, but the product I was sent is a knock-off from the REAL Molinard de Molinard. I will never buy from another dealer, but \\&quot;Perfume Emporium\\&quot; here in California, which has consistently sent me the REAL Molinard de Molinard. The original Molinard has a fantastic fragrance that everybody comments on, whenever I wear it. Never buy from another perfume store.</li>
    <li> It was old and it was the worst smell I ever had smelled, I cant wear it and they wont refund my money. I tried to return it and they refuse.It was a very dark color nothing like it was suppose to be, I will never buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> I use this perfume during the holidays. I can&#x27;t say why...only that it makes me feel more &amp;#34;holidayish&amp;#34;! I do use it at other times because for some reason I feel great when I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is the perfume that I had in my younger years. I am now 50 years and I still love it. The men were crazy about this perfume ...</li>
    <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s mother had us looking for this perfume a few years ago while vacationing. We ask around and could not find it. She ask about it again during the holiday and I look it up on Amazon and found it. She was very happy to get it.  The price was in our budget and now we have one happy Mom .</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance .</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne! Thank you, Amazon, for getting it to me!</li>
    <li> simple but tastefully</li>
    <li> So when I was very young (about 8,9,or 10) I found and purchased Molinard (the only Molinard I saw on the shelf) in a Ross store as a gift for my father. Yes my father. The box was labeled Unisex (no Molinard label on the box or bottle which might explain what it was doing in Ross) so I took a whiff (perfumes in Ross would not come in protective cases as they do now) and decided it was strong, oriental, yet retained a soft pleasant aroma. So obviously I purchase, gave it to my father, he went to work, and boy was he chipper when he came back! He received so many compliments from co-workers, his sisters, and his mom! They all wanted to know what he was wearing! He didn&#x27;t know what I had given him due to the lack of labels so could not say what perfume it was.&lt;br /&gt;LONG STORY SHORTER  LOL&lt;br /&gt;It is strong at first but through out the day becomes much a more gentle and lovely aroma ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ&lt;br /&gt;Brings me back that happy memory!&lt;br /&gt;( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)♥ ( ˘ ³˘)&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;br /&gt;-The package arrived in about 1 week (a little less I believe) which was much quicker than the estimate given to me which was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;-No damages, perfume aroma was new and crisp, factory sealed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing struck me as odd, the Molinard in the display picture was not exactly given to me. I am not quite sure if it is just a different display box but this is what I recived:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41zCqGN5QmL.jpg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, not sure if its just the box that changed, if it is a true Molinard or a knock off&lt;br /&gt;I let my father smell it and he said it was Molinard&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the shipping time and purchase (❍ᴥ❍ʋ)</li>
    <li> I was delighted to find my signature fragrance available at Amazon. It was delivered as promised and I am thrilled to find a new source for my special perfume!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances ever!</li>
    <li> Molinard De Molinard by Molinard for Women is the best eau De Toilette that my wife has used. She is very satisfied with it and me too.</li>
    <li> I have worn Molinard for decades and this product is not genuine.  The scent is odd, and even the cap on the bottle does not fit.  I am returning it immediately.</li>
    <li> Excellent // I love it.. When I can I will purchase another one .. of course. Tanks for this purchase</li>
    <li> It is a heavy scent but not at all sweet.  I have used it for years.  It is really good for when the weather turns cold.</li>
    <li> I used to wear it long time ago.  Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store so I was very happy when I found it with you.  Deliciuos.</li>
    <li> I have worn this scent since 1980.  I can put it on and not be overwhelmed by its scent hours later.  It is still there for others tell me how nice my parfume is.</li>
    <li> it is a gentle and very feminine scent. Feels fresh, settle and warm. I wear it on a daily basis. Got many compliments. This is my to go perfume right now.</li>
    <li> I was a complete Molinard de Molinard addict in the eighties.  I wore it regularly and LOVED it.  I had sort of forgotten about it and then remembered what a great scent it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I got this, it smelled like Right Guard.  If  you like me are looking for a nostalgia trip, forget about it.  this is not the original in any way shape or form!</li>
