      <li>Nice product and arrived on time.</li>
      <li>so I could make my own luxurious almond-smelling lotion for cheaper than buying the Jafra royal almond stuff which smells woooooooonderful</li>
      <li>i might just have to go to wholefoods and get my own rather than trusting these online sellers.</li>
      <li>like a yucky (as opposed to nice), poisonous burnt wood smell.</li>
      <li>The bottle has a nice dispenser type flip cap.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice oil.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it should smell good or not, but the smell wasn&#x27;t a potent yummy smell.</li>
      <li>But, I love it and again, very pleased and will buy again.</li>
      <li>it shipped quickly and the product itself is great.</li>
      <li>I love the feeling on the skin (much better than after all those skin lotions!)</li>
      <li>This almond oil absorbs really nicely and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your the skin like some oils.</li>
      <li>This sweet almond oil makes a pretty awesome leave-in conditioner for my hair.</li>
      <li>Sweet Almond Oil itself five stars because the first bottle I got was just exquisite.</li>
      <li>A bit oily when you first apply, but absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves your skin wonderfully moisturized.</li>
      <li>Who would deodorize something that smells so good, then not tell their customers, um, by the way, this has no smell in case you were expecting, um, a sweet almond oil to have an almond smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and not too greasy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Almond Oil.</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and has almost no smell.  </li>
      <li>mama is in love with it.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I just logged on to purchase more of this oil and thought I&#x27;d write a review.</li>
      <li>We use this in our house for a massage oil and we love the slip of it and the scent.  </li>
      <li>Was pleasantly pleased...</li>
      <li>Will buy more from this vender</li>
      <li>Quality product, great price, and fast delivery.</li>
      <li>i love this  oil, i give it a five star rating.</li>
      <li>I also add this oil to my lotions to make more moisture.  </li>
      <li>, I love the smell.</li>
      <li>What could be better?</li>
      <li>No nasty toxic chemicals that cause allergies &amp; sickness!  </li>
      <li>I love this oil.</li>
      <li>The price is pretty good</li>
      <li>Its also great as a massage oil, and pour a little in a bath and great for the body.        </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for whatever your natural needs are!  </li>
      <li>Fast, good packaging.</li>
      <li>Very mild almond scent.  </li>
      <li>... as others have noted, getting the amount you want into your hand isn&#x27;t so easy, hence the four instead of five stars.</li>
      <li>It came very quickly.</li>
      <li>It has a nice light scent, absorbs nicely (it does need a few minutes) and best of all, it&#x27;s all natural and organic!</li>
      <li>Jojobo oil is good, but it doesn&#x27;t combat dry skin as good as Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
      <li>And, the texture was thinner, a lot less wonderful.</li>
      <li>This is a really light oil, but I don&#x27;t use this on my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a great hand moisturizer, no waiting to open doors or anything.</li>
      <li>The texture is indescribable in it&#x27;s luxury and the fragrance is a light nutty almond.</li>
      <li>Its really good if your into natural products...</li>
      <li>It squirts out the perfect amount of oil at a time, and leaves no oily mess in the lid or bottle at all!</li>
      <li>This sweet almond oil is my absolute favorite -- no need to spend more $ on fancy brand argan oil.</li>
      <li>So I LOVE that this oil is pure !</li>
      <li>It moisturizes nicely, but I don&#x27;t think all almond oils are equal because I tried some at Whole Foods (I WISH I could remember the brand) and it absorbed sooo nicely!  </li>
      <li>Feels light and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
      <li>You could probably add your favorite fragrance essential oil to this to create your own blend.</li>
      <li>This Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil 4 oz is really and truly a lovely oil.</li>
      <li>I bought it thinking it would smell like sweet almond  </li>
      <li>When you order sweet almond oil, you assume it will smell like almonds</li>
      <li>I have used the sweet Almond organic for over a year.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received it quickly and it was packaged very well. I love this almond oil and makes my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a good oil but it gave me cystic acne and now I have scars. :( I use argan oil it&#x27;s a 0 on the pore clogging scale.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a base to mix with several other oil combinations.  I love that it&#x27;s organic and has almost no smell.  EXCELLENT product, and amazon&#x27;s price is so much better than almost any store!</li>
    <li> I chose this&#x27;s particular sweet almond because it was a pure oil. Was pleasantly pleased...good product. Will buy more from this vender</li>
    <li> Very well packaged, natural, potent and worth every cent.  Highly recommend these for those into alternative medicines/healing/wellness.  Aura Cacia makes a great product.  Their quality control is a standard I feel comfortable with.</li>
    <li> This sweet almond oil makes a pretty awesome leave-in conditioner for my hair. And blended with some shea butter, it makes the best moisturizer for my feet! However, it&#x27;s really hard with this bottle to get just a few drops out. You have to apply a lot of pressure and then you get a big squirt. If there was some way to control the amount of product you squeeze out, I would give this five stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to put inside my nose to combat winter dryness. It works wonders! Apply with a q-tip!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used sweet almond oils before that smelled that had a distinct rich almond smell, but this product had no smell.  It moisturizes nicely, but I don&#x27;t think all almond oils are equal because I tried some at Whole Foods (I WISH I could remember the brand) and it absorbed sooo nicely!  This product is ok, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing sadly because the price is nice.</li>
    <li> Same description. Just different bottle color. May just be new. I just used it in a body butter. I don&#x27;t know if it should smell good or not, but the smell wasn&#x27;t a potent yummy smell. Not sure if that matters with almond oil.</li>
    <li> Not what expected or described as in picture. No &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; scent...smelled like vegetable oil. Save your money and look somewhere else.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great for massaging, and for the most awesome foot rub.  Leaves your skin feeling wonderful.  A bit oily when you first apply, but absorbs into the skin quickly and leaves your skin wonderfully moisturized.</li>
    <li> Soaks into the skin beautifully and breakout prone areas do just fine.  Softens skin but if you&#x27;re dry you may need something more.  It&#x27;s also a great hand moisturizer, no waiting to open doors or anything.</li>
    <li> This is a really light oil, but I don&#x27;t use this on my skin. The Sweet Almond oil is a part of a mixture of organic essential oils for my hair. This concoction of shea butter, coconut oil and other oils has really revived my natural coils.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful all organic oil!  I bought it to make my own lip balm.  It is a dream to use!  The Almond smell is not overpowering at all.  The bottles are a bit small but depending on your needs, they may last a while....I made a lot of lip balm with maybe a 1/2 bottle.  A lot!  Enough for the year I should think!  It&#x27;s great for whatever your natural needs are!  I will certainly purchase this again when I run out!  Good for the environment.  Good for you!  No nasty toxic chemicals that cause allergies &amp; sickness!  Just pure Organic Oil.  What could be better?</li>
    <li> I do like this oil, no odor and goes on like silk. However the bottle has a sort of valve that keeps the oil from coming out too quickly and it means that the bottle has to be squeezed - really hard, and it&#x27;s not a soft bottle. I have arthritis and it&#x27;s literally a pain, so I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> perfect make-up remover out there</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful oil! Cheap and great quality, would buy this again. The only thing is the way this bottle dispenses, isn&#x27;t good. Too much of it will squirt out and therefore, wastes product.</li>
    <li> I use this on my hair and body.  it makes my skin soft and it keeps my hair moisturized.  I mix it with some essential oils for my hair.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift. My friend loved it. I will try it for myself in the future! She said her skin looked amazing!</li>
    <li> Nice product and arrived on time. Would order again.</li>
    <li> I use it on my hands and elbows at night right before bed. Loved the product. Its really good if your into natural products...</li>
    <li> Purchased to use in a recipe for a skin lotion.  The almond oil and shea butter mixture solved all of my dry cracked fingertips this winter.  Quality product, great price, and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing after a shower.  I also add this oil to my lotions to make more moisture.  Great to have on hand.</li>
    <li> wonderful, I recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Im in love with this Organic product!! the USDA label made me trust it. Iv been using it on my face and it does not leave my skin all oily. Its great, yeah kinda pricey but I only use a few drops on my face a day and Im going to use some for my homemade lotions so it should last. This Stay at home mama is in love with it. :)  Doesn&#x27;t have a almond smell but I didn&#x27;t expect it to because its an OIL.</li>
    <li> I use this as an all over body moisturizer once or twice per week for dry skin.  You do need to wait about 5-10 minutes for it to absorb into the skin after showering, so don&#x27;t use it when you&#x27;re in a hurry to get dressed (not oily after it&#x27;s absorbed).  However, it&#x27;s worth the extra time because you&#x27;ll immediately notice how hydrated your skin feels with one use.  And the effect seems to last for several days without using any other products after showering.  One tip - don&#x27;t purchase an oil where sweet almond oil is combined with several other oils, I&#x27;ve found pure sweet almond oil by itself works much better.</li>
    <li> This was a gift.....recipient was very pleased</li>
    <li> I have used the sweet Almond organic for over a year. I usually mix it with the rose hip oil and honey and use it as a mask. It has moisturized my skin, I do not have wrinkles, but minimize the small laugh lines and has nourished my skin. I would like to add my skin is naturally oily and extremely sensitive. Its also great as a massage oil, and pour a little in a bath and great for the body.        AP, Bronx NY</li>
    <li> I mix this with vitamin E and essential oils to make a hydrating facial cream for night.  It might be a bit too oily for daytime use under make-up, though.  Very mild almond scent.  Feels light and absorbs into skin quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil for my baby. Problem is the bottle. It&#x27;s very hard to push the liquid out and when I can, a lot of oil comes out at once. Not so good for use to little by little...</li>
    <li> Excellent product, thank you.</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with unscented lotion so I could make my own luxurious almond-smelling lotion for cheaper than buying the Jafra royal almond stuff which smells woooooooonderful but is so pricy. When you order sweet almond oil, you assume it will smell like almonds but this smells like cooking oil. Lo and behold, on the bottle it says it has been put through a deodorizing process. How stupid! Who would deodorize something that smells so good, then not tell their customers, um, by the way, this has no smell in case you were expecting, um, a sweet almond oil to have an almond smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of $$$ but not worth returning.</li>
    <li> i love this  oil, i give it a five star rating. but unfortunately i ordered from the wrong company: Phenomstore, because when my oil came it stinks like burnt wood. it&#x27;s not fresh. i&#x27;m going to try to return it. i might just have to go to wholefoods and get my own rather than trusting these online sellers.</li>
    <li> I only use organic ingredients in my hair. This oil works perfectly. I mix it with my other oils and add it to my conditioner. I usually keep my conditioner in for about an hour before washing it out, and my hair feels so soft after. This is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product, smells like cooking oil, nothing like almonds!!&lt;br /&gt;I am pregnant, and when I opened the bottle I wanted to throw up. Maybe the kept the bottle for too long and lost the almond scent.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! it shipped quickly and the product itself is great. I use it on the ends of my hair and as a face cleanser before I go to bed. Good quality for a good price.</li>
    <li> I used this oil to make a facial scrub and it leaves your skin very soft.  It smells great too.</li>
    <li> the oil is very soothing on the skin. I was a little disappointed that it was unscented because I love the smell of almond oil and was hoping the almond scent would cut down the shea butter smell of my body butter. But the almond oil blended well in the body butter.</li>
    <li> It was good for my baby. Johnsons baby oil was making rashes so we bought this.it is nice organic product.</li>
    <li> A family member recommended this during pregnancy and she didn&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. She was also tiny throughout her pregnancy and I think is blessed with good genes. I had a much larger baby and gained way more weight than her, but also managed to avoid them! I put this on religiously after every shower, and didn&#x27;t see a single stretch mark! It has a nice light scent, absorbs nicely (it does need a few minutes) and best of all, it&#x27;s all natural and organic! My mother had stretch marks due to her pregnancies so genetics did not have a part in this! Try this out, I hope it works for everyone!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very please with this purchase. The oil is organic, light - not heavy. It&#x27;s came perfectly wrap. The bottle has a nice dispenser type flip cap.  When you try to squeeze out the oil you&#x27;ll get about a tablespoon at a time. If you want less -jut take off the cap and let it come out slowly. But, I love it and again, very pleased and will buy again.Thank you!</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local store and from Amazon and the one from Amazon was significantly darker in its texture. Most likely the oil was aged and not current stock. I returned it as defective!!! And yes the bottle is lousy, it always squirts more than you want to use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for baby massage. Gentle - and doesn&#x27;t cause a rash like other massage oils.</li>
    <li> I just logged on to purchase more of this oil and thought I&#x27;d write a review. When I get a massage, I want an organic unscented oil used . I want to know what&#x27;s being absorbed by my body. I have many allergies and a chemical sensitivity, so fragrance added, chemical or natural can cause me to have a reaction.  So I LOVE that this oil is pure ! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer also. Good job Aura Cacia, you have a life long customer!</li>
    <li> This almond oil absorbs really nicely and doesn&#x27;t sit on top of your the skin like some oils. The aroma is light and pleasant!</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer.  It has a new bottle, which is different that what is shown in the photo, but it is organic and 100 pure almond oil.  Seller did great also.  Fast, good packaging.</li>
    <li> This Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil 4 oz is really and truly a lovely oil. The texture is indescribable in it&#x27;s luxury and the fragrance is a light nutty almond. I use it after every single shower because it leaves my skin protected and very soft. I ran out of the 4 ounce size that I first bought quickly. I bought that first wonderful bottle at D. M. E. Online Sales Inc. through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another 4 ounce bottle through Amazon from Red TAG sale. I like 4 ounces because it&#x27;s a size that won&#x27;t go stale in summer weather. Anyway, I was shocked that although the bottle and color of the oil within were the same as the first order the scent and the texture were not. I thought that there was something wrong with my nose that it should smell so bad! It&#x27;s not really a rancid smell so much as a weird, unpleasant smell that the new bottle of Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil has...like a yucky (as opposed to nice), poisonous burnt wood smell. And, the texture was thinner, a lot less wonderful. In short, I am not using it. I called Whole Foods here in Vancouver, WA and asked if they carry Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil 4 oz. The girl said yes and that it sells for only 5.99. So, I guess I&#x27;m both applauding and, yet, warning about purchasing this brand of sweet almond oil, at least online. RED TAG sale sold me something not at all like what I first got from D. M. E. sales. IF you must buy online try D. M. E. online sales! I will not buy from Red Tag sale again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I give Aura Cacia Sweet Almond Oil itself five stars because the first bottle I got was just exquisite. I don&#x27;t think the 2nd bottle reflected on the manufacturer (in Germany) but that the seller RED TAG sale likely is selling old oil or even adulterated oil.</li>
    <li> Jojobo oil is good, but it doesn&#x27;t combat dry skin as good as Sweet Almond Oil. I mix it with Macadamian Oil.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I love the feeling on the skin (much better than after all those skin lotions!), I love the smell. Would never buy skin lotions again.</li>
    <li> This is a nice oil. It came very quickly. The top made using the oil very convient. It was also received timely.</li>
    <li> This oil is odorless.  I bought it thinking it would smell like sweet almond  but it doesn&#x27;t.  You could probably add your favorite fragrance essential oil to this to create your own blend.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair cuticles really soft even though its for your face it softens my hair cuticles to control shedding</li>
    <li> Yes I really like this too.</li>
    <li> Almond oil arrived on time.  I have not yet used the oil, but will update with some comments at a later date.</li>
    <li> ... as others have noted, getting the amount you want into your hand isn&#x27;t so easy, hence the four instead of five stars. I generally remove the cap and pour but that sometimes means wasted product. The oil is excellent for my purposes... for massaging into the skin (I use it every day on my face after the shower). The price is pretty good and if you want organic almond oil, in spite of the container issues, I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> We use this in our house for a massage oil and we love the slip of it and the scent.  It&#x27;s very light and not too greasy and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
    <li> This oil is great, but honestly my favorite thing about it is the bottle. It squirts out the perfect amount of oil at a time, and leaves no oily mess in the lid or bottle at all!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Almond Oil. This stuff however stinks! It just smells like cooking oil. It might feel good on your skin and hair but I won&#x27;t be using it for the smell.</li>
    <li> Daily use of a facial oil has been a miracle worker for my acne-prone, Mediterranean skin. This sweet almond oil is my absolute favorite -- no need to spend more $ on fancy brand argan oil. Trust me!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it (along with other oils) to mix my Shea butter into a cream.</li>
