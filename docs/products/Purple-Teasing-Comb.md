<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Easy to use love it! Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Used this for high school dance team competitions.  We had several teezing brushes, but everyone who did hair seemed to really like this comb the best.  It worked great!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm...fast teasing! Very sturdy...love it...highly recommended....it&#x27;s worth the money.....good for all lengths of hair..a few strokes and u have great volume that lasts</li>
    <li> Gave me little volume that lasted about 5 minutes. Plus there was a long gray hair stuck in the brush, like someone had already used it and placed it back in the packaging. 1 star because the brush is cute, but does not work for fine hair at all.</li>
    <li> My hair is so fine and straight and I had high hopes for this teezer. But. I still have to teeze the same amount as I would with a cheapo plastic teezer. Not very impressed.</li>
    <li> Ordered one for myself....loved it so much I ordered one for my mom, too! If you are looking for a comb to tease your &#x27;do- this is the one to get!</li>
    <li> Love love this.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair teased looking.  Hair is smooth and untangled.  Last for a long time.  Fits nicely in your hand.  Shared with my girlfriends on a recent trip.  All five of us used it.  Everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing that has happened to my hair in my lifetime!  I have thin, fine hair and no matter how I&#x27;ve had it cut, what styling products I&#x27;ve used (including typical teasing combs/brushes), the style always falls flat. Not so with teeze w/eez.  I love this product and will use it forever!</li>
    <li> Best teasing comb ever. My stylist uses one, that&#x27;s why I purchased one for myself. I&#x27;ve tried so many before.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser had one of these and suggested that I get one since I liked \\&quot;big hair\\&quot;. It did not disappoint!It works fast &amp; easy &amp; stays teased! GREAT for anyone with fine hair!</li>
    <li> This comb is amazing!!!!  I just wish I could get 3 more family at the low price of 10.83 I got mine for.  Anyway I&#x27;ve never been able to get the volume from any other comb.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
    <li> EASY to handle and use.  Takes the difficulty out of teasing.  A must have!</li>
    <li> love this comb! fast high volume with less work than other combs. Keep alcohol and strong cleaners away from this comb, as it rubs off easily.</li>
    <li> Love the comb for teasing BUT the color bleeds when it touches water! I&#x27;ve marked up my counter and sink several times! I bought the violet color.</li>
    <li> I placed this order on line. It Came in to my door Real Fast. The Item is Exactly as Described. I like it . No Complain what so ever.Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a good product but I left it on my bathroom sink top and it left pink stains.  There wasn&#x27;t any water or dampness to cause it to bleed so I&#x27;m of the persuasion it was made with cheap materials.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and was skeptical due to the teeth on the comb being thick. The results are amazing.  However.... The color bleeds so I cannot say that I highly recommend this product. I am giving 3 stars instead of 5. Also it&#x27;s a bit over priced for the overall quality.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it.  And I am a champion at teasing my hair.  I&#x27;ve followed instructions with this and watched video.  It&#x27;s my opinion that this doesn&#x27;t work any better or worse than other teasing brushes or combs (or regular brushes and combs for that matter) out there.</li>
    <li> My wife asked me to get this for her and we have since purchased two more for gifts.  It works for her...</li>
    <li> This has just got to be the most wonderful comb out there!  Go big hair!!!!!  A woman cannot be without one of these and am off to buy a few more!!! Kudos to you!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, but does get tangled in hair. Need to smooth out once teased.</li>
    <li> This excellent item works very well on my very senior, baby-fine hair.  I do virtually no teasing and get a good volume regardless.  I recommend this comb.  One drawback, minor and readily dealt with, is an apparent &amp;#34;coat&amp;#34; of unstable color on the handle/frame.  When you get this item, wash it immediately in very warm water/dishwash detergent.  Dry thoroughl.  This worked fine for me.</li>
    <li> high price but worth every peney.choice of color,should and will get another one but smaller size.think i&#x27;ll go 4 the pink one next.</li>
    <li> seems to work for creating volume!</li>
    <li> This is a really neat comb/teaser.  It really does work and saves having to use product to give fullness.  It does not knot the hair and does not look floozy teased, just fuller.</li>
    <li> Makes backcombing a breeze!</li>
    <li> Cute teasing comb.  Works great!</li>
    <li> Works great!  I have to tease my hair and this is a really great  tool. Makes it easy for me, and I have issues with using my arms due to nerve damage.  Makes a nice tight base and holds.</li>
    <li> The last hair styling tool you will need for teasing.</li>
    <li> I loved this comb. It teezes your hair with little effort and the teeze holds. Your hairstyle is as good as the tools you use, and this comb is a definite must have.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and I am finally able to tease it! I bought this for me and then bought more for gifts.</li>
    <li> This tool is great!!!  I&#x27;m not sure how I survived with out it. It really give my hair a boost.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use. Gets the job done!</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine hair. . . no amount of hairspray and &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; backcombing will add anything to my hair, it just falls immediately.  Until now.  Just what I needed for retro styles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the comfortable feel of using this brush. It is good quality and works great. I can use less hairspray when using this because the &amp;#34;tease&amp;#34; stays put ! I&#x27;m glad I bought it !</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the amount of volume I achieved with this product. I can actually get more lift/volume just teezing with a comb. I&#x27;m southern, so I know how to teeze some hair though! This might be great for a beginner, but if you can teeze with a comb, save your money.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and this comb is the best ever for any type of hair. The two rows of teeth on this product get to every hair strand and you get a huge backcombing with out getting your arms tired. I fully recommend this comb. The price is very worth paying.</li>
    <li> Does not tease hair well.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair with the teased look, like a rats nest, they called it, in the &#x27;60&#x27;s. It doesn&#x27;t hurt either; my mom has a teasing comb, and a sensitive scalp, and it hurts her every time, teasing her hair. I let her try this teeze w/eez, and right away, she told me to get one for her. You have volume in just a few seconds. Of course, a little spray helps it stay that way. The rhinestone is a nice touch, I like that.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Ordered three.  Really gives your hair volume!</li>
    <li> I do love this comb.  I use it on a lot of my clients, but I also was able to buy if from the website for 15.00....Keep looking.  It is amazing, but there are better prices.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine, but I have short hair and this would be good for someone with longer hair.  Consider the mini version if you have short hair.</li>
    <li> Gives you some fullness without having to do a lot of backcombing</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have thin hair and it makes my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM!!!! ALL MY FRIENDS WANT ONE!  It is totally awesome.  I will probably order some more for gifts!</li>
    <li> The product is not what I expected. Not worth the money and isn&#x27;t any different from a regular cheaper comb. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this comb.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Purple comb and when it came...on time...I was astounded with the design, construction and color.  I knew then why this product costs so much.  It really does the job and it&#x27;s beautiful to boot.  It&#x27;s very durable, made to last, has a little decorative rhinestone at the comb end on one side and the comb&#x27;s teeth are angled just right so that you don&#x27;t have to go over each section of hair just two to three times...I have found that it is very good for smoothing/blending the top surface of the area of hair that has been backcombed. Purple seems to be all the rage now and this metalic shade is over the top!!!</li>
    <li> ok product. I suppose it depends on your hair, but mine is a bit too fine to benefit from this comb. I found the .79cent comb from the beauty supply place to be more beneficial. But this is a very nice comb. Just doesn&#x27;t work for teasing on my hair.</li>
    <li> This comb truly does perform as promised and is much easier to use than a standard flat comb. You get quick, effortless volume and it does not tear your hair in the process. The color and weight are indicative of a solid product and I would recommend purchasing.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with comb!! A girl needs extra volume and this comb is perfect! I found a video on youtube that showed me exactly hw to use it and I have been having the best hair days ever since!!</li>
    <li> Gives me lift fast and easy!  The technique has you push the hair down from the front and 3 stokes and it works, put not too drastic of a lift.  Great tool for us gals that are flat heads!</li>
    <li> Love this little gem!!!  First time EVER I have been able to tease  my hair...and it was sooooo easy!!!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This teasing comb is fabulous--I have very fine hair and with this comb I can now have volume!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very happy with both product and receiving order so quickly.</li>
    <li> Bought this after recommendation by my hairdresser. Design is well thought out and different from others on the market, but a bit pricey ($25.00).</li>
