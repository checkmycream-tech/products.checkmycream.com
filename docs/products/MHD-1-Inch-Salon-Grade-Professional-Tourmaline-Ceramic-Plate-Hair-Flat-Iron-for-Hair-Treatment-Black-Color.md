      <li>Does great on fine to medium hair but would not recommend for natural or course hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Update to original review:  I was finally able to return the faulty product to Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The heating plates have some give when compressed and hair slides easily through.</li>
      <li>It gets hot very quickly, and the ability to choose the temperature you want is nice.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>Super glad I bought this.</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m great with a flat iron and have ringlet curly hair, this had to be used many many times on the highest heat which was not that hot, returned</li>
      <li>I do not see any difference in my hair as all the straighteners claim to make hair shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>It heats up to the desired degree in seconds and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
      <li>It pulls through really smooth, no snagging.</li>
      <li>right now it made it look so healthy</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the feel and operation of this flat iron from the beginning.</li>
      <li>I have contacted the Amazon seller requesting a full refund, as the phone number for the company included in the packaging is no longer a working number.  </li>
      <li>Its not a bad price</li>
      <li>So easy to use, heats up super fast and straightened my hair in minutes!</li>
      <li>You can grip the ends when straitening because they get very hot, so use a comb.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this flat iron and only have just begun to use it.</li>
      <li>It does, however, give a more natural look to my hair.  </li>
      <li>So far I am satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>Excellent flat iron, equally as good as expensive brands.</li>
      <li>Sleek design and heats up super fast!</li>
      <li>Large buttons that increase or decrease temperature are right there!</li>
      <li>This flat iron is awesome, I have thick hair and long hair and work great.</li>
      <li>I liked the smoothness but wished if it is wider for my long hair</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and straightens my hair really well.</li>
      <li>I love it very much, it&#x27;s not heavy &amp; fast to heat up &amp; auto off.</li>
      <li>But it heats up very fast, and gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>have Keratin treatments, so my hair is already smooth, shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has coarse curly hair and this works better than any I have purchased before.</li>
      <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
      <li>Save your money and just buy a better quality Flat Iron.  </li>
      <li>Love this flat iron!</li>
      <li>, it is simple and easy and I can finish style my hair faster than before.</li>
      <li>The iron arrived quickly, and so far seems to be working well.  </li>
      <li>When I picked it up to get a closer look, I noticed that the entire unit was very hot!</li>
      <li>with one stoke my hair transforms from frizzy, curly to silky straight.</li>
      <li>I do have to go over my hair a couple of times to get it completely straight, but that could be because I use a lower heat</li>
      <li>but when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready in the morning, sometimes I forget things, but still.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Heats up very well.  </li>
      <li>Everything I expected and more.  </li>
      <li>Would give it a 5 star if it was able to be closed.</li>
      <li>Really recommended.</li>
      <li>but it does heat up fast.</li>
      <li>Better than any other heater bar I used before.</li>
      <li>I accidentally left it on all day and it slightly damaged the laminate bathroom counter (in a rental, so...not good).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another thing is that if I don&#x27;t keep the iron moving at a steady pace, it will almost get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; and leave a dent in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I cannot recommend this item. I used it once, on the lowest heat setting to straighten just my bangs. When I switched it off, I heard a loud pop and noticed that the plates had partially popped off. When I picked it up to get a closer look, I noticed that the entire unit was very hot! I&#x27;m returning this ASAP.</li>
    <li> It literally just got here and I ran up stairs to straighten my hair. It works so good better than any straightener I have ever had. I would recommend it to any one. Heats up literally in seconds. I&#x27;m obsessed with my hair right now it made it look so healthy it&#x27;s like some magic straightener I swear I love you</li>
    <li> Very Impressed. This flat works better than the flat iron i bought for $120 and it usually takes 45mins to 1hr for my hair to be straighten. It took me only 15mins.. I am very happy..</li>
    <li> I love it very much, it&#x27;s not heavy &amp; fast to heat up &amp; auto off. You don&#x27;t have to worry that you forget to unplug it.</li>
    <li> I jusr received my flat iron yesterday. I used it this morning and I LOVE IT!! I HAVE Short hair in the back and longer sides with bangs. With this flat iron, I can finally wing out my sides instead of having them straight down.  I have very thick hair and this flat iron did exactly what I wanted! My hair doesn&#x27;t look as brittle as when I used my old iron. Very happy with this flat iron and only have just begun to use it. Hoping to let my hair grow out some now cuz this iron does an amazing job! Thank you Amazon!:) Definitely 5 stars from me! I can now have salon looking hair and did it by myself!:)</li>
    <li> Came in two days.....love the way it works when straightening or even curling my hair. Leaves my hair feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron, equally as good as expensive brands. My hair is fine and curly, I have no problems with this straightener! Also love the price.</li>
    <li> Works great,  heats up super fast.</li>
    <li> Bought it and shipped it to my daughter.  Ir arrived faster than I thought it would and she was happy with the product.  Great! !</li>
    <li> MHD 008 Pro Hair Straightener. Auto shut off and memory save don’t work. Got a replacement with the same issues. Received them from different companies and neither works as stated.  Purchased for safety of having auto shut off feature, isn’t the product represented on-line or per manual spec. Called manufacturer about it, but no luck because their English was so limited. Unhappiness more with product and manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Uneven heating, but it does heat up fast. Does great on fine to medium hair but would not recommend for natural or course hair.</li>
    <li> This product already broke and I just bought it two months ago. It was working great. Now won&#x27;t turn on and can&#x27;t get it to do anything but can&#x27;t return it through amazon! Not happy</li>
    <li> I need to preface this negative review by saying that the flat iron worked really well and we were very happy with the results -- for the three weeks it actually worked.  The product had not been dropped or damaged in any way.  We did not repeatedly plug and unplug the product either.  It was simply used as usual one morning, left on the counter, and then did not work at all a few hours later.  No display and no heat at all.  I have contacted the Amazon seller requesting a full refund, as the phone number for the company included in the packaging is no longer a working number.  Buyer beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update to original review:  I was finally able to return the faulty product to Amazon.  The company offered me a PARTIAL refund, charging me a restocking fee -- a restocking fee for a FAULTY product that I can only assume they plan to resell to another customer.  Do not do business with this company.</li>
    <li> The iron arrived quickly, and so far seems to be working well.  I don&#x27;t use it everyday, and it&#x27;s a new hair tool for me.  So my knowledge is limited.  But it heats up very fast, and gets the job done.  So far I am satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> There are a number of features of this curling iron that I like. It gets hot very quickly, and the ability to choose the temperature you want is nice. Flat irons, in general, are more &amp;#34;forgiving&amp;#34; than regular curling irons, so if your hair looks a little funky after running the flat iron through it, you can rectify it without a problem. I use it every day.</li>
    <li> Love it! Sleek design and heats up super fast! I love that I can program what temperature I want.</li>
    <li> At this moment it meet all my expectancies; it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I researched and reviews for hours to find myself the best flat iron. I finally decided on one similar to this with titanium plates but then just when i went to order it from Amazon the price went up at least another $10. So I ordered this one, my second choice.  Its fine, nothing much different than the $30 one I bought from Walmart a few years ago.  This one does heat up super fast and it make my hair so hot that my hair has actually burned my fingers bad. I do not see any difference in my hair as all the straighteners claim to make hair shiny and smooth. No pulling on my hair. Its not a bad price and I hope it lasts.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. I got it in 4days.</li>
    <li> I did not care for this flat iron. Thought it would do a great job, but did not srtaighten my hair that well.</li>
    <li> I liked the smoothness but wished if it is wider for my long hair</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchase. It had a five star rating. I will give it 4 stars. My only complaint is that the plates are too short. Otherwise it works great.</li>
    <li> First off, I will say that this did straighten my hair very nicely. I have coarse, thick, wavy hair, and this did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the auto off function does not work at all. I accidentally left it on all day and it slightly damaged the laminate bathroom counter (in a rental, so...not good). Plus, the safety hazard is a big concern. Obviously I try to remember to shut things off but when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready in the morning, sometimes I forget things, but still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the memory function does not work. No matter what temperature I am at, when I hold down the Memory button it goes to 420 degrees. It doesn&#x27;t matter where I try to set it, it just doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The memory function was not a deal breaker, but unfortunately due to the safety hazard I will be returning this. It sounds like other reviewers have had the same problem, with no luck exchanging, so I guess I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand. I&#x27;m growing slightly suspicious of all the poorly written 5-star reviews...</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced, left my hair in salon quality.</li>
    <li> Would give it a 5 star if it was able to be closed.</li>
    <li> Fastest heat up I&#x27;ve ever seen! Great for straightening AND curling. Super glad I bought this. I usually buy the cheap ones from like Walmart, but since I straighten my hair every single day figured I should get a quality one. And I&#x27;m verrrryyy happy with this one!</li>
    <li> The numbers on the digital readout would would race around  ..hard to stop,,,,finally went dead,,will not come on,,,only had a week,,disappointing!!!!!! N</li>
    <li> Great disappointment.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the feel and operation of this flat iron from the beginning. Have had a flat iron for several years that didn&#x27;t have auto-shutoff.  So I decided to try this because of good reviews.  It was very light and difficult to squeeze tight enough to straighten hair.  Now, a month into purchase and maybe five uses it has stopped working.  First time I&#x27;ve purchased something that has failed so quickly.  Hopefully I will be able to return it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has coarse curly hair and this works better than any I have purchased before.</li>
    <li> More than perfect .I love using it , it is simple and easy and I can finish style my hair faster than before. Really recommended.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair iron for the price! It heats up to the desired degree in seconds and leaves my hair smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this flat iron, I bought for my daughter who has African American hair, her hair is very thick thick and this flat iron does a great job, recommend to everyone</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this didn&#x27;t work for me. The plates do not touch together at the bottom. See attached picture. This is a great quality straightener, but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment.  I don&#x27;t see the glowing results others spoke of.</li>
    <li> Better than any other heater bar I used before.</li>
    <li> This is the first flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned that &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; my hair.  It&#x27;s almost like it grasps pieces of hair that I&#x27;m not ironing and tries to pull it in?  I&#x27;m not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Keratin treatments, so my hair is already smooth, shiny and soft.  I can&#x27;t comment on this iron improving that, because my hair is already that way.  It does, however, give a more natural look to my hair.  Some irons that I&#x27;ve had in the past give my hair a straw-like appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing is that if I don&#x27;t keep the iron moving at a steady pace, it will almost get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; and leave a dent in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Heats up very well.  The only issue is that the heat setting will not stay locked in memory when I set it .  So each time I must go back and reset the heat setting to my liking.</li>
    <li> Would have liked it wider -</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally thick, curly, frizzy. My hair is also incredibly long.This iron is the BEST because it is efficient. with one stoke my hair transforms from frizzy, curly to silky straight. It takes TEN minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron! I have fine, curly hair.  It pulls through really smooth, no snagging. I do have to go over my hair a couple of times to get it completely straight, but that could be because I use a lower heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable temperature is awesome, and this thing literally heats up in a matter of seconds! You can watch the temp rise on the digital screen. Also, I use it to curl and straighten, so I have to grab it by different sections, there is no excess heat, it&#x27;s all in the plates so you won&#x27;t burn yourself trying to style your hair.</li>
    <li> So easy to use, heats up super fast and straightened my hair in minutes!</li>
    <li> Unit gets hot quickly and works well to straighten thick hair.</li>
    <li> This product is the best hair straighter we&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend to a friend. ( As with any metal ceramic heater you need to be careful )</li>
    <li> Definitely not professional styling, I&#x27;m great with a flat iron and have ringlet curly hair, this had to be used many many times on the highest heat which was not that hot, returned</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this flat iron. It heats up immediately! The best part for me is the digital display-large numbers placed on the inside are bright and easy to read. Large buttons that increase or decrease temperature are right there! And it does a great job of smoothing out my frizz. I love this product and sent one to my daughter too!</li>
    <li> Terrible flat iron CHINESE BRAND</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more.  Very satisfied..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work well for me.  I think I don&#x27;t know how to use it properly.  (I&#x27;m not very coordinated).</li>
    <li> this thing heats up in 3 seconds and works better and faster than the CHI ceramic.  it takes less than five minutes to finished hair.  i use it whenever i want to look awesome.</li>
    <li> I think It may be generic. When I looked it up on youtube and nothing popped up. However this would be great for a travel iron. You can grip the ends when straitening because they get very hot, so use a comb. The memory settings always bring the temp setting to 420 which isn&#x27;t a huge issue because a temp past that would likely fry your hair. It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product in worked great for about 4 weeks.  As a matter of fact, I gave it 5 stars.  However, after using it less than 10 times, it doesn&#x27;t work at all for no apparent reason.  Not dropped, damaged, nothing like that.  Still in perfect cosmetic condition.  It just won&#x27;t turn on at all.   Save your money and just buy a better quality Flat Iron.  I thought I was getting a deal, instead I threw 40.00 in the garbage.  Also,  the seller does not accept returns, even though the product is still in new condition and I haven&#x27;t even owned it for 5 weeks.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old straightener. My old one took almost an hour to heat up fully and the outside got so hot your couldn&#x27;t touch it. This one has met and exceeded my expectations. It has a great range of temps to heat to and has a memory button. It heats up in about a minute and even gives you a digital temp reading. The cord is long and durable and won&#x27;t kink. When using it it doesn&#x27;t get to hot on the outside you can use your hand to press it on your hair. The heating plates have some give when compressed and hair slides easily through. I would definitely recommend this for your next hair straightener.</li>
    <li> VERY disappointed. The plates don&#x27;t close completely, leading to my hair being pulled and very uneven heating of my hair. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome, I have thick hair and long hair and work great.</li>
    <li> I really like my flat iron. I&#x27;ve been using it constantly for over the past 2 months and it does a fantastic job! It heats up quickly and straightens my hair really well. It&#x27;s so much better than the ConAir that I had (which didn&#x27;t do anything on the highest setting) and does it&#x27;s job! My only (minor) complaint is that the buttons are on the inside of the iron (I would prefer them on the outside so there&#x27;s less of a chance to burn my fingers when reaching for the buttons). If I needed to replace mine for whatever reason, I&#x27;d buy another one of these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the price , heats up fast and does its job</li>
