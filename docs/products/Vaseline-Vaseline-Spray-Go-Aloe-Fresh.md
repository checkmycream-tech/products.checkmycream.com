<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this stuff. With this having aloe it is going to be my go to after the beach this summer. The $1.00 off coupon was awesome too. This leaves my skin feeling quenched and soft. I know how dry my back is when it only takes a few minutes to soak up without the quick rub. Light scent goes away quickly but lingers a tiny amount on your skin.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and easy to use. Great for after being in the sun! I would definitely recommend. Good stuff and looks great on tan legs!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT!!  You truly can spray and go... it&#x27;s not greasy and has a mild scent!  I will continue to use this for a LONG time!</li>
    <li> When I watched the commercial for this spray on lotion I thought well that&#x27;s just great. When I got it I found that it isn&#x27;t as good as it regular counterpart and it&#x27;s very messy. No matter how hard you try, the spray goes all over the floor making the floor dangerously slick. I won&#x27;t buy it again and would not recommend it either.</li>
    <li> This is Great for everything !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;1. After my bath &amp; showers,&lt;br /&gt;2, To freshen up from sweating,&lt;br /&gt;3,  if i cut myself by accident&lt;br /&gt;4  It helps reduces wrinkles,&lt;br /&gt;5.  It smells GREAT !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id suggest TRY this out as its Great !!&lt;br /&gt;i keep one in each room of each House!!&lt;br /&gt;Thats how much i love these !!</li>
    <li> This works well for people who have dry skin, but for me (someone with oilier skin) I was looking for something that I could use after shaving. This made my legs and knees break out badly. I tried using it at different times of the year as well, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. However, I did find that using the St. Ives grapefruit spray lotion worked well for me and did not make me break out.  The smell of the St. Ives is much better as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great especially if you are in a hurry. It&#x27;s not greasy but it moisturizes your skin.</li>
    <li> Send a friend,very nice</li>
    <li> This is a lightweight moisturizer that is great for summer. I have not tried it in the cold weather yet but just purchased my 3rd bottle. Love the light scent and it soaks in quickly.</li>
    <li> Since I have been using Vaseline Spray at night before bed, I never had leg cramps and felt my legs and arms very smooth. I recommend this to anyone.  My mother is 86 years old and I gave her one to try and she&#x27;s very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I used to have issues with getting really bad razor burn on my legs if I applied lotion after I shaved. I read that you should avoid applying lotions with alcohol in them after shaving so I switched to Nivea Essentially Enriched. That product worked well but was kind of greasy and I had to wait a while to dress after applying it. I found this product on sale at CVS and decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t have very high expectations, but this product blew my low expectations away. I love that it applies super light and I can dress pretty much right away. I like that it is a spray applicator which makes it easy to apply quickly &amp; all over. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I saw in ads that it&#x27;s supposed to dry fast when you spray it on and not be sticky or greasy so you can&lt;br /&gt;dress right away.  The ads were right.  I just spray it on and it feels good on my skin and has a wonderful scent and I can&lt;br /&gt;dress right away without having to wait for it to dry.</li>
    <li> In the winter my back gets dry and itchy.  Since my husband travels and I cannot put lotion on my own back, this is just what was needed.</li>
    <li> It took a few tries to learn to manipulate the container but now I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I am old and stiff and had stopped using cream.&lt;br /&gt;Discovered spray olive oil for pans and began using that... what a mess and hard to breath.&lt;br /&gt;This is not so flighty and is easy to spray... I just smooth over where I can and the rest soaks in quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Stand on a rug or towel as it can make a bare floor super slick.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a can of this.  At first I was very skeptical of a spray and go.  It truly seeps quickly into your skin and is not greasy, slippery or runs.  I really like it straight out of the shower.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this. I saw the commercial for it and had to have it. I was skeptical at first, but it works exactly as the commercial showed. I spray it where needed and just quickly run my hand over it and ready to go! Very nice to be able to spray the moisturizer on your feet and then slip on your socks to hold it in without having to spread around lotion.</li>
    <li> great for the gym and for the summer. does not make u sweat</li>
    <li> Terrific moisturizer &amp; it dries so quickly !</li>
    <li> First time purchase for me. Spray is a nice product for someone such as myself who is handicapped.  Easy to apply and work in. The aloe makes it nice and smooth.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> The spray stopped working properly pretty early one. You definitely have to rub it in. Makes your hands a little greasy but overall okay.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD!! first I don&#x27;t see any good about this. eventually I need to rub and wait to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;But, I tried a week or so, and I love this one. you don&#x27;t have to rub.. just a feeling remain. It makes no stains on clothes.&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect for your back too.&lt;br /&gt;My granny always said, even a little bit, keep on is always better.&lt;br /&gt; I recommend this to kids too. they do not lotion, but they will like this.</li>
    <li> Hadn&#x27;t heard of this before, but now we&#x27;ll keep this on hand for quick application of moisturizer.  And the cost was reasonable for this particular use.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and haven&#x27;t been able to moisturize my back until I found this great spray with Aloe.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I was skeptical at first and didn&#x27;t think it would work at all.  But WOW, it&#x27;s non-greasy, goes on quickly and evenly and blends in perfect!!!  A  little background i have very dry flaky skin, and always need some kind of lotion to prevent dryness.  This quickly absorbed wasn&#x27;t grease or oily and smells sooooo good.  I love it and will be repurchasing.  I got this for testing purposes</li>
    <li> I received this to test from Influenster and review my honest opinion on it and I have to say I really enjoy this lotion. I&#x27;m kinda lazy when I comes to putting on lotion because I&#x27;m prone to dry skin I have to put lotion on so this stuff is perfect because it takes no time to apply you just spray and do a quick rub and I dries really quick so you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time rubbing it in. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling stick or greasy which I like. And my favorite part about this is it have a very fresh light scent almost like cucumbers. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Great for a quick moisturizing routine when you have no time! Smells great absorbs quickly.I use when I&#x27;m running late, the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long.  I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of a spary lotion to reach hard to rub places, but you still need to rub it in or it just sit on your skin. It also has overspray, so you need to be careful where you use it.</li>
    <li> My wife says this stuff is not for her. Plus, it&#x27;s expensive. I bought the Aloe Vera one to spray on my feet but it&#x27;s like water. Sorry, I cannot recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have anyone to put lotion on your back, you can spray this on and let it set for a bit.  The lotion sprays out nice and feels good.</li>
    <li> I received this product free for testing purposes. It&#x27;s a super lights spray and it dries really quickly. I have a hard time remembering to put lotion on and by the time a remember, I don&#x27;t have the time to rub it on and wait for it to dry before I can put clothes on (have you tried putting skinny jeans on over freshly lotioned legs?!). This is a great solution, I spray it on as soon as I get out of the shower and then rub it in (even though you don&#x27;t need to) and it&#x27;s dry within seconds. I have noticed that these sprays don&#x27;t last as long as regular lotion, but I have a feeling that I use more spray than I need to, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I received this is a monthly subscription box. I never would have tried it on my own. My family just happened to be heading to the beach and I have super sensitive fair skin. After a day sight seeing, I was burnt even with many applications of sun screen. I pulled out this aloe spray, applied it and felt better. I applied it a few times through out the next day and night and was never in any pain. For a woman who usually has massive itching and peeling after a day in the sun this was a wonderful surprise. It works great and I will continue to keep this on hand for all of my families sun relief needs.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for lazy, or in the rush people. You just spray, rub, and you are ready for the day.</li>
    <li> Only used this twice before the sprayer broke, waste of money, would not by it again.  I did like the idea of it</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Product absorbs quickly.  Only negative product only lasts for 2 weeks with daily use.  Gets me out of the house quicker as you do not have to wait for lotion to absorb.</li>
    <li> Girly smell, gave to wife.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and never seem to have the time to fully moisturize. I love this, it is quick easy with a nice light scent and keeps me moisturized all day. No more excuses! #FreeSample.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a fan of spray lotions, but I received this product to test for free and was wiling to give it a try :).  I&#x27;m grateful we had it on hand this past weekend, because I made a parenting mistake and didn&#x27;t put enough sunscreen on my son. He got a bit burned, but he was willing to let me spray this on to ease the pain, and he was much better in the morning.  I have also started using it in my morning routine - it sounds ridiculous, but I don&#x27;t usually have time for lotion. This has left me feeling a bit more put together in the morning.  I&#x27;m only giving four stars because I&#x27;m still not a huge fan of spray lotions, in general. What I would love to see is an easy to apply lotion without the grease and without the spray - this product does one of the two, and that&#x27;s a start!</li>
    <li> This is such a great idea and I have been buying it since it has been released.  Very light and easy to use.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly today.  I immediately sprayed it on my arms that have very dry skin.  It squirts out as a white cream and rubs in quickly as stated.  I guess I bought the wrong stuff--this one has strong scent that stays with you for hours.  I wish Vaseline would make on that has NO SCENT.</li>
    <li> This product is what I was hoping for. I have severe dry skin  and it usually takes a long time to apply moisturizer. The spray bottle cuts the time in two , leaves no oily film and makes my skin feel great.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on a television ad and decided to try it.  While it is an easy to apply, lightly fragranced spray-on, I find my skin is in need of more moisturizing that this provides.  Maybe the mixture is heavier on the water (listed in the ingredients) than on the oil moisturizer.  Very convenient....just not as moisturizing as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> This stuff comes out like water from a fire hose. Very high pressure and goes all over the place. I was expecting a gentle mist and was blown away by the force of the propellant. Other than the delivery method, the product is very nice … not greasy … smells good too.</li>
    <li> So easy to put on lotion with this. I use this kind of lotion when I am in a rush.</li>
    <li> I am always too busy to moisturize. I am a mother of 4 minor children and have a full time job.  I would rather sleep than spend extra time getting ready in the morning for work while getting my 5 year old ready too. But, this spray and go is a God sent!!! I was sacrificing moisturizing when i don&#x27;t have to, and i love this stuff. I keep it in the bathroom. After showering and drying off i spray it on, do a quick rub and I am ready to put clothes on.  I always wanted to apply a moisturizer i just never had the time and now i take 5-10 seconds a day and it works. My legs don&#x27;t look like the Mohave Desert anymore. I have used the product for about a month. the only downfall is that i need to order more after a month and a half. I think i used too much, i would spray about 4 or 5 lines of the moisturizer, i don&#x27;t think i need that much and i have a second bottle where i will use much less with this time. I pay a bit more for the spray but i need it because i wouldn&#x27;t use any if i had to apply it the old fashioned way.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about spray on lotion, but this stuff is great! I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy and it dries very fast. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Not pleased at all with this one. However, my favorite is the total moisture oat extract in the yellow can and the cocoa radiant in the dark brown can. They work well for me.</li>
    <li> The shipping is fast so I was happy. When I tried this, it was not sticky like the normal lotion so i really like it the only thing is I don&#x27;t know if it really moisturizes that well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this because of the TV commercial.  I don&#x27;t think that it is quite as easy and quick to apply as the commercial implies, but I haven&#x27;t found better.  It is easy to apply, does a wonderful job moisturizing and smells lovely.  The ease of application and quick drying time make for much more often use.  Therefore it is a win/win....I use it often, my skin is moisturized and the Vaseline company sells a great product.</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell.  Pretty good for reaching my back.  You do have to rub it on after spraying though.  Provides light moisture.  Only complaint is that it feels Cold after a warm shower in the winter.  So it should feel good when the weather warms up.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is much in a container, and it leaves my bathroom floor slippery and greasy. I love the idea of it, and it is a great formula because it moisturizes without leaving my skin greasy, and it smells nice, but the greasy floor is dangerous and I don&#x27;t see a way to have the convenience of a spray lotion without having excess lotion greasing up the floor.</li>
    <li> Not for really dry skin</li>
    <li> This is great for lotion users.  Does not clog and seems to have a good bit of lotion in it.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. It worked great as lotion and I felt the aloe in it BUT I brought it on vacation and on the plane ride home it got crushed and the lotion spilled EVERYWHERE in my suitcase. I totally recommend it but not on vacation when you bring it in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> This is not as good as I had hoped for. It is kind of sticky on your skin. I doubt if I will buy more</li>
    <li> Easy to use non sticky non smelling leaves skin feeling smooth I prefer this over the regular Vaseline because it drys fast</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT.love the spray because of disability cannot put moisturiser on.Had just found out this is available vaseline .always good products.thanks</li>
    <li> I love all of the different flavors of this spray and go.  It really makes your skin feel good and it is easy to apply without getting it all over your hands.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this, but I do know that my wife likes the product. I order it as a subscribe and save item and every time it comes up as time for a refill I ask her if she wants another one and she says yes. That&#x27;s high praise from her. With many other items it&#x27;s often - &#x27;no, that didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair&#x27; or &#x27;no - I didn&#x27;t like that at all&#x27;. Her skin is soft.</li>
    <li> I have always used Vaseline Intensive Care products. It&#x27;s one of the only lotions that works for my super dry skin. I was given this to sample for free and I am so glad that I received it. It&#x27;s a game changer. The smell is amazing, light and refreshing. It sprays on your skin and absorbs with just a few rubs. I have never been happier with a lotion in my life. The lotion goes just as far as any other bottle of Intensive Care I&#x27;ve ever used. You&#x27;ll be so happy that you bought this. I know I am and can&#x27;t wait to get it again.</li>
    <li> Overall this is a good product - it&#x27;s lotion and it comes out through the nozzle as described, but it&#x27;s certainly nothing like advertised in the sense that there is not a mist coming out of the nozzle when you push down. It basically squirts lotion wherever you point it. Somewhat disappointed...</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT WITH VASOLINE AND ALOE IN ONE SPRAY.  WHAT A GREAT CONCEPT.  EASY TO USE AND NO STICKY MESS FROM VASOLINE.</li>
    <li> Who would of thunk that Vaseline produces a spray on moisturizer that smells great! I for one hate using lotion normally because of the feel of it, however after the first time use of this, I was surprised of how convenient and quick the application was aside from the great smell of it. It also came at a great discount as compared to purchasing it in person at a retailer.</li>
    <li> This is really convient to use, especially when in a hurry. It absorbs right away and skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I have for the longest time used Aveeno because I feel as though my skin is sensitive to the fragrances in lotions. I decided to give Vaseline Spray &amp; Go a try anyway. I picked the green bottle, brought it home, sprayed it on, and instantly loved it! It is super convenient. You do have to rub it in a little more than the girl in the commercial does, but it&#x27;s fast. I used to under moisturize because I hated that greasy feeling, specially on hot days where simply stepping outside makes you feel yucky. This product has a soft scent, it does what it says it will do, and it will not clump on your skin no matter how many times you put it on, the way lotion eventually does. I really like it, and would buy again.</li>
    <li> This spray on moisturizer goes on evenly and rubs in well, smells ok (not strongly scented). Made my skin feel cool and good. Put a towel under the area where you plan to spray it though because it gets on the floor (slippery!!) or the carpet (sticky).  It&#x27;s nice if it is hard for you to reach your feet to rub in lotion though.</li>
    <li> It does not try in dry seconds, even if you rub it in. It takes several minutes to dry. It is convenient or else I&#x27;d give it a one.</li>
    <li> Wonderful as I don&#x27;t have to rub it in like other moisturizers. Has a nice smell and it lasted longer than I thought it would.</li>
    <li> IT WORKS GREAT AND DOES HELP WITH DRY SKIN BUT I WISH THERE WAS JUST A LITTLE MORE OILY FEELING WHEN SPREADING,</li>
    <li> I am diabetic and my legs are in bad shape.  This goes on fast and easy and absorbs fast.  Seems to help me.</li>
    <li> goes on nicely and moisturizes when you are in a hurry and dont want to get lotion all over your clothes. I cant get enough of this. Wish there were other scents ...like Green tea and Aloe, etc,</li>
    <li> On one hand, I love this product. Without being thick or greasy, it gives your skin a lovely moisturized feel. However, in all honesty, I deducted three stars because it turned my bathroom into a skating rink! You can&#x27;t imagine how upset I was to realize that I should have spread towels on the floor before I used this product. I actually had to use a strong spray-on bathroom cleaner and mop it up before I could leave the house or risk having someone else fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great on the skin, but really, really BAD on the floor!</li>
    <li> Wow this is truly amazing I can feel it starting to work already and its only been a few days but my skin is definitely  more smooth than before so I say this is an excellent product</li>
    <li> Really wanted to like this. Turns out if you want to spray the consistency of water on your body instead Of lotion then this is it.</li>
    <li> Great light-weight, FAST  moisturizer for summer months. Aloe has a refreshing \\&quot;feel\\&quot; and smell. LOVE how fast this goes on! Downside, does spray EVERYWHERE so do stand on a towel or rug, NOT on tile/hardwood floor.  Since this is rather lightweight formula, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m going to have to go back to the thicker stuff when winter hits. For around 6 bucks, it&#x27;s pricey and doesn&#x27;t last as long as you&#x27;d think, but then again, you pay for convenience.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing spray for hard to reach areas on the back. I have very dry skin and all of it needs hydrating, including my back. Very useful and inexpensive. I also gave it to my mother so she can use it on her legs and feet because she is unable to bend down that far. Wish they made a travel size.</li>
    <li> Im already a fan of the regular aloe vaseline lotion because i pretty much use it everyday. When i got my vaseline spray and go sample from influenster, i was very much pleased with the product. Its very light and absorbs well espcially after showering. The spray bottle was easy to use. The scent is very clean and fresh. It doesnt leave the skin sticky so its a perfect everyday lotion even in the summer time. I&#x27;m definetely going to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> I hate it, it makes my skin dryer. I like other Vaseline products but not this one!</li>
    <li> It is very convenient  and easy to use and I do not have to have lotion all over my hands .</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this. The concept is great but the product isn&#x27;t. Honestly my skin didn&#x27;t feel very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you don&#x27;t need a lot of moisture this could work for you however my skin is on the dry side. I am faithful to using moisturizer after a shower and it looks like I will continue to use a container or tube form. Good try Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Perfect for moisturizing your feet when you plan to wear sandals or open shoes as it dries immediately, no slipping and sliding in your shoes.</li>
    <li> I like this very much.  I can spray my feet and legs where I cannot easily reach.</li>
    <li> I received this product from Influenster in the Sunshine VoxBox. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure how a &amp;#34;spray lotion&amp;#34; would work out. I must say that I am quite pleased. I never realized how much I needed a spray lotion in my life. It was definitely easy to apply and didn&#x27;t leave my hands with a greasy feeling. Most of the time after applying lotion I would wash my hands to make sure I didn&#x27;t stain anything. But with this product it just left my hands feeling smooth. It does absorb quickly which prevents my pants from sticking to my legs. And it has light great scent that I love. I definitely plan on trying the others.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this - it is hard to control as it sprays all over the place, and it really doesn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
    <li> It does not last that long.  My palm feels dry after an hour and after 2-3hours my skin feels dry and have to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commercial seems to show the female going out for the day.  Maybe they did not show she has a spare in her bag as she sure will need them later</li>
    <li> I received this product complementary from Influenster and Vaseline Brand for reviewing and testing purposes. I like the product, and I think it works well. It does not leave an oily feel not is sticky. What I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s not clear where I have sprayed or how much is needed. I also don&#x27;t like that the bottle is not recyclable. But the scent is very nice, and it&#x27;s easy and quick to apply. Especially for hard to reach areas like my back. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but I think it would be a great product for someone with mobility or flexibility issues who still need moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I got this product to test from Influenster and I never heard much about this product, but when I received it in my VoxBox I was pretty excited about trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I spraying it on my arm, it was a bit cold, but when rubbing in the lotion it dried instantly on my skin and made it feel soft and smelling very sweet, but not with a harsh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying this if you don&#x27;t have much time going for a lotion bottle or don&#x27;t have much time to moisturize in during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky&lt;br /&gt;No wait time for drying&lt;br /&gt;Smells pleasant&lt;br /&gt;great for lazy or not enough time&lt;br /&gt;College kids will love this and so will moms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Non that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning:&lt;br /&gt;People with asthma or having difficulty breathe, face away from the spray when you are spraying anywhere on your body.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product&lt;br /&gt;Did not help with anything&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money&lt;br /&gt;Does not moisturize the skin. I ended up buying cetaphil</li>
    <li> Refreshing and easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, just soft skin.</li>
    <li> Going to try this in place of chap stick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a practical moisturizer and it dries fast but you still have to rub it in. The scent is good and fresh. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I even use it sometimes. My wife and daughter use regularly.  Both say it is a great product that delivers needed results in a convenient manner.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> I wish the lotion was more nourishing, but it&#x27;s definitely not greasy. Kind of a trade-off, I guess.</li>
    <li> This is one is OK but not as moisturizing as the yellow spray can. The brown one dries out the skin too much.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the lotion. It is very thin and I don&#x27;t like the smell. Like the idea of a spray lotion.</li>
    <li> FAST application as advertised.</li>
    <li> Fast &amp; easy to apply right after a shower at the pool.  I was worried about overspray &amp; the potential for slips and falls, but the spray is very targeted and controlled, which is good for safety and for minimizing product waste.  Would love to see this in a pump spray bottle rather than aerosol, and in an unscented option...and then I would award 5 stars.  Good product.</li>
    <li> It does make moisturizing spray-n-go, drying almost as you smooth it out with your hand after spraying on your body.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long, though, and takes some getting used to to avoid missing your body and spraying the rest of your bathroom/bedroom.</li>
    <li> The smell is really, really nice and it does dry quickly, but not instantly. The moisturizer lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is pretty neat to have on hand. The reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because I think it kind of is addicting which is not a good thing LOL - I use it now and then and it sprays on good but does drip so you have to catch it quickly before it gets on your floors. It smells really good - a light refreshing smell.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like this product.  It goes on wet and I didn&#x27;t at all like the smell so I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> This goes on nice, I do not like to use creams, this one I remember to put on I guess because I tend to forget the creams because I hate applying them.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it does exactly what is promised...you can spray it on the large surfaces of your body quickly after a bath or shower, swipe it in and go.  Regular body lotion takes forever to be absorbed while this seems to absorb really fast so you can apply in a hurry , get dressed and go!  Seems to work as well.</li>
    <li> It smell so fresh. It keep my skin comfortable. I love it so much ! I will shear my friends too.</li>
    <li> I love it and use it after my shower every morning.  Plan to buy more in the store when I go shopping.</li>
    <li> I really like this spray and go moisturizer it&#x27;s pretty much like commercial says spray it on throw clothes on and go. I use it every nite after shower. What I like the most is it drys like a creamy baby oil. Some lotions when you get hot leaves u feeling sticky this doesn&#x27;t. Creamy baby oil use too be my favorite but now you can only buy it in small tubes can&#x27;t get it in big bottles anymore. Been looking for anything close couldn&#x27;t find it till now. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars cause its a little pricy.</li>
    <li> Thanks to Influenster, I received the Vaseline Spray Go Moisturizer as a free product to sample. I am really excited about this product and I am really glad that I received it otherwise I&#x27;m not sure I would have every found it on my own. I LOVE it and I mean that 100%. I had never used a moisturizing spray and I&#x27;ve been missing out! It&#x27;s so easy to use, just spray and go. I like to use it right after getting out of the shower so it helps lock in moisture better but I&#x27;ve found myself using it during the day because I love how it leaves my skin soft and refreshed. I will definitely buy this once my sample is up and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is really a spray and go product yet very moisturizing.  Little pricey for everyday use but certainly cost effective if you are in a hurry and can&#x27;t wait for a product to be absorbed.</li>
    <li> The speed of application makes this the best option for me. I usually don&#x27;t apply lotion after showering just because I&#x27;m lazy and feel that I don&#x27;t need it but that&#x27;s an illusion, I do need it just the same as everyone else. This produce is perfect for me, shake, spray and go....Awesome.</li>
    <li> Did not like. Not much in the can.</li>
    <li> what more can I say? Keeps your moisturized and easy to apply! I have it on the monthly auto-order now!</li>
    <li> Works well and has an active spray so no pumping is needed. It dries extremely quickly so you actually use this product daily without having to decide. Use it,,,fast soft skin!</li>
    <li> convenient and good lotion</li>
    <li> Very handy moisturizeR , it have aloe Vera slight smell ( not odor ) absorb very quick leaving skin silky , and touchable , sort of a dry oil effect non greasy , and I really love the smell of freshness + Aloe Vera have calming effect on the skin . I do spray it on my hands then rub fast into my body since it will make the bathroom floor very slippery and also my laminate , but putting towel on the floor will help if you are on hurry after shower , will order again after I use my new 2 bottle that I just ordered . This product include Aloe Barbadensis Leafs Juice</li>
    <li> Not sure I will purchase this again as I still need to &#x27;spread&#x27; this product all over my skin after I&#x27;ve sprayed it to make I get the most out of the spray and aid its penetration into the skin. Also I need to be careful when spaying it over certain areas of my skin since the stream seems to &#x27;overspray&#x27; which requires you to wipe it off the walls of where you have stood next to.</li>
    <li> This is really great stuff. Before using it I had exceedingly dry skin.--No more. It even stopped the itching from dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great Product, it does exactly what it says and this one in the green bottle smells great. i use it everyday</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how this really works. Customer service also added a valuable coupon on the end of my purchase. I will defiantly buy this again. Thanks</li>
    <li> I got this b/c I found sometimes my back felt dry and itchy--and while I could get lotion everywhere else--the back was a bit harder. It does serve it&#x27;s purpose and helps relieve that issue--but I kind of wish it shot a broader, finer mist--rather than what I find to be more of a thinner harder stream--which means it still really needs to be rubbed in. I&#x27;d like it better if it sprayed more like a sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Goes on quickly with no mess.  I get out of the shower, spray, rub it in quickly and am set to go. It has a light feel, not heavy or oily.  Plus it leaves my skin feeling wonderful.  I don&#x27;t notice any scent.  The spray hasn&#x27;t clogged.</li>
    <li> The product is OK.  However, it does not work form the way vaseline does. Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Henry</li>
    <li> Wonderful idea for body lotion.  I am glad someone came up with the idea of a moisturizer spray.  It also dries very quickly, which is great!!</li>
    <li> This product does everything the TV ads show ... What a time-saver!  Buy some and hide it from your kids!!  bjw</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product s it is so easy and mess free to apply. Amazon subscription offers good value for money and getting it delivered is always a bonus too.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leav home without applying Vaseline Spray Aloe every morning. It keeps my arms mosturized throughout the day, especially on the cold brisk mornings.</li>
    <li> I have never rated a product before in my life.  I am in my late 60&#x27;s, This product advertises that it Moisturizes in seconds and skin will feel instantly soft and NOT sticky or greasy.  It does exactly what it says.  Finally a product that works.  Hint:  I spray it on one hand to spread om my body and hold the sprayer with my other hand to prevent over spray from my flooring.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for a very ravenously and more wonderful and deal with you very excellent and went very quickly I will return you to buy another set soon</li>
    <li> I was about to give this a 3 star rating but it&#x27;s not a bad item if your busy and on the go....but I probably will never purchase this again...like I said it&#x27;s not bad and it smells good its just not for me...but you may like it.</li>
    <li> Bought one for my self and one for adult daughter.  Both agree the aloe one smells good.  It is quick - I think because of the spray- and does a decent job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for those who have some physical limitations who want to continue their own personal care.Works very well.  I&#x27;ll even use this as a gift for friends who share my joint problems.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use that&#x27;s for sure.  Spray it on, but you still have to take the time to rub it in.  The more you put on to moisturize the more you will have to rub in.  I am please with the product.</li>
    <li> Love how easy to use this is! Literally just spray and go and the scent is pleasing and not overwhelming! Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> This was the best deal I have paid for in a long time.  Quality more than expected, and oh so delightful</li>
    <li> This works... but I have to say when I read that the first in\gradient is &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; it makes you wonder how good this can be.  I do love the convenience of spraying on my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> They took my beloved Nivea spray moisturizer off the market here in the US so I was excited when a great brand like Vaseline came out w/ this! I went out &amp; got all 3 options. I love the wheat the best. The aloe is great too. And the cocoa butter is my sons favorite. Its an extra bonus I can purchase it on Amazon</li>
    <li> and decided to order it. really does not stay greasy.. apply and rub and go. my kids love it too as they can just spray on legs and arms and go.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  Absorbs quickly.  Does not leave a sticky feeling like you would think of when Vaseline comes to mind.</li>
    <li> When I saw this item I thought this would be just the ticket - it would be easier to use and not as messy as lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s in my estimation:&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) nice light scent&lt;br /&gt;2) quick and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;3) absorbs quickly and skin feel soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;1) a bit pricey&lt;br /&gt;2) watch were you spray it - I try to put my leg up on the tub so the excess goes into the tub and not on the floor&lt;br /&gt;which can become slippery.&lt;br /&gt;3) After a while my skin feels dry again - so it doesn&#x27;t last all day.  My skin is not extremely dry yet this still didn&#x27;t help during the dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the price and the fact that it&#x27;s such a light spray with not a lot of moisturizer, I would not buy this product again and&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The product is okay. Trust me yo have to rub it in don&#x27;t take the commercial seriously. I  guess I was looking for something that has a little more moisturizer. I rate this product three stars.</li>
    <li> First of all, it&#x27;s a lot of money for a very slim bottle of product.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to spray -- not like the commercial for sure -&lt;br /&gt;the product comes out like a spritz almost.&lt;br /&gt;It does dry on the skin quickly.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Goes on sticky and gets worse.  I had to take another shower after I sprayed this gook on me!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have trouble bending so this spray is wonderful. I just spray when I get out of the shower and my legs have been so smooth and not oily or sticky.</li>
    <li> Smells so good, but does not last long as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> These spray moisturizers are great for when your on the go ..spray applies nicely and rubs in quickly so even if your late to work, at least your skin looks good</li>
    <li> Spray on moisturizer is AMAZING! I wish someone would have thought about this a long time ago. I like that it sprays on in a thin layer and it dries quickly. You can&#x27;t put your clothes on imediately like it says but if you spray it on and then pick your outfit, you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t have especially dry skin this might be a good option for you. However, if you&#x27;re expecting this to replace the original Vaseline lotion-- you&#x27;ll be disappointed. It has a nice and light floral scent and when first sprayed it has a cooling effect. Once it dries (after several seconds) it doesn&#x27;t leave a film (like regular aloe does). It also leaves a film on the floor where sprayed. Personally, I could live without this.</li>
    <li> It really is good because I can spray my entire back which used to be difficult to get all parts.  Absorbs and dries very quickly.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. This product is super easy to use. Sprays on nicely, doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy and works just as described.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I still use a regular mouisturizing cream each day, but this is a great way to give body extra boost.  Normally, I spray on when I am done my shower and skin is still wet.  I also stay in shower , after I turn water off, to spray so it doesn&#x27;t spray walls and floor in bathroom. It can make tub floor slippery, so I make sure to give a few extra squirts of daily shower cleaner where needed most. I have also used it instead of shaving gel....works great for that. I also keep a can in purse to refresh/add moisture, later in the day.  I go through stages of extra dry skin and using this has made a big difference. I have added this to my daily routine, and I have to say, since I use for a shaving gel at times or put on legs pretty much right after shaving, my legs are a lot smoother and look silkier, and for me, its a great way to freshen up during the day. You should really give it a try, I think you will be pleased with the results, and surprised by how much of a difference that extra minute each day makes! Great to add to a beginning of summer gift basket, too!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, easy to apply, soaks in very fast, don&#x27;t have to deal with that greasy feeling. I use it in the am after my shower and I am good to go for the whole day. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> This spray oils rocks.  I use it every time I step out of the shower after towel drying.  It is absorbed quickly and really help moisture.</li>
    <li> exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to last on my skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Not too moisturizing but fine if it&#x27;s for the summer.  In winter, I definitely need something heavier.  It will be good for trips since it probably won&#x27;t leak.  My only really big peeve (and it may not even be something that&#x27;s fixable) is it is FREEZING when it&#x27;s sprayed.  Really cold and makes me almost jump when I put it on.</li>
    <li> After buying this lotion in a can, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll go back to the old style pump again. Its easy to use and less mess. Just spray it on, rub and go. Blends in effortlessly and wont make you feel sticky. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought and I will continue using this product. Amazon did take over a week to get it to me, even though its a Prime item and I&#x27;m a Prime member so I&#x27;ll buy it at the store next time.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal. Spray anything is more convenient as long as you apply it correctly. The problem with this product is that it has a very feminine smell. I&#x27;m sure a lot of people probably like the smell but I&#x27;m not a fan. I&#x27;m much happier with the Trader Joes brand 99% aloe gel.</li>
    <li> So easy, nice, made my hands so soft in just a few applications!!  I recommend it highly!  So fast, and I&#x27;m all about the doing things fast!  Low maintenance is VERY important to me!!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to kill doing lotion!!</li>
