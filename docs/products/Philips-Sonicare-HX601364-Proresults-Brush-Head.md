<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sonicare is a great tooth care product.  It massages your gums while it cleans.  The brush heads hold up well, even after they show the need to replace.  I like the reminder bristles feature.</li>
    <li> Received a 4 pack phillips brand or replacements heads. Identical to the ones the tooth brush came with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m convinced these aren&#x27;t the real deal. The blue bristles that are supposed to slowly fade to indicate replacement - they fade out within a few days. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> These are mighty pricey, especially compared to Oral B heads, but when you drop a toothbursh head in the toilet... well, there&#x27;s very little choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for the Amazon &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34; packaging after coming across a few reviews of counterfeit heads. It seems to me that Amazon would only source their heads from a known entity. Sure enough, the heads come loosely packed in a nondescript cardboard box, and they appear to be the real deal. The box also includes three additional color rings (all the heads come with the gray ring pre-installed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one oddity is that instead of having &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; printed on the shaft, the heads instead have a Sonicare logo. But they look exactly like the ProResults heads that came with the toothbrush, and they fit equally well.</li>
    <li> Buy original philips sonicare toothbrush heads. It cannot be wrong! The quality is assured.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re provided by the manufacturer.  They last about 3 months as advertised.  Does anyone know of a less expensive alternative?</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THESE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY WILL NOT FIT YOUR SONICARE PROPERLY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not be try to be thrifty - spend your hard earned cash on the real deal!!</li>
    <li> Totally disappointed the bristles fall out. I thought it might have been just the head I was using so I changed it and it&#x27;s doing the same, very frustrating. Poor quality I hope it&#x27;s just the batch.</li>
    <li> I swear by the Sonicare toothbrush and these brush heads really are comfortable and clean really well.  It feels like that &amp;#34;just from the dentist&amp;#34; clean every time I brush.....you know when to change the heads when they fade.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re like me you loved your Sonicare until you realized how much replacement brush heads cost. It&#x27;s like what they do with razors, but on a higher scale. Not that Sonicare brushes are cheap, but you get the business model. These heads are the genuine product and best value I&#x27;ve seen anywhere. Most places give you 3 for this price.. here you get 4. And that&#x27;s value my friend.</li>
    <li> These are good replacement toothbrushes for my sonicare toothbrush. They are a good&lt;br /&gt;Price! They do last  but not three months. more like 6 weeks. But a better price than the drug&lt;br /&gt;Store and las t the same amount of time. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I like these brushes for my basic sonicare toothbrush. They seem to work just a well as the diamond brushes which cost more. I didn&#x27;t see a difference. The problem is the cost for replacement and the fact that they wear out more quickly than what the manufacturer says. It seems silly to spend so much on tiny pieces of plastic, but they&#x27;ve got your over a barrel because they are needed for the toothbrush.  I do love my sonicare and how it cleans, so I use it. Currently, a three pack is running around $30 for three at our local store so I try to find them for less elsewhere. The cost continues to go up on Amazon, so I may have to check other places.</li>
    <li> I splurged and got the Philips Sonicare toothbrush a few months back, and just realized how expensive the replacement heads were.  I did some research online - I really wanted to make sure that these fit before spending the money.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived quickly in a brown box.  With a simple pull, the old head can be removed and the new one slips right on.  I can&#x27;t tell any difference between the replacement head and the one that originally came with the brush.</li>
    <li> We received these a couple of days ago, and I was wondering if they were really the same as the originals that came with out Sonicare or the considerably more expensive brush heads that are specifically for the Elite Diamond Clean (HX6063/64 at $12 each). The first thing that you&#x27;ll notice is that these four brushes come with color bands. I thought that this was to show that Sonicare had listened to some grumbling about no color coding on the Diamond Clean brush heads. In fact, they seem to be there because there&#x27;s more space between the bottom of the brush head and the Sonicare handle than the original. The bands create somewhat of a seal between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things: First, yes these are Sonicare heads...in terrible packaging. I don&#x27;t understand the difference between a cardboard box within a cardboard box and shipped in another cardboard box and a very small plastic cover on the \\&quot;standard,\\&quot; more expensive heads. Second, it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter if a little water gets between the brush head and the handle. If you have the Diamond Clean, take a close look and you&#x27;ll find a 1/32\\&quot; gap between brush and handle. There&#x27;s no rattle or movement of the cartridge with the toothbrush on, and so I&#x27;d say that they&#x27;re darn near the same as the originals, and I&#x27;m guessing that most of us take the brush head off and clean under after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to give them 3 stars just because of the packaging, and I&#x27;m tempted to give Sonicare 2 stars for pricing and labeling. (The Diamond Clean toothbrushes - and I&#x27;m talking about the whole toothbrush - came as a set of two handles and two brushes at Costco for the price of one through Amazon, and all models numbers were different at Costco, Target, and one other store.) Then, there&#x27;s the myriad names for all Sonicare models. BUT, I can&#x27;t knock what Sonicare does for my teeth and gums and these brushes are very good (although overpriced at every level). Minus one star for the cost and the fact that the brushes that fit the thinner handled Sonicares only last two months which brings them back up to about $15 EACH!hat fit the thinner handled Sonicares only last two months which brings them back up to about $15 EACH!</li>
    <li> These are so hard on the teeth. I don&#x27;t press hard with my sonicare but still my hygienist was not liking the way my gums looked. She suggests to use a soft bristled handheld old fashioned toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good brushes for our Sonicare. Great price compared to what you would pay if you bought them individually. For that I give it 4****.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go back to brushing my teeth with an ordinary tooth brush after using my Philips Sonicare tooth brush.</li>
    <li> What I ordered was a 4 pack of standard Pro Results Brush Heads.  What I got was an assortment of differently sized heads and styles.  To make matters worst the heads are individually packaged yet the packages were all open! Disgusting!!!  I&#x27;ll be returning.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is the correct item</li>
    <li> it is working well. perfect.</li>
    <li> A great brand and the best price.</li>
    <li> These do a pretty good job and seem to last longer than diamond clean.  However, diamond clean definitely makes the teeth feel more clean.  I have sensitive gums, and the pro results irritates them sometimes.</li>
    <li> My husband and I love our sonicare!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price</li>
    <li> I think these were the best price point for the count? love these heads, love my sonicare. not sure how I ever used a regular toothbrush for so long!</li>
    <li> Good product for the Sonicare.  Product is as expected.</li>
    <li> i regularly buy heads for our tooth brushes and i dont know what happened here but these fall apart in your mouth -- like the free tooth brush at a hotel. its very irritating because obviously these are knock off  brushes....or sonic care has gone down hill. these are crap ...again the plastic brushes fall apart in your mouth. total crap</li>
    <li> Worth the money to keep my teeth clean. And it quite convient to get it through the amazon subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> What else is there to say?&lt;br /&gt;They are original replacement parts, they fit well, lasts as long as they should.</li>
    <li> Exactly what we expected.</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6014/30 Pro Results Brush Head, 4 Count from Philips Sonicare are great brush heads. This product is highly effective at cleaning and maintaining a happy healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the &amp;#34;Push on&amp;#34; connector because its makes the toothbrush easy to clean and maintain. I don&#x27;t like the occasional rough plastic surface or loose bristles that I&#x27;ve encountered with a few defective brush heads over the years because it&#x27;s a annoying and a waste of money if you have to replace it sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and a great value, each brush head will provide several months of use and preventative care for your teeth.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot to say. The bristles are fairly soft, but firm enough to feel like they are doing something. I&#x27;ve had instances where they do cause problems with my gums if my gums are irritated, but for the most part I&#x27;ve not had any real problems. The color indicator wears away much faster than 3 months if you actually brush your teeth for the full 2 minutes twice a day, but the feel of the brush does not.</li>
    <li> love the packaging. brush heads are as you&#x27;d expect with Sonicare.</li>
    <li> This was just perfect! I love the price and it arrived right on time. When I run out I will definitely be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> Best price around for this item. Work just like they should. Last longer than expected, which is really good.</li>
    <li> Ordered the package as shown, 4 brush heads.  Fulfilled and sold by Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;When I received the package, there were 2 loose brush heads in the box.&lt;br /&gt;Called CS and was told that I needed to return the 2 loose brush heads, that they cannot just send &#x27;2&#x27; loose brush heads back to me.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that was what I received!  So, of course you can. My only choices are go out of my way, spend my time and my ink to make a replacement/return order, or get a refund which will be the same time consuming activity.&lt;br /&gt;NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;Second order today from Amazon.com that was not correct.I asked for a supervisor, after getting rather angry, and I was told, viola! They CAN SEND me a replacement.</li>
    <li> Great value and price.  Recommend product</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush heads, and a good deal for four.</li>
    <li> gotta keep those pearlies deserving of their title</li>
    <li> Simple pack with four high-quality heads. If you are looking at this you already know you like the sonicare toothbrush, so this is more of the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that each head comes with a cover, though mine didn&#x27;t have the different colored rings to differentiate between people using the same base unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is the overall price charged by Sonicare for replacement heads. I get the business model, but it still cost them a star.</li>
    <li> These brushes work very well with my Sonicare Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> They work well enough. No complaints, arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Fits on my sonicare diamond clean and not as pricey as some other brushes</li>
    <li> The brush head that came with my sonicare was alright, but when I swapped it out for this one, it was a HUGE difference.  My teeth feel so much cleaner now!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice if there was any difference between these heads compared to the ones that came with the toothbrush originally. Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save discount and delivery convenience is what made these since this is just basic replacement heads for your toothbrush that you can get anywhere.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Really enjoy the new packaging because it is a lot less frustrating to open than the plastic packaging.</li>
    <li> These showed up on time but 3 of the toothbrush heads were children&#x27;s size! Only 1 of the 4 was regular size. Ridiculous, especially for the price paid</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare Pro Results toothbrush for about three years now. We love the toothbrush, and the toothbrush heads are also great. They aren&#x27;t cheap, especially since you need to replace them every three to four months. But they sure do get your mouth clean. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in ages. Overall, I say they are worth the price--especially when you get them from Amazon, shipped quickly and in easy-to-open, plastic-free packaging.</li>
    <li> Amazon has the best price around for these replacement brush heads, and we&#x27;ve checked all over.  We love the minimal packaging!</li>
    <li> Tough to get a great deal on these brushes and this one was the best. Gave it 4 stars only because the price is too high for these brushes. They do however keep my dental bills lower so it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. I have used it for server all years,and have not found anything to replace it. The results are immediate!</li>
    <li> I found buying these on Amazon to be cheaper than buying them at the big box stores. I always keep several of these in stock at the house to keep my brush heads top notch. Look no further than Amazon.</li>
    <li> The four brush heads come enclosed in individual plastic wrappers, inside a plain brown cardboard box.  The delivery was exactly as promised, and the brush heads are genuine Phillips Pro Results.  Not much more needs to be said when Amazon delivers a quality product at a reasonable price, and you get it exactly as expected.  I highly reccommend both Philips and Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love the minimal packaging- they work great too!</li>
    <li> I have this brushed shipped every few months to remind me to change out my brush heads.  It keeps my teeth very clean and I am receiving postivie remarks from my hygentist.</li>
    <li> I Paid for 4 toothbrush heads, only received 3 toothbrush heads in the shipment. The product advertised for 4 toothbrush heads</li>
    <li> This fits my brush perfectly.  These last a long time.  I would purchase them again from this seller and would tell other people to do the same.</li>
    <li> These brushes do a great job of keeping my teeth clean.  However, they are supposed to be changed every three months and show signs of wear after only two months.  The &amp;#34;indicator bristles&amp;#34; turn from blue to clear after less than a month of twice daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price and quality of regular, manual toothbrushes, I can&#x27;t understand why these replacement brush heads have to be so expensive.  The Amazon price is the best I&#x27;ve found, and the free shipping with Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan is a plus.  If you use a Sonicare Toothbrush twice daily, you don&#x27;t have much of a choice.</li>
    <li> These are great and help promote great oral health.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for a while and every time I go to the dentist I get a good check up.  The bristles are soft.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great quality brand name replacements, fit all handles perfectly, work much better than the generic ones sold here as well.</li>
    <li> Good product, works like the original brushes.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush heads look and feel authentic to me. Will order from here again.</li>
    <li> Does fit and work properly, but I find the bristles start coming out faster than the original manufacturers. Had to change heads after 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Good price for overpriced brushes.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find replacement heads for my resultpro toothbrush.  These were such a good deal and fit perfect!</li>
    <li> They really clean teeth well. Lost a star for price and only good for 3 months. My first Sonicare brushes were rated for 6 mos and would usually last a yr.</li>
    <li> Beware, these are cheap knock-offs and not a genuine replacement part manufactured by Philips. The fit is too tight compared to the original product and the exposed metal at the base got covered with rust after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> No plastic packaging to cut open.  Just a sturdy plain cardboard box.  The only problem with the packaging is that the box is larger than necessary. It takes up more room than is ideal for storing the brush heads before they are put into service.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads aren&#x27;t in a retail package, but are clearly from Phillips. They fit my toothbrush just fine and saved me a few dollars in the process.</li>
    <li> Love my Sonicare toothbrush and love that I get these 4-pack brush heads every 4 months. Super convenient, and I don&#x27;t even have to think about it :)</li>
    <li> Almost $10 for 1 brush head!!&lt;br /&gt;After I order this 4, I saw other place selling&lt;br /&gt;8 compatible heads for $13&lt;br /&gt;And they all work as good as the Philips&lt;br /&gt;Do more research before you buy this.&lt;br /&gt;Can save a lot of money if you do</li>
    <li> I really enjoy my Sonicare so this 4-pack is a good value on the replacement brushes.  They are the same exact as the ones that came with the toothbrush and do the job well.</li>
    <li> Great price and it comes to the door without having to goto the store.  Same brushes that come with the sonicare as these are not knock offs.  They are Phillips brand.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and bristles feel great in your mouth. They do run down pretty quick and I use my brush twice a day. Probably 2 months or so before you see the blue bristle down to half.</li>
    <li> OK and well made, however we switched to the &amp;#34;Diamond&amp;#34; version, but used these for a few years before that. My wife still uses (prefers) this style, but my son and I needed a stiffer, more durable brush head.</li>
    <li> These are legit and the factory ones- not a knock off and work perfectly:)</li>
    <li> Much better price than any other venues, especially with the Subscribe and Save 15% discount.  Worth the cost to get multiple replacement heads at once!</li>
    <li> No frills packaging; order arrived ahead of expected delivery date. 4 heads for Sonicare toothbrush, as expected. Repeat customer</li>
    <li> I love the easy open packaging.  Same great product that comes from Sonicare.  And now with the auto delivery I never run out of brush heads.</li>
    <li> buying replacement brush heads at your local Walmart or chain pharmacy at a much cheaper price with an extra brush and eco friendly/frustration free packaging. Will order again when I need more brush heads.</li>
    <li> These are the same heads that came with my Philips toothbrush and they work just as well.  The price is pretty ridiculous though.</li>
    <li> I LOVE my Sonicare.  After abut 5 years it died, and I immediately had to buy a new one!  Great price on the brush heads &amp; super convenient to do sub &amp; save!</li>
    <li> Works great and fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> I have used Sonicare for a long time. Brush heads last a long time. Love them and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Have been using the sonicare for three or four years.  It has really made a difference.  The way I can tell that is before I began to use it my teeth cleanings seemed to take for ever.  After they go very fast.  My hygienist has even mentioned this fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have had zero cavities and my gums have totally stopped receding.</li>
    <li> I was very excited upon learning that these brush heads came 4 to a pack and they were less than the 3-packs in the store. So, I signed up for the subscription service and waited for my first pack. When they quickly arrived, I opened them up to find that it was only a 3-pack. Saddened by this, I contacted Amazon&#x27;s Customer Service, which was stellar, and they sent me a new &amp;#34;4-pack&amp;#34; at no charge. Welp, the second 4-pack arrived with... you guessed it!! only 3 brush heads inside! Oh well, now I have 6 brush heads for less than the price of 3 in the store.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare. I have one for my wife, and my 2 year old daughter. So I found these and they were good brush heads except there was a small spot on the back of the brush head shaft that rubbed my mouth as I brushed. I looked at some of my other brush heads and that small spot was smoothed out. I&#x27;m guessing these were rejected for that reason. Still a good brush.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t look the same as the one&#x27;s that came with my model. But it seems like they do work on the brush head.</li>
    <li> This is one item that I love having on auto-ship, because otherwise I always forget to change the brush heads. Having these arrive is an instant reminder!</li>
    <li> In the picture shows you that it&#x27;s 4 brush heads, when I opened the box there was only 3 brush heads. Fail</li>
    <li> These are genuine Sonicare replacement heads for a relatively low price and packaged without fuss. I buy these every six months for me and my wife. If you have a Sonicare, buying these is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Why do these darn things have to be so pricey!!!</li>
    <li> They are exactly what you&#x27;d expect... Philips Sonicare set of 4 OEM replacement heads. No fancy packaging... just a cardboard box. Perfect.</li>
    <li> These are the brushes that I have been looking for.  Somehow I got the wrong ones the last time.  These are the professional.</li>
    <li> The brushes come in a box labeled Philips Sonicare. Every thing looks fine. But a months usage convinces one that something is wrong. Cleaning is inferior, Fit between the brush and the handle is wrong, wrong, wrong. My advice, don&#x27;t buy this. The supply chain is likely being poisoned with counterfeits.</li>
    <li> They are exact fits for the toothbrush, and you will notice the difference after 3 months of what new bristles feel like compared to your older head.</li>
    <li> These appear not to Philips, but an imitation. They are VERY soft and do not perform like the brush heads I previously purchased from Philips. I have to brush two timing cycles to get my teeth as clean as with the original Philips brushes. As soft as they are, a hand brush would perform just as well. Also each brush inside the box was placed in a plastic bag with one end open. Not sanitary packaging by today&#x27;s standards and not what a major company such as Philips would place on the market. I&#x27;m guessing - foreign copy.</li>
    <li> Work great,brush teeth..what can I say?</li>
    <li> These are not authentic philips sonicare heads. They do the job but the wear on them is much quicker than true sonicare replacement heads. I am disappointed that I paid $52 for a product that is said to be authentic, and EVEN CAME in a philips box BUT the seal was broken.</li>
    <li> Actually after I write this.  I need to order more.  Great brushing.  Keeps gums and teeth looking great.  Keeps the dentist happy.</li>
    <li> These are very well made toothbrushes and I am very happy with the results I have gotten from using them.  I have been using these brushes for the past two years and I think it is a great value for the money you have to spend on them.  Nice clean feeling after I use it and they also have kept my dentist very happy with my teeth.  They might be more expensive than regular brushes but taking care of my teeth are important to me.</li>
    <li> Changing out the brush heads is absolutely essential. Amazon makes it simple with subscribe and save and you can&#x27;t beat the price and convenience. High quality.</li>
    <li> These, as far as I can tell, are genuine. I appreciate the frustration-free packaging and the zippy delivery. Price is okay; I always wish these would be cheaper.</li>
    <li> Great price and value.</li>
    <li> shipped quickly perfect replacement.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I always used to put off buying new heads in a store cause they are priced so high.  I am satisfied with the amazon price plus I get a 4-pack.  Im a happy camper!</li>
    <li> arrived quickly and a great value for a pack of replacement heads for your toothbrush.  The box they came in is nice and small and fit perfectly in my drawer of my vanity.</li>
    <li> I wear orthodontic braces, and for me, the heads wear out very quickly.  I generally have to replace each brush head weekly which gets expensive due to the cost of these brush heads.  Otherwise, for the first few days the brush heads clean well.</li>
    <li> I recommend these because they are made by Sonicare for the electric toothbrush I purchased.  I bought them at the same time i purchased the electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I had Sonicare Tooth Brush Replacement Heads on a replacement Subscribe and Save Order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than send me what I had received before, Amazon sent these fake Sonicare Toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are not as firm as the Sonicare Brand Brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles are not the same stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes do not have the wear indicator feature as true Sonicare Brushes have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid these at all costs.</li>
    <li> Official heads with no complaints, works as expected. Compact packaging is good for the environment. Only one set of color bands provided if you&#x27;re into those; I don&#x27;t use them.  Sealed in bags in pairs.  Each head has a cap (pictured).</li>
    <li> These are correct for Healthywhite along with other Sonicare models. These are OEM models, not aftermarket. Not sure why I feel that matters but I feel better about it.</li>
    <li> I tried buying a cheaper brand for my Sonicare - I saved money but the brush ends were not as good as the Sonicare and although the packaging stated they worked just like these originals, they didn&#x27;t quite fit all the way down on my sonicare - sure they worked, but not as good as the originals.  So this 4 pack of originals is handy and although I think Philips charges too much for these, the Amazon price is less than I can find it at Walmart.  Plus I am Amazon Prime member so no shipping.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  It does a great job.  The brush heads are a little pricey but it is worth it.</li>
    <li> These brush heads do not fit the sonicare correctly - they are very tight and will eventually loosen your sonicare head pin from taking them off and on.  I know they say sonicare on them, but I believe they are either defective or counterfeit</li>
    <li> Perfect. Fits just right. Works just as good as the overpriced ones in stores.</li>
    <li> My wife an I have had 3 Socicare&#x27;s go bad electrically. At least two were in warranty.  So now I have lots more brushes. Will probably have another base unit go bad before I need this last box.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware - these may be fake.  The packaging appears legit, but the blue bristles never lose color, as other reviewers have noted.  And, yes, it was a pack of three brush heads, not four as pictured.  All around, a rip-off.</li>
    <li> great product! get it when it is on sale though</li>
    <li> I cannot live without my sonicare toothbrush but the replacement heads are so expensive!  I am glad I found it on Amazon Subscribe and Save.  Otherwise I would be purchasing it through my local warehouse super store for +$5 dollars.</li>
    <li> I ordered this Philips Sonicare Pro Results Brush Head, standard 4 pack of replacement brushes for our electric tooth brush unit. We have been using the Sonicare unit for several years and these are replacement brushes. The 4 pack was shipped properly and arrived in a timely manner and we are very satisfied with the quality,</li>
    <li> We have been using these toothbrushes for years as it was recommended by our very trusted dentist.  I replace brush heads every 3 months, have them automatically delivered so I don&#x27;t forget.  Works well for us....brushes still look very good when we replace.</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.  Now I never have to worry about running out of the refills or searching stores and the Internet.  Automatic refills are an option that comes every 5-6 months.  This leaves me the security I need by applying for this great service.  I never have to worry about where to find the refills.  What a great choice.  Many thanks.</li>
    <li> This package arrived yesterday. The toothbrushes arrived individually, as opposed to in a standard package. There is an unusual and inconsistent texture on the toothbrushes. I find it hard to believe these are authentic Philips Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> They are really tiny.&lt;br /&gt;Takes forever to brush my teeth properly.</li>
    <li> These work fine as replacement brushes. They fit my sonicare electric brush just fine.</li>
    <li> They and this brush do a wonderful job of keeping cavities from forming and removing some cavities that are in their infancy before they become a problem the dentist has to fill.</li>
    <li> Love the device. We are on our second Sonicare. These brushes are on our subscription so we don&#x27;t have to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;They are excellent just like the device.</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush heads last a long time&lt;br /&gt;and they fit perfectly on the toothbrush holder without feeling loose or wobbly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes!  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I use these to replace brushes that wear out, on a regular basis. I have had no problems with them at all.</li>
    <li> Usually the brush heads fit well, but this last batch is so hard to get off the Sonicare that I tossed these in the trash because they were past the 30 day return period.  Sighhhhh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  Fortunately, unlike some other purchasers, our package contained the 4 brush heads, along with colored rings.  I waited far too long to replace my toothbrush head.  It&#x27;s amazing how much difference it makes to have a new brush.  The brushes I received look and feel exactly like the ones I received with my original toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Love buying these! A LOT cheaper than buying at Target! Our whole family uses these replacements and convenient to travel with.</li>
    <li> No problems here, order these as cheaply and in as much bulk as possible. Not sure about the non brand knock offs though.</li>
    <li> Fit the Sonicare brush perfectly. No issues. Last long enough (3 months each). I have bought these for last two years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare since the beginning. The Pro version is slim and works great. These brush heads are a great deal, esp. with Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> Perfect.  I was going to order the generic but after reading the reviews, I thought it best to just stick with the Sonicare heads even though more expensive.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Pleased with product and  price.</li>
    <li> Product appears to be the real deal, but as some other customers stated, I paid for 4 but only received 3...</li>
    <li> This product meets all of my expectations based on the description.  we have had no issues with the system.  Still in a breaking in period, but would be apt to replace this with same item down the road.</li>
    <li> This is such a huge improvement to buying these in store.  You can also now subscribe to these and never go without. The packaging is much easier to open and the price per head is much improved over the drugstore price. Please don&#x27;t ever buy these in store again!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the authentic brush heads to the best automatic toothbrush out there.</li>
    <li> Good product : works as expected.</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price!</li>
    <li> Have not yet used these, they just arrived today - but disappointed that package was shorted 1 brush head.  Received 3 not the 4 as described and pictured.</li>
    <li> I just opened the box on this product (I have a subscription, and had just replaced a head with the last one from my previous order when I got this order), and found that there were only 3 heads in the box instead of 4. The box was still sealed with the &amp;#34;If seal is broken&amp;#34; tape, and the box was intact, so I guess the shipper&#x27;s QC department failed on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they work great, easily lasting the 3 months they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
    <li> The description says 4 standard heads, but I received 4 compact heads.</li>
    <li> definietly better than the ones on groupon. this i the actual sonic care one</li>
    <li> Makes my mouth and gums bleed! Not original! Refund!</li>
    <li> Great Value for my Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
    <li> The first 2 times I purchased these I loved them. But this last time they were different. They were in the same brown box, they say Sonicare but they just don&#x27;t work the same. The bristles are way too soft! They also don&#x27;t fit properly on the brush. Waited way too long to return, so I&#x27;m stuck with them :(</li>
    <li> I have been using and enjoying Phillips Sonicare products for years with terrific results. My only issue was finding replacement brush heads at an acceptable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells 4 of these brush heads for the price of two at stores nearby. Each brush head should easily last you three months with proper brushing technique. A lot of brush heads are worn too quickly because too much pressure is applied during brushing. This is not only bad for the longevity of your brush heads but it isn&#x27;t kind to your gums either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and it saves you cash. If you use Sonicare products then this is definitely for you!</li>
    <li> Having bought cheaper knock-offs that fall off my Sonicare brush I went back to those made by Philips. These work and stay put. Not inexpensive, but I&#x27;ll stick with them from now on.</li>
    <li> Delivered what  it said.</li>
    <li> good brush heads, came with 4 that fit the easyclean sonicare brush. will replace hx6013 models.</li>
    <li> I like the auto reordering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wondering if these are real sonicare replacement heads.  They don&#x27;t fit great.  I&#x27;ll buy in Bed Bath and Beyond next time.</li>
    <li> These are definitely legitimate Sonicare heads. I matched the ProCare branding and product no. near the base of the shaft to the ones I bought in Sonicare packaging from Costco. They come with the interchangeable color rings and everything.</li>
    <li> Works, great on my sonic toothbrush! They are not knock offs!</li>
    <li> These heads are exactly the same as those found in the store but are easier to get.  They work great and last longer than suggested.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as described. I&#x27;ve looked and I know I couldn&#x27;t have found it in a local store for this price or even on the Sonicare website.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is the best of this type of product.  My hygenist always tells me that I have the cleanest mouth she has seen all day.</li>
    <li> Despite what some are claiming in these reviews, this is a genuine product. Not much you can say for or against replacement bits for a product you own other than it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality product. I especially appreciate the minimal packaging and the buy and save aspect of the listing. We signed up and it shows up, and it&#x27;s a good reminder to throw out the old brush head on the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brush heads fit our Philips Sonicare toothbrush and have a soft but strong brush head.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend these brush heads, but I have not tried any 3rd party brush heads, if any exist.&lt;br /&gt;They last, on average, about 2-3 months.  My cleaning pattern is to do a quick (1 minute?) brush in the morning, and the full 2 minute brush in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;After the blue band fades, I would recommend that you swap it out for a new brush head to get optimal results.  After using these brush heads, my dental cleanings are a lot shorter.</li>
    <li> There are a couple of reviews that said this was a knockoff product, but if you search the Phillips website, they do sell a 4 pack in a brown box like this one.  When these arrived they were identical to the heads we had purchased from Walmart and fit our toothbrush without any issues.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare plus white along with extra brush heads. Not only do I love the ease of my Sonicare but these brush heads really get the job done. My teeth feel just like I came from the dentist; so clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> My regular subscription was changed to the four pack. Fine with me. The funny thing was they stated that this was the \\&quot;Frustration Free Packaging\\&quot; version and was it ok to replace with it... No, I want to be frustrated!!! Hahaha. Don&#x27;t you hate it when you almost cut off your fingers trying to break into a package?</li>
    <li> Not much to say about these Brush Heads. But they are nicely packaged, easy to open and you get a good price.</li>
    <li> They work.  Seem identical to the ones that came with my toothbrus.  Highly recommend sonicare brush.  Last dentist visit involved very little tooth scraping.</li>
    <li> What can you really say about toothbrush heads?  I&#x27;ll give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they were a little softer but overall they are right in the middle of the spectrum.  One four pack will last one person up to a year or longer if you don&#x27;t change as often as they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is rather high but they are decent quality.  You might be able to find some generic heads out there but these work well and you know what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall they are a decent value.</li>
    <li> Replacement heads work perfectly with my toothbrush.  It is more cost effective to purchase them in this pack than purchasing them in a regular retail store.</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t find at the stores any more...good product that will allow me to keep my base for longer...they also make the small brush heads and they arrived on time...easier then driving all over looking for them</li>
    <li> Buy these in the frustration free package, you will wish you had done so if you don&#x27;t. As always, these are expensive but they work well and my Dentist insists I use them.</li>
    <li> Great brush heads. Original Phillips product.</li>
    <li> Yup, they&#x27;re the replacement heads for the sonicare I bought.  Why?  Why are they so expensive?  Seriously?  You&#x27;d think they would be cheaper...</li>
    <li> These are growing increasingly overpriced for what they used to sell for.</li>
    <li> for a multi pack of brushes, they was economical and reasonable and they fit great on the brush head. great</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my new Sonicare toothbrush and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The packaging was easy and the price was fantastic.</li>
    <li> It is what it is and for the price it is hard to beat. I&#x27;m noticing they wore out a little quicker but maybe that&#x27;s something with sonicare??</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like the original! I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Best to go with name brand. There wasn&#x27;t an option to buy a soft dentist recommended brush. Harsh.</li>
    <li> So far, this is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for keeping my teeth clean.  The one thing that I took off a star for is the system for knowing when to replace a brush.  There is a colored stripe on some of the bristles that loses its color slowly as the toothbrush is used.  When the color is gone you&#x27;re supposed to replace the brush. What I don&#x27;t like is that it loses its color within about a month, even though the brush should still be good for a other 2-5 months.</li>
    <li> These are made to last and fit just fine on our sonicare system.  Cheaper here than buying at the store.</li>
    <li> This is the most recommended dental care item. Periodontist want their patients to use it on a regular basis. This is to prevent serious gum disease, of which I almost was a victim.</li>
    <li> My husband and I are always using sonicare toothbrushes, and being able to have subscription for the heads is very convenient and cheaper than buying them in a shop.</li>
    <li> These brushes feel good on the teeth and will not hut your gums. They last long enough that when my next order is received, I look at my old ones and sure enough it is time to replace. them.  Being on auto ship is also a plus by saving money.</li>
    <li> I have tried the knock off brush heads in the past and they fell off after the second or third use. I will never use knock off brush heads again.  Do yourself a favor spend the money and use the originals for your sonic brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered these heads for my HealthyWhite 710. They fit and work perfectly. They come with the colored rings to differentiate the brush heads between different people, or whatever else you want to use them for.</li>
    <li> It is so much easier to automatically have these shipped every 6 months. Brush heads should be changed every 3-4 months so this way I never run out and it is much cheaper than going out and buying them in a store.</li>
    <li> You can buy this at target at $30 for 3, or you can buy 4 for much less.  you decide.  With a subscription you will save a little extra.  It makes a lot of sense to me.</li>
    <li> great price, better than what you get in the store!  Love the product, my son uses this for his braces works wonders.</li>
    <li> These are definitely better than a manual toothbrush and a better deal when purchased is a 4 pack.  Four stars because they are still pretty pricey to replace every few months.</li>
    <li> This is the Sonicare toothbrush head that fits on the metal post, not the one that screws on. That&#x27;s about all you can say about the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is getting better and better, easier to open anyway. Now it&#x27;s a cardboard box and small plastic bags/sleeves on the toothbrushes. Much nicer than a hard-to-open, heat-sealed, hard-plastic case.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, easy to open, will buy again</li>
    <li> There is nothing really different except packaging. They are packed in plastic and when in cartoon. I think I liked previous packaging better. When I received it, I thought I was send something random, not even Sonicare. Every Sonicare product was securely packed in plastic previously. They perform well.</li>
    <li> Obviously you should replace toothbrush heads more often than I do but for this price - ouch! I&#x27;m still waiting for the less expensive visits to the dentist after a year with our Sonicare. After using it, it would be hard to go back to a &#x27;regular&#x27; toothbrush but why does it have to be sooooo expensive!</li>
    <li> When I got my Sonicare a couple years ago, these brushes cost $7.30 each, now they cost $9.25 each. It was overpriced back then, but now it&#x27;s just over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are just plastic and some bristles... prolly cost like 2 cents for them to make. And there is nothing special about them... they don&#x27;t last long... shorter than a regular manual toothbrush!!! Sneaky Phillips... got me to invest in its toothbrush, and now are milking me as they please on their brush heads...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PHILLIPS, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!!!</li>
    <li> Fits our Sonicare toothbrushes perfectly and works just as they should. We usually change our brush heads every 2-3 months, but they are well made and the bristles can definitely last much longer.</li>
    <li> Pretty straight forward, if you bought the brush and enjoy it, these refills are self explanatory.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush and these brushes are the Phillips brand so they are wonderful and dependable. I bought an off brand to save a few dollars and they weren&#x27;t satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Was worried about purchasing these because past reviewers have said these might be knock-offs but they arrived in original Philips packaging and all the brush heads are in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare Toothbrush, but buying heads at the store was becoming too expensive.  The cost of buying 4 at a time really helps, and the cost of this 4 four pack is less than the cost of 2 two packs.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Sonicare e-series toothbrushes for several years.  Mine stopped holding a charge, so I purchased Pro Results.  Its awesome.  The 4-pack is a great deal.  I love the no-hassle packaging.  To buy these in stores, I have to find someone to unlock the hook so I can even buy them, and then its a fight to cut through the plastic to get them out.</li>
    <li> Shape of brush fits perfectly around teeth. Gives the best clean!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s something very shady about the packaging.  These are not sealed.  Yes, they work but they are not authentic.</li>
    <li> perfect - works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my sonicare brush for many years now.  I feel a lot cleaner when brushing with it.  I typically change brush heads out about every 1.5 months or so.  Maybe too often for some but, I like stiff bristles as opposed to broken in ones.  And a few months ago, Amazon changed to frustration free packaging.  That&#x27;s the best thing ever!</li>
    <li> 30$ for one at walmart- great deal</li>
    <li> I am a long-time user of Sonicare; I&#x27;ve been using various models. It is not the quality, but the recent price increase of the replacement brush heads is quite prohibitive.</li>
    <li> I am happy with the toothbrushes, they are good quality and were shipped quickly.  The electric toothbrush is very good.</li>
    <li> Nice to find the right brush.  There are many different ones  for electric tooth brushes so know exactly what you have.</li>
    <li> I love my sonicare.  These brushheads are a better value than the other options.  I will get these guys again.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric toothbrush for several years now and always use these replacement.  I like getting a 4-pack, as the older ones used to come in 3s and as there are two of us in the house, it was inconvenient.  Last quite a long time, before the blue turns to white and must be replaced.</li>
    <li> They are working fine, they do not fit as well as the original set, For the cost it is still a good buy</li>
    <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great price and brush.</li>
    <li> Fit perfectly and worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare system for over a year and a half now, and have the brush heads on subscription, which I have found to be both an effective way to bring the price down and make sure I&#x27;m changing the heads regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Sonicare system: it took a little while for me to learn to minimize my arm or wrist movements as I brush--having brushed \\&quot;manually\\&quot; for over half a century (::Gasp!::). Letting the movement of the system take on my teeth is much more effective, as one might guess, and it&#x27;s much easier in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a system I&#x27;m very happy with.  My only recommendation is that it is pretty expensive...I can&#x27;t believe a brush head should really cost anywhere close to $15 apiece (the approximate non-subscribed and un-\\&quot;bunched\\&quot; price).  That seems to be a \\&quot;Ha! I&#x27;ve got you now\\&quot; kind of pricing, and irks me every time I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great system.</li>
    <li> Perfect and perfect price!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush... and I have learned my lesson about getting aftermarket replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the real deal Philips heads are pretty spendy, but I have to tell you that they are well worth every penny. All of the aftermarket heads that I have tried are either too soft, too hard, don&#x27;t fit the pin on the top of the toothbrush body properly... something is always wrong with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the true Philips heads, they work great, and I&#x27;ll get them again.</li>
    <li> had very soft bristles,&lt;br /&gt;worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;i loved using them.being using them for two and half months..&lt;br /&gt;still they are as soft as in beginning</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are just like the ones that came with the Sonicare toothbrush.  The package also contains new colored rings.  I like the reduced packaging available, the brown box is easily recyclable compared to the packaging found at the store.  The price is also great on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Getting a multi-pack is a better buy per head.  My hubby and I love our Sonicare.  Our teeth feel so much cleaner and our gums are much heathier.  We even bought one for our 3 and 4 year old kids.</li>
    <li> I do enjoy the Sonicare toothbrush, and it&#x27;s important to have new heads every 6 months.  Yay for Sonicare products.</li>
    <li> If you have a Philips Sonicare HX7023/30 Eseries, these will not fit.  You need the larger ones with the large base.  The entire top of the toothbrush screws off of my model, not just the small toothbrushing appliance.  Make sure you take apart your toothbrush before ordering!</li>
    <li> I love my Sonicare and I&#x27;m glad that I can buy these replacement heads for it .  My dentist loves that I use this toothbrush. He says my cleanings are a breeze due to the placque breaking capabilities of these toothbrushes</li>
    <li> This was the first time I bought replacement brushes after 6 months of use. Huge difference between a new head and an old one. You can feel the rigidity of the brush and get that quality clean feeling after first using the sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the packaging 4 stars. The added stickers made the package seem less &amp;#34;frustration free&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Fits proresults edition. Brushes like a pro. Fools dentists. They think you go for a cleaning every year but you don&#x27;t do you! It&#x27;s for those of us that like to go the extra mile for cleanliness.</li>
    <li> Save and buy in bulk.</li>
    <li> This product seems legit. It looks &amp; functions like the original brush head that came with my Sonicare system. It&#x27;s the best price i&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> We are very pleased with the quality and performance of the Philips Sonicare tooth brush heads and recommend them to all users of the Philips electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Are these made out of gold? If people stop buying these ridiculously expensive brush heads and buy generic (they are the same), the companies will stop selling at a 400% mark up just because their name is on them.  I find it so offensive!</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s authentic or not but 5 days into using it, it&#x27;s doing fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this multiple times. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> These are the replacement heads for the Sonicare toothbrush that I own.  All in all, these are good brushes and last about as long as expected, but they seem to be overpriced.  I mean, it costs about $9 per brush, which is quite high.  It may be what the expected going rate is, but it just seems too high to me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s important for best performance of your Sonicare to replace the heads on a regular basis. I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problems with these. Great price for a four pack which should last a year with normal use.</li>
    <li> These brush heads work perfectly and fit my tooth brush.  This is the best price and quantity I could find these!  Beats out any other merchant!</li>
    <li> I like to change the brush heads monthly and these work great. I will be reordering on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using my sonicare for about 3 years now and I love it.  Particularly with a new brush head, there is no better feeling that completely clean teeth that the sonicare can deliver.  I was ordering replacement heads from amazon with the subscribe and save, which at the time, was a 3pk for about $12, which I thought was reasonable considering a standard, quality toothbrush will run you about $3-$4 anyway.  Slowly, this price began to creep up and now, they offer the 4pack at a whopping $37 ($35 with S&amp;S).  $9 a brush head?  Are you mad?!  I can&#x27;t think of any reason why they would continue to jack up the price of these things.  And to be honest, no matter how much I love my sonicare, I refuse to pay $9 for a brush head when I can pay less than half that for a good quality toothbrush.  Perhaps Oral-B has cheaper brush heads.  Who knows.  But, at least for me, it&#x27;s time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a great product if you&#x27;re willing or just don&#x27;t care about spending the money.  The sonicare system and the brush heads do a great job and leave you feeling clean and refreshed.  But for someone like me who&#x27;s never had a cavity in my life even before using the sonicare system, I&#x27;ll gladly go back to the tried and true before giving Philips more of my money for the same, exact product.</li>
    <li> these work great - no complaints except maybe for the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;other than that ive since found generic ones that work the same and cost half the price.</li>
    <li> Item was received in great condition and was happy to see that it was genuine Sonicare  brushes. Deliver was relatively quick. I will continue to shop Amazon. Actually all products that I have received have been good.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare products for 10+ years now...and they contribute to a huge overall difference in your dental health!  This package of 4 replacement heads is a great deal!</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush and thankful that the refills are in an even number since initial purchase came with two bases.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed and wanted.  I had ordered the smaller size last time and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
    <li> . Helps keep my teeth and gums in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;. The only toothbrush for me is the Sonicare.  I have been using it for over 10 years now, my dentist and I are very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;. Amazon&#x27;s great price and convenience.</li>
    <li> I love my phillips sonic care healthy white toothcare system. Make sure you are getting the right brush head for the right system. A four pack is a year&#x27;s supply for one person if you are changing out at the recommended 3 month interval. Packaging is minimal recycle cardboard.  If this is your first replacment make sure you clean the metal tip on your brusher well before inserting into the new brush heads (keeps mildew, mold from building up).</li>
    <li> so glad we finally thought of adding these to our S&#x27;n&#x27;S on Amazon.  our fault we couldn&#x27;t seem to remember to pick up replacements for nearly a year.  greatly appreciate they come in a multipack with recyclable packaging. little box also seems great and reusable for shipping smaller items</li>
    <li> Toothbbrush and sonicare base have been best ever for my dental health. My dental hygienist confirms this per dental evaluation. BUT packaging was so difficult to open that I broke my kitchen knife trying to open it. Unless packaging improves, I&#x27;ll have to get tooth brushes elsewhere.  This is a change from previous packing which was easy to open.</li>
    <li> these are the bomb! great for the price plusgood customer service, i bought a set a few months back and one of them wasnt perfect, they refunded my money...the rest of the brushes were fine, so now ive bought  more and im completly satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Great brushes.  Also liked the non-wasteful packaging - recyclable and low volume.</li>
    <li> They work well andare quite durable.  My only complaintis over the high price; roughly $7 each!  A regular brush  is a fraction of this price.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Trouble free dental check ups! The subscriber program makes it simple to save money and change to a new brush as recommended.</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes, and I received only 3 brushes. I contacted Amazon, and they made it right. I give Amazon an A+++. I like the brushes that I received, and they are exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare system is great, and replacing these brushes are mandatory for use.  I&#x27;ll admit that I may leave the brushes on a little past when the blue strip tells me I should replace them, but there&#x27;s been no trouble.  Appreciate the frustration-free and bulk packaging, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Philips Sonicare Pro results electric toothbrush. I recommend it to everyone. I have owned it for about 3 years now. I was getting a little lazy about ordering new heads and used my last 1 for little too long I forgot how good it can be. I ordered these and it was like a trip to the dentist my teeth felt great my gums felt massage. Make sure you change your brush every so often. These are great quality and straight from the company.</li>
    <li> It is great to have a new brush when you need one, I love my Philips Sonicare HX 6014/30 pro my dentist always hads a great report now that I have the Sonicare. Clean bill of heathy teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this brush system. I wish I could get more life out of the brush heads, though. Maybe I brush too long?</li>
    <li> These work very well. I was just bummed about the price going up for them. Recommend for those looking for a good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great price for sonicare heads, and for once the packaging isn&#x27;t ridiculous.  I highly recommended the Sonicare system, including the heads, to anybody.  Your teeth will never feel furry again!</li>
    <li> Really love my Sonicare though the brush heads sometimes need replacing which is why I bought these.  Packaging is easy to open and quality of the product is solid. I&#x27;ll buy these again once my current heads wear out.</li>
    <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.</li>
    <li> Much better quality than the seemingly cheaper counterfeits here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> they fit perfectly..a bit more expensive that I hoped but they work...</li>
    <li> in my mind the philips sonicare system is the best out there.  never have my teeth felt cleaner.  the only downside of these things is that they&#x27;re expensive for toothbrushes.  however, i&#x27;ve decided that it&#x27;s much cheaper to buy these than to have less than clean and healthy teeth.</li>
    <li> I subscribe to these replacement heads.  I switch out the heads pretty often about once a month so these are perfect! I love my sonicare toothbrush and can never use a manual toothbrush again!</li>
    <li> I love these sonicare tooth brushes.  My teeth feels squeaky clean every time I use them.  Cost is a little high but Amazon usually have the best prices.</li>
    <li> The best price I&#x27;ve been able to find so far.  Wish the toothbrush heads would last a little longer, but once you go Sonicare you NEVER go back!</li>
    <li> I paid for 4 heads and the box only contained 3.  Looks like other customers are experiencing the same issue.</li>
    <li> They work fine, but seems like the bristles are softer than the ones I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> These are good, but you can get functionally equivalent generic replacements on Amazon for much much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved 90% by ordering these generics on Amazon instead:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 x Generic replacement brush heads compatible with P-HX-6014 replacement brush heads from PE GENERIC</li>
    <li> One of the brush heads was faulty. Didn&#x27;t work - came apart. Too late for a return because I didn&#x27;t use all 4 brush heads within a one month time period.... imagine that.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to be able to find replacement heads for a value. I bought a pack for my daughters sonicare too!</li>
    <li> I like having extra Sonicare brush heads on hand so I can change as soon as they have lost the blue indicator.</li>
    <li> Received all 4 brushes as advertised. They actually fit a little tighter than the original that came with the unit, so they&#x27;re a little more difficult to remove. Other than that, the brush quality is every bit as good as the original brush.</li>
    <li> This is the best price for replacement brush heads that we found; the four-pack will keep us supplied for a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;The quick 2-day delivery is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love the Sonicare, and can really feel the distance when I use it.  The replacement heads are not inexpensive.  I looked for a good deal and settled on this one.  I&#x27;m glad I did - the price per brush head was the lowest, and it is manufacturer&#x27;s quality.</li>
    <li> Replacement brush is the same as the original, so its a perfect fit.  Brush is soft, yet durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these kind of brushes for more than 2 years. It cleans my teeth and feels so clean, that is why I always order these brushes. If you buy these brushes on other stores they are so expensive, but on amazon.com the price is always right.</li>
    <li> And the frustration free packaging really is frustration free. I love my Sonicare, and the replacement heads for it are great. I like the small size slightly more than this standard size, but hey...it&#x27;s the right price and frustration-free.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Works like all the other tooth brushes that goes on the body that we had been using. Great price.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE FAKE. They should have \\&quot;sonicare\\&quot; written on them.  I bought the FlexCare+ model before it was even released for public sale through a Philips sales rep at the dentist I worked for. And none of my brush heads then said \\&quot;ProResults\\&quot; and all brush heads in the store today say \\&quot;sonicare\\&quot;. I would be skeptical about saving a couple bucks if these could have the potential of damaging your gums. All toothbrushes (but especially power toothbrushes) when used improperly can VERY quickly cause gum recession.</li>
    <li> These are excellent but expensive....however they are competitive with the market... The 4 pack is great which gives my wife and I two changes... and they work great. You dont realize how good the new ones are until you change out the old one..... Worth the money for this great item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s never fun buying replacement heads for your toohbrush because they&#x27;re so expensive! I shopped around a ton and this was the best deal I could find. They work great and now I don&#x27;t have to buy them again for another year. :0)</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using sonicare for over 2 years now. Started the Amazon auto shipping a year ago. It saves us a lot of time and money getting the replacement heads this way. Sonicare is a great way to care for your teeth. It was recommended by my dentist and makes our annual cleaning a lot shorter visit.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is a wonderful way to brush your teeth clean without extra effort.  The 4 pack helps to keep costs down.</li>
    <li> These replacement brush heads fit my Sonicare HealthyWhite perfectly, and provide a great clean feeling to my teeth.  However, there is a blue strip towards the top of the toothbrush to indicate when the toothbrush needs to be replaced.  This blue strip wore away FAR before the 3 months I normally use toothbrushes.  Do not use that blue strip as an indicator of when to replace the toothbrush.  Simply replace every three months.  I am not sure if this was designed to make people buy more brush heads than they need, or if it is simply flawed for another reason, but you will spend far more than you need to if you replace your brush heads before their 3 months are up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these perform the same as the brush head that came with my toothbrush.</li>
    <li> My husband and I received our Sonicare as a gift so had no choice in the matter - I wish the toothbrush worked with generic heads. These are fine, but really expensive considering they need to be replaced so often.</li>
    <li> Brush heads arrived as described, and well packaged. Husband thinks they are a little hard to put on our particular model. However, I double checked the manual and the boxes that this is the correct brush head style that is compatible with our Philips Sonicare model. I think they get a little easier to put on over time. These are a good deal and work just fine. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads are great. They are often difficult to find in stores; I have since discovered that there are several models of Sonicare toothbrush that utilize these heads which may be some of the cause in difficulty to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a handy blue indicator built in to some of the bristles that turn white gradually with use to alert you when to replace the brush head. This seems to happen earlier than it should, often suggesting replacement in less than one month, which would become quite expensive at the cost of these. Price on the replacement heads does seem to be somewhat excessive, especially since Sonicare removed the magnets from use in this line of of electric toothbrush creating a brush head that has less plastic than a manual brush. When bought in bulk however, it becomes more comparable to the price of nicer manual toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all however, I do prefer this toothbrush and the smaller size of these replacement heads to a manual brush. I highly recommend the brand and have been happily using it for the last decade.</li>
    <li> Note many words to describe the brush heads. The price was not too bad, and they have wear marks on them to tell you when to replace.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads, though listed as original, don&#x27;t seem to be of the same quality as the ones that originally came with my Sonicare toothbrush. The bristles come out a lot easier.</li>
    <li> I love the sonicare toothbrush, have had one for years. I like the timer feature, no short cutting. These replacement heads are authentic and work well.</li>
    <li> My pile of crap sonicare toothbrush broke and so I don&#x27;t even use these things anymore.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrushes and the fact that you can subscribe and save - HOWEVER, there are much less expensive generic imitations that cost a fraction of what you pay for these.  I ended up spending a third of the price of these buying 8 toothbrush heads.  Shop around is my advice!</li>
    <li> I balk slightly at the price of these replacement heads, but at least I know what I am getting: Real replacement brushes--not fabricated fakes--that will fit perfectly and do the same cleaning job that the original brushes did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you: I tried buying a three pack of those \\&quot;generic\\&quot; brushes, and they were/are absolute garbage. (Thankfully, Amazon gave me a full refund and I reported the seller for possible fraud.) They don&#x27;t fit properly and do absolutely nothing but piss off the person who risks buying them. I implore you to think about what you want: Pay more, get perfection; pay a lot less, get a s*** product that was probably made in Chinese sweatshop and is not only ineffective but likely poisonous. The choice is yours.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit right out of the package and quite a savings buying online vice retail. Great product.</li>
    <li> great subscribe and save item, highly recommend that pick these up instead of paying an arm and a leg at the local wholesale/grocery stores.</li>
    <li> I have had my Sonicare toothbrush for about 2 years.  I was stunned when I realized how much replacement heads cost!  Happily, I discovered Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save feature.  Replacement heads are still not cheap, but the price is much more reasonable with this service.  I am very happy with the Sonicare.  My dental hygenist noticed the difference it made just 2 months after I started using it.</li>
    <li> Better packaging than plastic clamshell these used to come in. This came in a small recyclable cardboard box and the heads are minimally wrapped in plastic. Sonicare is great and my dentist has noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Sonicare toothbrush with its replaceable Pro results brush heads.  The brush heads last for 3 months and do a very good job cleaning my teeth.  I use the gum care setting which is 2 1/2 minutes per brushing and the brush heads do a good job.</li>
    <li> Excellent item, quick shipping, we recommend!</li>
    <li> Could h ave purchased for a lower price. Not a bargain. Too many notices sent to me .this us a very poor format to respond.</li>
    <li> Does the job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Great product, felt these worked better than the standard brush heads. They seem to have more dense bristles and did a more thorough job of cleaning. Was also pleased with the easy open packaging (no cuts from ripping plastic!) Overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Not much to say, it&#x27;s made for the brush, so it&#x27;s working great. I ll buy another pack when time comes.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do &amp; does it well. Each brush lasts about 2 months before I need to change it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these in 3 packs.  Two of us use a Sonicare and it was a bit of a pain buying these in threes.  Not a huge deal but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> This is not the original product, I think. Probably, it is a counterfeit. I could compare the original Philips product and this &#x27;something.&#x27; It looks almost identical but the head bristles has a little bit different color. It also wears out significantly faster than the original and the flosses stick in different directions. I compare my 2 mnts old original with my wife&#x27;s 1 week new &#x27;fake&#x27; brush head and mine looks much better. My advise: do not buy it, you waste your money.</li>
    <li> We have been using the Sonic Care toothbrush for years. Our dentist loves the way our teeth look on check ups and I credit it to this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> These brush heads are less expensive than if I bought them locally, and I like the convenience of subscribing to force us to change them at the proper interval.</li>
    <li> Loved the product, loved the ecofriendly packaging. Loved that I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying them online every few months.</li>
    <li> Items were received and are brand new in a plastic sealed container ready to use when needed.  No special tools required to open the box.</li>
    <li> Item as described,price not bad either</li>
    <li> I love my Philips Sonicare toothbrush. The only downside is the cost of the replacement brushes but you definitely need to replace them regularly to get the full results of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this pro-series better than the e-series screw on brushes. Those tend to grow mold if you are not diligent with drying them. I used to unscrew them after each use to avoid the issue. I have not had the mold issue with the Pro-Series brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is the best price I have found consistently for these brushes.</li>
    <li> Fix my Sonicare and am so glad to have new brushes</li>
    <li> Appear to be genuine Soncaire.  Good price.</li>
    <li> The order was quick and priced very well.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE ON THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> They do a fantastic job cleaning our teeth and a fair price too.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrushes - excellent products.  Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like the frustration free packaging of this product...makes a big difference when you are trying to open it!  The product itself works just as I expected it to... but I have been using Sonicare for over 5 years now.  My teeth always feel super clean.</li>
    <li> Exactly like the one that came new with my brush.  And at a much better price than if bought individually.</li>
    <li> Great buy. The multi-pack of the pro results brush heads are great. Much better than buying in the store and they are the same exact product and quality. Also, much easier to open thanks to amazon. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Package came in the original box in good condition.  Brush head replacement is straightforward.  The brush heads also come with the replaceable color trims for identifying brush heads.</li>
    <li> It is really good product. There no difference betwee this and the original one. The price is great. I higher recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Replacement brushes . . . well worth the price for the quality.</li>
    <li> well packaged and sent very prompyly/ Love this product, Best dental record over the past few years. Recommend changing every other month for best results</li>
    <li> I love it. My mouth feels so clean after a brushing and I like the extra sonic brushing, too.  The only problem is the cost of the replacement brushes. They are too expensive and obviously can&#x27;t cost the manufacturer very much to produce.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are exactly like the brush heads that came with my Philips Sonicare tooth brush.  I use the soft heads and I&#x27;m pleased with my order.</li>
    <li> Came when I expected it, product was right fit for my toothbrush, good price as well compared to buying from dentist.</li>
    <li> Maybe I had a unique experience, and these are the exact same heads that you&#x27;d buy in the standard pack in a retail store, but each one had a slightly rough part on the back, which I assume is a product of the injection moulding technique used to make them.  They still work, I still use them, but long-term, I need brush heads that don&#x27;t annoy my lip.</li>
    <li> I really like the four brush heads contained in an easy open package.  I will reorder this same item when the time comes.</li>
    <li> I recently upgraded my Sonicare toothbrush. (purchased from Amazon) It came with one replacement head. I like to keep additonal brush beads on hand so I went to the store to purchase additional brushes I was very overwhelmed by the price. Amazon always delivers. Excellent service and price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m laughing as I write this. What could be good or bad about toothbrush head replacements? They fit the toothbrush!</li>
    <li> This is a great deal for Sonicare brushes.  I have mine shipped automatically every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;The timing and the cost work out perfectly.</li>
    <li> These fit my sonicare perfectly and worked as one would expect.  This was the most reasonable option out of all the choices and it was through prime.</li>
    <li> I always have excellent dental check-ups after using this.  I believe Sonicare is the best is the best toothbrush available.</li>
    <li> We use Philips Sonicare teeth cleaning system, as our dentist recommends, and this provides a great value for keeping our replacement heads new and always available.  I did prefer the older packaging, since the heads seemed to be easier to find in the myriad of things you have to store in your bathroom (my husband can find nothing without the easier task of me looking for it for him!), but that is a small complaint for a good product.</li>
    <li> I chose this product because it was recommended by my Dentist and his technician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not and have never like the brushes.  Not only do they cost too much they do not hold up well, as in last any length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not really recommend this entire product to anyone.  I continue to purchase the brushes&lt;br /&gt;because I made a big investment in product and and disabled and unable to go out to stores and purchase these brushes cheaper, therefore, I have to order from you folks.</li>
    <li> Phillips indicates these brush heads should be replaced every 3 months.  They provide a disappearing blue in some of the bristles to tell you when the head needs replacing.  Unfortunately, the blue is totally gone in about 4 weeks and shortly thereafter, the bristles are too soft to be effective.  I still love the Sonicare tooth brush so I will just replace the brush heads every month.  Expensive!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised</li>
    <li> Nothing much more to say here, standard philips sonicare replacement heads in a real easy to open box.  The previous boxes with the plastic molded crap, why do they even bother with those plastic molded casing?</li>
    <li> No fancy technical review here. I bought these on the &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; Amazon program. That way it forces me to change my toothbrushes heads every 3 months when it arrives (the order re occurrence I set on subscribe and save). These are the normal size ones, I tried the smaller size (my toothbrush came with one) and I liked the full size better. I immediately noticed the difference using this brush. It wears out at just the right .Never had any issues. They come with the color coder rings for the bottom as well. No fancy package, since I don’t need any, nor do I want any. I will keep re-ordering these as long as they make them.</li>
    <li> Works with my toothbrush</li>
    <li> When I first got these, I really thought they were knockoffs. However, Sonicare does, indeed, sell four pro results brushheads in this type of a package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit into my genuine sonicare flexbrush just fine without any issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to these, I have also used the diamond clean and the hydroclean as well as the standard. I like to mix it up every few months because I feel each one of them cleans a little bit differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with that said, these are probably my favorite. They leave my teeth feeling the cleanest. The diamond clean are nice, but too expensive and not really worth that much more than these heads. The nice thing about them is that they don&#x27;t seem to break down as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushheads are supposed to last you three months, but I don&#x27;t think they really do...they are more or less done for me in about 2 months. I brush twice a day, morning and evening, just to give you perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, these are the genuine brushheads you are looking for. They work well with the brushes they are rated for. They give your teeth a good overall clean. They do not simulate flossing like the hydroclean. They are offered at a pretty good price here (though still expensive compared to regular brushes of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proceed with confidence.</li>
    <li> Great way to save money on quality replacement theads. Compared cost against stores in my area and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush and from a pricing point, very good.  It is difficult to find these Philips heads and when you do, they aren&#x27;t cheap.</li>
    <li> Hi Sonicare gang,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, I realize this review is going to be buried like pogs in my attic, but I wanted to tell you guys how much I appreciate your product.  You guys take quality and the buy-it-for-life thing seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only a few years ago my dentist recommended you to me. Since then, you&#x27;ve brightened my smile and been a part of every trip and major event in my life, every step of the way ensuring I have a glistening, righteous smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I&#x27;m writing you doesn&#x27;t have to do with your product, per-say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sitting here on my couch after working 13-hrs straight, I came home to a package resting on my doorstep with more replacement heads inside. I actually flinched at the thought of having to fight with the hard, brutally sharp plastic your replacement heads normally arrive in.  Incidentally, I even said, \\&quot;God, I really need these heads, give me the strength not to hurl this plastic and its contents across the room. Give me the patience and tenacity to dominate this packaging with swift execution. And please don&#x27;t wreck my damn scissors.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Sonicare, you simply provided a tiny cardboard box with four brush heads hanging out inside, with no fighting to be had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for being awesome with the packaging, Philips Sonicare package design team. You guys got it.</li>
    <li> I bought some generic heads earlier to save money. I threw them away withing a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the same as the original.  Keeps my fangs healthy and clean.</li>
    <li> did this product mention the bristles were firm?  They are much more firm than the bristles that came with my sonic care.  I still like the product, it just took some adjusting.</li>
    <li> We love our Sonicare, and the brushes are very good, cleaning your teeth quite well.  They may seem pricey, but the best prices we&#x27;ve found are on Amazon.</li>
    <li> the Philips brush are grate they clean my teeth good. they make me glad that I got them. The size is right.</li>
    <li> I love the toothbrush, not so much a fan of the cost for replacements, but its your teeth, so you pay a little bit more to save a lot more from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes sense, that i search around to find the best deal and i believe amazon has it. No worries on going to the store and searching, this is sent to me every few months and there is nothing to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be buying again in a few months, thanks to amazon offering a great price and hassle free shipping. too cool</li>
    <li> Horrible! Im not sure if these are really even SonicCare heads because the quality was so poor! The bristles came off in my mouth and were very very abrasive.</li>
    <li> Not easy to find the better Sonicare brush heads, even directly with Sonicare. They seem to be out of stock often. These came packaged nicely and were very easy to open and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I bought the Sonicare system a year ago and have yet to buy a brush head that lasts longer than a month.  You are supposed to change the brush head when the blue bristles turn white.  Those blue bristles on every single one have turned white within a month.  That does appear to signal a worn out brush since the bristles are definitely weaker once they turn white.  I&#x27;m not sure what to do.  My dentist recommends Sonicare, and I like the job it does.  But--my options are to scrap the Sonicare for a different system, pay $10 a month for a toothbrush, or use the brush heads for the three months they are supposed to last.  I don&#x27;t like any of the options.  Amazon has already replaced two of the first three heads, but the replacements didn&#x27;t last any longer.  What to do?  Buy more?  I haven&#x27;t decided yet.&lt;br /&gt;  Amazon seems to know these brush heads don&#x27;t last as long as Sonicare advertises.  If you subscribe for four brush heads, Amazon suggests getting them every five months.  If they lasted as long as Sonicare advertises, a subscription for four should be once a year.</li>
    <li> Pretty standard replacements heads. No-hassle packaging was a nice new touch. These were cheaper than buying new heads in the store.</li>
    <li> If you do the math, this is a lot more cost effective than buying them in any of the major stores</li>
    <li> Over $30 for four pieces of plastic with bristles? I love my Sonicare toothbrush and that&#x27;s the only reason I continue to purchase these brushes.</li>
    <li> Good brushes. I think that the Phillips Sonicare tooth brushes are excellent and are far more effective and convenient than manual tooth brushes.</li>
    <li> Name brand brush heads. They last, they work, not much can go wrong.</li>
    <li> These seem to be legit OEM replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are lasting as long as the retail heads and fit my brush body perfectly. They only give you one package of the little o-rings (used to identify heads for people sharing a brush body), so don&#x27;t lose that. Normally, you get a little package of o-rings for each brush-head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for this package, and I keep re-ordering this exact package when I need refills. The price is not &amp;#34;too good to be true&amp;#34;, just a good deal.</li>
    <li> What can you say, it&#x27;s a replacement toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great value and works perfectly.</li>
    <li> Excellent, original. Best price, certainly a lot cheaper than buying from the dentist.</li>
    <li> I saw a lot of reviews on here about these being fake/fraud toothbrush heads. I must say if they are different, I can&#x27;t tell. They look and feel the same. The only difference I found from the stock to these replacements was a serial number printed on the actually neck of the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the price and the same feel, I will continue to buy these. They are amazing!</li>
    <li> I enjoy having these toothbrushes delivered to my home regularly.</li>
    <li> The best.  I first bought a generic and they were worthless.  Stick with the brand.</li>
    <li> Have purchased multiple times.  Can not beat the price</li>
    <li> i use these as replacement heads for my sonicare toothbrush. they work well.</li>
    <li> This is the only place I&#x27;ve found for replacement heads for mine toothbrush; am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Have ordered these in the past with no problem.  This batch did not fit all the way down on the brush handle.  The resulting vibration made it impossible to use.  Returning.</li>
    <li> But prices keep going up and up everytime I offer them... otherwise I love my sonicare toothbrush. Better buy than going to Target.</li>
    <li> I had the Oral B first and my dentist visits never really seemed to change. The cleanings still took about an hour. But since I have started using the Sonic my cleanings have been reduced to less than thirty minutes.</li>
    <li> These are the exact same heads as the head that came with my brush right out the box. The stores in my area want about $23-26 a head for these. Well worth the purchase. Will be buying again in the coming months.</li>
    <li> They are what they say they are--toothbrush heads.  We have been getting these for years.  I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else.  Love sonicare.  I think the amazon subscribe and save price could be better though.</li>
    <li> More convenient as a 4 pack than the previous 3 pack for two people. We like having the subscription option.</li>
    <li> I have been using sonicare for about 8 years so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. I believe these replacement heads are FAKE! They look the same at first but they didnt&#x27; fit onto my Soncare as easily as the others and the bristles are far too SOFT. There&#x27;s no resistance on them at all so how can they clean your teeth!!!! I&#x27;m going to ask for my money back ASAP...</li>
    <li> Love the smaller handle design. I have been a fan of Sonicare for many years but have always used the original.</li>
    <li> The brush heads are too soft for my taste.  They also wear out too fast.  The instructions say they are supposed to last approximately three months but one month is all I get out of one brush head.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a harder brush and one that would last longer.</li>
    <li> These are good brush heads for my new Sonicare. I bought the new Flex-care brush and these brush heads are made for it.</li>
    <li> this was a great buy, works great.nice item for the price .the 4 pack was a great fit for our family.</li>
    <li> I love to Sonicare Toothbrushes.  My dentist has said my teeth are cleaner ever since I used them.  The extra price of the Toothbrush is countered but savings on dental work.  These brushes (with a subscribe and save discount) are the same price as 3 brush heads from my local awl-mart.</li>
    <li> Compared to buying these at the store these came at a great price.  I would order from them again.  I still think they should be cheaper for the product which is why i only gave four stars for the review but that is not the fault of the vendor.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using the Sonicare electric toothbrush, but the brush heads do have to be replaced.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the lowest I&#x27;ve found anywhere, and the product is the genuine article.</li>
    <li> Perfect in quality and effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I love getting these by mail.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re still paying almost $10 for a toothbrush head and while I can appreciate the &amp;#34;razor and blades&amp;#34; model that Sonicare has going here you&#x27;d think they could do better. Keep in mind that most places sell these for way more than $10/head too! It&#x27;s a good brush head and works fine, and the small packaging (all cardboard) is a great touch. Drop these to $5/head and it&#x27;s 5 star all the way.</li>
    <li> I got a Sonicare product as a gift. The toothbrush/charger set came with a small and the listed larger head. Both heads do a far greater job than any &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used but the larger one still leaves your teeth noticeably cleaner. A normal CLEAN pass on your teeth will leave them feeling like you just got out of the dentist. Another thing you notice after switching to these toothbrushes is the lack of plaque that the dental floss picks after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 months of use I have noticed some whitening of my teeth without the use of any whitening toothpaste. I have not gone to the dentist yet to see if it has had any effect on my cavity prone teeth but I cannot see myself going back to a manual toothbrush ever again.</li>
    <li> Good price for these brush heads!  I found this to be a better deal than most places I have shopped in the past.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as I had expected. Each individual Brush Head came in its own sealed package within the pictured Phillips Sonicare box.</li>
    <li> These are fake brush heads.  They didn&#x27;t fit properly on my Sonicare FlexCare brush (it was loose and moved around a little), but I used it anyway thinking it was just a fluke.  Well, after one week of use it broke my toothbrush.  I then compared these to one original ProResults brush head that I still had, and I could see some differences:  the bristles are slightly different color, the writing is slightly different, also the blue bristles on the one I used for a week are already halfway faded.  After I realized this, I read the one-star reviews and saw that I am not the only one who got fakes.</li>
    <li> I bought these to have some extra heads for my sonicare, quality heads, fit perfect, great to have some spares in the closet.</li>
    <li> * First it ain&#x27;t cheap. Cost much more than a regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* But it will last pretty long even if i use it thrice per day.&lt;br /&gt;  Mine last almost a year before i decided to change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Poor quality control??? Some of the brush are alrady out of shape when i received it :(</li>
