      <li>This shaver is weighted nicely and feels good in the hand, and I have had no issues with the heads popping</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is an all around very capable shaver at an excellent price.</li>
      <li>There should be more sellers like this one!</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I was impressed with the close shave.</li>
      <li>it really works the titanium is a great Plus.!</li>
      <li>it felt nice too.</li>
      <li>It would be nice if it came wth a case.</li>
      <li>The cordless feature is a really nice feature..</li>
      <li>The fact it can be rinsed out with water is nice too.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of electric shavers over the years (Norelco, Panasonic, Remington, etc.), and I believe this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>So I was thrilled to get a shot at trying the RemingtonR-5130NB Flex 360</li>
      <li>I hope this isn&#x27;t some kind of scam</li>
      <li>and I plan on using this razor into the foreseeable future.ing needs this has done quite nicely for me.</li>
      <li>nice close shave</li>
      <li>It also has a nice popup trimmer for close trimming.</li>
      <li>got the R-7130 for my older son about a year ago, no problems, does a great job, he is still happy with it.</li>
      <li>First though, the good things - the shaver feels very nice in your hands.  </li>
      <li>He loves it too and is finally clean shaven!!</li>
      <li>A good shaver is worth good money.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work right out of the box!!!</li>
      <li>This Remington does produce a nice and even shave, but nothing better than my Norelco.  </li>
      <li>The shave was fairly close and even, and it was completed in a pretty good amount of time.  </li>
      <li>I get a good clean shave quickly,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>, I have not had any problems keeping it clean, and it still does a good job.  </li>
      <li>and this is easy to obtain the latest books out there!</li>
      <li>He is impressed with how well the Remington Flex 360 works, and he generally turns his nose up at electric shavers.    </li>
      <li>They are very light</li>
      <li>BUT it is made very very cheaply.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight and easy to use and gives a really nice shave.</li>
      <li>The nice thing about this one is that it is lightweight, rinseable and charges very quickly.</li>
      <li>For shorter trips this isn&#x27;t an issue because the battery lasts a week, but it could become a problem on more extended journeys or if you just have two bulky things to plug into your bathroom outlet.</li>
      <li>, OK.  </li>
      <li>Granted, they&#x27;re designed to come off for cleaning, but the problem is that it is so cheaply made that the plastic molding broke in the process (of running it across my face!)</li>
      <li>Will look for a better shaver...</li>
      <li>the top pops off &amp; everything flies everywhere.</li>
      <li>if anything notable happens I will update this post.</li>
      <li>I acknowledge that the shavers I am comparing them to cost 2 to 3 times more</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Perhaps my face, which is kinda squarish, is better suited to the Norelco shavers.    </li>
      <li>Had a Norelco for MANY years that just wouldn&#x27;t quit.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaver...</li>
      <li>I like their shavers anyhow, but now will be sure to always buy Remington because I know they will go out of their way to resolve problems.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Have had the Remington R-5130 for about 3 months and am thoroughly dissatisfied.  1)  The small rotary heads frequently pop out during use and end up on the floor.  2)  The door (whereby the head opens up for cleaning) pops open every time you set the razor down.  3) It takes about 2x as long to shave compared to my prior razor, a Norelco.  I ended up throwing it in the trash and will look for a new Norelco.</li>
    <li> Unlike others, I&#x27;ve had no issue with heads poping off, or with cleanign it (pop it open, then clean). Maybe they fixed the issues in the the ones that are more recently made?    My issue is that the batterlife is very short. 2 shaves and its at red (low) charge. Got a 3rd out of it, but then needed to recharge.    However, for its price,I think it is good, midline.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well and charges quickly. I came charged, in fact. It would be nice if it came wth a case. Otherwise, a fine product.</li>
    <li> The last time I tried an electric shaver was about 25 years ago - I liked being able to keep it in my glove compartment.    But it never really worked that well, I think its because I have a soft beard. Using Electric Shave helped, but the smell was a little too much.    OK, so here it is 25 years later. I usually use the latest multiblade gillete razor - like the fusion 3, that vibrates and everything, and I always get great results.    I decided to see if after 25 years anything significant had happened to electric razor tech since my 20&#x27;s - evidentally not. I was equally dissapointed with the results of this shaver then the similar-looking model I owned over 20 years ago.    So, I think &#x27;your mileage may vary&#x27; is an appropriate way to describe electric razors in general, and this one is no different. If you have a strong, hard beard, it may do the trick and let you shave wherever you want without water or shaving cream, which is the appeal - but if you have a soft beard, it might not be so great.</li>
    <li> Remington R-5130NB is a three flexing heads shaver that comes with a power cord, head guard and a brush. It has dual track blades and comes with an LED battery level indicator(my previous shaver did not have the indicator and it really helps to have one). It also has a nice popup trimmer for close trimming. The nice thing about this one is that it is lightweight, rinseable and charges very quickly. I have charged it only once since I have started using it. I have been using it for almost two weeks now and it did take sometime to get used to it. In the beginning, the shave was not so smooth but after a couple of shaves the difference is evident. It&#x27;s not a great shaver but will get the work done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used and reviewed about 7 electric razors for Amazon now and this is by far the worst.  While it did provide for a decent shave (not spectacularly close, just \\&quot;decent\\&quot;), the deal breaker for me was the bulkiness of the charging cord.  I have limited counter space as it is, and don&#x27;t need a large bulky cord to take up even more room.  Additionally, cleaning was a major pain and I could never get all of the stubble out of the unit without a lot of effort.  It reminded me a lot of the Norelco three-headed razor I had about 15 years ago. This is not what I would expect for a razor of this price/brand.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a fair job. The cordless feature is a really nice feature.. no cord getting in the way or dangling around. Charge lasts long enough to complete a full shave. The blades conform fairly well to your face and give a pretty close shave. Not the cosest shave I have ever come across, but pretty good. The shaver itself feels kinda bulky/chunky and it feels kinda cheap. I am not sure that I would recommend this shaver for gift giving because it just has a cheap feel to it and you could get a better unit close to the same price if you watch for sales and deals.</li>
    <li> The price is so low, and the one I purchased three years is still working, not real good, but it works.  For the price, I can buy three of these, they would last a total of 9 years and I think that would be a stretch for the others.</li>
    <li> The Remington R-5130 rotary shaver is a very frustrating piece of engineering. The first time I used it I was impressed with the close shave. The second time I used it one of the three cutting heads popped off. This occurs any time you apply pressure to the shaver to get a close shave or if your face is damp creating drag on the shaver.     Since that second use the cutting head has popped off almost every use. To make matters worse they are very difficult to put back on.     I would have to say the 13 page \\&quot;Use and Care Guide\\&quot; that is available for download at the Remington website is WORTHLESS. They provide no instruction on this very common problem in the guide.    I have had this for about a month now and I wish I would have kept the sales slip so I could return it.     I will be purchasing a second shaver today to replace the very frustrating poorly designed Remington R-5130. Based on my experience I assure you it won&#x27;t be a Remington.</li>
    <li> This is my first Remington shaver, bought in the UK during a visit.   There were only two makes in the shop: Phillips and Remington.  I&#x27;ve always found Phillips products pretty lousy quality and would have preferred a Braun or Hitachi but I was in a hurry and this seemed a mid-range model so I assumed it would be okay.  To be honest, I liked it at first.  It&#x27;s far quieter than all my other razors and worked fine.  But then a head and cutter fell off.  That&#x27;s never happened to me before.  The next day, it happened again.  The third time, I spent ages trying to find the cutter.  They are very light and you can be sure that they&#x27;ll end up in the last place you look.   One reason I prefer electric razors is so I can shave in the morning while walking round the house opening the shutters and getting the kids up.  The poor quality of the cutter/head assembly will make this almost impossible!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item while I was in the hospital due to cutting myself while shaving with a manual razor.  The electric razor trims so close everyone thought I was using a regular manual razor instead of the remington.  I am still using this razor today for the clean, even smooth shave with no shaving nicks.</li>
    <li> Just like several other people and stated this razor, Remington R-5130 is a piece of JUNK!!!! I got 5 1/2 shaves before the head fell off. And it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get it back on. The Remington MS2-390 is also a piece of JUNK. It&#x27;s VERY LOUD and the screen only lasted about 5 months before it got a hole in it. I&#x27;m going back to a Norelco.</li>
    <li> This Remington shaver does the job but compared to other shavers I have owned/own now, it doesn&#x27;t quite achieve the same level of comfort or closeness.  I was not able to get as clean a shave as my current shaver, the [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]].  I acknowledge that the shavers I am comparing them to cost 2 to 3 times more so it&#x27;s not a fair comparison so please take that into consideration.  Perhaps my face, which is kinda squarish, is better suited to the Norelco shavers.    At about $50, its definitely a decent shaver but the unit doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy and durable.  The materials feel cheap and flimsy compared to the more expensive units.  The main selling point of the shaver being the titanium coated blades I can not at this time determine if I am getting any more life compared to \\&quot;regular\\&quot; blades.  Since I have made mention of the units I am comparing them to, the first is the [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] which retailed for about $170 and the other was the [[ASIN:B000UK2VRK Philips Norelco 8040X Moisturizing Shaving System]] that dispensed lotion that retailed for about $100, both yielded better overall shaves.    Since I consider shavers durable goods that should last a few years, If you can afford it, I would suggest spending a little more for a unit that will give you more comfortable shave.  Remington does have a unit that is higher than this one so maybe the performance may be better there.  For $50, this Remington does an acceptable job, but not something I would count on long term.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well, it provides a clean and reasonably quick shave.  It is a little bulkier than my Panasonic LA63, but at the price it is a very good value.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads and associated small parts habitually pop out  during use. I was able to put the pieces back together the first  30 times this happened; but now one of heads just won&#x27;t fit back  on to shave my soul! If this were the ONLY complaint about this  poorly designed product (it&#x27;s not) wouldn&#x27;t that be enough to discourage   anyone from ever buying it? Stay away from this razor at any cost.</li>
    <li> Tried this Remington R5130 rotary shaver after all the Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve tried recently run weakly and shave poorly.  This Remington shaves better than the Norelco models I&#x27;ve tried, but is clunky, cheaply made and of very poor quality.  The head cover does not snap on and stay place, but the biggest complaint is that the rotary heads fall off while in use.  I can&#x27;t forgive a shaver that self destructs while I&#x27;m using it despite giving a decent shave.  Groping about the bathroom floor trying to find the head and cutter assemblies and putting them back in place is a bit irritating.  At least the Norelco shavers don&#x27;t self destruct.    Remington - you should be ashamed of producing a piece of junk like this.</li>
    <li> While this razor does give a decent close clean shave it several unforgivable flaws.  First, the head will not stay closed.  The clasp pops loose all the time.  The beard trimmer is difficult to get to release.  Worst of all, this morning while shaving instead of capturing the shaved bits of hair, they fell out all over the place instead of in the shaver head.  What is the point of a shaver that just blows hair everywhere?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried to save money, but will be returning this to target for a high end norelco.  I had a norelco previously and that was a great shaver for about 10 years, but it was about $150.  I will be purchasing another one.  A good shaver is worth good money.  Besides, the new noreclos come with self charging base stands.  Bonus.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a store (without getting to see the Amazon reviews - the Amazon reviews would have helped me avoid this).  I have used electric shavers for years and some have been better than others (but nothing even remotely close to as bad as this).  The store was out of replacement heads so I bought this shaver.  It is just lousy.  I can&#x27;t believe how poorly it shaves.  I really can&#x27;t believe someone can make this while trying to make a decent product, they have to intentionally have it fail so people buy a more expensive one (my guess is the razor heads are incredibly dull and the motor incredibly weak).  It does a lousy job of shaving closely and takes at least 3 times as long as the Norelco I had.  I won&#x27;t buy Remington again.</li>
    <li> I was looking to replace a Norelco that was roughly 7 years old or so, and I had originally planned to buy a [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] but they were out of stock, so I made the frugal decision to try this Remington 5130 instead.  My facial hair is &#x27;light duty&#x27; I would say so I have generally had good luck with an electric shaver.  I was very disappointed with the results from this one however and wound up returning it.    First though, the good things - the shaver feels very nice in your hands.  The LED battery indicator lights are also a very nice touch, especially at a shaver in this price point.  Also, being able to rinse the head of the shaver under the faucet is a great feature.    On to the bad - simply put, the shaver did not offer a very close shave, even for an electric, and it was far from comfortable.  I prefer electrics to using a safety razor because generally the electrics give me less irritation.  Unfortunately, this shaver was no better than a safety razor in terms of irritation.  It also seemed to pull out a lot of hairs, rather than cutting them, and the shave actually seemed to be a little bit worse than with my very old Norelco.  Additionally, the mechanics of the device seem to be adequate but not particularly sturdy.  I would not expect to get more than a couple years out of this shaver, and reading some other reviews it sounds as if there have been durability problems.    I noticed a couple of interesting things about the design as well.  This shaver features dual cutting rings, which means that the blades on the inside ring are moving at a different speed than the blades on the outside ring, which to me seems like it could lead to uneven cutting performance.  Also, the cutting blades themselves seemed to be very narrow - they looked to be no more than 40% of the width of the channel they sat in.  I am wondering if these could be factors that contribute to the shaver&#x27;s tendency topull hairs.    Overall, I was not very pleased with the 5130.  I returned it and bought the Norelco 1150x I had originally planned on purchasing.  The Norelco, through admittedly only a few shaves, has proven to be just what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s possible you may have luck with this shaver, as other reviewers have, but my best advice would be to steer clear.</li>
    <li> First, I just returned a Norelco 1050X ($190) after seeing almost no difference in shave between it and the Remington R-5130.  I&#x27;ve never had the quality problems some mention below with the 5130.  Does the 1050X seem better built?  Only slightly, not an extra $135 though (I&#x27;m not take by the woven carbon fiber look).    I like the way the Remington charges, unlike the Norelco where I need to get the stand out, plug it in then set the shaver in the stand.  And a BIG issue with the Norelco was you can NOT leave it plugged it.  So I guess Norelco expected me to leave work to go home and unplug after an hour or 2 then return to work!      Some folks below complain about the size of the 5130/7130 series.  Personally (here we go again) the Norelco 1050X is too small for a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized hand.  The size of the 5130 is just about right.  The Norelco felt like I was holding my toothbrush.    And most imported is the quality of shave, which I am very happy with.  Remington hangs with the Norelco products just at a much lower price.  I&#x27;m 44 and having been shaving for over 2 decades, been through many units.  And, have always returned to Remington as Norelco products never did any better for the extra cash.</li>
    <li> Just bought this Remington rotary shaver to replace an older Norelco.  This shaver will not shave anywhere near as close nor as fast as the old Norelco. The shaver is also cheaply made with flimsy plastic head parts.  This shaver had a charging base but no protecting head cover. I am returning the product for a refund.</li>
    <li> OK, I&#x27;ve had it. I&#x27;m pretty patient but the shaver heads keep unscrewing themselves and coming off when I&#x27;m shaving and I&#x27;m tired of picking them up off the floor. Plus, the socket on the shaver that the recharging cord plugs into is junk because the cord will not make a good connection. I&#x27;ve got to wiggle it in just the right way to get the charging started. I&#x27;m going to write Remington to see what they&#x27;ll do about these issues. Do not buy any Remington shaver with spin on heads. PS. Even if the shaver heads and charging system worked well, these shavers should only cost about $10 - $15 if you calculate how little goes into building one.</li>
    <li> I have used older Remingtons shaver with great success and finally decided to replace it with the 5130.  It shaves pretty good, but one or more of the heads will fall off everytime it is used and that is not acceptable.  Shame on Remington!!</li>
    <li> I shave everyday and I have used razors by Remington, Braun, and Norelco. I find that Remington and Brauns seem to give me the closest shave. Cleaning the product is fairly simple but does take some careful alignment of the parts during re-assembly but it isn&#x27;t too bad. The battery life seems to be about a week and a half before I can notice the motor not cranking as hard. The con to the product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a case and overall the unit feels kind of cheap but for the price, I guess that is sort of expected. Overall a good electric shaver for the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Norelco tripple head razors for some time and my last one needed a new battery.  So I thought I would get a new razor instead.  I bought the Remington and have never bean so dissapointed.  My Norelco is a lift-and-cut, the Remington should be called a lift-and-pull.  Very painful shave and not as close as my Norelco.  I will be trashing this and ordering a replacement battery pack for my Norelco.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electrics for 20+ years and they don&#x27;t get as close as a blade!  They do very good and are convenient, fast and no mess.  I like they way this one fits in my hand and the flexing head that follows the contours of my face. Has decent charge time.</li>
    <li> I bough this from a retail store in the summer of last year to replace a similar electric razor that was long overdue. Initially, I was somewhat happy with the shaver. The shave was a bit patchy but also quick and close in most spots, so I did not have much to complain about.    Over time, however, I found that the shaver was a real pain to keep clean. There&#x27;s no apparent consideration for this in the design - there&#x27;s tons of nooks and crannies for hair to fall into, which an extremely rigorous cleaning with a q-tip is required every few weeks.     Besides that, the shave only got worse as the blades became duller. That&#x27;s to be expected, but when the shave is already just okay, a somewhat dull blade can make things go sour quickly. Finally, I cracked part of the shaver by simply dropping it two feet from my sink to my countertop.     This is indeed a shaver and it will shave you, but you probably won&#x27;t like it. The more expensive options are worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with electric shavers (20+ years) using several different brands and models.  Before trying this Remington, I used a Panasonic ES8109 (about $180) for about a year.  Before that, I had a Braun Syncro 7540 (about $150) for several years.  Before that, I used several Remington dual foils.  I was always happy with my Remingtons way back then, but I was lured away by the convenience of a self-cleaning shaver.  I currently use the [[ASIN:B001DEYP8K Remington F5790 Pivot &amp; Flex Foil Shaver]] (though it&#x27;s only washable, not self-cleaning).  While the F5790 is certainly not perfect, it beats this rotary shaver, hands down (and at virtually the same price point).  There are very few reasons for considering this one over the F5790:    *If you have extremely sensitive skin.  The F5790 gives a much closer shave, so it irritates the skin much more quickly.  But keep in mind that this shaver can irritate your skin, too, especially on the neck.    *If you have trouble holding a shaver.  This one is noticeably lighter than the F5790.    *If noise is a consideration.  This one is noticeably quieter than the F5790.    Otherwise, the F5790 beats this rotary shaver everywhere it counts.  It&#x27;s quicker, closer, easier to clean, and easier to maintain.  Unless you have a specific reason for choosing a rotary shaver such as this one, get the F5790 instead.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver few months back and have been unhappy with it since day one.  Maybe it&#x27;s the way I shave but I like to put the shaver as close to my skin as possible (that is, press the shaver against my skin).  However, this causes the (rotating) heads to pop off.  I tried to shave lightly holding against my skin but it seems to take longer to shave.  I end up pressing hard around the curves of my jaws and almost always pop off 1 or 2 heads.     I don&#x27;t know if my memory is bad but it seemed that the other shavers I&#x27;ve used before would last about 2 weeks after charging while this one seems to last only about 1.5 weeks of shaving.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor since high school. And we won&#x27;t discuss here how long ago that was! I&#x27;ve been a blade shaver since college, and generally prefer the feel that it gives me. But blade shaving does take a lot of time, and I&#x27;ve wanted an electric shaver for a while. So I was thrilled to get a shot at trying the RemingtonR-5130NB Flex 360 shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a feature perspective, this shaver has everything I desired: titanium-coated blades, pivoting neck, pop-up trimmer (great for around the ears), rinsable, and a battery indicator. And perhaps most importantly, it&#x27;s cordless. Shaving while connected to the wall is difficult! This shaver is weighted nicely and feels good in the hand, and I have had no issues with the heads popping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, this shaver performs to expectations. However, I feel that it probably works better for those who have \\&quot;light\\&quot; (or soft) beards. My beard is very tough, and I tend to sport the \\&quot;3 day growth\\&quot; look, so if the hair is too short, I have to really work at it to get a good shave. But if I let it go a little too long, it painfully yanks hair from my face. But I believe this is likely the case with any electric shaver, and is probably more indicative to my beard not being \\&quot;trained\\&quot; to an electric shaver or my face being used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel this is a decent quality shaver in this price range. Whether is suits your needs primarily depends on what you&#x27;re used to and what you&#x27;re looking for in a shave.</li>
    <li> I think it is easy to use and she reads a lot and this is easy to obtain the latest books out there!</li>
    <li> I find myself doubting the necessity of the \\&quot;flex 360\\&quot; head, as my wrist is perfectly capable of mimicking its movements, but overall, it actually is slightly easier to do routine emptying of clippings, over my previous remington shaver, by popping open the, now hinged, cutter head assembly and dumping it out; and I have not had other people&#x27;s problems with it coming apart on me.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington R5130 electric razor for about 2 weeks now. I previously used more of a \\&quot;flat\\&quot; style Panasonic electric razor for many years, so it took about a week to get used to the rotary style that the Remington featured. It cuts cleanly and fairly close (as close as any electric shaver will get you, which is generally a bit less than what a wet shave with a safety razor will get you). It will irritate skin and occasionally knick the skin if one presses too hard, but as I got more used to the razor and how to use it I was able to get a closer shave with less irritation. It is by far faster than regular wet shaving with a safety razor. (There is definitely a learning curve to any electric razor, lasting a few weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a particularly heavy beard, and it generally worked very well on flat parts, cheek, under chin. The parts around the chin and under the nose are more difficult to navigate due to the large size of the head of the razor. The head flexes a bit to help with this but I really didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is straightforward, the cutting head flips up and you can rinse with water. However, the hinge feels quite fragile and seems like it could easily snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge for about 5-6 shaves before needing to be charged and comes with a small \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot; transformer with a cord that plugs into the base of the razor. There is no charging base or stand included. It also includes a clear plastic cover to protect the rotary blades and a small brush for cleaning. There is also a beard/sideburn trimmer which pops up that I rarely use, but I do think it is quite cheap and flimsy. (I am usually disappointed by the trimmer attachments on electric razors -- I am convinced it is because manufacturers would rather you purchase a separate beard trimmer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am mostly happy with this electric razor for my own everyday use. It does feel a bit flimsy and the side trimmer is disappointing, but I find that with my simple shaving needs this has done quite nicely for me. The build quality is lightweight, bordering on flimsy. However, it has been a good razor to use so far and I plan on using this razor into the foreseeable future.ing needs this has done quite nicely for me.

    <li> These 2 models are ALMOST identical in their specs, the R-7130 lists 1 additional feature of teflon coating, but the difference is far more than thar!&lt;br /&gt;I got the R-7130 for my older son about a year ago, no problems, does a great job, he is still happy with it. Then my younger son needed an electric shaver/razor so I thought this one would be of similar quality, minus the teflon coating..................boy was I ever WRONG!&lt;br /&gt; It seems every  time he goes to use it the top pops off &amp; everything flies everywhere. At first I thought maybe it just wasn&#x27;t fastened securely but after reattaching it, and starting to use it again, \\&quot;POP\\&quot; goes the shaver,........all over again! I don&#x27;t know why, maybe it&#x27;s just this one but based on my experience, I would spend a few more dollars &amp; buy the next model up, the Remington R-7130 Flex!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first experience with shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Nice and fast cut, does well the job. Nice LED indicator, the fast charging feature really works.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complains, maybe I&#x27;ll update this soon.</li>
    <li> Not a great product, but for the price, OK.  Given the cost of blades, spending $40 on a reusable electric is a deal.  Does not shave very close, which is the biggest issue.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Remington R5130 as my primary shaver for the last month, thanks to Amazon Vine. Before this I have been primarily using a Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Nano, which is a wet/dry electric, and a Schick Quattro Titanium with Trimmer. I used the latter when I really need to get very clean for a special day, or use its trimmer for sideburn.    The R5130 shaves really well considering that it has a rotary design. I am not trying to start any debate here, but I have always been less than impressed by the closeness of rotary designs. (I am sure it&#x27;s just my skin type.) While I find that I often have to revisit some area at very particular angles, the frequency with the R5130 makes it bearable during this testing period. I don&#x27;t expect the more expensive R7130 will solve this problem with its teflon coating, but it might.    I also appreciate the LED battery level indicator. I don&#x27;t think I can live without this feature on any shaver these days. The included charger, however, is quite a bit bigger than my taste. It&#x27;s also very hard to plug and unplug, but I hope the connector at the bottom of the shaver may loosen up some day. The trimmer on the R5130 is also very flimsy, but it works as advertised. However, there is no length guide, as in my current Schick, thus making the R5130 only useful for a close trim.    I don&#x27;t know what Remington is targeting with R5130&#x27;s price point. Honestly, the first time you pick this up you will be concerned about the construction quality. I won&#x27;t deliberately drop my Panasonic onto the floor, but I feel that it can survive easily. This cannot be said for the R5130. The top cover, which holds the blades, is especially flimsy. While it didn&#x27;t pop off during use (as indicated by some early users), I don&#x27;t expect the hinge to survive after a drop. I know the R5130 is almost half the price of my current Panasonic and that explains the build quality, but it&#x27;s an issue that&#x27;s hard to overlook. Seeing that I myself prefer foil/linear shaving on my skin, I am back to my Panasonic after one honest month of testing. The one star I take off is to reflect that this is not a prefect product, but please consider this totally adequate for the job if you like rotary designs.</li>
    <li> As a person that has almost exclusively used Braun shavers, I&#x27;ve only had a few moments where I&#x27;ve used a Remington.  In fact, it had been a couple of years so I thought I would give the R-5130NB Flex 360 a try.  When evaluating an electric razor/shaver, I really have two key areas to judge: closeness/comfort/efficiency of the shave and quality of the device.    I was pleasantly surprised by the closeness of the shave.  Prior attempts to use a Remington were not very successful, but I was pleased with the R-5130NB.  The shave was fairly close and even, and it was completed in a pretty good amount of time.  Comfort level was decent, although it did seem to pull some hair at times rather than cutting.  Generally speaking, the shaving aspects of the device were probably four stars.    While the shave was decent, I have less impressive notes on the quality of the device.  First impressions were made of cheap plastic and what appeared to be flimsy mechanisms.  Cleaning the shaver and putting it back together just wasn&#x27;t a smooth process and things seemed to be somewhat fragile.  On a few occasions, the top would just come lose and you would have pieces everywhere.  It&#x27;s a shame that so many shavers these days are of lower quality.</li>
    <li> We were hoping this would be a good inexpensive shaver but in the end, it was not; it is just downright painful to use.  This shaver seems to abrade the skin more than other shavers.  It also seems to tug on whiskers more than other electric shavers.  Maybe the blades aren&#x27;t as sharp or maybe they are poorly designed.  In addition to being painful, it shaves very unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an electric shaver, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Waited after I have used this shaver for a few months before writing a review.    This shaver is comfortable to hold, holds charge well (after 10 shaves charge still quite full, but then I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair), and the flex heads are very comfortable and easy to use.  With these heads, you do not have to try to hold the shaver at all kinds of angles to try to get a close shave - it does it for you quite effectively and comfortably.    The noise is not bad, so using it early morning does not make such a loud noise that you wake the rest of the house up.  It is definitely a lot quieter than the Braun shaver I have.    The only cons are that the charger has a good size head, adding to bulk if you use it for traveling.  The push on/off switch could also be accidentally pushed on by other items in your luggage, so that you find could find yourself without a charge.  I would deduct 1/2 star off the rating for these issues...but Amazon does not do 1/2 star increments.    In summary, for a close, comfortable, and fairly quiet shave, this is a good choice.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable shaver gives you a fairly fast, close shave and charges quickly. Even better, it can be used while charging, and the small charger is world-capable (you just need a prong adapter to use it anywhere in the world). The floating heads provide a comfortable shave. I don&#x27;t like the pop-up trimmer which has insufficient clearance to be very useful. Otherwise, this is an all around very capable shaver at an excellent price. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington R-5130 at Wal-Mart for $40, thinking that it might be worth the extra $10 compared to the $30 Norelco 7310.  The features that caught my eye were the quick-charge ability (1.5 hours vs. 8 hours), the charge remaining indicator, and the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews on Amazon after bringing it home, and was tempted to take it back, but decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m happy with it.  I get a good shave, with no irritation.  I would say it&#x27;s actually an improvement over my previous Norelco Quadra-action razor, which couldn&#x27;t always get around my adam&#x27;s apple without giving me razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely has a different sound than Norelco.  It&#x27;s a bit louder and it&#x27;s higher pitched.  At this point I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s necessarily worse, just different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The method of removing/attaching the individual cutting heads is different than Norelco, which seems to be the biggest source of complaints.  I will say, it&#x27;s not as easy or as robust as Norelco&#x27;s method.  However, so far I have not had any problems with heads popping off.  I occasionally check to make sure the heads are rotated all the way to the right, and I do not press the razor into my skin super hard.  High pressure and abrupt movements are usually not conducive to a good shave with any razor, so just take it easy, and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor cleans easily enough.  I open the head after each use, tap the individual heads to knock loose the residue, then rinse the heads under the faucet from both top and bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  July 13, 2010&lt;br /&gt;After using this razor for six months, I&#x27;m still happy with it.  I have never had a head pop off, I have not had any problems keeping it clean, and it still does a good job.  The battery life is pretty good, and I have not uncovered any major complaints.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington R-5130NB Flex for about a month with no problems.  I have not had any problem with the head falling off like others have talked about.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves OK. BUT it is made very very cheaply.  The head design is terrible. Pieces fall off during cleaning, sometimes the heads fall off while shaving.  Things snap back together, but small plastic clips hold parts in the head. When they break and they will the unit will be trash.    Surprised Remington put their name on this poor quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I am a blade guy because I&#x27;ve always gotten the closest shave that way.  But, I&#x27;ve been using this Remington the past few weeks as an occasional \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; alternate for the weekends, when in a hurry, out of razor blades, etc.  Although I am still a blade guy at heart, the Remington does the trick as well...my shave is not quite as close but it is faster (no shaving cream, etc).    For $50 I think this is a good buy if you are looking for the occasional electric shaver.  Battery indicator is a nice feature and charges fast for me.  Build quality seems a bit on the light side so I can&#x27;t say how it will hold up over time...if anything notable happens I will update this post.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor can&#x27;t beat it it shaves close and smooth too it really works the titanium is a great Plus.!</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m not the electric shaver fan, but my husband is. He is impressed with how well the Remington Flex 360 works, and he generally turns his nose up at electric shavers.    So is the shave smooth and close. Yes - for an electric razor. It&#x27;s definitely not as good as a good, five blade razor and shaving cream. What is?    But for the price, and the time saved, it&#x27;s definitely not bad.    My husband&#x27;s been using it on weekends, when he just wants to clean up a bit, and would like to save his skin from the entire razor/shaving cream route. it works very well for that.    Will it be a permanent substitute for the razor and shaving cream fan? No, but for weekends and touchups, and the occasional five o&#x27;clock clean up for a night out, yes, it&#x27;s a good, reliable razor.    Recommended as a razor alternative.</li>
    <li> Having used Norelco shavers all my life, I was somewhat skeptical whether a Remington product would stand up to an experienced user of rotary electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few days the handling of the shaver seemed somewhat awkward, but as I became accustomed to this shaver&#x27;s \\&quot;feel\\&quot;, I became a true convert. It definitely is not awkward any more.  The \\&quot;floating head\\&quot; seems to adapt to shaving angles better than my Norelco and it also feels like it has more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the supplied cord it is very easy to charge, takes about an hour, and the charge lasts a couple of weeks with daily use.  It runs very smoothly with little noise or vibration and the pop-up trimming blade works rather well. The series of LED lights showing state of charge is well laid out and easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with doubts but am now convinced this is state of the art in electric rotary shavers.  I&#x27;ll give it an A+.</li>
    <li> I obviously can&#x27;t reveiw this from my own personal use (being a woman) but I can say that it works well for the man in my life.  Didn&#x27;t give him any type of razor rash that I know some electric razors can cause and it&#x27;s fast and convenient.  Keeps the stubble at bay which keeps me happy :).  I think the price is also very reasonable being under $50.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an old Remington for over 12 years that finally&lt;br /&gt;broke down. I bought a Philips to replace it a few months ago&lt;br /&gt;based on price alone and that turned out to be worthless,&lt;br /&gt;so I figured I would try another Remington.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is excellent. I get a good clean shave quickly,&lt;br /&gt;and the trimmer is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of reviews that said the heads would fall off&lt;br /&gt;easily. I don&#x27;t know what those people are doing wrong, but&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see anyway the heads could come off with normal use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> great shaver, still using it. Charges quickly.</li>
    <li> Let me state that I am a blade man. I keep trying electric razors, and most are worthless. Sadly, this is one of them. I give it 2 stars because it is better than not shaving, but not by a whole lot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Philips Norelco electric shavers and beard trimmers for over 12 years.  It was my first and may be the last brand electric trimmer that I ever use, especially after this Remington R-5130 purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington R-5130 is not a horrible electric razor, but it does suffer from some flaws that should not be showing up in a name brand company with such a long history of manufacturing electric shavers.  Although the shaver looks flashy in the box and has features that are usually reserved for higher price models (LED battery gauge, titanium coated blades, and a washable waterproof housing), the finished product still has room for improvement.  The cord is bulky, the battery is a bit weak, and the plastic on the housing feels cheap and likely to break.  Personally, I&#x27;d rather spend a few extra dollars and get a shaver that impresses me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t fuss over a close shave.  Men have to shave every day, so why stress if the stubble grows a nanometer longer with a certain shaver?  This Remington does produce a nice and even shave, but nothing better than my Norelco.  I prefer the rotary blade design over the foil design.  Rotary blades fit my thin and somewhat boney face better and allow for better maneuverability.  An electric shaver is a personal choice.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different.  But quality is quality.  And this Remington R-5130 disappointed me in that department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For 4 years I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B000FEGUIW Philips Norelco 7140 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver]].  The housing is solid and waterproof, the parts are sturdy and durable, and the feel in my hand is comfortable and light weight.  Before this trimmer, my previous Norelco (the cheapest model) lasted 9 years without problems or complaints.  I gave it up only because I couldn&#x27;t find replacement heads anywhere online.  So Philips Norelco has served me well over the years and this Remington shaver gave me no reason to switch loyalty now.</li>
    <li> A bit flimsy, in that, the blades popped out a few times as well as making grinding noises if you have heavy stubble. I did return the item. But you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This is the second Remington floating head razor I have owned.  I like the floating heads, as it gives a real close shave. Also like the fact I can rinse it off in water to help clean it. Will without a doubt, order another one when this one wears out.  Highly reccomend it!!</li>
    <li> This razor was not the lowest priced nor has it been the best performer. Wetting the heads is not a good idea since the razor becomes clogged with accumulated stubble. The design below the heads is bowl-shaped and necessitates the head removal for cleaning. Once the heads are removed it&#x27;s a task to get them back in place even when following directions. Additionally, the razor does not do a good job on my neck. I&#x27;ve had to use a regular razor every time I use the R-5130.</li>
    <li> Very good Shaver with good trimer, worth buying,nice sleek design , good fathers day gift. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Every few years, I am tempted to give electric razors another try.  I keep thinking the technology will somehow improve to make shaving with an electric razor easier, quicker, and more comparable in closeness and comfort to shaving with a razor.  Well, this was my latest attempt.  Verdict: NOPE!  Even with 3 heads, it takes FOREVER to get all the little hairs off your face.  By the time you get them, you could have shaven your face 3 times with a regular razor.  All of the round-and-round motion irritates your face, and the shave is not nearly as close as a traditional razor.  So why use an electric razor?  Good question.  I have not figured out why people use them, but I won&#x27;t be trying another one for a few more years.</li>
    <li> Works really well and has a pretty long charge.  Still going after quite a long time.  Cleans easily and quickly.</li>
    <li> Just got this this week, so I can&#x27;t speak to the long term (yet), but so far I must say I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are whiny about... your unit is opening in use? Try keeping your fingers away from the release!         I bought this to replace a 5-year old entry-level Norelco rotary that served me well, but was noisy, and required numerous passes to actually shave an area, even with new blades. Shaving with it was like thinning a forest. Oh and it had a nasty hair-pulling habit--even with new blades!--and was a horror to clean.         This unit unit was charged right out of the box (not sure how that&#x27;s possible, but hey, bonus!) and is extremely quiet. I took it for a spin through my 2-days growth and thought, \\&quot;What the heck! Nothing&#x27;s happening!\\&quot; I felt nothing, heard nothing ... and was then shocked to discover that the fur was gone, in one pass, reduced to the shortest of stubble. The Norelco thinned the forest, but this baby mows the lawn!</li>
    <li> Chose my last shaver, a Norelco, using Consumer Reports and ConsumerReview. LOVED IT. They, and Amazon, still rate them tops. Unfortunately, when it died, I grabbed this (overpriced) excuse for a razor off the store shelf. \\&quot;How bad can it be\\&quot;, I reasoned. \\&quot;Brand name, looks like all the rest.\\&quot; WRONG!  I have a tough beard, and it grows fast. I have to shave every day or it is really scruffy by the end of day two. Even if I shave every day, this model takes forever. The wasted time is one thing, but I have to go over-and-over the same spots until I have my skin pretty irritated. Then I still don&#x27;t have a decent shave. And it cost 50% more than my old Norelco razors.  OK, rotary razors are not the best for two day old beards--but this thing is ridiculous. It takes about 10 minutes! I have to empty it and bang the chaff out of the blades at least four times, or it simply quits cutting!  NEVER had any such problems with my $50-60 Norelco units. They were fast, gave me a reasonably clean shave, and I could go several shaves before I had to clean them out. Never any skin irritation. Two day old beards were not exactly pleasant to remove, but I could do it reasonably fast, and with minimal discomfort.  I put up with this for a year because of the price I paid for it. Now that it needs blades, NORELCO ON ORDER!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND LIKE THE EASY OF USE THE REMINGTON R-5130NB FLEX 360 CORD/CORDLESS RECHARGEABLE MENS ROTARY SHAVER.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this shaver on a regular basis for the past several weeks and he&#x27;s very pleased with its features and functionality.  He especially appreciates the smooth, comfortable shave he gets.  While no electric shaves as close as a blade, this Remington does a very good job a lot more neatly and with much less effort.  Cleanup is simple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Impatient also loves the ease and speed with which it charges.  After the initial charge, it takes just 5 minutes to perform a quick charge, a godsend when you&#x27;re perpetually in a rush and the battery indicator always lets you know where you stand.  It does its job quietly too so it doesn&#x27;t add to the cacophony and chaos of a busy morning or disturb the peace of a quiet one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are there better, more feature-packed shavers on the market?  Undoubtedly, but for its moderate price and its ability to deliver a close, comfortable shave, this Remington is a very good value.</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying a middle-of-the-line electric razor, but it literally broke after about three weeks. One of the little \\&quot;floating\\&quot; razor heads popped off while I was using it. Granted, they&#x27;re designed to come off for cleaning, but the problem is that it is so cheaply made that the plastic molding broke in the process (of running it across my face!) I can take the other 2 razor heads on and off, but the third is down for the count. So,  now I&#x27;m stuck using this with just two of the three heads. This seems to be a serious design flaw.       The shave it provides is decent (it will cut about 99% of the hair off my face, but inevitably leaves a few that it simply won&#x27;t cut.) The battery life is OK, too. It will last about a week, give or take a little (using it once a day).</li>
    <li> The Remington Flex360 family of electric razors includes the R-4130, R-5130, and the R-7130.  The high-end R-7130 sells for around $80 on Amazon, the R-5130 for $55, while the low-end model, R-4130, goes for $44 on Amazon.  The difference among the models is their charging systems. There is also a charging stand available for $10.  These are all competitive prices.  However, the true test of a razor is how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I have used electric razors manufactured by Remington, Braun, and Norelco.  I have found that this razor gives me a close uniform shave which is the equal of the best that I have had.  It also does this in half the time of that of my previous razor, a rotary of Norelco of similar design.  So, I can get to work a few minutes earlier, or maybe better, sleep a few minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to clean the razor, you have to flip the top open, but also take the shaving heads apart, clean them, and put them back together. This requires some careful alignment of the parts for the re-assembly step. I do this once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total cost over the life of an electric razor must include that of replacement cutting heads.  The SP-5161 head for the R-5130 and the R-7130 sells for $27 on Amazon, while the SP-3141 head for the R-4130 is $21.  These are equal to or lower than the prices of replacement heads for other razors.  The instruction booklet suggests replacing the heads every twelve months.  That may be optimistic since I have had to buy replacement heads for other razors after around six months.  However, it could work out to twelve months since the time per shave is only a few minutes, much lower than for other razors that I have used.</li>
    <li> Agreed with other reviews. This shaver self destructs while in use. Shaver heads pop off and fall on the floor. Poor design. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I have owned Remington shavers in the past and liked them, but this one is a bit of a disappointment. After about six months of use it needs replacement heads already and they cost almost what I paid for the shaver to begin with. I think I&#x27;ll try a Norelco next time.</li>
    <li> Was surprised the package said &amp;#34;factory refurbished to like-new condition&amp;#34;.  Thought I was buying a new razor - not a refurbished one.</li>
    <li> I last shaved with an entry-level Norelco about 15 years ago, but it constantly tore my neck up, and since then I was a dedicated Gilette blade shaver.  I grew tired of dealing with a wet mess every morning (not to mention the ever-climbing cost of replacement blade cartridges!) so quit shaving for a bit and then bought the Remington R5130.  It was fully charged and ready to use right out of the box, so I immediately took the trimmer (which opened with no problem) to work on three weeks&#x27; beard growth which it reduced to stubble effortlessly.  Then I used the rotary blades to shave myself clean with no trouble -- from fully bearded to clean shaven in under 5 minutes!  I&#x27;ve not experienced any manufacturing defects, and if you follow the instructions to shake out the hair inside the chamber before rinsing the blades, you don&#x27;t get jammed masses of stubble but rather thoroughly cleaned blades.      It took a week or so to get the hang of how exactly to move the heads in a circular motion over my skin to get a close shave on some particularly tricky parts of my jawline and neck, but shaving with any new method will require similar adjustments.  An added bonus is that the unit fully charges in an hour, but if you don&#x27;t have an hour, five minutes of charging will give you enough juice for a full shave, or it can be used corded.      I can understand the frustration of people whose shavers fell apart.  I&#x27;d think it was a piece of junk too if mine started popping off heads and spitting springs, but that&#x27;s why it has a two year warranty, and a company with a name like Remington will make things right.  I got a sturdy, well-performing unit and wholeheartedly recommend this shaver.  The oversized charger plug that some people reference is that way for a reason-- the plug has a built-in voltage adaptor to run on any voltage between 100V and 240V AC.  Because I travel regularly to countries where the voltage is 220V, this means I don&#x27;t have to worry about a separate voltage converter-- another plus!    The bottom line in my experience with this product is that it&#x27;s an A+ shaver and I have no plans to trade it for another shaving system.</li>
    <li> Have loved the old Microflex R 845 and 850&#x27;s. The R-5130 is very poor; (1) Clunky (2) Shaving heads pop off in use...cutters, springs etc fly out on the floor. (3)extra large charging mechanism (4) NO carrying case (?) for $61, and mainly,(4) the cleaning instructions are nuts...\\&quot;daily flush with water\\&quot; leaves agglutinated stubble debris stuck in the heads...meaning daily manual cleanout.    Very disappointing product. I will send this note to the Remington company also.(and try and find another old R-845...has lasted about 8 years, and continues to function just fine).    Addendum: got another R-845. Now does poor job of close shaving. ? new China low bidder.  Will look for a better shaver...probably not a Remington.

    <li> I bought my husband this razor because he needed a new one and already owns the same model. The vendor discount jungle sent me a supposedly new one that doesn&#x27;t charge when plugged in and then sent me a replacement that shows it&#x27;s charging, but once you turn it on, it doesn&#x27;t work. I hope this isn&#x27;t some kind of scam and they&#x27;re just selling razors that are defective!! I&#x27;m so disappointed because this is my first bad experience ordering through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon for work because I&#x27;m a buyer for the company and I use amazon for personal use. I&#x27;m upset and hope that discount jungle can resolve this issue of defective razors.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver because my boyfriend has the exact same one, it gets a really close shave for him and I have really sensitive skin so I thought, why not? I bought it, charged it for the 24 hours that it needs to charge the first time and used it the next day. I LOVE IT! It gives me a pretty close shave (there are a couple spots that just stay a little prickly. But, they&#x27;re about the size of a dime at most so I can&#x27;t complain) It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin AND, it hold a charge for a long time. After 3 days of taking 10 minutes to shave, it still has over half it&#x27;s battery left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one word to the wise, don&#x27;t use this for overgrown hair, it will pull (I discovered this when shaving that hard to reach spot on the back of my knee.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it&#x27;s great around my knees and ankles and I love it. And for the price, you can&#x27;t really beat it!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as well as claimed but it will do. It is for my daughter to use so she doesn&#x27;t cut her legs</li>
    <li> I have had three other electrics over the years.  This is my first rotary.      I am also now past 60 years of age and my beard seems to be tougher, so comparisons to shavers I used in past decades are an apples and oranges situation.  A really good close shave is not always easy to get with a blade and certainly not easy to get with an electric.    This shaver does a good job on some portions of my face, but it leaves a stubble on other parts.   I have to go over some areas of my face multiple times from different directions, and even then I can not get rid of all of the stubble.  This shaver will work at its best for me if I am patient and figure on more passes over the same areas.  I do feel a definite stubble by mid-afternoon and may shave again during the day.      The first time I used it, I got pretty aggressive with pressure against my face.  That is when I jarred loose one of the cutters and its screen.  If I am less aggressive, the cutters stay in place.    I know you are supposed to be able to rinse the cutters with water, but I removed the screens one by one and blew them out with my mouth.  That seems to work well.    The shave I get is not as good as with a blade, but it is not as much bother as a blade, either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my fair share of electric shavers over the years (Norelco, Panasonic, Remington, etc.), and I believe this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a 7130 that I had. I guess I have to buy a better head sometime.</li>
    <li> The price was right. Will never buy another cordless shaver like my last Remington. Although this shaver seems to run down quicker than my other model thus the advantage of the cord.</li>
    <li> I already had one and it worked pretty good, but the newer ones are cheaper. This one came dead and wouldn&#x27;t charge. They were selling &amp;#34;refurbs&amp;#34; as new.</li>
    <li> This was  given to my father.  He is very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance and would recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> The feature that made the decision for me was Remington&#x27;s &#x27;worldwide voltage&#x27;, the ability to charge and operate from 110v to 240v. I bought the razor in the US but carry it overseas. From Europe to South Africa, I can attest the dual voltage feature works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the widely different reviews here, I conclude that facial hair and a razor&#x27;s ability to deal with it must vary as widely. I&#x27;ve not had screens pop out or any other complaints. Removing the entire head at first puzzled me but while quirky, it works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans better than other shavers I&#x27;ve used. The main trick is to rinse from the outside first, ensuring a hard jet of water flows through the screen, rinsing away stubble trapped inside. (Highly aerated water may not work as well.) I then wash the inside. I&#x27;ve reduced take-apart cleaning to once a month, after which I lightly oil and am ready for another month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, my Fusion razor (without the poncy battery bit) shaves closer, but for an electric, the R5130 does all I ask of it. I&#x27;ve decided to buy another one to keep in the US while I leave the original overseas to use when I return. That&#x27;s about as good as anyone can recommend.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for face pain and wallet drain . Now I use a really sharp rock and it works much better until I find a good razor .</li>
    <li> I had a problem with my Remington Rotary Shaver that was as much my fault as it was the company&#x27;s.    I found that customer service at Remington was quick and responsive.  I like their shavers anyhow, but now will be sure to always buy Remington because I know they will go out of their way to resolve problems.</li>
    <li> This does shave well but it is so cheap. It is like a Happy Meal toy. Also, it pulls hairs bad. Shaving with it was very painful. Finally, it comes apart just by looking at it. I would not recommend spending that much money on a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
    <li> the shaver works great I would tell other people to buy it .It shaves very close and does not burn my fase.</li>
    <li> I find this shaver quite well made and comfortable to shave with, and it doesn&#x27;t cost any where near what a similar Norelco costs..</li>
    <li> Used to replace another electric shaver, and a good price.</li>
    <li> nice close shave, good long run time.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate a shaver that doesnt make me go over my face multiple times, and this does a very good job</li>
    <li> My husband was very satisfied with the Remington R-5130NB Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Rotary Shaver.  We would definitely  order again on-line.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really review the way it worked or how it shaved, since ours did not take a charge at all. We followed all instructions and charged it for over 24 on its initial charge (as the booklet said), but it never turned on. Had to return it. The two stars are only because it was a disappointing gift. Hope our next shaver works a bit better.</li>
    <li> This was my first rotary shaver.  Maybe I&#x27;m just used to the foil type, but the head was just too bulky.  It&#x27;s fine on my cheeks, but when I move to the nose, chin, or neck the big head doesn&#x27;t fit (and I&#x27;m not a small guy).  The shave wasn&#x27;t very close, but I couldn&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s a problem with the rotary cutters or the inability to fit into the nooks and crannies.  I&#x27;m returning it for a foil type.</li>
    <li> I bought my son a Remington R3130 Rotary shaver for Xmas. I did not research the product but relied on my personal past experience with an ancient Remington  foil shaver (remember the ad...\\&quot;I liked it so much I bought the company\\&quot;). I had since switched back to a blade and have been a blade user until this Xmas.  I figured...$35 for a college kid&#x27;s shaver could not be a bad investment as the competitive Norelco was twice the price. One day, I tried the shaver and WOW...great shave. Even better, I shave my head with a blade and what a pain that is...let me tell you, not an enjoyable experience.  I tried the shaver on my head and WOW&#x27;&#x27;fabulous, no nicks, cuts and missed spots and it felt nice too. I liked to so much I didn&#x27;t buy the company, but I started researching the product line...looking for the \\&quot;full mack daddy\\&quot; unit...(R-7130).  The reviews as usual were all over the place. I eventually bought the R5130 (middle line) Product.   Here is what I found: First, It came fully charged..lasts about a week for me shaving my beard daily and my head every other day.  Second, the shave is close and comfortable...(a little difficult to work around my goatee). Third, so far, I have not had the \\&quot;falling apart problems\\&quot; others have had with their rotary heads.  As with any machine, it requires care...I clean mine after each shave with a brush (not with water...that just seems like a bad idea to me)  I also give it a quick spray of Remington Shaver Saver.  All machines need lubrication and a quick shot of this seems to make the blades run smoother.  The cover does not click over the blade head as other reviewers report. a minor thing to me, but if I travel with it, I&#x27;ll buy a small case to  protect it.   Finally I would say that if the heads are popping out of their holder, there may be too much \\&quot;skin drag\\&quot;  Try a little \\&quot;&#x27;Lectic Shave preshave lotion\\&quot; or better yet (I am happy this product is still around)..Remington Face Saver...a talc stick that you rub on your beard that allows the shaver to glide over our skin.  My son uses this and in one week&#x27;s time has cleared up his razor(blade) irriation rash.    So thumbs up from me...at half the price of the competition.</li>
    <li> This is a pile of junk. After week and a half I threw it in the trash.    Pros:  - lightweight  - charges quickly  - series of LEDs on the front clearly shows the remaining battery capacity -- this is nicer than some shavers which just have a \\&quot;low battery\\&quot; light    Cons:  - battery lasts for maybe 5 shaves  - plug on the end of the charging cord is huge  - rotary blades keep popping off while shaving -- this is ridiculous</li>
    <li> I love this shaver...it is the first one my husband has used in a long time!! He loves it too and is finally clean shaven!!</li>
    <li> R5130:    What a cheap piece of JUNK! You CANNOT take the heads apart to clean!!!!! I guess they figure everybody will toe the line and just buy new blades. With Norelco I could EASILY pop the blades out to clean it!    GOING BACK TO NORELCO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have used a wet shaving method for years, forgoing the convenience of an electric. I did not believe I could get a close shave with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along comes the Remington R-5130 Flex 360 Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Rotary Shaver and it changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is rechargeable or you can use it with a cord.  I find no difference in power with or without a cord. It is a lot more convenient without the cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job on shaving my whiskers even after a two day growth. The trimmer that flips out does a fair job of side burns and mustache. I still prefer my Wahl trimmer for that task. The Remington doesn&#x27;t trim as close as the Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rechargeable battery keeps power for a long time. I have charged it twice and used it several times alternating with my wet shave method. No problem here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I prefer the wet shaving method I give the Remington 4 stars for quality, ergonomics, and ease of use.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving it a one star is that it arrived as promised, however, it was put on charger&lt;br /&gt;for the initial 24 hours x2 and NEVER worked.  Very disappointed as it was a gift for our college student&lt;br /&gt;and he couldn&#x27;t use it ONCE or take it back to school with him.  I will need to return for a refund.</li>
    <li> Although the machine is cheaper than other machines, the result is good , close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively noisy machine.</li>
    <li> I normally do not rate items and then only if I am really pleased but in this case I just have to warn others of this product.  I am 66 years old and have used electric razors for the past 7 years.  I have owned a Braun and a Norelco in the past and actually still using the Braun and probably will for years to come unless it wears out which since it&#x27;s battery operated could of course but after 2 years it&#x27;s still going strong.  The Norelco was a present so thought I might as well try it out and I did for an entire year.  It was around $24.96 or so my wife told me so one of their cheaper priced ones but overall it was a good razor but when it came time to replace the blades after a year decided to go back to the Braun I mentioned above.  I couldn&#x27;t see spending as much for just the replacement blades as the whole razor cost and since the Braun was quite a nicer razor anyway went back to it.  Now I purchased this Remington wanting to try out something new as one gets tried of the same razor after using it every morning for a year and since the blades for it cost around $39.98 thought I&#x27;d just apply that amount to a brand new razor and since never owning a Remington thought I&#x27;d try one.  Bad idea.  It shaved like a tank meaning rough as hell on my skin.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was so bad and returned it after a week trying to give it a chance but man! it really was awful.  The Norelco rotary is so far ahead of the Remington in smoothness it&#x27;s not funny and should be down right embarrassing to Remington to product something like that.  I realize it&#x27;s was an inexpensive razor but the Norelco was even less but they still managed to make a very decent inexpensive one.  Anyway, just a heads up this razor is terrible in my opinion.</li>
    <li> After using a Norelco for many months, I decided to change brands because the Norelco took forever to shave with. I&#x27;d have to go over the same spots repeatedly to get a clean shave. This Remington was so much better. It gives a great, close shave in 1/3 of the time. The battery in this thing lasts forever too. I did have one of the heads fall out when my son dropped it on the floor, but I snapped it back in place and haven&#x27;t had a problem since. I&#x27;ve owned it ~15 months now, and I&#x27;m thinking it may be time to get new blades for it, which is why I&#x27;m here, since it now \\&quot;pulls\\&quot; hairs out from time to time, making for a more painful shaving experience.    Good Razor. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband and these are his comments -     \\&quot;Works Well - I&#x27;d give it a 9 out of 10.    I&#x27;ve owned a Remington shaver for the past several years, and approached this new one with some skepticism. An electric shaver&#x27;s just a shaver, right? What more can they do to it?    Well, this one has a pivoting/floating shaver head. The first couple of shaves I found it hard to adjust to, but by the 5th shave I realized I was zipping through a close shave in half the time of my old razor. It really works well!    This shaver also has a series of lights to inform you of the battery charge level. Much better than suddenly finding out that your shaver is giving out with just minutes to go before you have to leave for work!    Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this one.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Have used one for the last few years. Discovered it was cheaper to buy new razor than to replace head and blades.</li>
    <li> Honestly i bought this machine because I was used to a previous model which was much simpler but with the same head. I didn&#x27;t want to explore new options or to get my face used to a new machine. This Remington is great and it will give you a very close shave but in my case I shouldn&#x27;t use it if i have left my beard to grow for more than two days. After this is like wax shaving. The battery duration is superb. I use it daily and it will last for almost a whole month. It is not as compact as you would like to take it for trips but what you can do. At least the battery is good enough so you don&#x27;t have to carry with you the charger. The charge indicator is a great addition and it wouldn&#x27;t reduce performance while the charge is getting low. When the charge is reaching zero the heads will spin almost as fast as fully charged so your face hair will not be roughly pulled.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor to shave your head with ! The blades last me almost one year before they start showing signs of not being sharp enough ! I wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> Works great and I love the quick charge option and the led battery level indicator.much better than my last one which I also purchased from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Original shaver sent was defective, but seller replaced it as soon as I returned it. I have been a Remington rotary uses for many years, but discovered that shopping on line for discounted new shavers is superior to replacing dull heads as well as cheaper most times.</li>
    <li> You know many shavers are packed with &#x27;features&#x27;, but really they are just roadblocks to a good, fast shave!  Just like my basic Sonicare, a model without all the fancy features of a high-end brush, this razor is a workhouse.      Cleaning is a little bit of a job, because of the design of the head, but definitely doable, even without your glasses.    Noise is a little loud, but nothing too out of the ordinary, and with many razors through the years, it&#x27;s certainly in line with others.    Overall, buy it for the quickness and know you can dispose of it as a couple new years roll around and get another new &#x27;basic&#x27; model.</li>
    <li> I really hope anyone looking into this shaver reads this review, Many reviews say this is cheaply made and falls apart...I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s even possible. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for probably 3 years (granted I&#x27;m using it only 2/3 of the time, 1/3 another shaver) and it works great.    The battery is great and it even shaves while charging (awesome. there&#x27;s nothing worse than struggling through a weak, painful shave).    I&#x27;d say my only complaint is it NEEDS an adapter, it doesn&#x27;t plug straight into the wall like some.    Over the years the only thing that&#x27;s broken on it is a single spot on the mesh of one of the shaver heads. I scratched myself on it when it bent outward, but i just popped it off and I don&#x27;t even notice it anymore.    Great shave probably 4.5 stars (so 5), but i&#x27;d rate it 10 because of all the people that mistreated theirs or something.</li>
    <li> bought this for the hubby. And he had this brand before but the razor itself sucked!!! PULLS at the hair and not properly cutting it..</li>
    <li> When they say you pay for what you get... They really mean it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being the only one in my family that can actually grow a nice thick and full beard I get tired of having to shave daily so I wanted to get another electric trimmer. I had gotten another one of these trimmers due to having one years ago that really did an awesome job, I forget the model of it now it&#x27;s been so long. I was hoping for similar capability in this unit but was disappointed big time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even get to really see if the charge of the battery was going to be good and long lasting due to the fact that the blades on this electric razor are such poor quality that it&#x27;s ridiculous! They pulled my beard hairs like it was the cool thing to do leaving me with small red marks all over my face from it yanking on the stubble that I had from only 1 day of not shaving. I could have understood if it was a result of several days but not just one single day. I gave it chance for a week or so thinking maybe it just needed a break in period and while it did get somewhat better it still didn&#x27;t get better enough for me to even care about this product anymore. I tried to give it to a friend but he had the same problem with it pulling at his beard hairs as well and just returned it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: nice little charge indicator, smart idea there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Pulls hairs instead of cutting&lt;br /&gt;Seams like a bit of a flimsy casing&lt;br /&gt;Bear/mustache trimmer are of very poor quality, just stamped metal blades that are basically garbage...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it seems that no one makes a reasonably priced quality trimmer anymore. What happened to paying 50-60 bucks for a trimmer/shaver that actually did a good job and made you want to keep it for many years? Back to good ole traditional shaves with a badger hair brush and DE razor, simply the best shave possible there. Though it might not be the most convenient it&#x27;s still far better than this lousy trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor when my Norelco wasn&#x27;t holding a charge well and saw some of the not so great reviews of Norelco razors.  So far, I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.  The motor is more powerful than the Norelco&#x27;s ever was and it gives close shaves.  The fact it can be rinsed out with water is nice too.  It took a little getting used to, but now, I&#x27;m happy with it.  Only complaint is no carrying case, which would be nice for when I travel.  I recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Had a Norelco for MANY years that just wouldn&#x27;t quit.  It also gave a nice smooth shave and only replaced the heads once.  I&#x27;ve had this Remington for just over a year now and the shave is far from smooth - actually I look like I haven&#x27;t shaved in a day after I&#x27;ve just shaved!  Also, the battery life is not good either - lasts for a day or so.  My old Norelco would go a week without a charge!  Anyway, wish I could return this one but waited too long.  I contacted Remington and they were not helpful, almost like it didn&#x27;t matter to them - not very good customer service.  Sadly, I would never buy another Remington because of this experience.</li>
    <li> This shaver is so cheaply manufactured ans so poorly designed that over a couple of months of normal use it just completely disintegrated.  At first the shaving heads would sometimes fall out during use.  After a while they would fall out during every use.  The continued movement and misalignment of the heads eventually made other peices of the thing break and fall out.  This is probably the worst product of any kind I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I can&#x27;t believe that a reputable company would sell such junk!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and product was as promised. I like that it runs either plugged in or cordless. Unlike cordless only, when the rechargeable battery eventually fails, you can still use it from the  wall plug.</li>
    <li> This one has great desing as well as functionality. Works smoothly and causes very little irritaion, specially compared to the other one I had from Norelco.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work right out of the box!!! I bought one for myself and one for my son. At least he has some brand new parts sitting in the bathroom for when his breaks down.</li>
    <li> ok but no fully charged light on it</li>
    <li> is a good quality product that meets the features requested and explained in the website, came at the indicated time and with a good wrap to protect your computer</li>
    <li> this is my second one, the first one lasted quite awhile before wearing out. Never had a problem with the old one. It&#x27;s fast charging. This is a great razor for the price.</li>
    <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend&lt;br /&gt;Excellent battery&lt;br /&gt;Most razors I had better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Comes without a case</li>
    <li> Save your money. Hubby has to clean it 3 times during 1 shave.  I would return it, but the cost of shipping both ways is more than what the shaver is worth.  I am surprised Remington would manufacture something this bad.  Hubby says it pulls, and is very uncomfortable to use, plus very difficult to clean.  Not like his Norelco he had before that he used for 15 years with no problem.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great and my guy&#x27;s face is softer and smoother than a peach! He is thrilled with the cordless feature and how quickly it recharges.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my electric raze because the one I have will no longer hold a charge and I have the same model and I like and I wanted to replace it with the same one. I&#x27;ve had my first raze for four years and it&#x27;s been great to me and I like how good it shaves my face. I does do a fair good on my neck wish hard because of my skin and I do have to finish with a blade after words but that&#x27;s because of my skin. It does get close as a razor on the rest of my face and if your looking for a good razor then this will do. My other razor is just getting old and I&#x27;ve used it a lot these past four years.</li>
    <li> Instead of shopping in a store for a new razor I figured I would check Amazon for one instead.  This one I got is just as good as anything in a store, but at a much better price!  Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> This razor is perfect.  I usually blade shave, so I use this for touchups and sideburns. It&#x27;s perfect. This is my second one.... I tossed it in my travel bag.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO LO RECOMIENDO, LA MAQUINA ES EXCELENTE. LOS VENDEDORES CUMPLEN CON EL TIEMPO YA ESTABLECIDO, LA BATERIA DURA PARA 5 AFEITADAS</li>
    <li> Excellent  article. It arrived at time</li>
    <li> You get a good close shave and the battery life is great. This is a perfect travel shaver. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works with low noise, a fully charged battery provides power for more than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only device that I found that provides double knives on each rotary head,and in combination with his mobile heads, offers a very good shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering this product as a Christmas gift for my brothers.</li>
    <li> The razor works well.  Shaves close &amp; comfortable.  I like if I forget to charge the razor, I can plug it in and keep shaving.</li>
    <li> Great product for the money</li>
    <li> I ordered this replacement Remington shaver because my old one died (after 6+ years!) This seller got the product shipped the same day I ordered it and it arrived the very next day. There should be more sellers like this one! The product works as expected, and if I need another, I&#x27;ll go to this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied in Madison, WI</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;triple-action&amp;#34; shaving system.  First, you stand an inch from the mirror and mash it into your face, trying to coax the individual hairs through the slots.  Second, you move it around your face to yank the hairs out by the roots.  Third, the heads, now red-hot from friction after a half an hour of effort, sear the skin so nothing grows there again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is the worst shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I&#x27;m not trolling, I&#x27;m warning Humanity.  Surprising and disappointing, given the reputation of the brand and the money I&#x27;ve completely wasted.</li>
    <li> Somehow I bought a refurbished Remington razor unit worked good for the first initial week and then the battery died to wear only hold a charge for maybe a day or two! Liked the razor but won&#x27;t buy anything Remington again!</li>
    <li> I bought a 5130 shaver two years ago and had a problem with shaving heads popping off. I bought replacement blades and never had the problem again. I just bought another and one of the sockets the blades ride in kept falling out. Took it apart and reinstalled. Still wouldn&#x27;t stay in, so I compared it to my old one and noticed the \little fingers on sockets were to short so I switched heads and installed new blades in old head and it works fine.Remington how do you stay in business with quality control like this?</li>
    <li> I received this product in three days and I have been a blade shaver for 55 years.  This shaves real close and I have used it 5 or 6 times and still have not recharged the battery, real please with this product.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like electric shavers; I&#x27;m just one of those people that prefers a wet shave with a good razor; but as I am traveling for three months, I thought I would get myself a cheap electric razor, just to make life easy while I&#x27;m on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed, especially for the price. It is lightweight and easy to use and gives a really nice shave. I have seen reviews about it being difficult to clean and I have to completely disagree and really don&#x27;t understand where than can be any issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse facial hair and am one of those people that needs to shave at least once a day and twice if I am going  out in the evening and want a clean look and it was not clogged after two shaves, though I do clean it after each use, just as I would a wet razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just open up the top and give it a good rinse under warm or hot water and it&#x27;s good to put away and ready for the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice little product that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I bought this in December, first one they sent did not work at all.  Used refund policy through Amazon and sent it back to second party.  After several days had passed I had to call them to find out what was going on, only after I called did I get a replacement.  Now here it is a few months later and this literally fell apart in my hands while shaving.  Very Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for a few weeks now. Overall I like it. It provides a close shave with minimal irritation. The battery lasts long enough to use it every day for at least a week without recharging. It&#x27;s easy to rinse it out after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor complaints I have about it are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) I have found the trimmer blade is hard to aim properly. I think part of the difficulty comes from the curved shape of the trimmer body, so it&#x27;s hard to see around where the case is curved to see exactly what angle the straight trimmer blade will cut.&lt;br /&gt;2) The cord is pretty bulky. For shorter trips this isn&#x27;t an issue because the battery lasts a week, but it could become a problem on more extended journeys or if you just have two bulky things to plug into your bathroom outlet.</li>
