      <li>This is my 8th or 9th trimmer and it&#x27;s as good or better than the others.  </li>
      <li>i dont understant what kind of service you when you dont do your job on time.........................</li>
      <li>So I started to shave my own head with this trimmer, about once a week.  </li>
      <li>Then I got a Norelco which was nice</li>
      <li>It has a nice size</li>
      <li>new one is great!  </li>
      <li>- easy to charge and good quality blades.</li>
      <li>I used to have one, it does a great job and quickly, had to throw it out when the &amp;quot;rechargeable&amp;quot; battery would not recharge anymore</li>
      <li>is that the trimmer is very easy to turn on</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t compare this one to any others, but I am very happy so far.  </li>
      <li>Does a nice even trim too that my wife LOVES :-)</li>
      <li>, the trimmer is very good - I particularly like the AC adaptor built into the trimmer.</li>
      <li>A \\&quot;dedicated\\&quot; beard trimmer is quicker, more convenient, more effective.  </li>
      <li>Good product, however, the Battery runs out way too quickly.</li>
      <li>These were very highly rated by others and I have been happy with everything.</li>
      <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
      <li>What could be improved:  - 1 more closeness setting because I know some guys would want that,</li>
      <li>that I love, but the battery is failing.</li>
      <li>my stubbly beard looks a bit more scraggly.</li>
      <li>Better than before.  </li>
      <li>Five years later and this thing is still perfect.</li>
      <li>Maybe more like 1-2 months.</li>
      <li>I also love the simplicity of this trimmer, no cord, just plug &#x27;er in.</li>
      <li>and I have a perfectly trimmed beard except for this big hole in it.</li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
      <li>This one stays in place (length setting) better too.</li>
      <li>What I love:  - No cord to lug around (built-in charger)  - Compact size  -</li>
      <li>It is much more than just a beard trimmer.  </li>
      <li>(More often than not, even products from Sony, Toshiba, Onkyo are being manufactured in China and Malaysia.  </li>
      <li>I like to keep my beard short and this works perfectly.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this thing, but it&#x27;s probably not for everybody.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s more, they now show another 2 weeks for delivery on my order status - yet they continue to list this item for sale showing 24 hour ship availability.  </li>
      <li>But by May 20, I&#x27;ll look like I&#x27;m in ZZ Top.  </li>
      <li>Outstanding product.</li>
      <li>today she also said it did a excellent job on the back of my neck and on my side burns.</li>
      <li>I was also pleased to see that the blades are replaceable.  </li>
      <li>So I guess she enjoyed it to.</li>
      <li>I like being able to pack this unit without having to worry about finding the charger and stand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This item is excellent.  I&#x27;ve had mine now for several months and initially bought it just to trim my beard and mustache.  It is much more than just a beard trimmer.  If you like your hair short; just set it on #3 or so and go over your whole head.  Take the attachment off and clean up around the ears and neck so close that it&#x27;s almost a shaver too.  The built-in charger plug (which slides in and out of it&#x27;s base) is the most innovative and practical idea ever...no more digging through a drawer full of chargers and wires to find the right one.  Simply plug it in overnight and you have at least 45 minutes of uninterrupted use in your hands.  All of this at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> Had this model for years. It started getting a little tired so I bought the same exact model again. Made in Japan. High quality.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer.  I bought one of these 5-6 yrs ago, and wore it out.  I have tried others, but they didn&#x27;t cut smoothly.  This one is great.  It doesn&#x27;t catch and pull on the whiskers as it cuts.  It&#x27;s simple, but effective.  I searched out this same model, and found it available and a great buy on Amazon.  I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is simple to use.  Its highest setting cuts the beard to about 3/4 inch.  This is perfect for me.  It is convenient enough that I trim every day or two.  It takes less than a minute to keep a just-trimmed appearance.  I find setting 2 is just right for moustache, sideburns and eyebrows.  The comb attachment removes easily for close trimming.  The instructions say not to charge over 48 hours at a time to avoid battery damage, so you would not want to store it plugged in.  I charge mine about once a week for 45 minutes or so while I get dressed.  The retractable AC plug instead of a cord is a nice feature.  Recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a replaced for a different trimmer that had an external power supply.  I like being able to pack this unit without having to worry about finding the charger and stand. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This shaver is a brick. I feel like I could throw it against a wall (not recommended) and it would be fine. What is there to say? It won&#x27;t break. It trims hair. It&#x27;s cheap. Buy it!  UPDATE:  Five years later and this thing is still perfect. I use it about once or twice a month. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge as well, but if you make sure you charge it before you use it there is more than enough juice to get through a full shave.</li>
    <li> Just got delivered today. Its a excellent product. Extremely sharp and easy to use. Does a excellent job. I also like the built in for charging it up. The way it works is as follows. On the bottom there is a button push it all the way forward and the plug in pops out. Just plug it up to the wall. I had my sister cut my hair today she also said it did a excellent job on the back of my neck and on my side burns. I would highly recomend this product to anyone looking for this type of purchase. LOOK NO FURTHER.</li>
    <li> I have a goatee and almost never shave smooth (what can I say? My wife likes the stubble) so I use this trimmer almost exclusively.  I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic wet/dry similar to [[ASIN:B00006WNQ9 Panasonic ES3041K Sonic Shaving Wet Dry Rechargeable Shaver, Black]] but much older and liked it very much.  It finally became not worth it so I bought a cheapy Wahl from the local Crap-Mart and it sucked fiercely.  I&#x27;ve only used this Panasonic half a dozen times but I&#x27;m a huge fan already. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Form factor:  I love the integrated charger.  Easily adjusted level on the \\&quot;guide\\&quot; (I don&#x27;t know what you call it).  Good feel in the hand. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cuts the hairs easily without \\&quot;yanking\\&quot;, at which my Wahl was very bad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning: the clipper head pops on and off easily.  Not a lot of nooks and crannies for hair to get lost in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not nearly the battery life of any of the others I&#x27;ve had.  However, it has plenty of juice and power for my 2 or 3 shaves over the course of a week. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The wide head makes fine, precise trimming a little tricky.  It&#x27;s a trade off, of course, and I&#x27;m willing to make it.  I&#x27;d much rather have the wide head since I use it for everything.  But some guys with the more intricate facial patterns may need something better. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this thing, but it&#x27;s probably not for everybody. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers -- all disappointing for a variety of reasons ...until this one. The Panasonic is perfect in my mind. It&#x27;s powerful -- trims in one pass. It&#x27;s compact -- no parts and pieces to keep up with. And the built-in charger is brilliant.</li>
    <li> Shaves in half the time of all others. Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. Without the guard it shaves twice as close as any other. I shave my head, face, and chest every week so the batteries only last a year and I agree that the battery life is less than adequate. I&#x27;ve wasted many dollars on others brands and models. This saves me twenty minutes a week and that easily makes up for my $30 a year for a new one. Seriously, (for anyone who shaves  anything besides their mustache) this is the holy grail of efficient manly devices.</li>
    <li> My husband had an earlier model of this Panasonic shaver, and had it for years until it just gave out. We looked everywhere for the original shaver and no one carried it any more. Father&#x27;s Day and his birthday were coming up so I went hunting on the Internet and finally found this one and bought it. He&#x27;s used it almost every day and is really happy with it. So far so good. One thing I did notice was the place I ordered it from said it was shipped from California...well, that&#x27;s where we live...and when it arrived I notice the box was actually shipped from Texas.</li>
    <li> I dont know how to rate this item,when i did not recive that.&lt;BR&gt;I place that order on Aug 05 2002 and it should have diliver in between Aug 16 2002 to Aug 29 2002 but it has not arrive&lt;BR&gt;i dont understant what kind of service you when you dont do your job on time.........................now when you fail to complet my order on time you should send me my trimmer for free of charge or send me some gift for your terrible service.</li>
    <li> I have a few beard trimmers and this one doesn&#x27;t cut well at all even when it was brand new.  Perhaps it is defective, but be warned.  I have a one-year old norelco beard trimmer which works so much better.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I like that it does not have any cords to fight with.  We had another previously that finally died after using for about 6 years.  I would reccommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is extremely easy to use, the battery charger is built into the unit, makes for simplicity and ease of use. Outstanding product.</li>
    <li> I have owned several beard trimmers over the years and this is a good one, however I am only giving it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t think that it is a great trimmer.  The main negative thing that I have against this trimmer is the height adjustment - the lowest setting is not quite as low as I prefer.  On my old Norelco trimmer, I was using setting #3 - so the lowest setting on this trimmer is not quite as low as the 3rd lowest setting on my old trimmer.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Other than that relatively minor gripe, the trimmer is very good - I particularly like the AC adaptor built into the trimmer.</li>
    <li> This little trimmer works very well. I have learned to lean toward Panasonic in all things electrical, right down to their NIMH batteries. This unit will take you from bum to Ernest Hemingway in about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. My old one the batteries gave out. You cannot replace them. But the price is cheaper today then 10 years ago. You will like this item.</li>
    <li> I like that the unit fits all together as one piece (trimmer + adjustable beard guard). Other trimmers I&#x27;ve had had tons of tiny pieces that were easy to lose; this unit it self contained. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself works well, and seemly plenty powerful. I like it much better than trimmers I&#x27;ve owned in the past.</li>
    <li> I dug my first version of this trimmer that I used for 2 to 3 years before it died not accepting a charge. Next, I ordered a replacement assuming 2 to 3 years was marginally acceptable. Yet, my second version of this trimmer has died not accepting a charge after only 6 months of use and about 6 uses! Damn, whats up with the batteries on this thing?</li>
    <li> No bells and whistles, just a quality beard trimmer at a very reasonable price. Compact, yet fits nicely in my hand. No recharger unit needed, as the trimmer plugs directly into AC outlet.</li>
    <li> So here&#x27;s the deal: I owned a Panasonic ER389K for about two years and it worked great. Then the battery died and it is not replacable. I thought, \\&quot;Forget this, I&#x27;m getting a dual mode trimmer.\\&quot; I ordered the Remington MB40. Well actually two. One of the pins that holds on the depth gauge broke off even before I got to use the first one. It turns out that if the depth is set to \\&quot;0\\&quot; then there is at least a reduced possibility of breaking these pins. Then I got the second one, gingerly handled the depth gauge as if it might break, charged it up and began trimming. I was immediately impressed with the power. I was not impressed with how close of a trim I could get. But I discovered that if I used the mustache trimmer (about 1/2\\&quot; wide) I could get as close a trim as I got with the Panasonic. Very tedious. After a couple of weeks of this I ordered a new Panasonic. It&#x27;s less expensive, the depth gauge will not break, I can get a much closer trim, the charger is built in, it&#x27;s smaller, it&#x27;s much simpler to use, and loads quieter. THAT&#x27;S 7 THINGS BETTER! I decided that I could do without the corded feature - I don&#x27;t like cords anyway.  I don&#x27;t believe that there are any trimmers that are water proof - that would be a useful feature for cleaning.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for years and it stills gives me excellent service. I recently bought a Brawn but it does not come close to this panasonic shaver. The panasonic shaves close, gives me the reliability i need in a shaver and charges in little time....this definietly is a life saver for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this beard trimmer for about 4 years now, and I&#x27;ve been quite happy with it.  Previously I had a crappy Wahl one that died after only a year and was cheaply made.  The Panasonic one is easy to use, stays sharp, and is convenient. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this trimmer is that it is cordless-only, so that you cannot run it when plugged in (though that would be awkward in any case given the design, with the pop-out plug in the base).  The battery no longer holds a charge well (after 4 years, 2x per week), and so it needs to be replaced.  There is no way to replace the battery separately, though given the cost of batteries relative to the cost of the trimmer I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a big deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this highly as an inexpesive trimmer.  I&#x27;m replacing it with the Panasonic 203 model, which has corded operation (so I&#x27;m hoping I can continue using it after the battery is really weak) and is dual-voltage, which is occasionally convenient.</li>
    <li> I bought one and used it twice in six weeks to trim my beard. Two weeks later I tried to use it and it was dead and would not charge. Seller said it had a 30 day warrantee and they were sorry. This is the only trimmer I have ever had that just died for no known reason. Others have lasted for years.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The sellers has my money and says he is sorry. This may be a good price and works well but a product is only as good as the people who stand behind it. They think so little of their product to fear standing behind it I would not buy from them at any price. Amazon is a good company and has always tried to help with problems but this seller and this trimmer does not live up to their high standard. As they said they are sorry. &lt;br /&gt;John Evers</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to keep his beard shaped.  He says it works all right but does have a tendency to pull his beard some.  Thought the blade might be too fine.</li>
    <li> This the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Shaves closely enough for me and has a good battery life. I only wish it had more adjustments. But overall it&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> i recently bought this product and firstly the pros: &lt;br /&gt;   - good trimmer, trims with less pulling and pain.  &lt;br /&gt;   - easy to charge and good quality blades. &lt;br /&gt;cons:  &lt;br /&gt;   - for a guy like me who would like to keep no more than 1.5 or 2   weeks old beard, this trimmer cannot give me the exact adjustment i want for my length. but this can be a great one for greater beard thickness. so that setting at level 1 is just not enough for a week old beard.</li>
    <li> Excellent beard trimmer should have bopught this one along time ago . Rugged and simple .Miles ahead of the Norelco that broke.</li>
    <li> I like the overall ergonomics and charging feature of the trimmer.  Feels sturdy and appears good quality. Price was right.  I actually use it to cut both my head and facial hair. If I could change one thing, I would like it to have a lower setting for even a shorter cut, but I believe it is 1/8\\&quot; which probably matches the industry standard.  Overall pleased with the product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like the title says, I use this for manscaping the squid and boys. Works great for this. Never had a cuttage problem to date!!!</li>
    <li> Have been buying and using this simple compact trimmer for years.  The only problem is that they stop working after about 2-3 years when the warranty is already gone. The repair center replaced one once with a completely different model. They are so inexpensive though that 2-3 year use makes them almost disposable.</li>
    <li> Battery last and it&#x27;s much cheaper then those others that do the same job.  They have been making this thing for years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Norelco beard trimmers.  One lasted three years and wasn&#x27;t fixable when it broke.  The other lasted almost 2 years, was noisy and didn&#x27;t do a nice job trimming, or shaping. This trimmer is excellent.  It&#x27;s compact, quiet, trims uniformly and can trim closely to the skin when shaping my beard.  I was also pleased to see that the blades are replaceable.  The built in plug for charging is very convenient.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought this item for husband whose old device no longer held a charge.  So far the new one functions well but he wishes it could be used while plugged into the wall rather than only in cordless mode.  It is relatively quiet during operation.</li>
    <li> I bought my first about 20 years ago and it recently stopped working. I purchased a replacement (quite affordable) and learned that I could have probably done some maintenance to the original and squeezed an additional 20 years of life out of it! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is unlike any other. Others have a cord or a cumbersome charging base. This has neither. Simply slide out the little electrical prongs and plug it into a standard outlet for about 8 hours. It runs for about 2 months after that (depending on use).</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic ER389K trimmer for me.  I wore the last one out after lots of use. I have a moustache that needs attention every other day.  I also like to keep sideburns trimed. I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
    <li> It went in the trashcan today. I bought this trimmer about 3 months ago and the battery is already more or less dead. It will not charge enough to make it trough one trimming, it was in the end only running for about a minute on a charge. I used it while traveling and not a whole lot as it was starting to fail on me after a short while.     Other problems with this one is the power contact that sort of springs out from the body, it&#x27;s quite annoying to plug it in and as the fit is so tight with the power plug you can&#x27;t really see if it&#x27;s connecting or if the contact has retracted back into the trimmer again.     There is not light indicating that its charging or if charging is done, pretty lame as even the cheapest battery charger can do that these days.   I also find the blades in need of constant oiling or they would slow down and sometimes even make the trimmer completely halt.     I used to have an older Panasonic model similar to this one, it lasted me 10 year before it finally gave up, that model was the reason why I trusted this brand, no more. If had know that todays quality and product improvement had gone in reversed mode I never would have bought it. In the future I&#x27;ll be looking for a Norelco or a Philips. Panasonic should stick to making flat screen TV&#x27;s.   Avoid this model, it will end up in the garbage bin quickly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for about 20 years.  The battery died so I needed to get a new one.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but at Amazon.com!  Of Course!  There are other brands and forms and formats - all trying to attract buyers with lots of chrome and curves.  But when it comes to trimming my beard, the Panasonic is fantastic.  I like to keep my beard short and this works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This the second ER389K that I have purchased.  The first one lasted over 20 years.  I especially like the fact that it has a built in charger.  It&#x27;s a great beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for 10 years for various looks from full beard to tightly groomed mustache.  The trimmer performed well at trimming my medium density coarse beard.  The beard length guide works well, but will move if too much pressure is applied.  With the length guide removed, the trimmer edges hairlines wonderfully, giving the beard a crisp outline.  I especially like the internal charger.  The plug slides out of the side of the trimmer and you plug it in the wall.  No other charger pieces to keep track of.  After 10 years of use, two times a week, the battery no longer holds a charge, and can not be replaced, but after 10 years, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d love to rate the Panasonic ER389K for you - unfortunately, I cannot ... I ordered it back on July 24th. However, it&#x27;s now August 15th and it STILL hasn&#x27;t even been shipped yet from Amazon. What&#x27;s more, they now show another 2 weeks for delivery on my order status - yet they continue to list this item for sale showing 24 hour ship availability.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BEWARE AMAZON&#x27;S \\&quot;USUALLY SHIPS IN 24 HOURS\\&quot; CLAIM - it&#x27;s bogus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve written two emails to Amazon to inquire about my order&#x27;s status and have gotten zero response thus far. As a long-standing customer with lots of happy endings with Amazon, I&#x27;m shocked they&#x27;re behaving so ineptly on this purchase. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you order one from Amazon, I wish you the very best luck in actually getting it.</li>
    <li> I reviewed numerous trimmers before I settled on this one and I could not be happier.  It&#x27;s simple to use, does and excellent job, holds a charge for a long time, is easy to keep clean, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about carring a cord to charge it.  The only thing downside that I&#x27;ve seen is that the trimmer is very easy to turn on and I have had it get turned on in my bag when traveling and then found it dead when I arrived.</li>
    <li> Finally what I needed. This will give you a good and EVEN trimming.</li>
    <li> While it may look a bit old-fashioned in comparison with some of the flashier models, i was very impressed with this trimmer in that it provides a very good trim and is easy to use and handle. With me personally, i don&#x27;t get many pulled hairs when i trim with it. Plus, it has this cool feature that allows it to be plugged straight into the outlet. No cord or wires required! Overall, its a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great.  The slide out prongs for charging are perfect - much better than I expected.  The length adjustment works great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Seems to me that Panasonic designed and built exactly what I wanted at a good price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is the third Panasonic beard trimmer I have owned and by the WORSTE.  The battery failed to charge after only two years.  The previous models lasted from five to seven years.  Panasonic has evidently cheapened their product line and the quality is just not evident as it once was.  Too bad, I hate having to switch brands but am forced to over this lack of reliability.</li>
    <li> I owned one of these \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; trimmers for almost 10 years and I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything. I actually broke it open and desoldered and replaced the non-replaceable battery when it finally quit just to keep it going, as nothing else compared to it that I tried to use. It&#x27;s still going. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This thing is quiet, effective, and small. No separate charger to forget! No vacuum or nose hair attachments or any other useless junk to foul up or lose. Just a good trimmer that doesn&#x27;t jam up or snag, with the best (and most robust) height adjustment system there is.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A real winner.</li>
    <li> Thank God for customer reviews.  I almost bought a couple of other trimmers before checking the user comments here on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve never used a beard trimmer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this one to any others, but I am very happy so far.  It cuts smoothly and evenly, with no tugging or clogging.  I like the fact that the charger plug is part of the unit.  The only possible improvement would be to add a clippings catcher, so the bits of beard don&#x27;t wind up all over the countertop.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is rock-solid. I bought one in 1992. Fifteen years later the batteries *finally* wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, but everything else on it worked fine (blades, nothing broken, etc.).    I tried to replace it with another well-known brand trimmer (sounds like \\&quot;wall\\&quot;), but it wasn&#x27;t comfortable to hold or use and made the ends of my beard feel pointy and sharp (which my wife noticed too). It also had a cord which I always lost. I finally chucked this brand-new trimmer and bought another Panasonic ER389 in October of 2007 from Amazon.    As soon as it arrived I ripped open the box and used it (it came slightly charged, I guess). Ahhh...it was like returning home again.    What I love:  - No cord to lug around (built-in charger)  - Compact size  - Easily adjustable settings without having to remove the guard  - Solid  - My previous one lasted for 15 years    What could be improved:  - 1 more closeness setting because I know some guys would want that, but it&#x27;s just right for me. Maybe Panasonic could make a snap-on attachment for just such a purpose?  - Replaceable batteries  - Make it in red? Just kidding.    Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic beard and mustache trimmer was for my husband, but since I cut his hair I get to use it on the back of his neck.  The product performs just as I had expected due to the fact that I had purchased one exactly like it before and it was lost.      Thanks,  Ann Pace</li>
    <li> I have a 15-year old Panasonic ER203 beard trimmer (unfortunately no longer available) that I love, but the battery is failing. The ER389K looks similar and seems to work just as well, with the exception that it&#x27;s shortest setting doesn&#x27;t clip as closely as my old one, so my stubbly beard looks a bit more scraggly. It also operates only on 110 volts, unlike the ER203. But I&#x27;d highly recommend the ER389K unless you need a very short setting or international voltage.</li>
    <li> Simple, sturdy, effective.  No cords, travels well.&lt;BR&gt;Favorably priced.  Both my previous trimmers seem&lt;BR&gt;like junk by comparison.  This one doesn&#x27;t snag or&lt;BR&gt;pull hairs, and it gets the job done quicker too.</li>
    <li> Good product, however, the Battery runs out way too quickly. 1 1/2 years.  use of 2x a week.</li>
    <li> I am new to electric shaving. This is my first full beard. I read all the reviews for this and competing products and the ER389K sounded the best for the most customers. I received it in a few days from Amazon and love it. It is simple, easy to use. It has no wires, keeps my bathroom uncluttered. It does the job and at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I had this model for seven years before it broke down, and I didn&#x27;t even take care of it that well.  So, it was an easy decision to buy it again.  Highly recommended if you have a problem with in-grown hair on your face.  It also gives a good-enough close shave.  But durability and ease of use are the trademark of this product.  Highly recommended period.</li>
    <li> Have been useing this for little over 2 months.  Its great!  I&#x27;ve yet to have a pulled hair!  I use it to trim my hair, sideburns, gotee, and so forth.  The guard on this thing is solid, there are no concerns of it falling off what so ever.  When this one dies eventually, I&#x27;ll certinly buy another.  You just can&#x27;t get performance this good without spending too much cash for a trimmer that has too many extras that will just break down.</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic trimmer was showing it&#x27;s age, so I thought I&#x27;d try a new one--a tremendous disappointment! This ER389K was completely unacceptable,and I returned it. The cutters are too fine, and the thicker beard hairs (most of them are,of course much thicker than the hair on your head!) pass over the cutting teeth unscathed. The height adjustment is difficult to set, and there isn&#x27;t a positive enough lock. Finally, it is a rechargeable only cutter, without a cord option like my old one. &lt;br /&gt;I decided that my 20 year old Panasonic ER200B still works well enough, and I congratulate Panasonic for that design. Why not remake it?</li>
    <li> I only use a trimmer once every two weeks or so.  Nevertheless, I found that my WAHL brand trimmers didn&#x27;t last more than six months.  Most of the other trimmers were too cheap or were too expensive.  After researching the products, I took a shot at this one and I&#x27;ve been amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pulling, no razor burn and no breaking after only a few months.  It blows away any other trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past and find it to be the best there is.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl that was good and lasted a long time, but I like this one better because I can charge it without having to store another cord. This one stays in place (length setting) better too.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy about this unit, but it simply works!  It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I like the built in charger so you plug the unit directly into the wall.  No charger base to take up space on the counter.</li>
    <li> This is a great, basic beard and moustache trimmer. I had one before that lasted for years before the battery went. Then I got a Norelco which was nice but the head broke after about a year and is too costly to replace. This appears to be the same as the one I had for years. The nicest thing you will appreciate is that it&#x27;s so quiet.</li>
    <li> i use it once a week to bald my head.    Works well!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to trim a beard, more recently a very short beard.  I have been pleased with its performance, and the battery recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really excellent item but it will be the best, IF it has charging wire and it works while it&#x27;s connecting to electricity.</li>
    <li> heres a tip if you want a closer trim or shave. remove the blade head and bend the two springs that guide the cutter blade.using a flathead screwdriver i pushed down on the spring right were it is bent, and flattened it a little bit at a time, while checking the overlap of the top and bottom blades.i stopped when the blades were just shy of zero overlap. its been a month, so far the adjustment has not changed and i get a closer shave.</li>
    <li> I found the Panasonic trimmer to be very quite, sharp and comfortable to handle.</li>
    <li> I just ordered a new ER389 because my current one died after a little over two years of use. It was a nice little trimmer while it lasted, but I really don&#x27;t think I should be filling landfills with dead trimmers every two years. If a frequent problem with these devices is that the batteries die, I&#x27;d be happy with a long-lasting trimmer with an old-fashioned power cord. By the way, I previously owned a Wahl battery-only portable trimmer and a Wahl AC trimmer, and they both had short lives. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> As a mustache trimmer, the product is a very good value.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for trimming mustache and sideburns, and even the occasional haircut touchup. I&#x27;ve even used it several times to give myself a crew cut, and it has plenty of power for it. Blades have stayed very sharp, after about 1 year of use, and the battery holds a charge for at least 2 weeks of daily use. I really like the built in charger, just extend the prongs and plug it in. Great for travel. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ll be buying this one again for as long as they keep making them.</li>
    <li> Have had a beard for 40 years.  This is my 8th or 9th trimmer and it&#x27;s as good or better than the others.  Handy because the plug is built into the trimmer, so no need to make room for a separate base.  Had read that it was easy for the trimmer guard to slip from its setting, but that is not the case.  Would (will) buy it again.</li>
    <li> Always reliable, always dependable, have used these models for many, many years. Only problem I encountered was the unit apparently burns out after 12-18 months and won&#x27;t hold a charge any longer, and then needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these trimmers ten years ago, and it served me flawlessly for a decade. When the rechargeable battery finally \\&quot;got tired\\&quot; (in the words of the Panasonic repair serviceperson I spoke with), I bought a new one with no hesitation whatsoever. I was amazed to discover that the price was no higher than what I paid in 1996, and delighted to find that the new trimmer was even quieter than my original \\&quot;old faithful.\\&quot; This is truly a superior product.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. &lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is the best I have ever owned. It is uncomplicated, does a fine job of trimming, and the flip-out plug for charging eliminates the need for carting around a cable and separate charger. &lt;br /&gt;I have purchased a number of others through the years (Norelco, Conoco etc) seduced by an array of attachments accessories and features which worked poorly or I never used. None of them have come close to the Panasonic&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> I use this trimmer for two big reasons: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1. The recharging power plug is integrated so that I don&#x27;t need a seperate cord. &lt;br /&gt;2. The lowest setting for the trimming guard is exactly right for me so I don&#x27;t have to worry about setting it too low and shaving a strip through my beard.  The level is also lockable so I would still recommend it for someone that would adjust it higher. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is my third one as after a few years it won&#x27;t hold a charge, which will happen with any rechargeable device.  I always look for a better one when mine wears out but always come back to the Panasonic.  I&#x27;m beginning to think that Panasonic is a very high-quality manufacturer of a wide range of products as in the last year I have also purchased a Panasonic cordless drill and  plasma TV by them.   These were very highly rated by others and I have been happy with everything.</li>
    <li> And I was so thrilled about how much better it worked than my old battery powered one which broke recently, that I decided to write this brief statement of praise.  All the good things other reviewers said about it appear to be true in spades.  Great!!</li>
    <li> Although the Panasonic is a nice little product and convenient because of the built in plug for recharging, I&#x27;ve used trimmers in the past, like the Braun, which have given a closer crop than this one does on setting number 1.</li>
    <li> Buy it, you will be satisfied. I have used other beard trimmers over the years and have had to battle inserting batteries every few months.  This beard trimmer is simplicity personified. Plug it into the wall when not using it. Unplug it when you are ready to trim, retract the plug and whisk away.</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for 20 years, I am a hairstylist, have used many trimmers, and this is the best, it lasts the longest, easy to use (cordless) and charge, I just hope they never discontinue this trimmer, I have had them last for 3 years, when they dont charge anymore or the blade gets dull, I just buy a new one, because the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> I had this product over 3 years ago.  The batter eventually didn&#x27;t hold a charge so I bought a fancy one from Fry&#x27;s Electronics. It sucked.  The fanciest with all the attachments and stuff...you don&#x27;t need it.  Keep it simple and this is the best one.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00005JS5G Panasonic ER389K Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer]]      Simple design, just keeps on ticking (and trimming) My first one lasted 10 yrs, just bought another.    Best features: Locking beard length selector; built-in charger    Shortcoming: Battery seems to be the NiCad kind, which has a &#x27;memory,&#x27; meaning you must run it most of the way down before recharging or it will &#x27;remember&#x27; to go only a short (running) time between charges -  Lithium type would be better in this regard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all I need and it&#x27;s design is very comfortable and the recharging system is user friendly.  A++++</li>
    <li> Poor battery life.If you get a year out of this you&#x27;re lucky. I loved it while it was working.</li>
    <li> This thing just broke and I can&#x27;t find replacement clips anywhere. The head of the clipper keeps popping off</li>
    <li> I want to replace my trimmer before it wears out. I have had many years of use out my current trimmer, but I don&#x27;t want replace it with a different product. This model was that good!</li>
    <li> Please send me my Trimmer first and then i will write review.&lt;BR&gt;Its been so many day pass and i have not recive my stuff you should send me my stuff free of charge beause you fail to complet my orderr on time.&lt;BR&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really review this thing, because I&#x27;m still waiting for it from Amazon. I ordered it on February 21, and just got a note from them saying it will be delayed, with an estimated delivery by May 20..That would be 3 months!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So...don&#x27;t believe the shipping estimate. It doesn&#x27;t ship within 1-2 weeks. Maybe more like 1-2 months. Yes, I&#x27;m looking forward to using this. But by May 20, I&#x27;ll look like I&#x27;m in ZZ Top.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Buy this thing somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I have had this Panasonic beard trimmer for about five years. I allways ran the charge down completly before recharging it again. Holds a charge a long time! Always worked great. I just had to buy a new one because my dog ate it! So I guess she enjoyed it to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand and make for four(4)years and it&#x27;s been serving me well. It has a nice size and I like how it is  rechargeable. I Had to purchase it again because it fell twenty feet and broke. This and only this I use no other.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic trimmer in about 15 years.  The first was a corded/cordless model, which I liked a lot.  The battery eventually died and I got tired of only being able to use it plugged in, so I replaced it with an ER389K, like this one.  It worked well for about 5 years until the battery quit recharging.  It didn&#x27;t work quite as well as my first trimmer and it was a little frustrating not being able to replace the battery, but I bought another one anyway.  The price was right and I liked it well enough. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The new one is great!  Better than before.  Why?  I took a good look at the old one vs. the new one.  The difference?  The new one is made in Japan; the old one was made in China.  There is a subtle improvement in the fit and finish of the new one and it just seems to work better.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My Husband has used this brand of trimmer for years, and even though they have changed small details of this trimmer it still remains the best on the market.  He has tried many other brands, and so far this is the best!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd, and it is the easiest to use and works very well. It lasts long on a charge and has a built in charger, so no seperate cords to loose. It is a well built and simple trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased a National beard trimmer in 1985 (NOT a misprint - it was 21 years ago) and have used it to trim my beard since then. It worked flawlessly throughout all those years except that, not unreasonably, the battery would not hold a charge in the end. Recently it finally gave up the ghost and I came across this Panasonic ER389K model. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, this is essentially the same beard trimmer (with a few modifications/improvements) that I used for 21 years so I hope to write another glowing review such as this in 21 years singing the praises of the Panasonic ER389K.</li>
    <li> Panasonic beard and mustache trimmer - Excellent for any male that would like to sport a well-trimmed beard and moustache without wasting a whole lot of time!</li>
    <li> The Panasonic beard trimmer product is really good. This is my second one...I keep one in each house. The new compact wall AC plug-in adapter also gets rid of storing long wires.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Panasonic ER389K Beard Trimmer in 12 years.  My old one has worked so reliably that I was surprised when it refused to run one morning last month.  Turns out the battery finally shorted out.  Still using the original blade.  Because I got such a good deal on the new one, I decided to buy new instead of replacing the battery, altough the trimmer would have operated just fine with a new battery.      After I used the new one, realized that I should have replaced the blade on the old one.    I&#x27;ve got a full beard and keep it trimmed close to my face (#3 setting on the trimmer length adjustment) so has gotten plenty of workout.  [[ASIN:B00005JS5G Panasonic ER389K Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer]]</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new trimmer after using a WAHL [two of them actually, one just didn&#x27;t have the charging power and the other / ] that would cut horribly; meaning it would literally CUT us. Anyway I had enough of that..      After reading the many positive reviews for this, I decided to buy one. I received it a few days after, during the same week ordered. Opened it up and first impression of it was \\&quot;Wow, this has some serious build quality\\&quot; I looked at the back and it said \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot;. Go figure. ;)    It really feels solid for something of this size. I read all of the manual [or lack thereof], let it charge overnight &amp; used it the next day. From owning the 2 Wahl&#x27;s before I thought it would be loud, but it wasn&#x27;t, just a nice smooth wzzzzzzzzzz purr that did its job right and left the skin feeling non irritated, unlike the previous trimmers I&#x27;ve had.    Only discrepancy I have is that it doesn&#x27;t leave AS close a shave wanted with the attachment removed, but it does its job well for the most part. Oh, and if you use the included attachment, it has a great moving up and down feature to choose the size of the trim WITH a locking feature so it doesn&#x27;t accidentally move around.      Definitely recommended. For the price, build quality and results you get, you cant go wrong with this Panasonic!</li>
    <li> This Panasonic beard trimmer is simply perfect. It trims my beard accurately and cleanly and never pulls or tears. The six adjustment setting, each of which is for a specified length, are precise and foolproof. The guard is exactly the right size and shape, allowing me to get the trimmer into my chin and the side of my neck. The integrated charger is  cleverly designed; it&#x27;s very convenient not having a charge-cord to forget when I travel. The unit is lightweight and easy to clean. It would have been nice to have had a travel pouch, but the price is so good that I don&#x27;t feel short-changed by its omission. Faultless design at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this model for several years.  After years of use eventually the battery will not recharge and I buy a new one.  Works like a charm, convenient length adjustment, easy to recharge.  Good value for the price, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I like the compact design without a separate charger.  I miss having a pop up trimmer.</li>
    <li> could hold charge longer</li>
    <li> I used to have one, it does a great job and quickly, had to throw it out when the &amp;quot;rechargeable&amp;quot; battery would not recharge anymore and no one had a replacement.  Has anyone told Panasonic yet that NiCad batteries stink?</li>
    <li> Six position, cordless beard trimmer.  Great product for about 2+ years, until the battery stopped holding a charge.  No replacement parts could be found.  Typical Panasonic product: just outlived its warranty.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s beard &amp;amp; mustache. He just loves it. He says that all the other numerous trimmers he has owned pale in comparison.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for about 8 years . The battery finally died so I bought another one . It does exactly what it is supposed to do . Great product !</li>
    <li> This model is well established - I have had three in succession since 1997.  It is the best trimmer I have ever found, with fine but non-scratchy cutting blades.  The built-in 110 volt charging pins are extremely convenient, except for trips overseas.  However, after a full charge the trimmer tends to last for a couple of weeks anyway.  Unfortunately, the rechargeable battery is not replaceable, so when it fails (after a few years continuous use) you have to buy a complete new unit.  On the other hand, the price of the trimmer has reduced considerably over the years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product (exactly the same) for many years, so when my old one literally wore out, I decided to buy the same thing.  I did a search on Amazon.com and found the same item...so I ordered it for about the same price I purchased the first on!!  &#x27;nuff said!</li>
    <li> I have been using the ER389Ks for nearly a decade now.  For me, they have been my absolute favorite.  I am on Amazon now about to buy another (I&#x27;ve lost track of exactly how many I&#x27;m on now). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BEARD and MUSTACHE TRIMMER - For various lengths of beards, sideburns, and mustaches, this unit works very well.  Understand that this unit&#x27;s shortest setting cuts once you look \\&quot;beardy\\&quot; rather than imply \\&quot;stylishly stubbly\\&quot;.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TRAVEL CONVENIENCE - I do a lot of traveling, but don&#x27;t bring the brush and oil that come with the unit.  The plugs for re-charging retract into the unit, which means no cords to pack (or lose).  SUGGESTION:  When you&#x27;re traveling, have the \\&quot;recharging prongs\\&quot; in the OUT position, which prevents the unit from being turned on accidentally.  Even if you flip the switch, it won&#x27;t drain your power.  Very handy!   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;TRIMMING - The ad reads \\&quot;For closer trimming, the guide comes off completely.\\&quot;  It works alright for trimming down longer hairs, but unlike your hairstylist&#x27;s buzzing trimmer (which is MUCH more expensive than this thing) this one has a tendancy to \\&quot;grab\\&quot; if you&#x27;re zooming this unit guide-less across your skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDES -  &lt;br /&gt;1.  BATTERY LIFE - This unit does not last forever.  Neither did my goldfish.  I&#x27;ve come to grips with both of these ultimate losses.  I read some reviews where they said their battery quit after a month, or something like that...  Having had quite a few of these units, I can honestly say that mine tend to last around 2 years when I was using it to trim my beard.  Now that I&#x27;m \\&quot;beardless\\&quot; but use it for trimming sideburns and such it&#x27;s lasting longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  GUIDE SLIPPAGE &#x3D; After a bit of use, the guide can slip from one setting to another (generally to 1)if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure.  This has been rather consistent on all of the models, but with this in mind, I am easily able to make the slippage NOT happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this unit.  If you happen to have problems with Amazon&#x27;s shipping of the unit, don&#x27;t give the product bad review from that...  that&#x27;s between you and Amazon.  It&#x27;s comparable to giving a movie a bad review because you got into a car accident on your way to the theater. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy Shoppping! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Would earn 5 stars if it adjusted down to some slightly shorter lengths.</li>
    <li> This is an easy to use beard trimmer. I enjoy it quite frankly. The battery duration is very descent. The main caveat is that may be a little bit too big to carry with you all the time, but is not that bad. However, if you would like to have a 7-10day beard all the time, this is not the right product for you.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt; I had an old Norelco trimmer that finally died after almost 8 years of great service.As I was getting shaggier and shaggier,I had to decide on what new trimmer to get. &lt;br /&gt; After reading all the reviews on Amazon,on every trimmer, I decided to buy this one. &lt;br /&gt;   I was immediately impressed.This is ,by far, the smoothest trimmer I have ever used.Very even effortless trimming...sweet. &lt;br /&gt; I waited til I have used it for a bit before giving a review. &lt;br /&gt;All was well...until this morning. &lt;br /&gt; I have read some of the previous reviews which some users warned of an unexpected length setting change.But,after actually using the trimmer about 10 times,I came to the conclusion that they were applying way to much pressure with the trimmer.Like they were trying to \\&quot;plow\\&quot; their faces like a garden.I myself don&#x27;t do this at all.There is no need whatsoever,as this trimmer cuts so cleanly and evenly.I use only enough pressure to maintain contact with the face.I&#x27;ve never had any problem with the length setting changing on me. &lt;br /&gt; BUT THIS MORNING...urghhhh!!! &lt;br /&gt;Trimming like normal,being sure to check the length selector and making sure it was properly set(not in an inbetween position).Everything was fine. &lt;br /&gt;I was almost done and then it happened.... &lt;br /&gt;The setting went down to the number 2 setting and I have a perfectly trimmed beard except for this big hole in it. Boy was I pi$$ed off. &lt;br /&gt;Good thing I wasn&#x27;t applying lots of pressure or it could be worse I suppose. Yes it will grow back of course but still...it really sux. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If Panasonic could fix this 1 little,but very crucial flaw,this would indeed be the world champion of trimmers. &lt;br /&gt; Until this happened,I was going to give a big fat 5 star review.But in light of the chunk of my beard missing...it only gets a 4.Ithoght about a 3 quite honestly,but I went with 4 due to the excellent cutting of this trimmer. &lt;br /&gt; I suppose from now on I will simply have to grip the trimmerright behind the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; to insure that it won&#x27;t slip and eat another chunk of my beard. &lt;br /&gt;Unfortunate to have to modify the otherwise great ergonomics when using this trimmer. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Simple, convenient shaver.  Best feature:  charges while plugged directly into the wall socket.  Makes for easy storage.</li>
    <li> First of all, forget about those beard trimmers with all of the various interchangeable heads.  (Did you ever use all of the gadgets that came with that all-purpose vacuum cleaner?)  They simply get lost and, moreover, rarely justify the trouble of interchanging them.  A \\&quot;dedicated\\&quot; beard trimmer is quicker, more convenient, more effective.  My last was a Remington, built much like this Panasonic.  I dropped it and broke one of the \\&quot;guards,\\&quot; leading to some strangely-streaked beards.  A replacement guard unit, I discovered, would cost me more than what Amazon is currently getting for this comparable Panasonic trimmer with a built-in, pop-out adapter!  (A real steal--just compare some of the other prices on the internet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the trimmer, the guard is more accurate than my Remington&#x27;s was, even when new, and the black design I find more appealing than Remington silver.  Admittedly, the guard mechanism doesn&#x27;t move into place with micro-accurate ball-bearing smoothness (users with weak \\&quot;morning fingers\\&quot; may find it initially challenging), and there are no niceties such as a charging light.  Still it does the job for a song while imparting self-confidence.  If a clincher is needed: this product bearing a famous, trusted Japanese brand name is actually manufactured in Japan! (More often than not, even products from Sony, Toshiba, Onkyo are being manufactured in China and Malaysia.  The Japanese have copied us once again, but in this instance, rest assured the product is \\&quot;Japanese made.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I used a Norelco trimmer for years before purchasing the Panasonic.  The Panasonic works very well and trims evenly.  However, I think the Norelco&#x27;s lowest setting is slightly shorter than the panasonic which I sometimes prefer.  Other than this issue, I do recommend the Panasonic.  I like the charging feature with the plug located within the unit.  It saves from having to carry another plug and cord, especially when travelling.  And, a full charge seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a full beard and moustache since 1980.  Shaved it completely off one time...big mistake.  I love this trimmer.  For me, it lasts about five years, then the blades are dullish.  I know, because I have owned 3 and I&#x27;m about to buy my fourth.  I have never had one stop working altogether.  Since 1980 I&#x27;ve lost most of the hair on my head, typical male-pattern baldness.  Two years ago I got tired of paying a barber $10 or now $12 for a 5 minute buzz cut.  So I started to shave my own head with this trimmer, about once a week.  It works fine.  I also love the simplicity of this trimmer, no cord, just plug &#x27;er in.</li>
    <li> I saw all the reviews praising this trimmer and I wondered if it really needed one more.  This is my third trimmer and I&#x27;m VERY happy with it.  I&#x27;m NOT happy about throwing my old one away because the batteries are not changeable.  Seems like a big waste.  I&#x27;ll probably buy #4 when this dies on me. I think my old one lasted about four years.  I guess that&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
    <li> I have had a beard for 10 years. Always cumbersome to maintain it - so i would let it grow for 3-4 days and then trim it. Until I found this product.    I use it almost everyday.    A little tough to trim the mustache though.</li>
    <li> first off, the range of trimming lengths are 1/8-45/64th of an inch.  i guess i should have read the tech specs since i typically like to trim as close as 0.06 inches. so that was quite unsatisfactory    secondly, the built in plug is a bit of annoyance since our plug point is mounted at a location where the plug cant slide in fully due to built in obstructions above and below the plug point.    thirdly, i have had the motor stall a bunch of times within a month of usage. i dont know why - i am guessing it has to do with it running low on charge quite rapidly. if so, the 45 min operating time per charge is an overestimate by a factor of ~4.</li>
    <li> I decided I would try a new brand and was not pleased with this.  It doesn&#x27;t get short enough with the attachment on and tends to pull hair too. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> replaced another pair that are now the &#x27;dog clippers&#x27; and you cannot beat them for performance.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00005JS5G Panasonic ER389K Rechargeable Beard and Mustache Trimmer]] I have had this make &amp; model for several years and the day it \\&quot;died\\&quot; I was disappointed that I would not find one like it again. Thank you Amazon!!! This trimmer has the re-charger built in, so you just plug it into the wall. Others have a separate re-charger with a long cord and no place to have it on you bathroom counter. Does a nice even trim too that my wife LOVES :-)</li>
    <li> As some of you have said, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;But the battery dies.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a rechargeable.  Did not like it.&lt;br /&gt;So I tried a standard everyday AA battery.  Stuck it in there, and let &#x27;er rip.&lt;br /&gt;Works great.&lt;br /&gt;My rechargeable battery died 5-8 years ago, and now I just use a standard battery.&lt;br /&gt;I have to change it every couple of months.  (Unscrew the the thing and jam the new one in there.</li>
    <li> Works great - hods a charge for a long time. This item seems to get used by everyone who comes to the house.</li>
    <li> too bad you can&#x27;t find it any more .It was the most versatile; all in one</li>
</ol>
