<ol>
    <li> This is a mascara that i could use forever</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT &amp;#60;3 EASY TO APPLY STAYS ALL DAY</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is the only mascara I can wear and not cause allergies. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know how this mascara comes so highly recommended. It&#x27;s horrible. Generally I don&#x27;t see much difference in mascaras and don&#x27;t see the point in buying super expensive ones but in my opinion there are MANY other options at the drug store that are FAR superior. This mascara never fully dries and smears easily.</li>
    <li> I feel very disappointed because it says that they will send you 6 mascaras and i receive only one, and other thing is not water proof..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bad choice</li>
    <li> I purchased this on 4/27/10  and when I finally received it,   it came with  just one mascara, not 6 mascaras.  So I talked to a friend  who also ordered it and she said  she&#x27;s only received one instead of 6.  So when I called Amazon to explain the situation,  all they said was for me to pack it and drop it off at UPS store instead of sending the extra 5 for a refund.  The reason I order from online is for convenience, not Inconvenience of going out and sending out a package back to them!</li>
    <li> It clearly staes 6 mascaras in the item description.  Only one came in teh box.  I returned for a refund.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and would never change</li>
    <li> In the description it clearly states 6 mascaras - I wish I would have read the reviews before ordering because you only receive one - It costs more money by ordering it this way than if I would have went to my local store and purchased it. Very disappointing... wish they would rectify this situation</li>
    <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
    <li> I use the Great Lash with a curled brush and love it. I&#x27;ve tried the straight brush and unfortunately it makes my skinny lashes clump together. The curled brush however goes on evenly without globs. If you go through mascara monthly like I do, this is an inexpensive solution to having great lashes!</li>
    <li> THAY ARE REAL AND THEY ARE SPECTACULAR !!!!!!!!  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS THIS PRODUCT FOR 40 YEARS !!!!!!!!!!  I LOVE IT. NOTHING COMPARES. IT HAS KEPT MY LASES HEALTHY  AND LONG AND LUSH.  IT GIVES ME SHINY, LONG THICK LASES AND WASHES OFF AND DOES NOT DAMAGE THEM. VERY GENTLE AT THE SAME TIME. I HAVE GOTTEN COMPLIMENTS ON MY LASHES AT LEAST TWISE A WEEK FOR THE LAST 40 YEARS OF MY LIFE! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMEND!</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase a mascara that made your eyelashes look pretty, but natural and thats exactly what this one did. I already have long eyelashes but i like to use mascara. I purchased in the color Very Black. I literally just received it in the mail and tried it on. It enhanced my lashes, but they still look completely natural. The brush is small, and thats just what i was looking for. The mascara formula itself smelled a little weird when i opened it, but maybe thats because its new. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that say they had an allergic reaction to the mascara. If your thinking about purchasing this mascara keep that in mind. I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy because a couple years ago my sister used to to use this mascara and i used hers once or twice and never had that problem. (tip: don&#x27;t share eyeliner and mascara for bacterial reasons!!)</li>
    <li> Only came with 1 mascara not six, very misleading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Therefore, also made the product a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> Not AT ALL what i expected to receive , the product is all dried out &amp; not even in the same packaging as in the image , EXTREMELY disappointed . waste of my hard earned money .!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands but I always realize I&#x27;ve made a mistake and go back to this one!! Now I will not try anything else!!</li>
    <li> Wonderful inexpensive mascara. Just wish the brush was fuller.</li>
    <li> This product has been highly rated in several magazines, so I thought I would try it. It was horrible. I would get smudges under my eyes, and it irritated my contacts. I won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it gives your lashes great length and thickness. I&#x27;ve used this once and I was extremely happy with the result. It lasts all day and will keep your lashes looking beautiful for hours.</li>
    <li> it came in earlier than the deadline but it was not the mascara that it said it was on the description. the description read &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; and the mascara had nothing waterproof.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good mascara, especially given the price.  I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it.  It&#x27;s not a lengthening mascara, but it doesn&#x27;t clump and I like that for every day use.</li>
    <li> i bought this one and i got the one with curved brush!!!!!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY MASCARA I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE. IT WORKS SO WELL, THERE IS NO REASON TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND. AND THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS AMAZING.</li>
    <li> This mascara applied very easily with the brush provided. Wasn&#x27;t all clumpy like some others. Color was very black and it lasted all day with only 1 application in the morning. Didn&#x27;t drop little specks of black on my face throughout the day either. Easy to remove at night when cleaning makeup off. Definitely liking this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same exact product that&#x27;s sold worldwide. It has great quality and works very well for my lashes. The applicator is very soft and comforfable.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for half of my life. I find that it goes on smoothly without clumping and I just love the fact that it washes off with water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of mascara for years.  Sometimes branch out and try others, but this is the best.</li>
    <li> Great simple mascara, no fuss, no muss. The very black is excellent, nice and dramatic without looking like a hooker. I have very dark eyes and olive complexion and I think it suits me very well</li>
    <li> Came right on time! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
