      <li>Using both products the shampoo and conditioner gives a better result.</li>
      <li>I really love all their shampoos and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Pretty good pricing.</li>
      <li>This has to be one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used in a very long time.</li>
      <li>My hair is easier to style, and my roots feel conditioned and easier to comb thru to the end -- great detangling action.</li>
      <li>It really smells good.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery, Cheap and good products.</li>
      <li>Which is fine, I just have to have another shampoo and conditioner on hand.</li>
      <li>If you or your family don&#x27;t enjoy strong scents, this may not be the shampoo for you.  </li>
      <li>Lathers nicely,sulphate Free.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and the way this makes my hair feel right after shampooing.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this product.  </li>
      <li>Might be good for someone else&#x27;s hair but definitely not mine.</li>
      <li>The conditioner does not seem as good, so I use another super conditioner (Aveda for dry hair) about once a week.</li>
      <li>The smell is AMAZING and actually lasts in your hair!  </li>
      <li>these put a nice shine back, without looking greasy.</li>
      <li>this is the only kind I will use now.  </li>
      <li>Very nice and not too heavy for your hair.</li>
      <li>The non-sulfate formula does not mean no suds, the shampoo lathes fine.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fabulous and great for conditioning hair especially if you have dry hair.</li>
      <li>I switched back to my regular conditioner and hair feels great.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, and my husband likes the scent very much.  </li>
      <li>At first hair was shiney but after a week of using this product.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine hair, so can&#x27;t leave the conditioner on very long; but all in all, they both work well.</li>
      <li>I still love the scent and was surprised when I came out of a store after washing my hair that morning a man behind me told me that he loved the smell of my perfume...</li>
      <li>Finely, I can stop looking for help,  managing my fine and limp hair.</li>
      <li>Wow! I i instantly knew my hair had more volume.</li>
      <li>and I found it at a reasonable cost.</li>
      <li>I find this product both gentle and healing for my hair which can be VERY dry/ brittle in the winter.</li>
      <li>my roots look very greasy and that is even without using the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have some thinning in the top of my hair that I wear short and in natural afro without chemical straighteners.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this combo of shampoo/conditioner to help with dry, unmanageable hair or just to give your hair that healthy shinny look.</li>
      <li>Be sure to buy it from Amazon because it is half the price than in salons.</li>
      <li>It lathers up well and seems to clean my hair without stripping it dry.</li>
      <li>The 5 stars are for the shampoo, but the conditioner is only worth 2.</li>
      <li>I am continuously trying new shampoo and conditioners.</li>
      <li>Wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>Pleasantly surprised to find it on here!</li>
      <li>I had previously purchased many different types of products to help with my hair problem but none can compare.  </li>
      <li>The conditioner is too watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as an instant volumozing shampoo, but its not going to make your hair stay volumized.</li>
      <li>thought it was funny to partially unscrew the tops on the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Wife had first run across this in a beauty salon and wanted to buy some but was extremely costly.</li>
      <li>I am blonde, ahem - not naturally - and need to use something that&#x27;s very moisturizing or my hair looks like straw.</li>
      <li>You only need a little so this product goes a long way, it works fabulously.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As soon as i got it, i went to shower and used it as directed. I got out of the shower, looked in the mirror and Wow! I i instantly knew my hair had more volume. Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second set. May never use any thing else.  Does not leave your hair  feeling heavy like some argon oil shampoos and conditioners.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> My hairdresser gave me a sample of this and I love it! Pleasantly surprised to find it on here! I recommend this product for anyone with color treated hair and you use dryer (heat) products often.</li>
    <li> I have purchased the same shampoo and conditioner from my stylist.  The conditioner is the a different consistency than the one I purchased from the salon and both items seem a little off as far as the end result.  Also the stickers on the bottle peel when they never have before.  Trying to save a little money may have cost me in the end.</li>
    <li> Using the shampoo and conditioner together leave my hair oily. I can only use the shampoo after a clarifying shampoo or the conditioner with a different shampoo. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again. It is not right for my hair.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, Cheap and good products.</li>
    <li> I am continuously trying new shampoo and conditioners. I thought this product would be good because the oil is so good. I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair but my hair is thin and when I use this shampoo it gives me that instant volume that I need and want in a shampoo. I highly recommend it as an instant volumozing shampoo, but its not going to make your hair stay volumized. If you want something for thicker hair you would need a treatment. But I love the effect it gives off. Using both products the shampoo and conditioner gives a better result.</li>
    <li> Agadir Argan Shampoo and Conditioner Combo is excellent. My product for life! I have some thinning in the top of my hair that I wear short and in natural afro without chemical straighteners. My hair is responding great to this product. Thicker roots, smoother, softer feel of my hair and moisturizing too. I find this product both gentle and healing for my hair which can be VERY dry/ brittle in the winter. I use cream Henna color and this brand doesn&#x27;t strip the color prematurely. My hair is easier to style, and my roots feel conditioned and easier to comb thru to the end -- great detangling action. The Agadir shampoo and conditioner smell is wonderful - not over powering, Consistency is creamy, not thin, allowing precise placement as you shampoo and condition. So there is little waste. The non-sulfate formula does not mean no suds, the shampoo lathes fine. But it does not break the hair during the shampoo process the way standard sulfate shampoos do. You can feel the &#x27;smoothing&#x27; feel of the shampoo and conditioner as you use them. A little goes along way. It can be expensive, but worth it. And you can find sellers who sell both shampoo and conditioner for the price of one.</li>
    <li> Very nice and not too heavy for your hair. Smells wonderful</li>
    <li> Love all their products</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and condition I have ever used.  I use the volumizing kind.  My hair is fuller and softer then ever.  Be sure to buy it from Amazon because it is half the price than in salons.</li>
    <li> Smells divine! Great feeling after hairwash.</li>
    <li> I have tried many hair products throughout my sixty some years and have found Agadir products to be the best ever. Finely, I can stop looking for help,  managing my fine and limp hair.</li>
    <li> I would buy it just for the smell if nothing else...but...luckily it works fantastic too!  That smell though is heavenly!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
    <li> Excellent product but looks like whomever shipped it to me thought it was funny to partially unscrew the tops on the shampoo and conditioner. A complete mess when I opened the box</li>
    <li> After having a hair stylist tell me that the One N Only bran of Argan oil products was the worst on the market, I decided to try this one. After one use, I went back to the &amp;#34;worst&amp;#34; brand. This stuff left my hair in such a tangled mess even after using the conditioner and leaving it on while I did the rest of my showering. Might be good for someone else&#x27;s hair but definitely not mine. I&#x27;ll be passing this one on.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used in a very long time. It lathers up well and seems to clean my hair without stripping it dry. The conditioner isn&#x27;t so great. The conditioner is too watery and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair soft and shiny. The 5 stars are for the shampoo, but the conditioner is only worth 2.</li>
    <li> you just can&#x27;t go wrong washing color treated hair with these products. I am blonde, ahem - not naturally - and need to use something that&#x27;s very moisturizing or my hair looks like straw. these put a nice shine back, without looking greasy.</li>
    <li> Awesome service and product!</li>
    <li> I have oily hair and was afraid this shampoo would weigh my hair down. I was completely wrong. It gave my hair body and fullness even without blow drying. I use a very small amount of conditioner to prevent frizziness.</li>
    <li> Most amazing hair product I have used in years.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> Met all my expectations!  This product leaves my hair fuller longer without weighing it down in just a few days.  I am so impressed that this was my second order.  I still love the scent and was surprised when I came out of a store after washing my hair that morning a man behind me told me that he loved the smell of my perfume...oddly I wasn&#x27;t wearing perfume.</li>
    <li> Love the volum and the smell lasts for days</li>
    <li> Very good for my fine curly hair.</li>
    <li> It leaves your hair oily, so I mix it with my other shampoo and it works well with my hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo is great for my fine straigt hair! The conditioner does not seem as good, so I use another super conditioner (Aveda for dry hair) about once a week. My hair has much more body.</li>
    <li> If you or your family don&#x27;t enjoy strong scents, this may not be the shampoo for you.  I don&#x27;t mind it, and my husband likes the scent very much.  I have very fine hair, so can&#x27;t leave the conditioner on very long; but all in all, they both work well.</li>
    <li> argan volumizing shampoo is the only shampoo I use.  it is very hard to find so I am almost out of what I have so I went to amazon, which I am very glad I did.  I think it is the best shampoo.  don&#x27;t know why it is so hard to find??  my hair always look beautiful.  I also like the argan oil for hair &amp; skin, use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo for body I have ever used!!  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product...before I knew it, it was delivered to my doorstep!</li>
    <li> Great for your hair.  Cleanses great but still has volume.</li>
    <li> Excellent product !! My hair was so dry and out of control. Dr. Oz mentioned Aragon oil for damaged hair so I bought that along with the shampoo and conditioner.  I was thrilled with the results !  I had previously purchased many different types of products to help with my hair problem but none can compare.  I would highly recommend this combo of shampoo/conditioner to help with dry, unmanageable hair or just to give your hair that healthy shinny look.</li>
    <li> I really love all their shampoos and conditioners. They add a lot of moisture and volume to my hair. The only problem is that I can&#x27;t use it every time. I use it every other time I wash my hair. Which is fine, I just have to have another shampoo and conditioner on hand. Otherwise I love the way my hair feels using this product!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, everything as advertised. Pretty good pricing.</li>
    <li> You only need a little so this product goes a long way, it works fabulously. Just as I have learned through the testimonies and previous shows and demonstrations of this product. It&#x27;s fabulous and great for conditioning hair especially if you have dry hair. Great Product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and the way this makes my hair feel right after shampooing. My issue is a few hours later...my roots look very greasy and that is even without using the conditioner. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this product again because of that :-(</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Lathers nicely,sulphate Free.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this product.  Wanted to try something new. At first hair was shiney but after a week of using this product.  Hair felt very unhealthy and like straw.  I switched back to my regular conditioner and hair feels great.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner since I started using t this is the only kind I will use now.  Also love the smell it gives to your hair</li>
    <li> I like the texture and feel and body this shampoo and conditioner give my hair</li>
    <li> The smell is AMAZING and actually lasts in your hair!  Would recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> Wife had first run across this in a beauty salon and wanted to buy some but was extremely costly. She found some in a store and it wasn&#x27;t quite as bad. I told her I&#x27;d check Amazon.com and I found it at a reasonable cost. She loves it and will be buying more.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair shine and it is not oily. It really smells good. Hair looks great.</li>
