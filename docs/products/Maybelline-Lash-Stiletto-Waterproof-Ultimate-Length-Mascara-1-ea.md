<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect! Best mascara I&#x27;ve found in a while. My eyelashes look like fake and stay up all day even though I work in a kitchen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mascara for a few years now. It couldn&#x27;t find it at the grocery and was pleasantly surprised to locate it on Amazon. This is now a regular waterproof mascara that comes off when washing your face in the shower. If you don&#x27;t take it off with makeup remove it&#x27;ll stay on. I&#x27;ve gone swimming and it didn&#x27;t even smudge. If you have multiple layers on it will flake off after a long day, but normal wear you&#x27;ll be good to go all day and into the next morning.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got to order my favorite mascara as the stores no longer carry it.</li>
    <li> I bought this mascara mainly because I needed one that was waterproof.  It was easy to use and it did not smudge and lasted during my workouts.  It gives a great stiletto look but if you are looking for volumizing as well you won&#x27;t find it with this mascara.</li>
    <li> Great for making lashes longer, but it tends to clump lashes together easily. I now use a base mascara that volumizes without clumping, and then go over it after that dries with this for length. Works very well for me</li>
    <li> It lasts and has very little clumping. The but brush could be better and it is not great for skimpy bottom lashes.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite. The brush is nice for separating eyelashes, but I tend to use it as a base for.. better mascara. I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s waterproof, but it doesn&#x27;t lengthen lashes much. Doesn&#x27;t exactly blotch up often, but like I said, not a favorite.</li>
    <li> This stuff is definitely worth trying. I have tried about a dozen drug store mascaras lately and this is one of the best for length. I am Korean and have virtually no eyelashes. In thickness or length! I use this along with loreal voluminous in carbon black waterproof and my heated eyelash curler and it works wonders. I alternate coats starting with the loreal. The second coat of stiletto I apply to just the tips.</li>
    <li> ordered the wrong formulation, still love the mascara though!  next time will order the correct formulation, have been using it for years</li>
    <li> I have tried many different mascaras and this is my all-time favorite at this price range. In my opinion it is comparable to Lancôme Definicils.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, unpacked, all scratched, I have a question that someone has used this mascara! this product, I wanted to give the girl, but seeing it in what condition, I can not do it! Be careful! MERAB GEORGIA TBILISI</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras- always reliable in rain, sweating, etc.  have been using it for years and will not purchase any others.</li>
    <li> I regret deciding to switch off from my usual Loreal brand.  Straight off, I didn&#x27;t like the brush.  The sharp ends were uncomfortable and poked my sensitive eyes.  I didn&#x27;t find that the formula made my lashes look much longer or curlier than normal.  Finally, it was NOT waterproof.  I had smudges under my eyes by 4pm.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Good product. I have straight eyelashes and with the curler and this mascara they stay curled throughout the day</li>
    <li> I use this one once in a while, I like that it last all day. I received it the day they told me and I recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I use this everyday. Have even subscribed to have it sent to me monthly. It doesn&#x27;t run when wet or flake during wear. Love this mascara.</li>
    <li> Hard to apply..this also seemed to be dried out when I received it.  Would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This mascara is decent. It is NOT as waterproof as it says it is.  It smears when left on all day. It lengthens your lashes though.</li>
    <li> I love this product - no clumping, no flaking and it&#x27;s waterproof.  I&#x27;ve had compliments on how pretty my lashes look.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. I receive many compliments on how great my eyelashes look.</li>
    <li> It got here quickly but the item was banged up and scratched.it also had something on the bottom of it, but the packaging was sealed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m torn with this mascara because it does give the extention but it is hard to get off I have to keep washing and washing and pulling at my lashes to get it off. I think the price is great and of course you get the stiletto extention as described but getting it off is a major problem for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried many costly name brand mascara lines that don&#x27;t even compare to this product! For the price I usually buy 4 at a time which lasts about a year or more!  Stilleto is what it is and what it actually does - adds height and long length to lashes!  Don&#x27;t buy the waterproof line though.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara, but I felt like i only got a few uses before the tube dried out.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice quality for the price, it is also so surprisingly light that I don&#x27;t really feel it even after second coat. It is probably the best option for those of you who hate to have too much stuff on the face but still look nice.</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love this mascara and I have tried them all. This goes on beautifully, stays on, no irritation and make my lashes look beautiful.</li>
    <li> Best mascara.  No smudging whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Just right, WARERPROOF!</li>
    <li> Great masca!! I really love this product..</li>
    <li> By far the best mascara I have tried.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge and makes the lashes look really long. I have sensitive eyes and these do not bother me at all.</li>
    <li> Love Lash Stiletto.  Have used for years.  I try other brands now and then, but always come back to this.  It glistens, goes on smooth, and does not clump.  Since its waterproof, need to use a makeup remover.  Love that I can swim, run in the rain, scuba...and my lashes look great!!!</li>
    <li> My go to brand for mascara. I got tired of looking all over town for the water-proof one.</li>
    <li> In love with this mascara !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over 5 years. Highly recommend it! It gives me the volume I&#x27;m seeking for and the length without any clumping. I&#x27;ve been asked whether I wear fake lashes! It really is that wonderful.</li>
    <li> I really like what this mascara does for my lashes. I have thick, short Asian eyelashes and these did a great job at lengthening, volumizing, and staying curled all day and opening up my eyes. But my two cons are: 1) by mid-day I had smears on my bottom eye line from blinking/smiling. I do have oily skin, but for a waterproof mascara I expected more; and 2) this stuff is impossible to get off! When applying you have to be really careful not to get it on your lid or else it&#x27;s game over and at the end of the day, despite leaving a soaked pad on my lashes, rubbing off, and washing it with face wash, the stuff still doesn&#x27;t come off all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost perfect, but for the hassle of raccoon eyes and it not budging, I continue my search for another mascara...</li>
    <li> This is some of the best mascara I have used in a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear and the brush separates all of my lashes really well.</li>
    <li> I really like, it&#x27;s easy to use and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is a good mascara to use on a regular basis, this use to be my to go mascara. It doesn&#x27;t create anything dramatic and it doesn&#x27;t clump so it&#x27;s not a miracle mascara but it&#x27;s a good one if you just want to lightly enhance your eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite.  A little irritation, a little clumpy and definitely flakes.</li>
    <li> Not irritating to sensitive eyes, beautiful, easy to apply, not runny or weak. Truly black! I actually recommend this on my beauty blog!</li>
    <li> Good wear, nice lash separation.  Dark color.  I wear this almost every day.  Has turned out to be my favorite mascara.</li>
    <li> I bought this with higher expectations from what I&#x27;ve read from the reviews. It clumps easily and if I take a different lash wand to seperate it, it takes away my length. Not a fan of this.</li>
    <li> Great for use during boating and swimming.  Must use makeup remover to remove. No clumps!!! Yay</li>
    <li> I already have a go-to everyday mascara that I have been wearing for years - unfortunately, my go-to is not waterproof.  I bought this mascara solely because it was waterproof, with good reviews to boot.  Well, not only was it NOT waterproof when I wore it on vacation, it was incredibly difficult to remove.  I had raccoon eyes in the pool with the tiniest amount of water splashed in my eyes , and even after I stopped wearing this mascara it took several days for it to fully wear off/not give me raccoon eyes while swimming!  Definitely disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why everyone loves this mascara!  What I&#x27;ve experienced is bad clumping on the first swipe making it impossible to apply a second coat.  Maybe it&#x27;s old or...........  Regardless of whether there was something wrong with my first purchase or not, I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> Love it. Easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This is the fresh mascara product, without the Drug Store price! So happy that I decided to try buying my makeup this way! Everytime I go to Walgreens it&#x27;s $100 ! So, this way I get months of makeup ahead for a fraction of the price!</li>
    <li> Super long lashes and waterproof! This is a favorite of mine. I wont be doing any more of these reviews because amazon requires them to be this long and i dont have this much i want to say about a tube of madcara.</li>
    <li> So far I really like it.  I have asian eyes and most mascaras rub off on my lids, but so far this does  not seem to transfer as much as the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after wearing this for a while i realized how much more it smudged. I had to downgrade the rating simply because it smeared and wasn&#x27;t good for me. I have monolid eyes and They smudge. Looks great going on but doesn&#x27;t last the day. For people with monolid eyes this won&#x27;t last. But I&#x27;m sure this would be fine for those that don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, and I have to say this product leaves &#x27;prestige&#x27; products in the dust. With mascara you have to decide on the look you want and then find a product that will give you that look. This is a daytime mascara, it&#x27;s not sooty thick, nor voluminous. It gives long silky, kinda spiky but in a cool way, lashes. I LOVE it for my bottom lashes because it doesn&#x27;t clump. I have this a few months now and I keep waiting for it to clump but it hasn&#x27;t, not even a little bit. It still goes on silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Now, sometimes we want a clumpy thick sooty lash, and I&#x27;ve even left tubes of mascara open to encourage the formula to thicken a little, this is not the product for that.This give a clean, sophisticated, thin but full (I know that sounds like a contradiction) I mean the lashes individually are thin but collectively they look full. I love the definition I get with this mascara and it never feels like too much for day time. You know how you start out wanting to do a simple day-time look but you grab the wrong mascara and you end up with lashes that are too much for day-time? This product won&#x27;t do that, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to try at least once. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Fantastic mascara. lengthens, thickens and stays put. This is by far the best I have used.</li>
    <li> I love the applicator on this. its my new favorite. I feel like it gives excellent coverage and doesn&#x27;t flake at all. really nice.</li>
    <li> This product is grate it makes my lashes soooo long and it last throughout the day without flaking. I would highly recommend this mascara!</li>
    <li> l love this mascara the best, and I have used many others. It gives a lot of coverage in just one coat without any clumping. It makes my lashes appear very long, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Not bad overall but a little gloppy for me, won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use waterproof often but I liked the way it went on better than my regular mascara. Had more fibers and my lashes looked fuller. However I layer my mascara and take lots of time to put on. Nice to have a good looking waterproof</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and this one is by far my favorite.  It lengthens my lashes so well. No clumps. Great price here on amazon too. Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> For being a fairly cheap mascara, I always try to have some in my kit. It is very solid performing, long lasting, and doesn&#x27;t leave dust on your under-eye area after hours of use.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find my favorite reasonably priced mascara here for greater than $2 less than at my local drug store!</li>
    <li> Long time user, Havent let me down</li>
    <li> Really nice, NOT clumpy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 years. I wish they would put &amp;#34;WATER PROOF&amp;#34; at the beginning of the description</li>
    <li> I have very short eyelashes and use a primer before I put on mascara. With this mascara after the primer I only need 2 coats to actually be able to see longer very pretty lashes. I&#x27;m satisfied with this.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. Use baby oil to remove.</li>
    <li> Great, un-clumpy mascara which seems to work just as advertised! So many mascaras advertise one thing and do not produce the goods or they dry out too fast and over-charge for what you get!&lt;br /&gt;So far - this mascara has lived up to its description!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a waterproof mascara that made my lashes longer, without plumping them into black gobs. I love the brush, it does just this--makes lashes look incredibly long and natural. I am a picky mascara person because I like my lashes to look nice, natural, and not fake. This does the job perfectly! It lengthens them and opens up my eyes without that obvious fake look that many mascaras produce. The brush is also narrow enough to use on those hard-to-get-at bottom lashes without making a big under-eye mess. So, if you want LONG lashes that look wonderful and accent your eyes rather than take away from them, try this mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None that I&#x27;ve found. As for mascara smelling, this one smells no better or worse than the rest of the bunch!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations, but I am so impressed with this mascara. It gives me long, beautifully defined lashes without clumps. It held up well in humid weather, too. I&#x27;ve put it on subscribe &amp; save.</li>
    <li> Love this Mascara and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It almost seemed as if the tube was empty.  It didn&#x27;t last very long and was just OK as a mascara goes.</li>
    <li> This mascara lengthens kind of but spreads lashes well... i saw someone else posted that they used this mascara as a base for a better mascara and Id have to agree as i have done the same. It smells odd too and does flake off... also the brush is very long and very straight and I often jab myself in the eye, its awkward to me. I&#x27;ve about used it to completion but I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful!....I love it...my eyelashes look longer....boyfriend thought I had on false lashes....lol.... (he hate false lashes)...😝</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years now and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Appearance-wise, this is probably one of the best mascaras I have tried. It had good separation, nice length, decent volume, and did not clump. It looked great throughout the day and there was no need to reapply as it did not fade (or flake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue I had with it came later in the day. I have a tendency to rub my eyes in the late afternoon, and when I did, I noticed my eyelashes felt tacky/gooey, like the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; element used was oil based. With the tackiness, my lashes stuck together a bit after the rubbing. It was also hell to get off. I washed my face before bed and followed up with a warm Q-Tip with soap after because it wasn&#x27;t coming off under my eyes. I could&#x27;t get the top lashes to come clean at all. I went to sleep and when I woke up my eyes were smudged wit mascara. Before showering I took another soapy Q-Tip and it was completely black before I showered. AFTER the shower, they were smudged again. Another completely back Q-Tip later, I finally got it off - after 2 face washes and 3 Q-Tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my lashes looked great and I might use it again, but definitely NOT as a daily mascara. Way too much work to clean it up.</li>
    <li> this is amazing dosnt do scary spiderweb look never smudges and i have very dry eyes and it dosnt bother me that much my tube is prob 3 years old and still works good lol altho i should prob throw it out my only complaint is that its not cruelty free witch makes me sad</li>
    <li> This mascara is not messy and it has an easy to use brush.  quick and simple mascara.  easy to remove too.</li>
    <li> Good mascara to wear in vacation!</li>
    <li> My favorite cheap mascara! I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive designer brands, I still consistently go back to this cheapie. Long wearing and is actually waterproof for long lasting wear without smudging. Holds the curl nicely.</li>
    <li> This mascara is excellent.  I read the reviews and one stood out for me because I&#x27;m part Native American and have very straight eyelashes:  an Asian woman who also has very straight eyelashes loved it.  Her review is so perfect I can&#x27;t add anything else!  Find her detailed review - its all true!</li>
    <li> I find that it clumps ....not sure why people say that it doesn&#x27;t....</li>
    <li> Maybelline Lash Stiletto has a brush that grabs just enough of the mascara that it really covers on the first coat!  It is a good quality mascara or it wouldn&#x27;t be able to do this, either.  The brush distributes the mascara without clumping the lashes together.  They have a good deal more volume and look a good deal longer.  This is one of the better drug-store brand mascaras I have tried.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> black waterproof mascara. not spectacular.will not reorder</li>
    <li> I do like this mascara. I use it along with Great Lash, and it helps my short lashes look longer. The black color is just right, and really brings out my eyes.</li>
    <li> it smudges very easily - raccoon eyes before 10:00am</li>
    <li> Best mascara on the market.</li>
    <li> This is a solid everyday mascara. The waterproof is mostly waterproof--though when it starts to come off (like after being wet), it clumps off in tiny pieces. Still, it lasts a solid 12 hours when dry, and it definitely makes lashes longer than any drugstore mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> Like fakes is not like maybelline, bad quality</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara, and I have tried just about all of the over the counter brands.  It goes on easily and is not prone to clump.  It makes my lashes look longer, and the brush separates the lashes well.  I prefer brushes with shorter bristles so I can get to the base of my lashes easily.  I have tried the brushes with the rubber looking bristles, and they just don&#x27;t go on like this does.  And it is waterproof....some other waterproof mascaras smudge a lot, but this one does not.</li>
    <li> Really good mascara for the price. I switched over from a much more expensive brand that rhymes with &amp;#34;hambone&amp;#34; (lol) because this is mire waterproof than the $28 one at the Macy&#x27;s &amp;#34;hambone&amp;#34; cosmetic counter!&lt;br /&gt;This stays on through a good laugh, sneezes,  or crying.  Very good product in the waterproof formula.</li>
    <li> Sorry.... I soooo wanted to love this product but i just don&#x27;t. It does nothing at all for my lashes. Total waste of money. Can this be returned?</li>
    <li> I have very light thin lashes and this goes on very light and makes my lashes longer and just a bit thicker.  Does not go on clumpy like some mascaras.  Is light as a feather and looks natural on!!</li>
    <li> This is absolutely my favorite mascara.  I&#x27;m half Asian and my eyelashes are consequently stick-straight and grown at a downward angle.  This mascara holds my eyelashes in a curl once I&#x27;ve curled them, and darkens, lengthens and slightly thickens my thin lashes.  It&#x27;s a non-clumpy formula and you can add a second coat for dramatic effect without making a mess.  You need an oil-based formula to remove it. I actually just use grapeseed oil.</li>
    <li> I have used this mascara for years now and it is all that it says it is.  I hope Maybelline never stops making it!</li>
    <li> I really love this mascara! Doesn&#x27;t clump up and makes my lashes look long and natural.</li>
    <li> Took bout three days to deliver&amp;process order. The regular ones are too expensive. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this one online. Bought 2 for $15 ish whereas if you go to stores its $10.50 per one.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras because I have asian lashes that are thick and go straight down so it is hard for me to find a formula that keeps my lashes curled up. I&#x27;ve tried a good mix of different brands (maybelline, covergirl, Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome, Missha, etc) and I&#x27;ve had the best luck with this mascara keeping my lashes curled and pretty for the longest amount of time. I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s not really waterproof. My eyes water a lot so I always try to buy waterproof but then again, I&#x27;ve yet to use a waterproof mascara that is completely waterproof</li>
    <li> It comes out clumpy on my eye lashes. I have never had this problem with this brand before.</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara. I have very short lashes and this stuff makes so you can see my lashes</li>
    <li> I have stiff eyelashes that don&#x27;t normally hold the curl when I curl my eyelashes. I&#x27;ve found that waterproof mascaras like this one help to hold the curl longer. I think this mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t give me spidery lashes, which is a plus for me. It&#x27;s also fairly easy to do multiple layers to make your lashes look thicker. I do notice that if I&#x27;m not careful and touch my eyes, that the mascara will start to flake.</li>
    <li> This mascara definitely makes my lashes look longer and the waterproof staying power is great. Unfortunately, it clumps very easily making it difficult to apply. More often than not, I am not happy with the way it looks. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> love this mascara. makes your eye lashes longer. My mom and granddaughter even love it.</li>
    <li> Lash Stiletto lengthens and thickens without clumping if you&#x27;ve got the right technique.  It definitely gives my eyelashes the va-va-voom I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel that I have mascara on - almost a fake eyelash feeling.  I don&#x27;t mind it because it&#x27;s not an annoying feeling, it just lets me know my lashes are fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does eventually start to run, but I tend to \\&quot;eye-sweat\\&quot; and no waterproof eye make-up has withstood it, so it might be just me.  I just check it when I go to the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still love it!</li>
    <li> This is a decent mascara, but i noticed a bit of clumping.  It doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied and is pretty easy to use.  I&#x27;ll still use it, but probably switch to a different one next time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara to hold a curl on my stick straight lashes (need to use an eyelash curler first). It does smudge a bit under my eyes. But the curl doesn&#x27;t budge all day.</li>
