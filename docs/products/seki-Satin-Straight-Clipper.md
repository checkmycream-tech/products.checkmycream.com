      <li>As advertised, these clippers are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using clippers that came in a cheap set, and LOVED them, but  lost them...</li>

      <li>This is a fantastic clipper.</li>
      <li>These are great quality clippers that will probably last to the end of time.</li>
      <li>Seki Edge makes fantastic products.</li>
      <li>the brand is good but the larger size is better</li>
      <li>so it would be easy to handle with my big hands, but in general is the best I&#x27;ve found in many years.</li>
      <li>I original bought the curved ones and liked them so much I bought the for my toe nails.</li>
      <li>and your nails don&#x27;t even need to be filed after because it leaves a smooth clean edge.</li>

      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
      <li>They are certainly worth the money.</li>
      <li>you will probably want to buy a solid nail file as well, because these will leave you with the perfect cut, not some pressure laden tear, in other words, the nails once cut, will be sharper than you are used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow...my nails are super straight!</li>
      <li>Really good and really sharp.</li>
      <li>No tearing, no snapping, just genuine slicing in the most crisp manner possible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used!  I was hesitant to try it because it is expensive,  but it preforms so much better than the cheap clippers that it&#x27;s worth the price.  It &#x27;s definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> very hard to find straight nail clipper that dont rust, this nail clipper had narrow cut edge it help cut little bit at a time easy to control how much you cut, when you hold on your hand it had balance and control, when make a cut it just a straight cut you dont fell no vibration</li>
    <li> Nice sharp edges and cuts clean.  Would have prefer to get something that has a curved edge to cut curved nails.  Great product.</li>
    <li> i find the straight clipper to be better than the non straight, so i am no longer a user of the curb or non straight clipper. the seki is well made for its sharpness, i&#x27;ve used them in fingernails / toenails, by washing them thoroughly with soaps after using on toenails, simply to avoid contaminations.</li>
    <li> Already own two other Seki clippers, and swear by them. Bought these because I needed a good clipper with a smaller cutting edge for more precise trimming on small finger and toe nails, as well as nipping off hang nails and such. These definitely work, just like all Seki clippers. I have wasted more money on cheaper clippers from drug stores and department stores that broke and flew into pieces. Was tired of dodging shrapnel from chinese-made garbage. These clippers hold up to the rigors of clipping the thickest, hardest nails. Yes they cost a little more - but they are worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the straight across manicure - not round, not oval - squared. When I try to file them that way it&#x27;s very difficult to get them all the same lenghth, same shape, etc. Using this straight edge clipper, I get a perfect straight line. All I have to do is file the sharp corners a bit to blunt them, but other than that I only have to paint. I LOVE this. It&#x27;s great quality, has a good texture for grip and has lasted for over 6 months, being used about 3 times a month really well.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, excellent quality. I highly recommend these clippers. They are certainly worth the money.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality. They work great.</li>
    <li> Perfect as advertised.  Keep my toenails straight and in-grown nail-free.  Very sharp and smooth clipping.</li>
    <li> Finally found a fingernail clipper that works for me and does what it claims. It clips clean, is easy to handle, and I like the straight edge rather than curved or slanted. I&#x27;ve tried others, but this Seki fingernail clipper works best for me. Purchased through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have to cut my big toenail very straight to prevent in-grown nails and also because I love the look. These are perfect for getting a straight cut that is impossible with other clippers. They are very sharp and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers i have used. They feel nice and solid, heavy weight but at the same time shapely and small. I like the flat edge.</li>
    <li> Very sharp easy to use on a woman&#x27;s hands my girlfriend cuts my toe nails no problem and its also very nice made all stainless steel no regrets it would be nice to have a hole for a key ring  it is little  small  is easy to get lost i have to keep in its box all the time but i would buy it again  6/32/17 Lost it is hard to keep an eye on it because it does not have a hole for key ring i loved but is gone am not going to keep buying the same to keep losing it i will get something else with a hole</li>
    <li> I really like the straight edge on this clipper.  I only wish it were just a little bit longer!  A longer clipper would allow use on both finger and toe nails.  Now I need to buy another one to use on my toes.</li>
    <li> Wished I&#x27;d found them sooner!  I can trim some very delicate fingernails with these and they cut right through the first time, plus I have never wounded anyone - they don&#x27;t slip and cut the skin.  I actually liked them so much, I bought some additional models.</li>
    <li> Super sharp, and smooth</li>
    <li> High quality but small. Would not work easily on my gigantic toenails.</li>
    <li> Finally.  A straight-edged clipper so I can cut my nails (and my husband&#x27;s nails, and my kids&#x27; nails) the way they&#x27;re supposed to be cut and file them into shape.  If you&#x27;re prone to ingrowns or hangnails this is a definite must have.</li>
    <li> Is it possible to get excited about a nail clipper?  Yes, it&#x27;s possible.  I bought this specifically for the straight edge because I like to do my nails into a rounded square.  With this clipper I can do just that.  This cut so precisely it&#x27;s like cutting into jello.  Before, I always cut my nails after I shower so that they are easily to cut.  You don&#x27;t have to with this clipper because it does all the work for you.  It&#x27;s too bad I didn&#x27;t discover this sooner.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers! they are made really well and have a straight edge so when you clip your nails it has a perfect  clean edge.</li>
    <li> These are the best clippers I have ever had. I have thick, strong nails and have no problem with my nails bending when I clip them. I will be giving this brand as stocking stuffers or for any little gift idea.</li>
    <li> Seki city is to Japan as Soligen is to Germany for knives.  Seki has a long history of sword manufacturing such as the samurai sword.  Ironically I make the analogy because I purchased a pair of toe clippers made by W&amp;uuml;sthof which she did like but was unhappy that unit had a curved blade.  This unit has a straight blade which I&#x27;m told is superior for cutting toe nails.  In addition she states the ease of use and cutting blade are better than the Wusthof&#x27;s at 1/2 the price.</li>
    <li> Seki Edge makes fantastic products. The quality is amazing. I do wish these were wider, but they work so well that the width just isn&#x27;t that much of an issue. In fact, the narrow width makes them easier to use on narrow toes.</li>
    <li> I really like these,  however these were purchased for my husband to use and whilst they are very easy to use and sharp they are very compact and petite.  I use and like them will need to purchase another pair that are on the large size for his hands.</li>
    <li> everyone needs a great nail clipper and this product works extremely well and also made extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;cratfmanship is excellent.</li>
    <li> never in my life what I have paid so much for a freaking clipper, well the company that makes this product also makes samurai swords...nuff said!</li>
    <li> By far the nicest nail clippers I&#x27;ve owned. I suspect I will not have to buy another for quite awhile. I wish though I had bought one that was a little wider.</li>
    <li> These nail clippers are great. It&#x27;s solid and heavy. The attachment where the lever meets the clippers are much more sturdy than clippers you find in a drug store. And the blades are very sharp. I&#x27;ll only buy Seki brand clippers from now on.</li>
    <li> Just like many people have mentioned, it is a little small, but sharp. I like it so far.</li>
    <li> I like them, but wish they were wider. You will need to navigate around your nail with a few clippings, so I would not have expectations of a single cut solution for your nails. So, they do end up slightly jagged as you round out the nail. Good quality, but the file is too recessed, and not so effective. Do like the small, portable size and form factor. They get 4 stars because they are sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men&#x27;s toes, I&#x27;d try to find a wider model.</li>
    <li> I always look for straight edge nail clippers but they always have those awful curved ones at the stores, and they end up making my nails look really bad. I love how with these clippers you get to decide the actual curve of your nails. It is super sharp and works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> This goes through nails with very little pressure. Does not leave any ragged edges. Perfect for achieving the square nail look. I have a problem with peeling nails after I cut them but this stopped that and your nails don&#x27;t even need to be filed after because it leaves a smooth clean edge.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best, and most expensive, clipper I&#x27;ve purchased. But it is worth it. It is a little smaller than I thought but it does the job cutting through thick nails much better than larger plier like clipper I have. Yes it takes a few more passes for the smaller bits it takes, but I get a straight cut with no tears, compared to one pass but almost always a tear or nip on something.</li>
    <li> not really for toenail clipping too small and very sharp. a waste of money. the brand is good but the larger size is better</li>
    <li> Wow...my nails are super straight! These are great quality clippers that will probably last to the end of time. Thanks</li>
    <li> Recommended clipper for your nails. This is a straight edge clipper, which is better cause you can trim your nails the way you want. The curved ones are sometimes difficult to cut around the corners of your nails.</li>
    <li> Love these! So sharp. Would have rated 5 stars if they had a nail catcher (they have another model with a nail catcher but it doesn&#x27;t have the straight clip)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty, too. As I&#x27;ve aged, my nails have gotten thicker and harder, and I really hate that curved clippers are never really curved in such a manner to cut my nails properly. Besides, they kind of snap the nails off, causing the cuttings to fly across the room, endangering anybody entering the room. I have to wear goggles cutting my toenails to avoid shrapnel blindness. These cutters, aside from the endearing straight cutting edge, has absolutely the sharpest cutting jaws I&#x27;ve ever seen. They just cut smoothly through the nails without them flying around and there is no snapping as the nails fly off. I don&#x27;t know how they work this, but this is exactly the way nails should be cut. A little pricey (not much, though), but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These clippers work Great. Excellent and easy cut but very small handles which slip out of your hands while using.</li>
    <li> This is a serious clipper and it is sharp.  We like it but be sure you don&#x27;t get skin in it as it does what it is intended.</li>
    <li> Can we say sharp? These nail clippers are no joke. They deserve a place in every manicurists drawer.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to spend extra money on grooming tools, as the saying goes &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. These clippers are high quality and I don&#x27;t see why the wouldn&#x27;t last a very long time.</li>
    <li> The best clipper you will ever use. The clip through all nails with ease. They are expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Well made, work great, and a big improvent over your typical 99 cent nail clippers.</li>
    <li> These cut cotton great for my vaping</li>
    <li> Love these. Very sharp. High quality. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Seki.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and do not need a lot of &amp;#34;pressure&amp;#34; to operate. I love the way they work. My only regret is that they are not &amp;#34;larger&amp;#34; and I have to &amp;#34;maneuver&amp;#34; my way around each nail multiple times. These seem to be for smallish fingernails and not designed for a 6 ft guy.</li>
    <li> Finally found a good sharpened clipper that works on the first cut without too much effort. I wish it was a little big bigger so it would be easy to handle with my big hands, but in general is the best I&#x27;ve found in many years.</li>
    <li> The best nail clipper ever, i don&#x27;t usually(this is the first time) make reviews but because of the nature of this product you might be wondering if this nail clipper it&#x27;s worth buying it, the answer is yes!!</li>
    <li> these are very sharp and cut very clean. very high quality product. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Really good and really sharp. The edge is straight and you are not supposed to used curved clippers. Straight edges are hard to find. This solves that problem and they&#x27;re the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I had my doubts, but this cuts very well and it is precise.  Great product, wish I could say the same about their tweezers</li>
    <li> the only thing is that it is too narrow.  About a centimeter, I think. I have to add six words.</li>
    <li> I original bought the curved ones and liked them so much I bought the for my toe nails. Theses are very high quality and very sharp. These actually cut through the nail. There not as wide as normal toe nail clippers only about 1/2 in wide perfect for what I was looking for highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Was very impressed by the quality and build. it&#x27;s a little on the narrow size, but apart from that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> A++++++. Super fast shipping and a great deal!  Thank you!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just got these and they seem to be as good as they purport to be.  I hate dull or cheap clippers.  These are neither of those, and seem to get lots of areas other clippers miss.  They clip dead skin well, too...but be careful.  They are sharp.  Of course, that&#x27;s what you want, right?  The first time I used them on my toenails, I couldn&#x27;t believe all the stuff that clipped off.  NICE!</li>
    <li> Excellent quality with sharp edges that cut through the hardest finger nails. I think it&#x27;s too small for toe nails however</li>
    <li> very nice quality ,exactly what i wanted with straight edge</li>
    <li> Quality, great leverage for cutting a big guys toenails.</li>
    <li> Works as it should. Sharp &amp; sturdy.</li>
    <li> Slim and smooth looking.  It&#x27;s a little more than some other clippers but I just like the way this one looks.  Got just what I wanted, works great.</li>
    <li> Very sharp they make clean cuts without leaving rough edges!  They last for a long time.  I have bought a few Seki clippers over the years. It has been to replace lost ones not because they break or dull.  I also own the curved ones and both of them are great!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot although the bottom jaw could be made thinner. I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived intact, very sharp, gets the job done, almost don&#x27;t need to file your nails after a clipping...hope the blades stay sharp over time.</li>
    <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever used. They are very sharp and have a nice weight to them. The straight cut is perfect for toenails. I&#x27;m happy to throw away all my sub-standard clippers from the drugstore.</li>
    <li> The instrument is ergonomic and the cutting edge is truly sharp.  Does not break the nails when you clip.  Highly recommended; good value for the money.</li>
    <li> no rust, or problems.  does what it is made for.  it does not chip my nails.  sturdy.  very good quality.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap China Clones this high quality product from Japan is head and shoulders above the competition.  I made the mistake of buying a cheaper version here on Amazon and wished I&#x27;d ordered this on first.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and it&#x27;s still clipping like it&#x27;s brand new. Razor sharp, super-precise. I&#x27;m looking into getting another one for my car and maybe even another one for my guitar case.</li>
    <li> As others have said, this clipper is well-designed. It has an easy, smooth mechanism, and it&#x27;s sharp.&lt;br /&gt;But, our more accurate rating would be 4.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s so effective, you need to be a bit careful. If you are in a hurry or unfocused, you could get some sharp angles on your nails. In other words, you might spend a bit more time filing to obtain really smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Truly the best clippers I have ever owned. You will never turn back. These clippers are more than worse the investment.</li>
    <li> IT IS SO HARD TO FIND STRAIGHT EDGE NAIL CLIPPERS. These are very well-made,of high quality solid construction. They are fingernail clippers in my estimation (which is what I was hoping for) though the description is not clear. If there is any negative, it might be that their width may be too small for some (approximately 3/8&amp;#34;). All in all I am greatly satisfied and thankful for these clippers.</li>
    <li> It made something that I was not crazy about (trimming nails) a lot easier.  It cuts right&lt;br /&gt;where you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never spent this much money for a fingernail clipper before but when I lost my little cheap one and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, I decided to buy one online.  This is the greatest find for me because it is extremely sharp. In addition, since the clipper has a straight edge instead of a curved one, you can sculpt your nail anyway you&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> Great quality fast delivery</li>
    <li> Cuts finger nails and toe nails like butter.No splitting. Very high quality stainless steel. Like a Samurai Sword. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly BETTER than expected. Paramount quality, so easy and effortless to cut the nails, very nice looking.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, I am used to &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; Trim cutters and it was a nice surprise to receive this one.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic clipper. Straight edge is nice. But I am sure the quality is equivalent on all of the other models. I have never used a proper clipper like this before. It cuts through it like butter. You will not regret this purchase. If you&#x27;re reading this, buy it now. Seems to be solid construction, can&#x27;t imagine I will buy another nail clipper in my lifetime lest I lose this thing. I know I am talking about a nail clipper, but seriously, this will change the those five minutes of your life per week that you spend clipping your nails. Not to mention, continued use of a flat tip like this will eventually help your nails to grow properly into the beautiful tips they should be. No tearing, no snapping, just genuine slicing in the most crisp manner possible. Note: you will probably want to buy a solid nail file as well, because these will leave you with the perfect cut, not some pressure laden tear, in other words, the nails once cut, will be sharper than you are used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY this product. Stop living with crappy nail clippers and the crappy nails those create.</li>
    <li> This is my second straight edge seki trimmer.  I have one to a friend to trim the claws of two kittens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the straight edge but it is not for everyone. it is quite small but suits me fine. it is also very sharp and the edge holds up very well after two years. I also use it to trim my cat&#x27;s claws and its sharpness is a big plus as it does not crack the claw.</li>
    <li> Well made and much better than anything you&#x27;d find at a drugstore. Good quality, looks like it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
    <li> I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth. I also had trouble finding clippers that would work in my hands with some very bad nerve tremors. I had bought individual clippers, sets of grooming tools, specialty clippers and items, and all sorts of things, all to no avail. I took a chance when I saw these Seki Edge clippers, and I could tell immediately I did not go wrong. First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness makes a huge difference! They are aligned well, which eliminates the spurs and uneven spots. The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. I let my wife try them out, and she loved them. I watched over her as she used them, took them back from her immediately, hid them from her, and am buying a set of them for her for her birthday at the end of this month. All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> The straight edge sucks. Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
    <li> If you use a straight edge, the nails won&#x27;t break off as easily.  A curvy clipper bends the nail, and if you have thin nails they will break more easily.  This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Precise cutting, easy to handle, very well made. Wish I would&#x27;ve bought these a long time ago instead of wasting money on the cheaper clippers trying to find a pair that actually cut properly.</li>
    <li> smooth straight clipper.. wasnt expecting the file on the handle</li>
    <li> How do the ones at Walmart even continue to be manufactured? This one is actually sharp enough to cut and not shatter my toe nails. and finger nails. I think I will get the larger one for the big toe.</li>
    <li> Love that it is straight. Although I would only use this for toe nails...</li>
    <li> As advertised, these clippers are very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using clippers that came in a cheap set, and LOVED them, but  lost them...&lt;br /&gt;Everything I had tried over the past couple of months did a hack job on my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo.... off to Amazon to see what others thought were good clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These got mixed reviews, but generally favorable, so I bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them, but due to the sharpness, and the narrower cutting width than I was used too, I have had to redo my clipping technique quite a bit.  Smaller, more nuanced cutting is key here.&lt;br /&gt;Minor cuticle/hang nails have disappeared, likely because I am not taking off so much nail at one time now, but rather performing light, accurate maintenance clips a couple of times a week, and again, the sharpness may be less traumatic to the cuticle area of the nail than the cheapos I was using prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approach with caution if you aren&#x27;t accustomed to very sharp clippers; take your time and pay attention to what you&#x27;re doing, and these work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice to hold &amp; well made.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what he emery board like surface on the top of the clipping lever is intended for.  It works in a pinch to smooth out any rough edges, but not really useful or ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy so far!</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and cut great. They are difficult to get into tight spaces if you have a lot of skin around the edges of your toenails or whatnot. Still pretty good product if you are looking for a straight edge clipper.</li>
    <li> Super sharp. Super ergonomic. Excellent pseudo-emery board. I only wish this same company made another model of these about 50% to 100% wider. But these are your typical size nail clippers, and I absolutely love them.</li>
