### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>great price!</li>
      <li>Amazing shampoo!!  </li>
      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>Thought I was getting a good Deal.</li>
      <li>A good purchase.</li>
      <li>and this is a more milky color but still works great.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck than some others if I purchased from Amazon fulfillment itself.</li>
      <li>However, in my latest purchase which arrived 10/22/14</li>
      <li>I liked the American Crew Stimulating Conditioner</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
      <li>so I bought this Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and certainly was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>The other one didn&#x27;t say &#x27;moisturizing&#x27;, so I am sure that is the difference.</li>
      <li>If you have a thicker and more coarse hair type and don&#x27;t mind smelling of this new scent, then this new formulation may possibly work for you.  </li>
      <li>Quality,  Economical, Instant shipping, AAA +++</li>
      <li>You only need a little bit and it lathers up nicely.</li>
      <li>The new formula is watered down &amp; smells like cheap $2 dollar shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I was using a Crew shampoo that was clear</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these American Crew products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Beware of new formulation with this product, and as there is no mention of it in the description and as it is now a completely different product than what I have been using for around 20 years now (the ingredients read differently on the back of the new and old bottles and \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; printed under the name \\&quot;Crew\\&quot; is the old formula).  </li>
      <li>The shampoo I buy like this from the salon is clear and this shampoo is white...</li>
      <li>My hair type is fine and thinning, and where previously this shampoo cleansed my hair gently and gave it volume with a nice smell, it now weighs my hair down heavily and with a new awful smell of cedar and menthol, and smells like cheap booze even.  </li>

<li> I guess they thought no one would notice the foreign shampoo in the same bottle.  </li>
<li> This is obviously a very weak attempt to make higher profits &amp; burn the American people.  </li>
<li> The texture and consistency of this product used to be silky/clear, and now thick and solid white.  </li>
<li> there&#x27;s some other shampoo inside....</li>
<li> Not a first time user, so it says it all</li>
<li> It&#x27;s watered down.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this expensive product as the formula has been changed and it is only half as good as it use to be.&lt;br /&gt;I should receive a double refund</li>
<li> I agree with the other reviewers -- this is clearly not genuine Crew shampoo.</li>
<li> The scent, texture and color were all wrong - the shampoo in the bottle had clearly been replaced with something cheaper!!</li>
<li> But even worse, the shampoo in the bottle was clearly not the correct shampoo.</li>
<li> Not sure what I got</li>
<li> You will not go wrong with American Crew!</li>
<li> Not sure I&#x27;ll buy from here again.</li>
<li> I would use bar soap for shampoo before I purchased 1 more bottle of this pathetic product.  </li>
<li> Saw a lot of negative reviews on this - I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
<li> the lid was the wrong size and did not fit on the bottle, so the shampoo had leaked.</li>
<li> Very disappointed that I will have to change brands since nothing, to me, beats the scent and feel of Crew Classic.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will ask for a refund.</li>

    <li> Not sure what I got but it doesn&#x27;t seem right. It&#x27;s watered down. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy from here again.</li>
    <li> Not a first time user, so it says it all</li>
    <li> The shampoo I buy like this from the salon is clear and this shampoo is white... It&#x27;s definitely not the same! The label all looks the same so I have a feeling there&#x27;s some other shampoo inside....</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo!!  You only need a little bit and it lathers up nicely. You will not go wrong with American Crew!</li>
    <li> Saw a lot of negative reviews on this - I don&#x27;t know why. I was using a Crew shampoo that was clear and this is a more milky color but still works great.  The other one didn&#x27;t say &#x27;moisturizing&#x27;, so I am sure that is the difference.</li>
    <li> This has to be a knock-off. I have used crew shampoo for years. It doesn&#x27;t smell correct and the color is white. Do not waste your money. Thought I was getting a good Deal.</li>
    <li> I liked the American Crew Stimulating Conditioner so I bought this Daily Moisturizing Shampoo and certainly was not disappointed.  I especially like the 33.8oz Value Size as it saves me money.  I highly recommend these American Crew products.&lt;br /&gt;RGRUNIG&lt;br /&gt;Lake Wales, FL</li>
    <li> Great product...great price!</li>
    <li> Bottle arrived leaked all over the box. Did not smell like American Crew it was a milky white never saw that before been using this product for years.</li>
    <li> Quality,  Economical, Instant shipping, AAA +++</li>
    <li> Beware of new formulation with this product, and as there is no mention of it in the description and as it is now a completely different product than what I have been using for around 20 years now (the ingredients read differently on the back of the new and old bottles and \\&quot;Classic\\&quot; printed under the name \\&quot;Crew\\&quot; is the old formula).  The texture and consistency of this product used to be silky/clear, and now thick and solid white.  My hair type is fine and thinning, and where previously this shampoo cleansed my hair gently and gave it volume with a nice smell, it now weighs my hair down heavily and with a new awful smell of cedar and menthol, and smells like cheap booze even.  If you have a thicker and more coarse hair type and don&#x27;t mind smelling of this new scent, then this new formulation may possibly work for you.  Just not me, and I have already moved on to another product to replace it.</li>
    <li> Was hoping I&#x27;d have better luck than some others if I purchased from Amazon fulfillment itself. Nope. Milky white stink syrup that others had a problem with. Very disappointed that I will have to change brands since nothing, to me, beats the scent and feel of Crew Classic.</li>
    <li> The American Crew Moisturizing Shampoo cleans the hair and aids in combing into place after the shower. A good purchase.</li>
    <li> DO NOT PURCHASE!! Have been buying this shampoo from Amazon for my husband for years and he loves it. However, in my latest purchase which arrived 10/22/14 the lid was the wrong size and did not fit on the bottle, so the shampoo had leaked. But even worse, the shampoo in the bottle was clearly not the correct shampoo. The scent, texture and color were all wrong - the shampoo in the bottle had clearly been replaced with something cheaper!! Do not purchase and make the same mistake!</li>
    <li> This is not the same shampoo as before.  The new formula is watered down &amp; smells like cheap $2 dollar shampoo.  This is obviously a very weak attempt to make higher profits &amp; burn the American people.  I would use bar soap for shampoo before I purchased 1 more bottle of this pathetic product.  I guess they thought no one would notice the foreign shampoo in the same bottle.  People aren&#x27;t that ignorant.  It should be a punishable crime to lie to the public like they have.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this expensive product as the formula has been changed and it is only half as good as it use to be.&lt;br /&gt;I should receive a double refund</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewers -- this is clearly not genuine Crew shampoo. This is not even the quality of pantene. I&#x27;m disappointed and will ask for a refund. DO NOT BUY!</li>
