<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> came fine. good clippers.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but the trimmer is not that sharp for line ups.</li>
    <li> I had another Wahl clipper that lasted for 16 years so I wanted to stick with them. This one seems to be as well made as the old one so I&#x27;m hoping it lasts as long. The smaller battery powered one doesn&#x27;t have quite as much power, but the smaller size makes it easier to trim body hair.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Love these clippers and the trimmers are an added bonus.  Nice set.</li>
    <li> Very good quality. The cordless trimmer is an excellent add on</li>
    <li> Requires more than one pass to remove unwanted hair.</li>
    <li> They are not durable and takes forever to cut hair.  You definitely get what you pay for....disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good product, straightforward heavy clippers.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking for a beard trimmer, and also need a new hair clipper but wasn&#x27;t a priority. I was apprehensive to get a rechargeable trimmer because of needing to use it and not being charged when the battery is run down. I came across this set which is perfect and well priced. The trimmer uses 2 AA batteries, which are good for about 3 weeks with my average use of 2 to 3 times a week (and a lot longer if you use them until they die). The clipper is great and has a good assortment of attachment combs.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive Haircutting Kit…  But if you have a course hair, then be careful when using it and move it slowly through your hair (especially if your hair is little long), as hair tend to bunch-up in the cutters which is quite painful (ouch!).  The snap-on trim pieces are also hard on the scalp... The battery powered beard-trimmer in the kit works great both on the beard as well as to do touch-ups around the ear and neck areas.  It is made in the US, which is great!  Support US Made Products!</li>
    <li> Lots of accessories included. The small battery powered clippers are handy for trimming. The main clippers lack cutting power, even when oiled and adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much from consumer grade hair clippers?</li>
    <li> this one works as stated.. granted I have only used it 2 times, myself and my son, but it seems pretty durable.. and if all else fails,, walmart carries the same one.. so i&#x27;ll exchange it :)</li>
    <li> My puppy is looking good....</li>
    <li> This product is unusable. The clippers vibrate so badly that it hurts to put against skin. As other reviewers have noted, they are painfully loud, (I literally put in ear plugs the first time I tried these.) There is an adjustment screw on one side which can be used to reduce the vibration and blade noise, but resulted in the blades not cutting hair, and smoke coming from the clippers. I own another pair of Wahl clippers (color coded), and was very pleased with those, until they were lost during a move. These clippers, however, are a waste of money. I am very disappointed in Wahl for selling such a low quality product. The clippers I received are useless.</li>
    <li> 2nd Wahl product. Works great. Use both trimmers. Very nice to have smaller trimmer too. Only had the regular one before</li>
    <li> great set at a great deal</li>
    <li> I am not a barber, but I have used Andis and more expensive Wahl products in the past. This Wahl is non-prof grade, but with the ability to deliver. The blade was sharp (Clipper) on first use. However, the trimmer isn&#x27;t as sharp as I will like, but I have no complaints as I know it isn&#x27;t going to deliver the quality of a $70 Andis trimmer. Good product for a guy in the desert seeking to maintain a neat appearance. I also like that it came with a hard plastic case, which makes it easy to carry and for storage.</li>
    <li> found the price was didn&#x27;t match the product level it was returned&lt;br /&gt;intended use would have been to do weekly hair cuts for 3 boys this product would not have withstood that not for the price they were asking for.</li>
    <li> nice product, much heavier and better quality then i expected for the price</li>
    <li> The construction of the smaller clipper is very chinsey. The corded model is solid and VERY quiet. Comes with many attachments and a case that actually holds them all! The small clipper is battery operated. I would like have had a rechargable.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s quiet and sharp enough for a great cut. I loved all the accessories also. I bought this as a fathers day gift and he really likes it, but says the small trimmers don&#x27;t work well for him. Overall, it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> Loved them at first but even with us taking care of them, there is rust starting to form on the blades.</li>
    <li> I love this item!  The trimmer that is included is awesome for quick touch ups, and the different types of blade guides makes the cutter perfect for just about any length desired.  I would absolutely refer this item to my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for 2 1/2 years, and they&#x27;re still working great! I use the battery-operated groomer as a shaver and a beard and hair trimmer. It alone was worth it.</li>
    <li> Does not last long. Get dull quickly. Had to buy replacement 3 month later.</li>
    <li> Love this set! cuts hair with no issues the little set works on facial and manscaping projects! great set!! highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The razor and all of it&#x27;s parts were very easy to use. Now we are looing good and saving money at the same time.</li>
    <li> Ordered on 9/9/2011 everything worked wonderfully for me until last week the power clippers finally seized up and failed. No I do not attribute this to worksmanship or poor quality. It is because people in my home not knowing how to properly care for the clippers. I absolutely love the kit, and since my first set has died after a few hundred hair cuts (total savings of probably $1000-2000 in haircuts) I&#x27;d say they paid for themselves. Time to reorder!!!! Lasted four years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good good good buy!</li>
    <li> Smaller clippers DOA. Larger ones were fine.</li>
    <li> Sent it back. Battery powered trimmer was a bummer</li>
    <li> I have saved a fortune cutting my father&#x27;s hair with this tool.  He has been complimented on his haircuts and I am not a professional, just his daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this set for my Fiance&#x27; as a birthday present and he loves it. It contains everything he needs to keep his hair cut short and his mustache with goatee looking fantastic. He loves how easy the trimmers are to use and loves to use the smaller clippers for quick touch-ups or while traveling. I would expect nothing but a well made product from Wahl and they did not let us down.</li>
    <li> Cordless trimmer is ok, the rest is great</li>
    <li> Yes, I would purchase again. Good value for the money.</li>
    <li> Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Haircutting Kit, Yellow/black, 22 Count arrived as expected.  Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Haircutting Kit, Yellow/black, 22 Count is a professional grooming kit, cuts very smooth and close, many guards  for different cuts,and smaller one for trimming your mustache and all at a great price.  Great value for the money.</li>
    <li> Much better than Andis clippers, small trimmer very powerful</li>
    <li> Loce this product nce I fugered out how to use them they worked great now I cut my noys and husbands hair with no problem</li>
    <li> These are great..  I use them on my son all the time.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time and as described.</li>
    <li> ALL IS FINE. GOOD SET OF CLIPPERS.</li>
    <li> There are sufficient supplements to make designed hair cut. Powerful hair cutter for easy cutting and useful trimmer. Recommended for home users.</li>
    <li> Professional.  These. Are the best trimmers I ever had.</li>
    <li> picece of s*** cheap asscs*** ðont buy i konow its a good deal and the package comes good donts but plastic</li>
    <li> arrived fast and works great thanks</li>
    <li> With the smaller trimmer</li>
    <li> Works well. My son asked for this for Christmas and has only used it a few times, but has not had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> Great real sharp cut like butter</li>
    <li> Love these clippers, brought them to start cutting my son&#x27;s hair. The directions explain everything and have options for clippers to how low you want to cut the persons hair. It was my first time using clippers and I feel comfortable cutting my sons hair and my son is OK with me using them on his head. No complaints on price or product.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with quality of this item, especially for the price! The item arrived so quickly and I used it immediately, cut just like the professional ones in the salons.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this clipper pair.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the battery powered clippers to really work, but have been pleasantly surprised.  I don&#x27;t know about how long they will last, but the first impressions are very good.</li>
    <li> Works great and is high quality, especially considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product to anyone out there in the market!</li>
    <li> Where a product is made is very important to me. I was surprised to see that this is an American made shaver. I waited until it came in the mail just to make sure it said &#x27;made in America&#x27; on it and it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a replacement for a Andis model:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Andis-Speedmaster-Adjustable-Clipper-24145/dp/B0029XVT2O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_16?s&#x3D;hpc&amp;srs&#x3D;2528930011&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1419214906&amp;sr&#x3D;1-16&amp;keywords&#x3D;andis+clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Andis one is more expensive, made in China, and one of the major components broke to where I couldn&#x27;t repair it. They say that the Andis one runs cool, but it would get piping hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got this Wahl shaver and have only used it one time. I can say that the haircut looked a lot better with the American made Wahl, then the Chinese made Andis, and it runs a lot cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair short, so it costs me a lot less to buy a groomer than it does to go to a barber every month.</li>
    <li> Wow! two for one can&#x27;t beat that, one thing that the smaller one need battery to us it.</li>
    <li> excellent, responsible</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good choice according to quality and the price.</li>
    <li> The product was exactly what I ordered.  New item and delivered on time.  I will purchase again from this seller. It&#x27;s great for someone personal use.  I have even bought as Father&#x27;s Day gift for family</li>
    <li> Received quickly. Used already everything seems good so far.</li>
    <li> Sealed packaging but the product is damaged. The cutter was not alligned straight. The blade is diagonal so the cutting is not even.</li>
    <li> Mi pedido lleg&amp;oacute; al tiempo previamente convenido con el vendedor por lo cual lo recomiendo ampliamente. Estoy satisfecho completamente con mi compra. Muchas Gracias......!!!  ;-)</li>
    <li> Love the trimmer that came with it!! Excellent for the common man!!</li>
    <li> The Clippers cuts ok but I like my head shaved all the way to zero. The clippers gets me very low just have to find out how to adjust them. The battery clippers are a waist of my time, I couldn&#x27;t even give them away if I tried that&#x27;s batteries go low with in 1 cut</li>
    <li> These work great and they are quiet it I had oster before which is twice the price and these are just as good along with the small battery clipper and all the attachments can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> To loud, blade didnt sit straight on main clippers.  Trimmer didn&#x27;t turn on had to open it up and adjust the switch.  Highly dissapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Haircutting Kit to begin cutting my fiance&#x27;s hair. I had never cut anyone&#x27;s hair before, and the step-by-step guide really helped. The combs are numbered for an easy, straight-forward haircutting experience! For the money, you really can&#x27;t beat it... and I think it&#x27;s of an excellent quality. Great product!</li>
    <li> Wahl knows what they are doing. This is a very powerful cutter. Cuts smooth and fast. With lots of extras and great case.</li>
    <li> Ok....  Cuts different than the others I have owned. I might need to get used to them.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Nice and sharp. Plenty of attachments.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great price.</li>
    <li> Very loud clipper set, cuts alright but sometimes when you put different clips on it makes weird noises which bugs, rather get a different set of clippers.</li>
    <li> these are a nice home hair cutting kit. all of the components seemed to be good quality. Clippers are made in USA trimmers are Chinese, but worked just fine on AA rechargeables.</li>
    <li> Works great easy to use. GreAt price.</li>
    <li> Kit arrived with a broken comb, so we were not happy at first.  We called Wahl and they sent a new piece immediately.  The sizing doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same as with other groom kits we&#x27;ve had in the past, it&#x27;s slightly different.  Overall, we do like how it works,</li>
    <li> I love the Wahl brand, been using Wahl trimmers for over 10 years.  My last one was the color version, it was great.  Only reason I went with this one is because it came with the smaller battery trimmer for $5 more.  Use both regularly about once a week, love them.</li>
    <li> After my 10 year old trusty Oster took a nasty fall onto the tile and broke half way through my haircut I put a hat on and went out looking for a replacement clipper. I picked this set up at a major retailer because it said Made in the USA, was one of the more expensive kits on the shelf, and i found out Oster no longer made budget clippers like my old ones. They finished the job but the whole kit felt cheap and did not give a very good cut. They were both very noisy and the little trimmer was 100% made in china. Not sure how they could put USA on the box... Anyways this kit is going back to the store. I bit the bullet and bought a set of Oster classic 76 clippers from Amazon. I wish I had done that years ago. There is no comparison to this junk. Spend your hard earned money once and be done with it. For hair clippers you really do get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit to replace my Oster clipper kit that I&#x27;ve had for 20 years as the blades finally wore down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this, I saw some reviews that said the clippers were cheap, or low quality, and I have to disagree 100%. Granted, these aren&#x27;t the $200+ kind that professionals use, but for the home user, they&#x27;re awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having all the guard sizes is great as it gives me flexibility to change the length of my son&#x27;s hair by season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery powered beard trimmer is a great addition to this kit and I use it frequently because of how handy it is and how long the batteries last in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of any other setup you could possibly find that is as comprehensive, high quality with a low price like this one.</li>
    <li> Got this product for family and love it and will purchase this again if I need it. I would recommend it to the beginner hair stylist.</li>
    <li> It was great the first few times I used it, but the blades became dull very quickly, even keeping it clean. After I got them sharpened it actually started to not cut because of the power just not being there. The small one has been the only one that&#x27;s worked for more than 3 haircuts.</li>
    <li> You get two high quality home razors with tons of attachments for a very low price. I Love the battery powered trimmer. It has impressive power for a battery operated device. The plug in hair cutter is solid, accurate, and has a professional feel to it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work in Europe even with a transformer.</li>
    <li> This work great and I can&#x27;t believe I got all of this for such a low price. This do exactly what I need them to do, taper my short haircut, line &amp; blend the back of my head which is shaved. These were more expensive in my local beauty store.</li>
    <li> Good price and a great product with lots of features.</li>
    <li> Yea for the price it&#x27;s awesome</li>
    <li> It cuts alright but very noisy</li>
    <li> Using monthly - keeps the fur down, I like the small one for &amp;#34;those&amp;#34; places.</li>
    <li> Got it for my husband after his old one broke.&lt;br /&gt;He loves it.&lt;br /&gt;He shaves his head almost completely (leaving only very tiny stubble). Its quiet and lightweight which is great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Not a precise cut but will do basic cut.  No fading quality.</li>
    <li> Plastic attachment don&#x27;t stay on properly falls off easily</li>
    <li> Very nice hair cut. But the smailler trimmer works with AA batteries, and I was not informed about and it does not cut that close to skin how I expect. The bigger one is great.</li>
    <li> It does the job. I gave three stars. Not five stars because I&#x27;ve had a cheaper less expensive brand do it quicker. It lasted three years. We&#x27;ll see how long this lasts...</li>
    <li> This was a great deal for the price and my husband is very happy with it.  A nice bonus came with the groomer, a cordless trimmer.</li>
    <li> They love it used them right away. Nice that you received the large clippers and the small one together. Great Buy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe you can buy such a comprehensive package at this price. It worth at least 100$.&lt;br /&gt;There are really 22 pieces inside including two electronic hair clippers, one of them needs two AA batteries. With small amounts of creativity, you can can break up with your barber soon :)</li>
    <li> Great product . Save time and money from going to barber .</li>
    <li> Nice to have the little trimmer too. A very complete kit. I like the case, which accommodates all the components with room to spare.</li>
    <li> Great clippers! Sharp cutting. Purchased another brand of clippers from Amazon and returned them for the Wahl clipper.</li>
    <li> very good product arrived in excellent condition thank you very much</li>
    <li> The clippers work great!!  They are exactly what I wanted.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love my new clipper set! It cuts through thick hair like butter! Like previous reviews, I agree that the attachments are lower quality, but are manageable. I am so impressed with the quality--especially at this price!</li>
    <li> With these my wife became a good barber for me</li>
    <li> The Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro It&#x27;s a very good haircutting kit, i&#x27;ts a very good option, i recommend 100% the product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, good price. Smooth and hairless</li>
    <li> Excellent barbing tool. Very beautiful hair cut and shaving results. Low noise, strong and powerful. Safe too. Complete. I love and enjoyed it from the word go!</li>
    <li> After adjusting the blade position per the instructions, this item worked fine.</li>
    <li> Love it love it love it!!!</li>
    <li> I had ordered this as a Father&#x27;s Day gift for my boyfriend.  He picked it out, after I should him Amazon&#x27;s website.  So I I had to do was order it, wrap it, and give it.</li>
    <li> I love the color and price, also the fact that is very compact too. The trimmer I thought it was going to be sharper but it isn&#x27;t specially if you want to edge up.</li>
    <li> I had an old haircutting kit that finally gave up the ghost....so I ordered this one and I have used it once and it worked very well.  I was shaving off my beard and it was gentle on my face.  Seems to be a good item!</li>
    <li> The battery has to be changed too often in the smaller trimmer</li>
    <li> Clippers arrived on time and work great.  Have 2 boys who like buzz cuts and this will pay for itself in just one use on each boy.  The little trimmer clipper works great on the neck and cuts clean.  Will be great for touch ups.  Will have to order more oil as the tiny little container that comes with it has just a very small amount.  Over all I am very pleased with both the clippers and the price.</li>
    <li> the clippers were literally as loud as lawnmowers. vibrated so much it numbed your hand.&lt;br /&gt;research showed that australian outlets over powered the unit, which was root cause of the problem. perfect for americans, do not buy for the rest of the world.</li>
    <li> This product is a really good deal for the multiple stuff you&#x27;ll receive. Plus each things are very useful, this product is a bargain for a good quality razor.</li>
    <li> I was very excited about ordering these clippers based on all of the positive reviews I had read. Much to my disappointment the trimmer that arrived was faulty. I threw in the batteries and instantly smelled a nasty electrical burning smell (think fried computers). Bummer. The main clipper has been ok, the attachments all snap on snugly but the blades themselves seem not as sharp as other clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I love it this. I&#x27;ve bought other brands before but they all s**k!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is just the best brand to have guaranteed!</li>
    <li> Wahl 79520-3101 Groom pro  Haircutting Yellow/black 22-count  It&#x27;s designed for use on your own head.  It&#x27;s has a nice quality and it doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this product in the mail.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift for my husband.  The personal trimmer is very nice, works great and I have no complaints.  The main clippers, however, is rediculously loud.  I mean loud like a concrete power drill.  I can&#x27;t have the thing on for more than a couple minutes.  I tried adjusting the side screw to see if I could relieve the vibration, but then the blade wouldn&#x27;t cut any hair.  I&#x27;m still trying to find the right way to tweak it so it isn&#x27;t so loud, but haven&#x27;t had any success.  Aside from the noise level, the unit does well with close cuts.  I give my husband a fade with a 1 ontop and skin on the sides, but I think I may have to find another set.  I can not get over the noise.</li>
    <li> I have been borrowing buzzers from friends for a few years now and decided to just buy my own.  A great variety of heads for this makes it great for choosing just about any short hair length.  It&#x27;s easy to use yourself if you don&#x27;t have anyone to buzz your head for you.  The best part about this kit is the smaller razor.  The only thing is that mine came with a few teeth broken off of one of the combs but I&#x27;ve already got a million of them.  You will need a couple AA batteries for the smaller razor.  Please with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Sick of trying the rechargeable trimmers and clippers! Never powerful enough. I buzz my head and these are awesome without pulling or any other uncomfortable events. So its wired. I just had to MAN-UP and its really not any bother. Its also a great price! Wahl is the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> The little trimmer that runs on batteries was great at first but then soon refused to work the piece that make the blades moves keeps popping out and I have to adjust it every thirty seconds. This extends the time for a 5 minute trim to 20 minutes with all of the time fighting to get the thing to cut .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for a new one now and not from Wahl</li>
    <li> Does a great job cutting hair.  The small trimmers work well also.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s works perfectly. This is my 2nd pair of Wahl clippers, after I dropped and shattered mine on the bathroom ground (after 10 years of ownership). Sharp, easy to handle, and it&#x27;s a plus that it comes with 2 combs and a bunch of guards.</li>
    <li> Works well. Exactly what I expected. The smaller clipper is battery operated which works really well to get to the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I bought this from Italy so I can&#x27;t really use the bigger razor since I can&#x27;t plug it anywhere in my house&lt;br /&gt;the little razor though works well enough, so far little to no problems with it</li>
    <li> I have been cutting my own hair for 3 years and this is a step up from the coair that i have been useing.  By no means is this a great product.  But it is a step up from what i was using.  The clipper is fine, but the attachements are cheap.  If i had a do over i would have picked something a little more expensive....ie you get what you pay for. over all not bad...but this will get the job done. I have used them 2x so i cant speak of lasting quality.....</li>
    <li> The small trimmer is weak, and there seems to be a bad connection - even with brand new batteries, it works sporadically. Sometimes it runs at full speed, other times (seemingly for no reason) it will run as if there&#x27;s something blocking it, or won&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large trimmer works, but is designed for 110-120v only, it seems - here with a 230-240v power connection, it&#x27;s deafeningly loud (many other electronics work without a voltage converter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t comment on how the larger one would be with its native plug, but disappointing that it can&#x27;t work on both, and the smaller is very disappointing altogether</li>
    <li> Great clippers, been cutting my own hair for years and these have been the best. The clips are kinda cheap but if you know what your doing you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. Thanks amazon.</li>
    <li> I received this product on time, and as described. I noticed what MAY have been small hairs on the large clippers, but it could have been small pieces of metal from factory production. Nonetheless these clippers cut great with a LOW amount of vibration, and they don&#x27;t get hot either my average cutting time is 15-20mins . I was hesitant to buy these because of the bad reviews complaining on uneven cutting and vibration. However you can ignore all of the crybabies. My hair doesn&#x27;t grow very long so I usually give myself a buzz cut on a #2 guard and it works just fine. If your cut is uneven there must be an error on your part. If you&#x27;re looking to save money on cutting your own hair this is a great set to buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great investment- in hair that is. I enjoy doing my own hair and the last clippers I bought from Grocery Outlet only made it for about 3 months, 2 haircuts. After It began making this horrible loud sound so I went and was able to get my money back. Then I started looking around through reviews and saw that this had an affordable price with not so many disappointed users. None the less, I have used it 3 times since I got it last month and is working fine. You get a lot of extra accessories so be prepared to shove them in a little black box. The little trimer uses batteries (AAA), so heads up. Over all, really glad I bought these clippers. Plus they come with motor guarantee  from WALH. Happy Clipping.</li>
    <li> Great price, exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I like it is everything as described</li>
    <li> This set works ok for the price. It&#x27;s not as good quality as other Wahl clippers I have owned but it gets the job done. The trimmers are very cheaply made and probably won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
    <li> The Best beginners set!! Love them! Great for the price :-)</li>
    <li> not made in the usa! the cordless unit has a switch problem. told wahl about it and they sent me a replacement and it had the same problem and wahl did not really care that they are dragging there name in the mud with cheap crap from CHINA. I gave it away to a local thrift store and will NEVER buy WAHL again!  Very misleading ad not impressed amazon... I vote with my wallet.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is a body builder. The blade guard is much too sharp to groom one&#x27;s body. I returned it to Amazon without a problem.</li>
    <li> Great selection of clipper attachments.  Works well, didn&#x27;t choke on masses of hair.  The small clipper handy for fine work.</li>
    <li> I went from using a cordless beard and hair trimmer to using this and the difference is like night and day. This one cuts evenly and directly. No need to go over the hair five times until it looks like it might be the length you set it to. Cutting hair is ten times faster and the results are so much better. We only just started using it but so far it works great.</li>
    <li> This is my second set, easily pays for itself in a few uses.  Would highly recommend,great product for the money!</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and was packed well I love this so much it works great now I can cut hair without pulling any out thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend these clippers.  I got my pair a few months ago and now all I want to do is use them.  I had never cut my own hair before getting these, and now I feel confident that anyone can do it.  The portable trimmer is also awesome.  I&#x27;ve used another cheap trimmer like it, but this one is way better than the $15 Remington one I had.  The downside is it only has two attachments (it doesn&#x27;t use the corded clipper attachments).  I found that the longer of the two is the perfect length for my beard, so it&#x27;s not a big deal.  I should note that I keep my &#x27;beard&#x27; fairly short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing this kit is missing is a mirror (and maybe a small scissors), but you can always get one at another store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a college student who just got these, been using other peoples&#x27; clippers for a while and these are by far the best. Strong and feels sturdy, the touch up trimmer also works extremely well. The clips on them are a little flimsy, but still a great set.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had these clippers for about a month but they seem to work great for the price I paid.  I&#x27;m really glad I decided to buy them.  So far, I believe that I made a sound investment.  I&#x27;m already pretty close to getting my money&#x27;s worth in savings from not having to go to the barber.</li>
    <li> Good clippers at a great value. With proper maintenance, they will last for a very long time.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping good clippers didn&#x27;t care much for the small one not powerful enough for me</li>
    <li> The brother I gave it to likes it very much.</li>
    <li> This product has a 120v output rating and is therefore not compatible with electricity supply in Singapore. So unfortunately I cannot use it</li>
    <li> The product is very useful. Both the outlet-powered electric shaver and the battery-powered electric shaver are very handy and useful.</li>
    <li> Ordered these to clip my dog, which I realize they&#x27;re not advertised as pet grooming, but they wore down quickly even after cleaning and oiling. Not a fan, bought a new set.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas because he insists on cutting his own hair. He loves it, he cuts his and his 2 other roommates hair at least  every month. They have been using it for 5 months now and it still works great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> these replaced an older pair of about 12 yrs and have used them 4 times now,extremely pleased, good product would highly recommend</li>
    <li> The large clipper works fine the small one quit working after three uses. Too much trouble to send back. we still use the large one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years, and I finally go this guy - and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Works perfectly and sounds like pure power when you turn it on. I had a cheap conair one before this, and it sounded like it was struggling to move the engine. This thing turns on like a thunderclap and holds a steady low buzz afterwards. All the attachments are nice, and it has never pulled on my hair or done anything strange while I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Using it for 3rd year now, its just as it was bought. Nice!!</li>
    <li> The clippers caught fire and I have to constantly change the batteries in the trimmers so I bought some Andis T Liner trimmers and went back to an old pair of clippers. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good trimmer for a good price. So I saw this one and liked it very much. In some reviews there was written that it&#x27;s so noisy that you can&#x27;t use it, but I thought it was a kind of upstart claim. But when I held the trimmer (the bigger one) and plugged in I nearly got shocked. The heck! Both noise and vibration are unbearable and after holding it for a while your hand shakes for about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller one is better. It works very good and don&#x27;t produce much noise. I bought rechargeable batteries that cost about 5-7 bucks normally.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you to buy some other trimmer but not this.</li>
    <li> The only thing that could better this deal is a couple more cutting combs. Preferably the 1 1/4 and the 1 1/2 size. Other than that, this is great!</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers for my nephew he seems to like them, The big one does a great job the little one is a little bit too light for his beard. Not enough a little too lite</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s some rust on the stainless steel, but it works well.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother. The small one does the job kinda but the larger clippers broke on the third use and after it scratched up the back of my neck, probably due to the distance of the blade. BUT enough to draw some blood. It&#x27;s a cheap plastic set. Save and spend a little more on a better pair of Wahls.</li>
    <li> He loves them (boyfriend), but the trimmers aren&#x27;t what I thought</li>
    <li> Let me tell you what I took a chance and bought these for. I have a Shih Tzu and my daughter has a Shih Tzu mix. Well, grooming prices are getting really ridiculous so my daughter and I decided we can do it ourselves. AND WE DID !!!&lt;br /&gt;These Clippers are wonderful. I have to take breaks to rest, so that would also give the clippers a rest, too. the smaller trimmers are the perfect fit for her little face and under her paws. WOW, I can actually say, this is one of the BEST purchases I have EVER made and I am actually PROUD to tell you that I bought human clippers for my precious Shih Tzu, Lacey, (who by the way, thinks she is human). She &amp; I live alone and she is a very big part of my world.</li>
    <li> quick delivery.  competitively priced.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement of an old conair clippers I purchased about 10 years ago, that started about a year ago to be extremely noisy (I mean like a lawn mower). I am so glad I purchased these. The quality is overall good. the guides are somewhat flimsy, but I have not noticed any irregularities in terms of cutting. The machine is quite powerful compared to what I had. I am now cutting my hair in less than a third of the time that took me while using the old clippers. I am quite happy with my purchase; It made my life much easier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revised: I am giving only a 3 because the guards suck. after a few uses (4 or 5 times) the guards fall off and I find myself cutting my hair without a guard. It was so annoying that I went bold for a few days. Good thing the shape of my head rocks!</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair using this cutter and the included tools.  It saves a lot of money which can be put to other uses.</li>
    <li> Works great for my wife on giving me haircuts at home so I don&#x27;t have to pay $20+ for a haircut at barber or salon.</li>
    <li> This was a purchase for my son. He said it worked as he expected it to. Wahl continues to be our preferred brand.</li>
    <li> The teeth grabs the hair before cutting which results in a painful experience!</li>
    <li> Works very well for cutting my kids hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not experienced with cutting their hair, but it came with instructions on cutting hair which was helpful.</li>
    <li> still have not used it but not buy it because it was recommended, they told me very hot and not much noise does good and so far everything is going as I have said. Thank you.</li>
    <li> exactly what I ordered I did not use it yet. So I hope that it works fine.  I will use it and get back to you.</li>
    <li> The clippers exceeded my expectations. They work great. Other than the loud buzzing from the little trimmer, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> Only using the trimmer and gets rust on 1st time used.. The clipper makes very loud noise, its more like drilling rather than hair dressing. pretty disappointed with the product.</li>
    <li> Big clipper is very nice. Small one is pretty much junk, though it still cuts, it consistently misses hairs. The big clipper sometimes rattles some of the guards and makes an annoying vibration noise. Other than that, good for occasional user.</li>
    <li> Item came broken, but company quickly sent replacement. Clippers work great. No problems as of yet. Great deal for the price.</li>
    <li> It was stunning to find that similar product with same price was out in the market, very disappointing product price and the results don&#x27;t match the description on the manual. The machine is heavy but less performing as expected. The small trim is just a burden since you need spend money on their powering and no savings thus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the quality clippers. All ya need is some batteries for the shaver, but other than that, i recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
    <li> This Wahl 79520-3101 is too noising, when you start it up you better have earplugs on!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed about this product.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut hair well, but I have to turn the power up pretty high to get the clippers to cut.  It may be because I live in Germany, and I need a transformer to use these, but the sound isn&#x27;t such a big deal.  I only use the smallest guard (being African American) so I can&#x27;t speak on switching them, but the guard stays put well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I took these clippers to the US, and they are much quieter there.  The power does not need to be as high to cut effectively.  I 100% recommend these to US residents.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my own hair a few years ago.  I&#x27;ve been using this set for the past few months and it has been great.  It&#x27;s not too loud and doesn&#x27;t overheat.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE!! YOU GET A GREAT CLIPPER &amp; TRIMMER WITH EACH SET. THE REG PRICE IS ABOUT $50. AT THIS TIME , AMAZON WAS OFFERING IT FOR $25.45.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too noisy that I can&#x27;t use. It will affect others</li>
    <li> Low powered, budget clippers. I couldn&#x27;t get a very close cut with these. They jam up and pull constantly. Only buy if they are cheap.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers. They are exactly what I wanted, and at a great price. I bought this on Prime day for a great price.</li>
    <li> the machine does not work get damaged, it was a bad choice, I recommend this product, it is of poor quality, do not buy</li>
    <li> This is a perfect saving and hair cutting kit. it helps a lot to me in daya to day life.</li>
    <li> Excellent clippers for the $$$&lt;br /&gt;Nice close cut. A well made set of clippers for the do it yourselfer.</li>
    <li> My wife cuts my hair and we tossed these in the trash they are loud and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;We replaced them with a different brand and those are fine.&lt;br /&gt;The first set I had were Wahl brand but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;Remington from a local store seem to work better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many clippers and have been remarkably disappointed about their performance. So I was like I should try this out maybe things might work out this time around. And lucky me, it turned out that this clipper actually accounted for the previous disappointing ones I have bought. Though not that its the very  best but it work-price comparison is definitely no loss a deal. So if you are looking for a clipper that does a decent job, this one should be one of your consideration. My seller also made it come on time. Nice deal so I gave it 4 star.</li>
    <li> the best product and cheap</li>
    <li> Excellent product and I have used this brand before and will continue to use their products and will buy them again.</li>
    <li> great clippers and great price</li>
    <li> Okay I&#x27;m a frugal guy. This kit is terrific for home hair cuts - with someone who knows what they are doing. My wife cuts mine and we save the $10 to $15 bucks at a pro. The beard/mustache trimmer will cut your weeks and months of beard down to nearly nothing and a few minutes with a razor and you have a slick face. I got neck issues and it takes me an hour to shave off a beard of 5-7 weeks or more. With the trimmer and a razor - about five to ten minutes. Recommend this in a second, five stars plus.</li>
    <li> the larger clippers are a Good product works very well and doesn&#x27;t pull hair. The little one works for trimming up a hairline</li>
    <li> High quality trimmer for a great price. They have a guard for every length I would ever need. I&#x27;ve used it once and worked excellent. One more use and it will have paid for itself in the cost of the haircut, not even including the convenience.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad there aren&#x27;t more clips for the trimmer, but this works very well overall! Don&#x27;t expect an incredibly close shave with either.</li>
    <li> what can I say you can not go wrong with Wahl and the trimmer is real nice.  i would buy them again</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and though he grumbled over me buying him anything (we had decided on a couch and it made him feel bad for not getting me something personal too LOL) he really loves this set and uses them quite frequently....he uses the bigger one to trim his hair and the smaller one he uses for his beard and mustache! Per the hubs it&#x27;s a great set that doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out like his last one did and the smaller one is perfect for trimming hair, beard, or mustache!! This makes the second Wahl product I&#x27;ve bought him and if this one holds up like the first one did I shouldn&#x27;t need to buy another one for a while, maybe never! Recommended this to his best friend when he said his went out and he loves it too!!</li>
    <li> what I expected. Rell nice! Perfect for home haircut. It works pretty easy. I advice to buy it! :-P:-D :-D</li>
    <li> Clippers arrived on time and work great. Have 2 boys who like buzz cuts and this will pay for itself in just one use on each boy. The little trimmer clipper works great on the neck and cuts clean. Will be great for touch ups. Will have to order more oil as the tiny little container that comes with it has just a very small amount. Over all I am very pleased with both the clippers and the price.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what to really say about these, they work great, cut my hair just fine. I don&#x27;t believe it comes with the #2 size clipper, but I just snagged the one from my old set. This will tend to get hot if you use it for a while. If I am trimming body hair this thing tends to get pretty hot in my hands.</li>
    <li> the product is excellent and the response by the seller is quite fast and effective, I recommend one hundred percent</li>
    <li> The big one is very good, especially considering the price. It has a strong motor and sharp blades. Still, it gets bogged down sometimes when cutting through a lot of hair. It also comes with all the attachments one normally needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little one is a different story. It is a total piece of junk. Even with brand new batteries, the thing is always just about to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, the package is worth it for the big one alone. Do not expect anything from the little one.</li>
    <li> If you cut hair a lot  or cut hair close these are not for you. Not a very strong motor so it causes the clippers to pull hair. If you like a close cut your head will have some pain from the use of these clippers. If you have the money for these clippers spend $10 more and get you a better pair. If you want a good pair of clippers stay around the $50 and up range. These feels like if you drop them 1 time they will break.</li>
    <li> The large clippers are great!  I used #2 and was done in 10 minutes!  The small battery trimmers will require 2  rechargeable AA batteries, they are not very heavy duty compared to the electric clippers.  They are okay since included, though.  They will be fine for someone with finer hair that is not too coarse around neck and ears, might be alright for mustache trim, too.  The order arrived very quickly, too!</li>
    <li> Stay away from this clipper kit, I am  serious. This Company should be shut down for allowing this noise deafening piece of junk to be sold to anybody on this planet,  it is louder than my 8 cylinder Dodge, you have got to be the most insensitive manufacturer on this Earth to test this item in your factory, listen to the extreme loudness of the motor and then put it on the market to be used behind people&#x27;s ears. The suggestion from Wahl is that you adjust the loudness from a screw to the the right of the unit , bovine deposits, the only way to lower the rattling sound as if the motor is falling apart, is to turn fully clockwise, and when you do that there is no operation from the blade, absolute rubbish. I was so upset I busted it up with a sledgehammer .</li>
    <li> I start to shave my hear after I get this kit. Simple and useful tool comb. Some tools I do not use such as a lot of clippers. I just use 3mm clipper. Maybe I will use them on my friends&#x27; head.</li>
    <li> This set of clippers was excellent. The larger of two has a nice feel in the hand and delivers a cut. One pass and the hair is cut evenly. It&#x27;s easy to use and the carrying case is perfect. Perfect for buzz cuts and those that do home haircuts. Definitely worth it and you cannot beat the price. Wahl is a reliable product and I have even recommended this model to some family and friends.</li>
    <li> Best razor on market, and what most pros use these days. Works great, cuts clean and thorough. Highly recommended by this buyer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I use it all the time (my two sons appreciate saving money not getting haircuts by having dad buzz their hair every few weeks). You get a multitude of attachments to cut hair at virtually any length and a handy carrying case to keep it all in.</li>
    <li> I have been using these for more than one year. They are very good &amp; have been working without any problem. Its price is also very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
    <li> Works as well as I hoped for. The small trimmer is very handy. Would like a replacement guards for the small trimmers. Seems like it would be hard to find if it broke.</li>
    <li> Not so loud you can&#x27;t use them but they are quite noisy. For clipping hair, no worries so far. The clippers are sharp and have never pulled my hair. The included brush is tiny but effective. The variety of clipper guards is limited so you may want to consider buying guards separately.</li>
    <li> Overall a nice combo that does the job well. Would have preferred to have BOTH units corded as the cordless detail trimmer is not practical in a busy salon environment.</li>
    <li> love this product, it runs smoothly, cuts smoothly, and it also makes very little noise when cutting. I would recommend this product to someone else.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted to cut hair but appears the blade for cutters not very sharp and packaged very poorly as a few accessories were broken.</li>
    <li> I love it, before I got this set I had to go out and pay a professional to cut my hair, and now I can save the money and do it myself, Ive already made the money back that I spent on it by not paying to have my hair cut!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber, I just cut my own hair and this set is good for all my hair cutting needs. I especially like having the beard and mustache trimmer to keep my face and hairlines looking good between haircuts. Lots of useful accessories.</li>
    <li> Fought with these for a few months, just trying to get them to cut each time was a pain...thought maybe it was a worn out blade so I went out and bought another Wahl hair clipper (different style since this wasn&#x27;t available at the time) but guess what, the very first cut I struggled to cut all my hair so as not to look like a fool with a screwed up hair cut....oiled it up, waited for my next hair cut and I&#x27;m trying to cut again, it won&#x27;t even go through my hair...Wahl is the worst! Never buying this brand again</li>
    <li> I thought this kit had a pair of shears in it but oh well  they get the job done but the only bad thing is the big pair of clippers get extremely hot if u have cut teo peoples hair back to back def not professional grade</li>
    <li> both work great except that the one with the cord is so loud. Make sure no one is sleeping when you turn it on!!!</li>
    <li> This product is okay. I wish I had of gotten something that was a little sharper.</li>
    <li> MY GRANDSON SAID HE LOVED IT. WAS HIS BIRTHDAY GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;HE WILL ENJOY IT FOR MANY MORE YEARS TO COME.</li>
    <li> Great clippers, fast shipping!!!! Pleased with purchase. Little noisy but not that bad. Very sharp clean cut! God value for the money</li>
    <li> Great item was a sad to see the  little razor needs batterys but other then that its great.&lt;br /&gt;Got here on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Good product for a reasonable price but the trimmer was broke. I had to fix it myself by taking it apart and hooking a wire up to the battery cable. Other than that the trimmer worked find.</li>
    <li> I bought one a couple of years ago and I love it because I cut my own hair. All I&#x27;ve ever done to it was clean it and it still cuts perfectly. My brother asked for one a year ago and now I&#x27;m giving him this for Christmas.</li>
    <li> We took a chance on these clippers and are very excited to say they are awesome. We have bought many brands over the years and this one exceeds expectations. They cut great and have plenty of extensions. The smaller trimmer is a little loud but as long as they are cutting my hair with good quality I am fine with a little noise. A great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> this product is very good... you can go for it without doubt....but little bit more noisy and vibration is high</li>
    <li> My husband said he really like this gift because it is of good quality and works very well.  He is happy with the gift and even likes the color.  The price was great too compared to other products of the same quality.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both love it.  I get really cheap haircuts through where I work but even at 4 dollars a cut this thing will pay for itself in just a few months.  For slightly more than the price of a single hair cut at a professional salon my wife gives me a better cut with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF I had to come up with a negative is how loud it clacks when you first power it up.  She did that a couple of times near my ear and it hurt.  Now she just clicks it off and on while not near my ear and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of attachments and the AA battery powered small trimmer takes the place of all of my facial hair grooming needs without having to deal with those rechargeable units and them never being charged when I want to use them.  I wish it was a little bit fuller featured.  I would like it to have the ability to put some of the complicated gadgets you can get with those personal groomer kits like nose hair trimmer attachments and the like but alas you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
    <li> This is a nice set. The little one works great.  The price is perfect for this at home use kit.</li>
    <li> Bad makes noise from Europe so buy adapter but still</li>
    <li> Good power... do not get stuck like others that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> I love these clippers!!! I&#x27;ve had them for a couple of years, just now getting back with the review! I use them all the time, size is great, cuts great, has additional extra&#x27;s that were good to have!! Always gets me done, when needed!! The blades are still shining!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price. Can&#x27;t go wrong with made in the USA.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and i dont like the trimmer.. it is battery powered and it goes through a lot of batteries.. and the trimmer part is sharp, keeps nicking.</li>
    <li> Works great to cut all the family memebers hair. Battery operated cutter is effeciant and performs better then our old rechargeable one. Comes with lots of size attachments.</li>
    <li> This was a great value, fast delivery and exactly as advertised. I take care of my own hair and beard, this set does the job.</li>
    <li> The one I bought 25 years ago was way better, cut cleaner and smoother,</li>
    <li> great deal and ok quality</li>
    <li> It works Great I LOVE It! !!!</li>
    <li> Good quality clippers with strong motor. Quiet motor as well. Like the smaller battery operated clipper, felt like it was a bonus based on price. The only thing not offered in this kit was a pair off scissors.</li>
    <li> I used it to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and plan on using the trimmer on his body hair.  It&#x27;s a did a great job!</li>
    <li> Clippers performed great, and are not loud.</li>
    <li> I will recommend this to every one, Its easy to use.  It has 2 trimmer, one with cable(more than 6 ft) and other without cable and very handy.</li>
    <li> Blades could be sharper.. To dull to do a good shape up. Otherwise did the job should be cheaper since you have to sharpen the blades yourseld</li>
    <li> real nice it is the best set of clippers i have ever owned i use them for everything trims, faids ,beard trim neckline and the little set comes in handy. my wife even uses it good buy had it for some time without any problems</li>
    <li> My GF graciously offered to start cutting my hair for me. I bought this lower priced model thinking even if they aren&#x27;t so great they only cost about what you pay for a haircut anyway. Instead we were pleasantly surprised! These work great and already have paid for themselves a dozen times over and still are going strong. Frankly I don&#x27;t see the need to spend a lot on the more expensive models. They are a bit loud but that&#x27;s all I can say even close to negative. Five stars means a five star value. Its been about eight months, we still have lots of the blade lubricant they provide (and use it regularly), its got all the attachments you need. One tip: take off the blade every few cuts to clean. I think the instructions do advise agaisnt that, and it is a bit of work lining the blade back up again, but the hair really builds up in there and will affect performance. The blade was getting a bit sluggish until I cleaned that out.</li>
    <li> I personally have been using the double A battery operated trimmer. Its main use is to trim my beard and it works flawlessly. I&#x27;ve yet to use the main corded cutter but when i do i will post another update.</li>
    <li> Works great not as loud as I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> It was a great gift for my husband! He loved it!</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace a set that lasted about a year. Use them mostly for my little mutt.  They do heat up but they work well.</li>
    <li> light and works great</li>
    <li> awesome product and two for that price, AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I trim my boyfriend&#x27;s hair almost weekly.  I like the little trimmer; it is great for touchups.  This is my second set.  My little trimmer stopped working on after I had it for about 2 years. The large trimmer was still working great.  It is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is just what I need and the price was a fraction of what salon supply stores were charging.</li>
    <li> Great product! The best as far as hair clippers go. The grooming tool worked excellent as well</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re comfortable with these clippers. My wife has the cordless one, and I use the actual clipper. This is our second time purchasing these exact clippers. The first pair lasted a few years, and perfomed nicely. I would recommend them.</li>
    <li> great clippers. both very quite almost no sound really with either one.</li>
    <li> A very pleasant purchase! A very good hair cutter! I like it very much and like to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> With this being my first Amazon review, I am really disappointed that it has to be a negative one.&lt;br /&gt;We bought this clippers for my husband&#x27;s hair, and have owned Wahl brand before and were satisfied with them.  However, after the old clippers bit the dust it was time to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and the shipment were fine, but I found these clippers to be almost unusable.  They vibrated so bad I had a hard time giving him an even and straight cut.  I found it pointless, especially since our previous Wahl clippers worked great.  A lot of reviews on here mentioned the noise (which was indeed loud), but it was the vibrations that did it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning these in favor of something a little more steady.</li>
    <li> This is our second Wahl Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;The first lasted for 18 years until it slipped into sink filled with water (fortunately not plugged in).&lt;br /&gt;I think it is an excellent product, with the addition of cordless trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, excellent price.</li>
    <li> I use the corded clipper to cut my son hair and use the extra battery operated for the line up. Both are good to use on someone&#x27;s hair as an introductory cutting grooming kit.  I use battery operated smaller clipper for my line up everyday and use the other to cut hair almost every two weeks.</li>
    <li> I only use the portable one.  The corded one is too heavy for me.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I would have just purchased the battery one.&lt;br /&gt;I do trim my husband&#x27;s hair and so we avoid the barber shop.</li>
    <li> This kit is wonderful. Cut my hair (which is very thick) effortlessly. The smaller trimmer is great for my beard and touch ups and has plenty of power for a small, battery powered trimmer.</li>
    <li> A well built product. Pays for itself with every I use it.</li>
    <li> Im a african american woman and I cut my sons hair which is so thick.I brought the first pair of these clippers in febuary.They was so good I brought a second pair.I got mines from walmart for about $40 the second pair was about $28.00.These clippers will not cut your hair if it dirty or very thick hair.The trick is I washed and condition my sons hair and then I put olive oil on there hair and rinse with cold water. Olive oil makes the hair very soft and shiny and I blow dry the hair for about 3 minutes.The hair dont be fully dry so I start cutting the hair with the wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Omg the clippers slides off the hair like melted butter the olive oil seem to had made my son hair very silky.These clippers are amazing after 3 o 4 months the blade would not cut I sent it back to the company and they puta new blade and adjust the clippers.These clippers are so good with freshly washed hair.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this. Its a all in one kit and easy to use. I would recommend to anyone looking for one!</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s a great kit at a great price. The quality seems good, the machine and the pieces all work as advertised. At that price, you can&#x27;t beat the quality.</li>
    <li> Great system, I&#x27;ve only had one haircut with it, but so far it is working like a champ. The smaller trimmer depends on batteries and is a little bit loud, but other than that, great!</li>
    <li> This Wahl haircutter is so wonderful! It cuts with such ease, never clogging! Just a great product! Made so well that I don&#x27;t think I will have to buy any clippers for years to come. Bonus!( Buy the Wahl Oil for the clippers, to keep them running perfectly!!)</li>
    <li> worth the extra $ as I develop as a stylist.</li>
    <li> works perfectly fine! Just as advertised! includes everything you need for a haircut! also comes with a few maintenance items. reason i rated it 4 stars instead of five was because after about 10 minutes or so it starts getting really warm/hot (the plug in one). I didnt really like it because i give myself a hair cut and usually doing the haircutting with one hand and holding the mirror with the other takes a bit longer so my hand gets really hot to the point its causes un-comfort.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in the market for a good set of hair clippers that won&#x27;t hurt my head, pull, pinch, or rip out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done some research and had a budget, and found that this would likely be the best option for my price range.  It&#x27;s not whisper-quiet, but it wasn&#x27;t loud enough to scare the cat out of the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are sharp and cut the hair with no problem.  The guards are clearly marked, which made it easy for a novice like me to give myself a great haircut with little fuss and nice tapering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second, smaller set takes AA batteries (which aren&#x27;t included) and does a great job on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little black buttons you see on the front are only decorative and provide grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid purchase.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> This hair cutting device works great. I recommend it and believe me you will never regret it.</li>
    <li> can not go wrong with a Wahl set</li>
    <li> The best clippers I have ever own.</li>
    <li> Excellent value.  Paid for itself with the first two boys haircuts!</li>
    <li> Love my new clippers , very sharp and they cut very nice !!! They were packed so that they would not move around in the box with another item , I received them on the 4th of July !!! Awesomeness Amazon , I cut my own hair and my girlfriend loved my new dew !!!</li>
    <li> I have a long haired miniature dachshund. Instead of taking of her to the groomer I bought this in hopes that it would work. Well it might be a learning curve on my part as to grooming my own dog, but it works well. The only thing I have a problem with is that it tends to get hot after 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li> Clippers work fine. The smaller trimmer does not work. Tried several batteries--no go. I e-mailed Wahl over a week ago and still no response. As a company they don&#x27;t know what customer service is.</li>
    <li> New product, well packed and sealed box.</li>
    <li> These are great clippers.  Both sturdy and sharp - great quality.</li>
    <li> Awesome for my husband and my son</li>
    <li> Good price. good quality. Quicky delivery.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. The beard trimmer pulls and snags a bit.</li>
    <li> Trimmer (small) is battery operated, I thought it was chargeable.  Works reasonably well.  I can work with i t.</li>
    <li> Kit had everything needed to give home hair cuts. For the price, I don&#x27;t see how anyone could beat it.</li>
    <li> The battery powered edger does not work to well. But the clippers i have no problem with. They seemed to cut great.</li>
    <li> With the cost of hair cuts; why would you not do it yourself?  I am not great at cutting my own hair, but it has nothing to do with the equipment I purchased.  I&#x27;ve had the Wahl product for less than 1-year and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> its price is good quality. called it multi purpose with this combo because I can make many different cuts and many things. many pieces this combo very complete and very economical.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! Great value on Prime Day!</li>
    <li> excellent product, works fine. recomended</li>
    <li> Use these to cut my boys&#x27; hair.  Work like a charm...my hairdresser uses the same exact brand/model</li>
    <li> I got these for my hubby because I broke his other set. Apparently these are way better than his old ones, be careful the blades super sharp. My poor husband lost about a half inch on the back of his neck and it was stuck with a funky hair line for about 2 weeks. He has since forgiven me but is taking the steps to show me how to use this correctly. It is an awesome set I can&#x27;t believe how much they are priced for I feel like they are worth a lot more. The cordless beard trimmer is his favorite part of them.</li>
    <li> Works great. Good cut.</li>
    <li> My son in law loved this product. I would recumbent it to others. It is well made and sturdy.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this haircutting kit. Has everything that I need to cut my husband and son&#x27;s hair. The little razor gets real close to make the neck area look neat. Has plenty of attachments for different lengths of hair. Works well.</li>
    <li> Very nice for an inexpensive set.  Works well.  No problems so far.</li>
    <li> I gave 5 stars to this haircutting, because it works excellent, have several accesories to choose when you make a hair cut!</li>
    <li> Great set and great price. If the small clipper was rechargeable it would be perfect.. But you can&#x27;t beat the price !</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely matter, works great for trimming and sideburns and beard-an improvement over my barrery operated one - both are great</li>
    <li> Good product, but the trimmer is not rechargable</li>
    <li> THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rECOMMEND IT</li>
    <li> I got these as back up&#x27;s just in case my chrome pro clippers broke and they are beautiful low great price haven&#x27;t used them but plugged them in to see if they worked and they did wasn&#x27;t loud the trimmers are a nice touch plus they came with a 1/16 gard which the chrome set didn&#x27;t have all in all great deal</li>
    <li> Works great! Have had other Wahl products and they are worth the money!</li>
    <li> Bought these over a yr ago and they are still cutting the way they did on day one a must get for self grooming</li>
    <li> The clippers work great but the cheap plastic adapters break so easily which means the clippers are mostly useless.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent value and a great choice for someone looking for an inexpensive set of trimmers of reasonable quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not an expert on trimmers and I&#x27;ll admit that up-front. My requirements were mainly value-based and my goal was to get a product that is of higher quality than a generic brand, while still staying inexpensive. When I got these, the kit was $21, which is certainly inexpensive and actually LESS than many of the no-name generic kits. I bought these for basic things like trimming my beard, maintaining neck line, touchups, side burns, etc. For this usage they have worked really well for me. I use the corded trimmer maybe once a week, and the battery-powered trimmer a few times a week. Three years after purchase, both products work as well as they did when they were new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not built to a quality standard that professional Wahl products are (and they are not priced that way either.) They are built for and marketed as a value home-use product, and I think they do a very good job at this role. After three years, my own usage has found that the...&lt;br /&gt;---blades themselves have remained sharp,&lt;br /&gt;---guards work well to prevent cuts,&lt;br /&gt;---battery life on the trimmer is excellent, and&lt;br /&gt;---overall construction is very solid considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;---Also, the included carry kit, guards, oil, and brush are also a nice addition as they avoid having to spend more money down the road and they give me everything I need in a single and inexpensive kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your needs are for professional usage or require a very robust &amp; extremely high-quality trimmer set, chances are a different (and more expensive) Wahl product is a better match. But if your goal is for a value set of trimmers that do a reasonably good job, this product is probably a good match, as they have worked very well for my needs.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because it was in really great condition . I got all that was required and I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this item under the impression that it was new. Arrived in good condition, fully sealed, but when I looked at the clippers they were still has on them. I am only to assume that these clippers were refurbished (not very well at all by the amount of hair left on both clippers)and not new as described and sold by Amazon. I contacted Amazon about this and another one is being shipped out to me to arrive today 10/4/2013. You can be sure that I will thoroughly check them when they arrive.  All in all, they looked sturdy  a good price and weren&#x27;t loud like others have commented (I turned them both on, but didn&#x27;t use). My rating is based on the fact that they were used and NOT new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well initially I had this rated @ 2 stars, but after receiving the replacement, I reduced it to a 1 star. This is due to the fact that hen I checked the second one it was also a USED item. I was clean, packaged well LOOKED new, but as I ran my finger across the cutting blades, again there was hair residue. Just to be sure that this was hair, I unscrewed the top blade of the main clipper to look underneath it. As I thought, there was definitely hair in there. I took pictures of it to document it. Aside from that, they are a good set of clippers. The reason for the lower star was that it was a refurbished product and customers should be aware of this as AMAZON is listing it as NEW when it is NOT!!!</li>
    <li> The hair trimmer sucks.  The clippers work very well and haven&#x27;t had any problems with that yet but seriously, the hair trimmer runs on batteries and works like crap.  Was part of the reason why I purchased this was to get the trimmer as well.</li>
    <li> Great kit! Has all of the pieces you need to be a successful &amp;#34;mom barber&amp;#34; and save money doing your own cuts. My family is very happy with the cuts I give them and because my family&#x27;s hair grows as fast as chia pets, I&#x27;m saving money every month by doing their cuts myself? This kit is easy to use and gives great results!</li>
    <li> My husband like the electrical unit, but the battery operated one....is horrible.</li>
    <li> Works as I expected.  I have been buying Wahl clippers for years as I cut my own hair.  It is a great item.</li>
    <li> great price for great clippers. love them</li>
    <li> I chose this model because it also had the trimmer with it.  I did not care that the little trimmer was battery operated as my Mom&#x27;s is a bit older and hers has a charger.  But it is nice and sharp.  It is very precise.  And does exactly what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;The larger hair trimmer has a TON of sizes of guards for a great hair cut.  I was replacing an older Wahl trimmer.  The only thing that I was missing was a Dvd.  I liked that the initial trimmer I got years ago had a DVD showing how to give a good &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; hair cut.  It had instructions but it would have been good to have a refresher.&lt;br /&gt;For the price of what you would pay for a men&#x27;s hair cut you can cut hair for years!  Good buy!</li>
    <li> Clippers work great and absolutely love the fact that the trimmer runs on AA batteries</li>
    <li> I bought these because I had a pair of Wahls before. I read some reviews that said they were loud but my last ones were loud too. These take the cake. It sounds like a lawn mower. I haven&#x27;t even used them because the sound hurts my ears. I need to get some earplugs before I put this thing anywhere near my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s been a few days since I got these. I tried everything I could think of to make the quieter and nothing worked. I eventually talked to a friend who happens to be a barber. What he told me is that the metal parts inside were hitting each other. The only way to fix it was to open them up and put something in between. I don&#x27;t think I should have to do that with a new item I just bought. So I will be returning them. I was extremely unsatisfied with this purchase. This will be the first item I have ever returned to Amazon.</li>
    <li> THE LARGE WAHL CLIPPERS LIGHT WEIGHT FEEL GOOD IN HAND SHARP...COOL COLOR.THE SMALL BATTERY OPERATED CLIPPERS ...SHARP,LIGHT WEIGHT, FEEL GOOD IN HAND...,I PERSONALY  DO NOT LIKE BATTERY OPERATED...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to receive a product and it is exactly what you expected. It is also rare, but these clippers met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> Clippers work great, grooming clippers are okay....way too loud though</li>
    <li> Precision was done in half the time than with my other brand of hair-cutting kits.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality clippers that seem to stay sharp. Once in a while will get some hair pulled, but overall a good value for the price. especially with the second razor that has really good battery life.</li>
    <li> The smaller personal groomer it comes with is basically throw-away.  It uses 2 AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t have a strong/sharp blade.  The other plug-in groomer is a decent one but I would just not bundle this trashy battery powered one in there with it.  Either get one that is plug-in rechargeable or just leave it out.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and the smaller clipper barley cuts. Better off saving your money and getting a higher quality clipper.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and provides wonderful hair cuts.  We have saved a lot of money by using this to cut my hair.  I can regulate the lever to control the amount of hair/thickness that I want to cut.  I have very thick hair and like it short so this fits my needs perfectly.</li>
    <li> As I am a continues traveller, I can not use this device in the countries where we have 230V input, hence its of no use to me</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for over 20 yrs on myself and this set is just as good as the previous one I retired.</li>
    <li> Excellent commercial quality buzzer. I also put the smaller buzzer in my luggage to take to work. I can keep the beard under control, and get proper buzzing when I&#x27;m at home.</li>
    <li> This team is very good has many combs change to taste, small machine that brings this case is perfect for cutting tiny hair behind the ears, and if cireto than the professional model but it&#x27;s as if it were barely vi buy it is an excellent product for Wahl.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best purchase I ever made! I&#x27;m able to trim facial hair with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Using it more than a year still works as new.Does it job neatly. Compared to expensive product this is worth. Like it very much.</li>
    <li> This has been a great tool to have around.  This has made cutting my own hair so easy I&#x27;ve yet to go back to a barber.  The clippers them selves have worked wonderfully and feel very durable.  It&#x27;s lasted years so far and I expect it to last many more.  On the other side of things the secondary battery powered trimmer isn&#x27;t as great.  It has its uses but in hind sight with would be better to save a few dollars or put that added value toward more durable trimming guides.  The guides are OK but I did break one a little to easily.  Despite that I&#x27;ve been very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This kit is sharp and precise I definitely recommend buying this. It comes with all the attachments that are needed and is made of top quality.</li>
    <li> Bad clippers. Heavy and cheap upper plastic. You need to go over and over the same area.  And it doesnt look even. Clippers also get stuck. Humming sound.Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> These are great, had a pair of conairs before but they pulled my hair out when moving the clipper to fast. These I can move the clippers fast and it does not yank my hair out. Also a lot quieter than my old clippers. Case has extra wiggle room so thats a plus!</li>
    <li> son uses it all the time</li>
    <li> well built and does the job</li>
    <li> We received this item with no problems...thanks for making our Christmas special with on time items.</li>
    <li> Good product good price easy to use.</li>
    <li> Qusality product and has performed flawlessly</li>
    <li> This was a huge hit.  Many attachments and a sturdy construction.  We get a lot of use from this as my fiance shaves his head weekly. Great purchase you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my old Wahl razor for 5 years and ran out of oil for it. I decided to get a new one, and this yellow one has a nice new motor in it. I like the trimmer too, which is great for small touch-ups. Hopefully, it will last another 5 years or more.</li>
    <li> It looks like a lot of equipment, but this kit offers everything you need to groom a man from head to toe!</li>
    <li> Worked great making me money every week</li>
    <li> I got these for my boyfriend and he loves them.  I&#x27;m not sure if its because they save him money and time for going to the barber, but he raves about it.  Feels like they are professional level clippers.</li>
    <li> They feel very cheap, but could get the job done.</li>
    <li> They work great no issues use them for the first time last night to fade both my husband and my sons hair</li>
    <li> The device is just horrible. There was no indication, that this was not a cordless device. who uses devices with cords except barbers nowadays anyway. Had I known about this, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. Had just that been the problem, the product would get 4 stars, not just one. But the trimmer with a cord is just unusable. When turned on, it vibrates like crazy, so much, that if I tried cutting someone&#x27;s hair with it, I would punch me really hard in the face, once they saw the end-product. I don&#x27;t live in the USA, I live in the far outskirts of Eastern Europe and had to get the product by third party shipment company. I can&#x27;t send it back, because it will cost twice as much, as the kit itself. So there you have it, 40 dollars, additional transportation costs included, just lost. The only thing I can actually hope now is to sell it for scrap metal.</li>
    <li> Good product needed a sharper liner but feels durable</li>
    <li> It would be nice if the wireless version was this price, but excellent product that ends up saving me money.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this kit, i would like to say first that the plug in trimmer, accessories and case are great... hence the 2 star rating.  I would now like to address the battery operated trimmer that quit on me yesterday mid use.  It just stopped cutting my hair, the blades dulled out.  Pro haircutting my a** i have had this less than six months and it&#x27;s already dead, this is the second time a wahl product has done this to me.  I&#x27;ll buy another brand next time.</li>
    <li> Good product... Did not test all the features, but seems to be fine...</li>
    <li> i just bought this so i cant tell you if the quality is good, i can just tell you that the times ive used it it just works great, it feels professional, easy to use and the price is even better, idk if this will work out for a business but for personal use i recommend it.</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t believe this was so cheap. i&#x27;ve cut my hair numerous times with this. it gets hot after about 20 to 25 minutes of continuous use. but who uses it that long (i do). but it comes with so many accessories. it&#x27;s the best deal/bargain out there.</li>
    <li> got it for my husband he did&#x27;t use yet,but he loves it.it&#x27;s also the color of his football team pittsburg steelers.thanks alot amazon.</li>
    <li> First time received the hair trimmer had a broken piece from its covering. Amazon was great with rectifying the situation by quickly sending me a new pair in two days. The beard trimmer was great, especially for trimming up the back after using the hair trimmer. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced with lots of attachments.  Works as advertised.  I wish it came with a cape,  but a towel works too.  Start the boys early with a great cut from Dad.  They will appreciated it.</li>
    <li> Very high quality.  Good instructions.  Was able to cut my own hair the first time.  Even my skeptical (and critical) wife was impressed.</li>
    <li> Great product had everything that is shown. everything was is great condition. Works great and look forward to using it again.</li>
    <li> These seem great. I don&#x27;t think I will need anything more intense for my personal use. I buzzed my myself head for the first time ever using this kit and it came out pretty good. It even has instructions on how to give an even haircut which was a plus. All the sizes and everything was spot on.</li>
    <li> Needed a clipper for my husband as his hair was falling out from radiation treatments, and didn&#x27;t want to use the horse clippers! This clipper did the job, painlessly, quickly and affordably. Only one wish would be that the small trimmer come with combs also, as he did not loose his facial hair and needs a way to more uniformly trim the goatee and mustache! Cleans easily also.</li>
    <li> Works well. I was pleasantly surprised so far with the power from the smaller battery powered unit. It is pretty handy to have the smaller size and the cordless option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did just notice the larger clipper get pretty overheated in one spot (probably where a part of the motor sits) the last time I used it. I cut both of my kids hair and trimmed up mine all in a row, so I may have overworked it. I know a more expensive professional model would probably be able to handle that extended session, but this only cost about $20, so I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth. Hopefully it does not overheat every time now.</li>
    <li> I love it I personally cut my boyfriends hair at least once a month and this was just what we needed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Wahl clippers for decades.  My grandmother was a beautician, and she only trusted Wahl... for a good reason... They work, and they last!  This kit I&#x27;ve just purchased is replacing a set of Wahl Pro clippers she bought for me more than 20 years ago!  The old set has cut my hair, my boy&#x27;s hair, trimmed my beard, and I&#x27;ve even used it on the dog more than once... and it&#x27;s still going strong!  I&#x27;m only replacing it because It was honestly cheaper to buy this kit with the battery-trimmer than it was to buy new guide-combs and a new battery trimmer separately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl is outstanding in their build quality... and this kit seems to be top-notch, just like the Pro clipper I&#x27;ve been using (only a bit lighter weight).&lt;br /&gt;The motor is quiet!  The blades are sharp, and cutting is effortless, even on thick hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to remember... keep the guide combs clean (free of residual oil), and do not leave them attached to the clipper for weeks and weeks... they will break if you do this.  If you take good care of the guide combs, they will last for decades (I KNOW).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when oiling the blades before or after use... a tiny drop is all you need... then let the motor run to circulate and spread the oil before use, or before putting them away.  Too much oil will eventually cause the clippers to slow down and can cause the blades to get \\&quot;gummed up\\&quot; and \\&quot;dull\\&quot; feeling.</li>
    <li> only thing i just wished the trimmer had a cord.</li>
    <li> Motor isn&#x27;t very strong and I have to go over the same spots several times to get it even. But ya get what ya pay for. I&#x27;ll stick to buying my professional tools</li>
    <li> Really nice trimmers and lots of guard attachments.  Alot quiter than our previous trimmer which the new one replaces. A+++</li>
    <li> They aren&#x27;t the best clippers I have ever used for sure.  I have paid about $20 and gotten ones that seemed much sharper than these.</li>
    <li> The clipper is really good, cuts smoothly and with little effort, but the additional trimming machine is BATTERY powered, which sucks. Who uses battery based electronics nowadays?? Apparently Wahl does...</li>
    <li> Ver Very Nice product that suits my need.&lt;br /&gt;The Kit is very useful and very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully- we bought this set to replace an older Wahl set that we had for many years- its nice and quiet and cuts well. My boyfriend uses the trimmers every other day and we&#x27;ve used the clippers on my toddlers hair and he loved it too. :)</li>
    <li> Simple to follow directions, easy to use for first time barbers.  Nice carry case will ensure easy storage between haircuts</li>
    <li> The Wahl groom Pro Haircutting kit yellow / Black was a great machine been useing it and its been great</li>
    <li> The hair trimmers work fine.  I pulled out the small trimmers to trim my side burns.  Put batteries in it.  Turned it on and nothing.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Great Buy!! Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Good product..good deal !</li>
    <li> excellent product, all without any problems, I recommend it 100%</li>
    <li> A little too noisy, and vibrates a little too much. Otherwise, it works fine.</li>
    <li> My husband was very pleased with this purchase. These clippers and groomer perform  well and are quality products. If my husband is happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> I selected this product even though there were mixed reviews. Happy I did. It&#x27;s everything I hoped it would be. Definitely would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Being familiar with professional grade clippers – these Wahl clippers will not let you down! For reasons like that is why I gave these clippers five stars for the quality of the product and a price that can&#x27;t be beat! You always hear that saying &amp;#34;You only get what you pay for…&amp;#34; Well that&#x27;s definitely not definitely not the case with these quality clippers because you get well beyond what you pay for. These clippers will not only save you money but at the same time, you get a quality haircut by following simple steps that you might read on the Internet or steps you can follow by watching a YouTube video. Yes, I sent follow a simple YouTube video and you too can become an awesome hair cutter for home and practicing on your spouse and kids :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Excellent quality, quantity and everything you&#x27;d expect to get three times the price, you can get by purchasing a set of these Wahl clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: All I can think of is the fact it didn&#x27;t come with a small chrome for running along the clipper as you cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong by making a purchase of these Wahl clipper kits.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this item,,, I get it a 5 star. good job.&lt;br /&gt;I never regret buying this item. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great haircut kit.&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant about the trimmer not being having the power cord but it&#x27;s no problems. Just put 2 AA rechargeable battery and everything works great.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend to others</li>
    <li> It came with some of the items broken. It was only one and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m gonna use it, but when you buy something you expect everything in good conditions. The main product works well, though.</li>
    <li> The hair trimmer works great!  The only problem is that one of the gaurds were broken when I opened the package.  It is not one that I needed but I hope the others don&#x27;t easily break.  Otherwise I am very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> this product works great it is very easy to work it was a very good purchase.I would buy other Wahl products.</li>
    <li> My husband really loved this product; the tooth cracked on the larger one so I need to order another set.</li>
    <li> Works excellent. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> Great set! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> i use this to trim my beard and get buzz cuts. quite worth it for the price seeing as some barbers would cost $20 for a buzz cut which is already almost the price of this kit. excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Good product! Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut totally evenly, but it gets the job done and makes my husband&#x27;s hair look pretty good!</li>
    <li> I had never cut someone&#x27;s hair before, but since my husband wanted me to try we bought this haircutting kit. I have to say I was really nervous but it was easy to use. The product seems fine and for me it seems of a good quality, but this is the first time I buy a product like this so I have nothing to compare it with. I like that it has its own case and its easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had it for a long time so we will see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> This product was everything we were looking for in a home haircutting and grooming kit.  We love it.  It makes staying close and on top of everything so very easy.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works great. I have not use the clippers yet. I am sure they will work just as well. This is my second set. The first shipped to me the trimmer did not work. Amazon shipped a replacement out very quickly. I am very happy with the service I have received.</li>
    <li> Good morning, large machine produces sound really loud and annoying, I tighten the screws of the razor but still sounds like this is not normal when the hair cutting machines are new, in fact, a cousin just bought one like which I bought, and it does not make that sound so strong...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to contact the seller but I can&#x27;t, cuz the seller is amazon and in my order don&#x27;t have the option &amp;#34;contact seller&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a pretty decent machine, for a good price</li>
    <li> good product, excellent customer service. very responsible and attentive. 5 stars men</li>
    <li> I have to admit, for the money ($23) this is a good razor (the large one).  Works well, has several different length attachments.  Goes through hair well.  I&#x27;ve only used a few times, so can&#x27;t comment on longevity quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller battery operated razor is pretty useless except for thin trimmings, not for cutting hair.  I have a Wahl Peanut (battery) which is way better (closer cut and stronger).  So don&#x27;t buy this for the small, portable razor.</li>
    <li> I like it very much. The attachments allow me to cut my own hair. The price was good and the quality of the tools is not cheaply done.</li>
    <li> This is a nice grooming kit the attachments are all good. They have the very short ones to give me a short cut for the summer.  The little clipper needs AA batteries (2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does make alot of noise</li>
    <li> Love these for cutting my husbands hair they work really good. They are a great buy and you get a great deal for them. Just wish the little ones has a charger or they plugged in too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 3 haircuts in now and it works great.  I also like the beard trimmer better than my electric razor.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Wahl.  Many of my friends have them and have done so for years with no complaints.</li>
    <li> exelent producto very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of hair clipper sets at this price range and I always come back to the Wahl brand. They make affordable, high quality, durable clipper sets that include everything I need for basic beginner hair trimming. The clipper has a good weight and feels sturdy when I use it. The bonus trimmer is great too. I&#x27;m not a professional but I learned to cut both my husband&#x27;s and son&#x27;s hair to save our family a lot of money. My husband is very particular but now he trusts me to cut his hair regularly since it is easy for me to give him a nice hair cut with the Wahl hair clipper set.</li>
    <li> It would have been better if the smaller trimmer wasn&#x27;t Made in China. It broke after a year.</li>
    <li> Great Trimmer set. Easy to use. No problems. Plenty of sizes for lengths of hair.</li>
    <li> Iam a retired hair stylist.  Wahl has always been my favorite</li>
    <li> Excellent! I have been using it for about 7 months and it´s awesome!</li>
    <li> Great product ! Work as it should, comes with a complete package with lots of itens.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t get 5 starts since the portable trimmer used AA batteries, instead of an internal rechargable battery</li>
    <li> Ordered this clipper set after reading the reviews since I was looking tho replace a piece of junk Conair rechargeable I previously had. My wife cut my hair with these and they worked great. The extra trimmer was great for the neck and around my ears. Very happy with my purchase and it was $6.00 cheaper than at my local ___mart store.</li>
    <li> This is a great set! I always buy Wahl clippers, you can never go wrong. This is a replacement for a set that I&#x27;ve had almost four years. They still work great, except I dropped them and broke it.  This is a good deal and looks pretty cool, too. Mini clipper is handy, too.</li>
    <li> We purchased this set of clippers after our old pair died.  We used them for the first time last night and was very happy with the volume of the clippers and the performance of the clippers.  I can only hope that they last as long as our old pair.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper and particularly great for the price. Is is powerful and not very loud. It is also very accurate; however, you might need to adjust the top blade. (Unscrew just one of the top screws and then swivel the blade to align it perfectly with the bottom blade. After aligning, put the screw back and tighten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important! For those of you who want a clipper for very short hair: If you primarily use No.1 and No.2 guides, note that they don&#x27;t transition very well. Meaning... a high No.1 does not precisely transition into a low No. 2. Relatively speaking, there two guides transition as well as most clippers, but if you&#x27;re looking for high end precision (and this is only pertaining to the 1 and 2) you might want to pay for a higher end clipper. To achieve a precise fade between these two guides just angle a high No.1 upwards into the low No. 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very good, but not perfect. It looks sturdy enough to last for years.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy :]</li>
    <li> Bought this and used it one time.  It worked great.  Put it away for a month and then tried to use it and it doesn&#x27;t work.  It turns on but not fast enough to cut hair. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s on low power.  And now I&#x27;m a few days past the refund date so I&#x27;m out my money.  That sucks.  Don&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
    <li> It was such a great value, and I am only using the beard trimmer.  Wish there were a couple more beard trimmer lengths, but still solid for the money spent.</li>
    <li> Everything works fine just make sure not to drop it. I dropped it from 4 feet high and onto carpeting and broke the guard, I am sure super glue would fix it but it was disappointing at the time.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I lost all my hair over these cutters!  No, really, I lost my hair due to age and the balding process, but these cheap Wahls do a nice job of keeping what I do have nice and groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should consider home hair cutting equipment to be &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; for the most part--kind of like printers.  These aren&#x27;t high end and will go bad (noisy at first, then slow down and ultimately stop) over time, but 3-5 years of service for this price ain&#x27;t bad!</li>
    <li> This seemed like a good deal, but I bought it mainly for the little cordless one, and that takes conventional AA batteries and doesn&#x27;t feel that smooth trimming my beard.  So for about $40 at Walmart I got a waterproof full body grooming thing that is so much better, and it has a lithium ion battery that lasts for a really long time.  You should spend some money on a trimmer, or you end up throwing multiple cheap ones into a landfill before you decide to spend more money.</li>
    <li> I have used an Remington trimmer for years but I broke the guard and I was not able to find a replacement for that model so I decided to buy a new one.&lt;br /&gt;the ratings and price of this one were appealing enough so I bought it...&lt;br /&gt;it does come with a lot for the price and it gets the job done but it does not seem so cut as cleanly as my old Remington did. It is not bad enough that I will replace it but i definitely find myself having to make a few more passes over the same spot for stragglers that these clippers did not pick up....</li>
    <li> excelente kit personal me ancanta trae todo lo necesario para el cuidado diario . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> Not the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned and not the worse.Trimmer would be better if could cut closer</li>
    <li> These clippers are &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34;. They are high quality, of course, as they are Wahl clippers. They work very well, and the kids love the color!</li>
    <li> This does a terrific job of cutting and trimming my hair.  It is far better than a previous Norelco set I owned.  Of the sets in the Top 100, this was the best ranked of those which the main clipper was corded, included a separate, battery-operated trimmer, and which had a wide selection of cutting guides.  My main reason for buying this one was the fact that the large clipper is not battery operated.  My old Norelco was a rechargeable and the battery could never hold a charge through even one clipping session.  No such problem with this clipper, nice and powerful.  This works much faster than my old clipper.  I just decided to go from my old hairstyle to a  currently popular very short style.  This trimmer did the job very quickly, and the result was perfect; nice even length all the way around my head.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that unlike my old Norelco; you have to oil the blades on this trimmer, and they are not self-sharpening. That would make this a perfect hair-cutting/trimming tool.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good set of hair clippers. The small one is battery operated and sometime struggles so you have to keep it with fresh batteries to make it work well. The large one is powerful and precise.</li>
    <li> I used to own a cheap set of Remington beard clippers.  When one of the guards broke, I considered just replacing it until I came across this set of clippers.  They are fantastic.  The Small beard trimmer uses a couple of AA batteries and so far has exceeded expectations.  The larger hair clippers are heavy (in a good way, they feel sturdy) and do a great job with trimming my hair.  For $26, you really can&#x27;t beat this set.</li>
    <li> A friend of ours bought this set at a \\&quot;big box store\\&quot; for $59.99 plus tax! This was a heck of a deal and it is heavy duty. The guys in our family have thick curly hair so we needed something that could cut through it and last. The cordless trimmer is perfect for my husband to trim his scruffy beard, even though I like it! And I can trim the back of my sons neck really easily.</li>
    <li> The item Arrived on time. The blades do not snag and batteries in the trimmer last forever! I would reccomend this product</li>
    <li> it seems like the clipper is used. Because it seems that some hair residues are on the clipper. But other stuffs are good.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this often and is happy with it.  I use it to cut his and my son&#x27;s hair sometimes and it works great for fades.  It isn&#x27;t really loud, cord is long enough to move around easily when cutting hair.  Power is fine.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price, did not heat up barely got warm. I had heard that Wahl was a good product, I was not let down.</li>
    <li> I have had short hair a long time and wore out my last Wahl after 10 years - this new cutter is working fine and I hope for 10 years again!</li>
    <li> For the price they are great cuts good it would help if it came with batteries for the edger ok over all</li>
    <li> Bought this few months back Hair cutting machine is good and serves the purpose well but the trimmer is so so, its switch stopped working after few uses, still I should say it meets expectation ,</li>
    <li> Its what I asked for.  I knew it was likely loud, and it is.  Does the job, don&#x27;t need no batteries for the big one, no real complaints.</li>
    <li> I have purchased other hair clippers before and used it for over four years which was great, only about $35 and it lasted a long time. However this product was cheaper and does a much better job, probably because it is new. Regardless, the clippers are sharp and precise. My hair is cut more consistently and faster with the premium blade and powerful motor. The added cordless trimmer is a huge asset in this package, allowing for optimum trimming about the ears and facial hair trimming in a short amount of time. I highly recommend this for those who do simple haircuts at home and want a quality product that appears will last for many years to come.</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive home hair cutting kit, this is a well presented set-up.  I like the fact that it comes in a compact transport case.&lt;br /&gt;However, upon receipt of the kit, make sure to test out the units immediately.  In my case, everything was good, except the battery powered trimmer worked fine, until I tried using it inverted (blades pointing down).  The motor started vibrating excessively &amp; sounding ragged, as if the internal motor wasn&#x27;t properly secured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as a redeeming feature:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notified Wahl directly &amp; they replaced that unit immediately, at no charge, &amp; it works fine, with just a request that I send the defective unit back for them (on their dime) to evaluate.  I recommend Wahl products, for that very reason.  They stand behind their products.  That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t see that often in today&#x27;s world.</li>
    <li> The cord is not long enough and it doesn&#x27;t cut the hair good and not enough power</li>
    <li> Blades need to sharpen</li>
    <li> GOOD Deal!!!! Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wahl Chrome for over a decade and love it.  The blades needed replaced (Pulling a bit and my son was fussing) so I went to get replacement blades and found this clipper for just a few more dollars than the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quality:&lt;br /&gt;The main clippers appear to be of equal quality to my old chrome clippers, and the fussing from my son has been greatly reduced.  Fells solid and for me it has a great weight, it may be a little heavy for some people, but it is so well balanced I think it would be comfortable for most.  the grips are well shaped and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ROI:&lt;br /&gt;This set comes with everything you need to start cutting your families hair.  I do not use all of the the guides as I tend to just toss on the 1/2 and buss all of my hair and my sons.  The cost savings is phenomenal, I cut my hair and my sons, but my wife and daughter go to the salon.  Each of their haircuts cost the same as this clipper set (at a minimum) so for the price of one haircut I cut two peoples hair for a decade, as Nike use to say \\&quot;Just do it\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disappointing:&lt;br /&gt;Cordless touch-up trimmer: I have tried several times with different sets of batteries and never got this trimmer to so much as make a noise, let alone turn on.  I know I can send in for warranty and Wahl would most likely replace, but I have another trimmer I love, so I just let it go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;So unlike most things I have bought 10 years apart, it appears the quality of the Wahl has not degraded, which is great.  The cordless touch-up trimmer was a disappointment (thus the loss of a star) if this had been what I bought the package for I would be much more disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wahl complete grooming kit. Hair clippers come complete with guides for that perfect cut.  The beard and mustache groomer is cordless to make life easy.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Husband uses these for shaving head and couldn&#x27;t use this for even one full cut. Pulls on even very short hair. Had to immediately buy another one. Very disappointing since we love wahl products.</li>
    <li> these are good and I love this brand.</li>
    <li> This is the product I was looking for,&lt;br /&gt;It is a good choice: two machines for differents objetives.&lt;br /&gt;It´s a long life product.</li>
    <li> This will get the job done, but it feels pretty cheap in your hand and can over heat very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that if you have a budget, buy this product. If you don&#x27;t have a budget, buy a higher end WAHL device (I love WAHL trimmers).</li>
    <li> It works as expected.  The side lever for close to longer is nice.</li>
    <li> While this is a good set of clippers, and pretty decent value, my main complaint is that some of the &amp;#34;guide combs&amp;#34; don&#x27;t seat tightly against the clipper head and vibrate very loudly.  To clarify, they&#x27;re not loos as in they&#x27;re going to fall off.  No, they&#x27;re very tightly locked on, but the lock isn&#x27;t tight against the body of the clippers and allows for probably less than a millimeter of area for them to vibrate.  Not all of them do this...the coule I use most do though and it is extremely annoying.  While I don&#x27;t think this makes them any less usable, it was enough for me to take a star off.  otherwise, they cut great...better than my previous Conair brand clippers I had used for 5+ years.  The included trimmer is very good...much better than I was expecting.  It is very powerful and feels solid.  In fact, the whole set feels solidly built.  Overall, this set is a good value...even if it is slightly annoying to listen to.</li>
    <li> excellent product, but came with a huge box, that it was twive the size of the trimmer box</li>
    <li> I bought these after my other clippers died that were Wahl. The old ones lasted about 6 or 7 years. Not bad for the price of one haircut. In the mean time I bought some Conair ones and hated them. I get my haircut every two weeks so this is very much more cost effective then going to the barber shop. The clippers seem very sturdy and well made. The green 1/16th guide is great. Before the smallest I had was the #1 1/8. The set comes with everything needed to give a professional haircut. The small hand held clippers do a good job in trimming the neck line and side burns. I cut my own hair and my son&#x27;s hair faster and better with these clippers then the old Conair ones I was using. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand except for Wahl now. I would recommend to anyone looking to cut their hair at home.</li>
    <li> Cuts well in the right hands.  Definitely need some practice before I take my barbering skills on the road.  But overall the product is easy to use and well constructed.</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of tools and such to cut hair and trim the facial and body hair.  Good product!</li>
    <li> Love them and works great thank you</li>
    <li> because i bought it for the wireless trimmer, but when i received it, it didn&#x27;t work. otherwise its a great product!</li>
    <li> It makes a whole lot noise comparing to my old  wahl set and I returned it after my first try.</li>
    <li> Everything you need to cut hair (minus scissors, bought those separately). Plus it&#x27;s yellow, which is also awesome. Everything worked great and fit together nicely. Good product.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair (what&#x27;s left of it) and have been using the same Conair clipper for 10 years.  The blades are dull and I can&#x27;t find a replacement set of blades, so I figured I&#x27;d get this one.  The small battery powered trimmer works wonderfully.  the larger electric trimmers barely cut.  I&#x27;ve cut my hair the first time and it worked.  Since then it pulls at the hair more than cuts and it takes 20 passes to get all the hair.  Not worth it.  At this point I&#x27;ll relegate it to trimming the matted hair off my dog.  It seems to work ok without any guides, but is useless with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good assortment of guides however.</li>
    <li> Love the case and all the gadgets that come with it.  I cut my boyfriends hair and this makes it so much easier especially having all the specific guards.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the brand name Wahl. I have had good luck with the Wahl brand and I just used this the other day to shave my sons head. worked wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality clippers for your basic essentials and average user. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t really work as I&#x27;d like it to but other than that this product is worth the money.</li>
    <li> Pros, Works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons. only con i can think of is the mobile unit in this set does drain the AA batteries when it is not being used. so you might want to switch the batteries around when you are not using it or it will constantly be dead and need new batteries after 2 days.</li>
    <li> muy buen articulo compre desde venezuela saludos</li>
    <li> The truth is very good product the machine is very good and work in perfect condition all accessories, I am very satisfied, the truth if it was what I expected., Delivery was done on a part-time line and although I am in another country in May the weather was anything but still is a very good product Wahl 79520-3101 Groom Pro Haircutting Kit, Yellow / black, 22-Count power very good and comfortable, has a weight average so to speak</li>
    <li> they work pretty well</li>
    <li> Definitely a worth while purchase. It&#x27;s sharpness is a little intimidating at first but once you establish a steady hand and pattern it cuts really well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> bought one for my son on Chrismas,,,My bf fell in love with it so I bought him one as well....I don&#x27;t use it but they seem to love it so A++ Thank You!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for over a year now to cut my husbands hair which he gets done twice a month.  They still work as good as the day I bought them.</li>
    <li> He loves this set, it works great</li>
    <li> I was expecting a better quality since the product&#x27;s brand is Wahl. Don&#x27;t even bother about the case cause it&#x27;s really bad.&lt;br /&gt;For $25 the product is ok. No ways I&#x27;d pay $49.99 for this one.</li>
    <li> Buen producto, 100% recomendado.</li>
    <li> It was what I expected works great</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the duel units in the kit.</li>
    <li> I have used both clippers twice since I&#x27;ve bought them and I&#x27;m impressed. They work flawlessly and have lots of ends for the desired length/style. I oil the blades before each use to ensure longevity. Highly satisfied and would recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not working at all, it makes extremely loud noise and it&#x27;s useless. As I think it&#x27;s not for australia electricity system because when plug it in it burned out straight. Even I couldn&#x27;t use once this machine. In fact I waste my money on it and I am not going to buy anything from this company.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and was exactly as expected as advertised</li>
    <li> I was skeptical on the battery operated clippers but was very surprised on how easy it cut my hair. I was so impressed that I bought a second set.</li>
    <li> It works good, has a ton of attachments, and a carrying case.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad clippers but they don&#x27;t cut as close as the use to. I have an older pair of wahls that can be adjusted close enough to edge and trim beards and mustache.</li>
    <li> I used the trimmer first to have a clean shave of my beard.It was great but with a bit of noise. Trimmer uses 2 AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is the best you can get in this cost and I am loving the case it came with to carry all the 22 parts when I go out of town with me.</li>
    <li> Best clippers for the price. They are decently sized, mind you I have child sized hands and are pretty light compared to other clippers. Do a great job and never pull hair and don&#x27;t get hot super easily.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them!</li>
    <li> The small one it&#x27;s no rechargeable</li>
    <li> THE TRIMERS DID NOT WORK.WOULD NOT EVEN COME ON</li>
    <li> u cant beat it,  it pays for itself</li>
    <li> Not perfelt but perfect for a beginner.</li>
    <li> Great products for all your hair needs. The hair clippers are electric while the trimmer uses two AA batteries. They both do a nice job at a very affordable price and come with a variety of attachments and a nice black plastic carrying case. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Easy to clean. Fast. Be careful with the shapes...everything is ok. You can buy it without questions. Great price</li>
    <li> Rusted really quickly and lost its edge.  Had to send it back to the maker and it took a few weeks to get it back.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for a v-day gift and he loves them. He ahd a Wahl set before for years and it finally gave out on him, but loves his replacements. Will save us lots of money since we have a house full of boys with hair that always seems to need to be cut.</li>
    <li> The 2 trimmer guide combs of the cordless touch-up trimmer were missing, not in the box</li>
    <li> Loves it! Great gift to him...</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, just needed something as my old clippers plastic guide had broke and I didn&#x27;t want yet another chunk taken out of the back, work frowns upon that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thought?  Yellow, freaking yellow?  Why on God&#x27;s green Earth would you make these YELLOW, I HATE HELLO!  I&#x27;m a Seahawks fan, I don&#x27;t want Steelers clippers.  But I digress.  They came in, I slapped a Hawks sticker on them and they cut my hair great.  That&#x27;s what matters in the long run, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little black rubber dots cave in and feel a bit cheap, but the actual guides on the big razor are a bit longer and allow me to literally shave men entire head over twice as fast, plus it has more torque than I though, which is great.  The beard trimmer also does it&#x27;s job.  I have rechargeable batteries so that&#x27;s not an issue.  I charge them once a week and it stays at full power.</li>
    <li> I bought this clipper set so that I could give my boys haircuts and save some money. These are very good quality. My last set of clippers actually pulled at their hair and was very difficult to give them a decent hair cut. (They have very thick hair) This set did not have this problem. Plus I like the fact I can edge their hair up easily with the other attachment included. I love these and would defiantly recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is too noisy,  and the size is kind of too large to make accurate cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair clipper is nice and works fine.</li>
    <li> Really great--easy to use and fun. Many attachments make it easy to cut hair of any length. Pays for itself after one or two cuts.</li>
    <li> The trim pro arrived in a timely manner with no damage.  The trimmers function very well and are exactly what I was seeking.  The description of the product was right on and accurate.</li>
    <li> Product is sold at WalMart for a little bit more, but shipping is so quick - no need to pay more than you have to. Purchased these for my brother and he is in love with them. Says they&#x27;re the best set of clippers he&#x27;s ever owned. Happy brother, happy customer!</li>
    <li> Love this set!  I&#x27;m not a pro at cutting hair by any stretch of the imagination, but these get the job done.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and product.</li>
    <li> I does a good job for people who want some semi-decent clippers, but for precision sake and use for people that want to keep their hair close to the their skin as possible. Not the right product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cheap, convenience and quality. I cut hair for my son and my husband. No need getting line at hair salon. I&#x27;ve also learned a new job. Very happy to do this for my family.</li>
    <li> These are not that bad...but once you try the best you wont regret it: http://amzn.to/1K8KQ4B</li>
    <li> As stated, it was a great deal...a really good find. Wahl has a good name and my son loves it.</li>
    <li> I really like this item it comes with two trimmers one small and a regular size it works great sometimes it may overheat a little but I can deal with it. price is right</li>
    <li> I opened this packet as soon as i received it. Found out the small trimmer did not work, i opened it up and found the positive switch was not even close to making a full circuit. Soldered a amall rod into it and works fine. Hope no one goes through that.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly reccommend it, cuts well and has numerous attachments. Used it a few times and I am very satisfied with the cut</li>
    <li> You get what you may expect for the price. The clippers work very well, and as far as this college student is concerned it does everything necessary for a good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading other reviews. It was a good purchase, and I am really happy with this product.</li>
    <li> it gave my husband and he is very happy, very practical, comfortable and rustic is not when shaving. really recommend it.</li>
    <li> This item is GREAT!! It is 100% better than I thought.  I was expecting a clipper and must have missed it included a trimmer.  This is better than the Conair we had and the one we compared this product to for the same price. I would buy this product again over any other brand.  Thanks :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic about ordering this set after reading some of the reviews but after receiving this kit I have found that it works perfectly! I use it on my husband and 16 month old son. It wasn&#x27;t nearly as loud as some of the other reviews suggested and having the trimmer is a bonus! I was worried about them being battery powered but they get the job done! My husband uses the trimmers on a weekly basis and hasnt had to replace the batteries yet. All in all this is a great kit- especially for the cost!</li>
    <li> Broke after first use</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely fashion, was well packaged, contained everything it was supposed to AND everything worked. I also thought it was a fair price.</li>
    <li> Clippers were a little more than a three, trimmers have an electrial problem,  doesn&#x27;t always turn on.</li>
    <li> La Maquina pequeña nunca funciono llego defectuosa</li>
    <li> I dont like the small beard machine its like a small toy and works with two batteries &#x3D;/ I dont recommend it to buy it if you look for a great beard shaver</li>
    <li> works great...does what it supposed to do</li>
    <li> My wife cuts what is left of my hair and this Wahl product does a great job. It fits in her hand well and the blades seem to be very sharp.  The smaller trimmer is &amp;#34;just ok&amp;#34;. I wish it was chargeable but it runs on AA batteries and it is only as good as the batteries are strong. I should probably invest in rechargeable batteries.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving kit. Comes with many different sizes and has the beard trimmer that works well.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to replace our aging clippers. They work good but are very loud. The carry case could use a lot of work. It has no compartments so everything is just thrown into it. Compartments would have been nice. I kept my old case to keep things organized.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase and will use it. Gave it a 4 star for a reason, like title over all good. But small clippers is not rechargeable. It needs batteries. Wish it would have said that in description. Saw other reviews and no mention of it. Just needed a basic clipper set for a great price and that is what I got. And will enjoy it and use it, and when I am ready will upgrade to better professional clippers.</li>
    <li> I found them very easy to use, they&#x27;re sharp and they work great. The cordless touch-up trimmer is a handy bonus too.</li>
    <li> very good and durable, easy to use and very versatile, very fair price for what it offers. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoin as i do</li>
    <li> works great, have had no issues and the wireless mini clipper is a nice convenient addition to the solid corded clipper.</li>
    <li> Excellent set, I have used and really like the feel of this</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for beard trimming. He uses it often, and it charges quickly. No complaints here!</li>
    <li> Love this set, and at a fantastic price, too! Great to have around when you need a quick trim but can&#x27;t get to your regular shop. The beard/moustache trimmer was a big plus!!</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FOR BILL HE LOVES IT HAS ALL THE ACCESSORIES AND A KIT TO CARRY IT IN CAME REALLY QUICK AND HE HAD A JOB INTERVIEW HIS CLIPPERS BROKE SO HE HAD TO GET SOMETHING FAST AND THEY CAME IN TWO DAYS REALLY MADE HIS DAY AND HE GOT THE JOB THANKS AMAZON  YOU ROCK!!!</li>
    <li> The product came to me well and on time, without any problem, I&#x27;m already using and it works perfectly, totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Wahl makes quality clippers, but this is not one of them. The large clippers are mediocre at best and the trimmer is so loud it&#x27;s just ridiculous. They should be lucky I&#x27;m even giving them one star because they don&#x27;t deserve any stars for selling a clipper set like this. This set is good if you don&#x27;t have anything else and you don&#x27;t need a trimmer. If you want clippers pay the extra 20  or 30 bucks and get a higher quality set. I&#x27;ve been using Wahl clippers for decades so I&#x27;m very familiar with the brand. I only purchased this inexpensive set because I was unaware that Wahl would sell junk considering that they&#x27;ve been in the clipper business for ages. This is clearly one of those cases where you get what you pay for. :-(</li>
    <li> Cheap piece of junk. Shame on you Wahl.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these to cut his hair and trim his beard.  The guides make it quick and easy  He had a Norelco shaver, but he really didn&#x27;t use it much except around the edges  The little trimmer is perfect even for his beard(he gets pretty fancy with his styles).  We like Wahl the best- if you clean and oil them, their trimmers will last for years.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Shipment was fast!</li>
    <li> used this on my husbands hair and then on my 7 year old grandson.  works well and with a little practice will be quicker.</li>
    <li> its a pleasure working with my own clippers i love them</li>
    <li> Hair clipper Cuts hair evenly, doesn&#x27;t make munch noise and does not overheat ,remember oil both products before use. as for the mini trimmer works great for being battery operated. It is also cuts really good . It requires 2 AA batteries not included</li>
    <li> The clippers themselves are heavy, loud and get very hot. They cut OK for the price but you definitely get what you pay for. The trimmer? Worthless... And cut the back of my son&#x27;s neck.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought it because of the little trimmer, i thought i was going to be quiet but its loud ehh still does the job!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy/pleased with this product. I oil the blades before each use and it has been working great. I use this to cut my son&#x27;s hair and it pays for itself in three or four cuts.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I should have believed the other reviews. The clippers are average at best, and the trimmers are worthless. Pass on theear</li>
    <li> Wahl products have always been my preferred choice of equipment.  Ordered this set to maintain my kids hair for the last one we had just broke.  Chose this one for it offered flexibility with a second one to run off batteries.  we have Amazon prime so the items we ordered arrived on time.  My disappointment is from the shipper, not sure what happened completely if a previous customer ordered the set I received and returned them after they tried them out.  Or if someone at the factory tried them....either way I received a set of clippers that had been used on someone&#x27;s else&#x27;s head, you shouldn&#x27;t be expected to pay for an item sent to you in this condition.</li>
    <li> it is nice, worth the price. I can cut my hair myself, works well and easy to operated. I love it!</li>
    <li> Es una buena cortadora de pelo. Además tiene muchos accesorios y una maquina extra. Recomiendo esta maquina 100%. Works good.</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmers as always from wahl!</li>
    <li> Hi,recently I get my package. when you open the box with the machine everything seemed to be fine .. I then set the machine to cut hair has a knock on the front. I wonder what has happened</li>
    <li> Great item! I&#x27;m still learning how to use it properly lol but I&#x27;ve used it twice and was pleased with results!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as an XMAS gift for my Brother in law. He used it once and it has stopped working. We have not gotten it to work since., Wow, really? A one time use system eh?  Very disappointing and not worth my time to even send back.</li>
    <li> Am currently stationed overseas and my power is 220v split, so it is out of phase for 110v.  Even my current Conair clippers, which worked fine for 3.5 yrs, let me adjust to compensate for the current/voltage differences.  The Wahl would not adjust on any screw setting, constant loud buzzing from clippers.</li>
    <li> the small razor did not work at all.  Some of the fitting did not fit right and would rattle when turned on.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my father for Christmas and he is happy with it Love the yellow color very happy!</li>
    <li> This is a good kit and the price is really good. I would recommend this to anyone who has a husband who keeps his hair short!</li>
    <li> Love this as it has both size trimmers in the box. However I do wish that they would have included just one more, smaller attachment comb guard for the small clippers. Just need them to go down one more size on that to make sure that boo boo&#x27;s don&#x27;t happen at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I love this. Easy to clean the blades, and love that there are so many different sized big combs included in the kit. The big trimmers are quiet and cut very well. The smaller trimmers are pretty loud, but that is to be expected. They also cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great having these around instead of having to go to the salon and pay to get a haircut.</li>
    <li> As described, a lot of product for the money!</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase for a great price. No complaints. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all there, everything you need to cut their own hair. The quality of the large razor is great, not too loud either. I have yet to use the smaller razor, but I would like to point out that it is powered by 2 AA batteries. I have not seen a razor powered by AA batteries before, but if they&#x27;re able to last a decent amount of time this would be a great razor for travelers.</li>
    <li> The clippers are very good and easy to use.  Good product for a good price after looking at other sites and in retail stores.</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I have no info to share. It was sent to the Philippines to help out.</li>
    <li> This is our third Wahl  haircutting kit over the last 20 years. Solid product that lasts. We now use it for our 5 year old who loves to look like Dad.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair clipper kit. The first time my wife gave me a haircut it turned out great. The trimmer does a fine job on my beard. The clipper and trimmer both feel and look like good quality pieces. Only time will tell how they hold up. This kit included more attachments than we&#x27;ll ever use. The storage case is a bit flimsy but works well to keep everything together in one place.</li>
    <li> These clippers are not no good at they bite and it takes forever to cut or trim your hair had them on for not even 5 min and the blade was super hot</li>
    <li> Not professional quality buy I&#x27;m not a professional barber.  Works great for me and the price was unbeatable. Would recomend for anyone who wants personal hair cutting tools.</li>
    <li> Good product at a great price. Shipped as promised, arrived on time with good packaging</li>
    <li> Good clippers and great price. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these if you&#x27;re looking to save $ on haircuts. Love the trimmer too!</li>
    <li> We previously owned the &amp;#34;color coded&amp;#34; Wahl hair cutting kit.  It was much better than this one.  Wish I would have purchased it again.  This one is loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as well as our old set.</li>
    <li> Only used it for two haircuts so far, but it works great and I&#x27;ve already saved more in barber costs than what it cost to buy the clippers.  Fantastic set with lots of pieces for a great price.  Both clippers seem to be good quality.  If I could change anything, I would opt for a corded trimmer (clipper is corded, trimmer is batteries).</li>
    <li> I really like it and it cuts great.</li>
    <li> Great Product if you need one get this pair.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed that the trimmers are battery operated, the box nor the seller gave info that they were battery operated or cordless. Had I Known they were battery operated I would not have purchased. I have not used either the clipper or the trimmer.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY CUT MY HAIR WELL</li>
    <li> Awesome  would recommend and buy again</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Great set for the price.</li>
    <li> Could not trim accurate lines like my old wahl peanut, returned it and ordered another peanut trimmer</li>
    <li> These clippers worked great! They adjusted easily and were sharp enough the cut easily. I would have liked to have seen a pair of hair scissors with the kit but other than that, no problems.</li>
    <li> I dont like this I prefer CONAIR</li>
    <li> Good cutters... have had them for a while now with no problems...</li>
    <li> Great product and deal though I have always been a fan of wahl products. They are always trusted. The trimmer is battery operated but it does the work for me.</li>
    <li> He uses it all the time and loves it.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> its a good seller. Recomended</li>
    <li> Great set for the money. Easily cut through hair and fairly quiet. The small one uses batteries and does a pretty good job as well. Of course, they are not salon grade but great for home use.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need nothing fancy. You get more than what you need for the price. Nice clippers. No issues after 3 months of use.</li>
    <li> My son loves this clipper set, so many attachments and the little clipper is a bonus.  The motor is strong and clips hair with ease.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product.  It came as advertized.  If needed I plan on buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Always satisfied with Wahl products. I enjoy the quality of the results their products produce as far as how they cut and and well balanced the clippers are. They do not pull the hair, and somewhat quiet.</li>
    <li> La maquina es perfecta, muy duradera, bastante eficiente y profesional, a demás el estuche y los accesorios son maravillosos para realizar diferentes corte, bastante fácil de usar. gracias</li>
    <li> The hair clipper is solid and clips hair nicely. Doesnt get warm. Although it looks  a little cheap on the outide compared to my previous clipper, it still does the job. The only problem is that its a little loud, compared to the previous Wahl clipper i owned before. The small trimmer is excellent for touch ups and trimming the beard. All in all, the kit is very good for the its price.</li>
    <li> they r great for about 6 cut then the mess up starts ripping ur hair clips r cheep junk that breaks</li>
    <li> I have to say how disappointed I am. I opened the package today and first hint was that there was a piece of clear tape over the seal. I opened up the box and noticed the large clippers were not wrapped in plastic as everything else in the box was. On closer inspection I noticed little shavings of black hair on the clippers and also greasy fingerprints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty shocked that this was trying to be passed off as new. Contacted Amazon and they are sending me a return label. But thought others should be aware of the issue I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Have to say I am impressed with customer service though. The response was pretty much instantaneous. Will respond with more feedback once replacement is received.</li>
    <li> as per the product given in site .its good and the packing fablous.............. great to have it more in all its good for household.</li>
    <li> My mother is a beautician and has always used Wahl professional products in her shop. I have extremely thick facial hair and can grow a beard from smooth in about 5 days. So, I go through a LOT of beard trimmers. This time I opted to upgrade to the full size clippers and these have not disappointed. A ton of guards and the little trimmers are very powerful as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect set of trimmers for an amateur.</li>
    <li> My boys are now well into their teens, and cutting their hair since they were babies has saved me a small fortune. This will be only my second pair of Wahl clippers. With care, they&#x27;re built to last. My original clippers finally bit the dust after three weekly haircuts including myself for the past 17 years. That totals out to just over 2650 (17 years x 52 weeks x 3 of us) haircuts. If you take the average cost of a men&#x27;s haircut at $20, it&#x27;s saved me $52,965 minus cost of clippers.  UPDATE: As stated before, I&#x27;ve always used Wahl clippers and they&#x27;ve been the best. HOWEVER, these clippers get really hot after only using them for a few minutes. Unfortunately I&#x27;m past the return date to Amazon.   So FIVE STARS for Wahl clippers in general. Two stars for these particular clippers.</li>
    <li> The best clippers around.</li>
    <li> todo perfecto la maquina cumple con las especificidades requeridas, y el tiempo de entrega fue excelente, gracias por la responsabilidad</li>
    <li> Not professional by any means, but a good product for some basic grooming.  I was disappointed that the small trimmer took two AA batteries (maybe I just didnt read the description closely enough).</li>
    <li> The reason I am giving these clippers a two star rating is because the cordless battery operated clipper doesn&#x27;t work after I used them the first time. I have tried everything, replacing the batteries, inserting then removing the batteries....everything.  No go.  The time to return the clippers expired before I needed to use the clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;The corded clipper leaves some straggler hairs too.&lt;br /&gt;Rather disappointed as Wahl normally has good products.</li>
    <li> I use them all the time and they haven&#x27;t let me down yet. i also liked the case and little trimmer that came with. very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Damn good shears about the best with out going to get your hair cut</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift.  When I last heard from the person that we gave it to the comment was &amp;#34;I really like it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a wahl before so i thought i would go all out and i think the correct choice was made. I only wish it came with a bigger brush but with all the other bundled accessories that really isnt a big deal. I would recomend this to anyone, no exceptions.</li>
    <li> Got this at the end of November, used it twice before a loud buzzing sound is heard every time its turned on.&lt;br /&gt;Followed the instructions to oil it as well but after 2 uses, it is too loud to use near someone&#x27;s ears.  I going to reach out&lt;br /&gt;to Wahl company as this is beyond the Amazon return window.</li>
    <li> my hubby loves it. had it for months no downfall whatsoever. i will always look forward to ordering from here</li>
    <li> After watching a few YouTube videos, my wife was able to give me a good haircut. She has given me three haircuts already, she is getting better all the time. Its a good machine and the kit has everything you need.</li>
    <li> This kit is great it has all that you there are no other gaurds needed and then throwing in the beard trimmer took the kit over the top.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of starter clippers, Wahl is the best in clipper and this is an awesome price for this high quality!</li>
    <li> Like that it came with 2 different trimmer. Great value for the money and I needed both of the trimmers.</li>
    <li> the small machine cuts your skin everytime</li>
    <li> just got it today after ordering it on PRIMEDAY! so far so good</li>
    <li> The cordless clippers broke on my after about 5 uses. I replaced the battery numerous times and they just don&#x27;t work :(</li>
    <li> After three haircuts the blades were uneven. Unable to straighten both blades because one is held in place (balances on top of) by a piece of plastic. Impossible to align the cutting blades for a straight cut. The vibration of the trimmer throws off any alignment every time.</li>
    <li> Good powerful clippers.  I have used them weekly for over the past year and have no complaints.  Much better than the last set I bought at a local store for virtually the same price.</li>
    <li> so far so good. nice and sharp. the little one didnt come with batteries though, so we havent used that part yet.</li>
    <li> Awesome little trimmers for the money.</li>
    <li> Great deal and works like a charm</li>
    <li> This was for me love them</li>
    <li> I started doing home haircuts. This kit provied the needed instruction on how to do a haircut correctly. I would recommend this kit for anyone who wants to do hone haircuts.</li>
    <li> Great value ...I use this often and it gets the job done well.  Strongly recommend it.</li>
    <li> buenos d&amp;iacute;as gracias por el producto estoy muy satisfecho,la entrega fue rapida como estaba indicada en la compra bay hasta luego</li>
    <li> Buzzer works great, but you can see that the item itself is cheaply made. The battery powered trimmers didn&#x27;t work right out of the package. It honestly wasn&#x27;t worth returning the entire case for only the trimmers, so we kept it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. This is product well made.</li>
    <li> Very good clippers. Once adjust them correctly, they&#x27;re quiet and easy to handle. Comes with attachments, protectors, scissors, and oil, and comb. The edgers, edges just perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and so far he loves it. Gives a good shave and has nice options for leaving hair longer if you want. Would suggest getting oil with it</li>
    <li> THIS MACHINE IS VERY NOISE, NOT CUT FINE THE HAIR, VERY RUSTIC , THIS IS BAD PRODUCT, DONT PURCHASING PLEASE!!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!! THANKS</li>
    <li> Perfect for son and I to use to cut hair. Love Wahl brand and no complaints. Now I can cut hair at anytime and no more waiting in barber shop.</li>
    <li> I use this kit approximately three times a month to trim my husband&#x27;s hair.  I like the number of attachments, but I like the cord-free&lt;br /&gt;slim unit for trimming around the ears and cleaning up the neckline.  The unit overall, is versatile yet simple enough for a non-professional to use.</li>
    <li> it a good..... much better than a pair of other clippers i bought. the trimmer works well. easy to clean an maintain.</li>
    <li> the hair clippers are great the trimmer not so much the guard broke almost immediately and since it runs off batteries the life isnt very long I do recommend the hair trimmers though</li>
    <li> I have been buying these things for 20 years. This is by far the best one I have ever owned and it was only $15. The portable is nice for quick touch ups but nothing fancy, I don&#x27;t even use it anymore.</li>
    <li> very professional and very good for its price!</li>
    <li> Product met my expectations. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, my husband has thick hair and it cut right thur it with no problem</li>
    <li> Very nice.  It gets lots of use.</li>
    <li> Bought these to replace the set I had. Was worried when I saw the very cheap price. Item is very good and the carry case holds everything perfectly. Cuts very smooth. No snags at all.</li>
    <li> This is a great clipper set. It has lots of attachments and includes a personal trimmer if you have a beard.</li>
    <li> No more bad haircuts from the salon, I can cut my hair poorly at home now. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;m poo at cutting hair, not because the trimmers suck, the trimmers are actually quite good.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t have time to go to the Barber Shop and my kid&#x27;s hair is looking like nobody loves them. It can save you a trip to the Barber Shop once in a while. But since this Item gets Hot very easy and It nothing like what the real barber shop uses. Also keeps getting Clogged from hair got constantly keep turning off and cleaning off the head with a brush to get from getting clogged up with hair</li>
    <li> Great value for money! Love the design and color. Smooth cut, used once so far. Not tried the trimmer yet. Looking forward to my next hair cut.</li>
    <li> Works great. Very nice quality for the price. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> Set on Fire!...i had so much high hopes for this product but after plugging it in and turning down the voltage I began to try and shave my head. In a matter of seconds i smelt burning and then they made a load bang, flashed a light and blew up in my (out of my) hand!...I am lucky i haven&#x27;t received burns to my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame as the small beard trimmer was great to use!</li>
    <li> This is a perfect deal for a clipper, as it includes the tiny one for details. The machines work great although the little one eats through batteries really fast, so that&#x27;s why I am deducting one star from the review. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great combo that performs as well as I expected it to and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Pure junk I will not recomend it to nobody</li>
    <li> Not to happy with this product was EXTREAMELY loud and didn&#x27;t cut evenly</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as higher powered buzzers.  This set also broke after about 10 cuts.</li>
    <li> Good professional sturdy set. Price beats eBay&#x27;s identical item, at that time, by one-half!</li>
    <li> Great but realize this is premium High-powered set.  Not for light trimming.  I think I could shave a goat with these things!! :-)</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Wahl quality</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair. This is the second set of these I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s cheaper to replace these then service or replace blades. At $20 for the set it&#x27;s an easy buy.</li>
    <li> Good day. buy this product which I think is pretty good .. only in such detail as the little machine, does not work, although he has placed several batteries diferebtes Double A. I would appreciate your cooperation model preformed to correct the fault.

    <li> This is the best trimmer i have found.  Using the hair trimmer on a half-inch for my beard is perfect with no snagging or any pull/irritation.  Only thing the combo could use is a scissors and clippercide.</li>
    <li> I received it yesterday and just used it for the first time today. I must admitt this is my first time using a clipper and trimmer, therefore I cannot compare with other products, but they cut very well so far, and are VERY easy to use.</li>
    <li> These things kick butt.  Yes they are just clippers but I&#x27;ve had a couple sets and these are far and away the best I&#x27;ve owned.  Very powerful barbershop style main clipper, and even the trimmer has plenty of juice.  Can&#x27;t be beat for the price.</li>
    <li> With great regret&lt;br /&gt;The popular site such as amazon&lt;br /&gt;Does not write all the information about the product&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product but does not function here in my&lt;br /&gt;Because only works on a certain 120-volt electricity&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time they deceived&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Make sure their products&lt;br /&gt;Because it is one of the best global positioning&lt;br /&gt;The market continued shopping because it is better and better all the other shopping sites&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I can not use the product</li>
    <li> Very good product. I have owned a Wahl brand forever and have never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery ! Perfect set</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago and I still use it today. I wish the cordless used an internal rechargeable battery but it works great.</li>
    <li> little clippers are crap&lt;br /&gt;large clipper is basic</li>
    <li> I love wahl clippers I got my husband a pair a few years ago and he loved them and they still work great. So I got my son a pair for christmas this year and I know he will love them two</li>
    <li> Great choice if you want cut your hair yourself. The little machine use battery and forces to you to buy batteries all time.</li>
    <li> Wonderful my husband loved them . Bought them for Christmas.  He said they were just what he needed. Great product</li>
    <li> I wish that I spent a little more money.  I bought these because I thought that new clippers couldn&#x27;t possibly be worse than my 10 year old pair.  They are pretty bad.  They miss a lot of small hair.  I cut my own hair, no guard, once every 2 weeks.  So I want it to be fast and not miss anything.  These are not good clippers.  I recommend you spend a little more money and get a good pair.</li>
    <li> This product was perfect for what I needed. Cuts through thick hair easily and the plastic blades aren&#x27;t that cheap feeling as others say. It is a bit heavy and loud, but if you don&#x27;t use it every day, it&#x27;s acceptable.</li>
    <li> Everything is as described. Cannot go wrong with Wahl. The regular clippers and trimmer works well. Have not had to use any attachments but they seem well enough.</li>
    <li> Gives a great trim and the price is outstanding for both.</li>
    <li> i got this hair cutting kit  today and used it did a great job,trimmer also included which i didnt use .According to the product MADE IN THE USA thats thumbs up.Also i liked the sturdy feeling of the unit and the instructions and the website were&lt;br /&gt;excellent.Everything s was in the box like the ad said.nice carrying case.great buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later wanted to use trimmer but it didnt work right out of the box.trimmer made in china haircutter made in the US.</li>
    <li> The item arrived on time and no issues with packaging.  I opened the box and everything looked good.  Put batteries in the cordless unit and I did not work at all.  Tried other batteries and still no good.  Requested an immediate refund.  The cordless unit feels very cheaply made.  Everything else looked fine in the package.  Will evaluate other possibilities and will not re-order this unit.</li>
    <li> The large clippers are perfect. They are sturdy and powerful. Everything I needed came with them, including a cleaning brush, oil, and numbered spacers.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller trimmer is OK. The one I got anyways, seems finicky. The battery compartment is kind of loose, and you have to have the batteries in just the right way to get it working properly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m certainly happy with the purchase, especially at the price.</li>
    <li> The small trimmer that comes with this item was broke.  It would not turn on.  Tried several different batteries, so I know that was not the reason.  The  main trimmers work well.  Needed the main trimmer so did not return.</li>
    <li> El producto llego a tiempo, corresponde tal cual a lo que esta en la imagen, todos los accesorios son de buena calidad y apenas me llego empece a utilizarla.</li>
    <li> wahl products are great. this is a 2nd one so we have two in order to have the swim team shave their heads in time for championship season. leaves some hair, so they shaved with a razor afterward.</li>
    <li> Had other wahl clippers in the past and they all worked great...but these NOPE!!  The blade won&#x27;t line up and keep cutting your skin and it really hurts!!  Can&#x27;t even use it to cut my boys hair :(&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to return them but just missed the small return window bc I am a busy Mom of lots of boys!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, comes with everything you need and is priced right.  No more paying for haircuts. 4 more words required.</li>
    <li> todo tal como lo esperaba, la entrega fue rapida y el producto llego en excelentes condiciones, la compra fue un exito</li>
    <li> WOrks great.  The little trimmer is pretty loud though. a a a a a a a a a aa  a</li>
    <li> As a charter member of Kitchen Beauticians International I can speak with authority.&lt;br /&gt;Well made.&lt;br /&gt;Very comfortable to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This was a valentines day present to my honey (it was supposed to be a hint to tame his unruly beard at the time). It turned out to be a great present! It is a wonderful set of clippers that run and cut better than any other ones I have used. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I wish it came with more guards for the personal groomer. He likes to be a little scruffy but the guards that this set comes with it is either long, short, or clean shaven. Otherwise this is a great buy and I love my tamed scruffy man!</li>
    <li> This works ok. It vibrates more than i expected. which gives uncomfortable feeling to hair cutter. Otherwise product looks ok to me.</li>
