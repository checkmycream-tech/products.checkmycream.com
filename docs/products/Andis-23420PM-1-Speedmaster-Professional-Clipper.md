      <li>All in all, most satisfactory.</li>

      <li>I will order more supplies.</li>

      <li>I am actually taking a loss on the shipping, which doesn&#x27;t make me very happy for a product that was defective,</li>
      <li>Very nice clippers with all accessories, highly recomended!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth and efficient and quiet and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than those inferior products you get in the discount store.  </li>
      <li>I bought thses clippers to replace an old pair that siezed up on me and these have been working great since I bought them</li>
      <li>I would say this clipper is best for home use but it cuts with the quality expected from an Andis clipper.  </li>
      <li>The clippers fit comfortably in my hand,and the blade speed is okay.</li>
      <li>I was able to cleanly cut my hair in one run over.  </li>
      <li>Works well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>Nice construction, high powered blades, great price, would recommend highly.</li>
      <li>However, upon first use I felt compelled to write my own review.</li>
      <li>i highly recommend it, i have tried a lot of beard trimmers and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I made a minor adjustment and they cut very very good and smooth.</li>
      <li>These clippers are excellent for black men.</li>
      <li>Just run the clipper over your hair back and forth and your hair will look great.      </li>
      <li>Andis makes fantastic clippers.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;- fits comfortably in your hand</li>
      <li>, it trims my beard with ease and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I primarily use it for an even-all-over cut and trimmer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once the guard is snapped on, you can use the lever to smoothly adjust the length of the cut, allowing cuts from 1/32\\&quot; to 1 1/4\\&quot;.    </li>
      <li>As a trimmer, it cuts smoothly and close.  </li>
      <li>The light weight of the clipper doesn&#x27;t exhaust your hand.</li>
      <li>There is no storage case, which seems to be the only drawback, but the unit itself is great.</li>
      <li>I had heard a lot about Andis clippers being the best on the market, so I decided to spring a little bit and get a better clipper after so much frustration with cheap clippers that wouldn&#x27;t work after a year or so.      </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
      <li>If you try to trim above your ears or do your beard/mustache afterwards you might get a good burn from it.  </li>
      <li>Not a bad piece of equipment.</li>
      <li>I GOT LUCKY ON THIS PURCHASE AS SOME DISAGREE.</li>
      <li>The problem with Wahls is that they die out too quickly.</li>
      <li>The motor is much more powerful than anything I&#x27;ve used, yet the clipper is also the most quiet and well balanced (weight-wise) that I&#x27;ve handled.  </li>
      <li>I would also note that the Andis got very hot at the business end.  </li>
      <li>I used these for the first time this morning to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and they&#x27;re fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Contacted Andis, they no longer carry this model, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth taking to a repair shop.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>Far better than cheaper retail Wahl or Conair.</li>
      <li>These are ok clippers if you want a cheap pair of clippers that will last you maybe a year.</li>
      <li>just beware that it does get hot quickly.</li>
      <li>Works great but gets a little hot when using.</li>
      <li>First, the trimmer does get very hot after a minute of use.  </li>
      <li>all right</li>
      <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was that it gets pretty warm after being on for a while and without an attachment (for close cuts)</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re definitely not worth it when you can get good quality right here.</li>
      <li>It cuts very well and quickly.  </li>
      <li>Oster was much noisier and this one is nice and quiet.  </li>
      <li>Hot?</li>
      <li>Its more than sufficient for just using occasionally at home.  </li>
      <li>It cut pretty well, but it got so hot it was burning my son&#x27;s scalp.</li>
      <li>attachment teeth are pretty</li>
      <li>This unit has power to go through thick hair and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>I have owned many clippers through the years and this now is the only brand I will ever use.  </li>
      <li>Works way better than my last one.</li>
      <li>and after that I noticed it did not perform as first time.</li>
      <li>First trimming came out</li>
      <li>/&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not too keen on the location of the &amp;quot;On/Off&amp;quot; switch, or its light action.</li>
      <li>The teeth on the guide combs that came with the kit are a bit flimsy, (I ordered the Andis Magnetic Guide combs after my first use), but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem returning anything when I order directly from Amazon with the free shipping either.</li>
      <li>Good heavy qaulity for years of clipping.</li>
      <li>It was in the  same ball park as Wahl&#x27;s cost wise, so that was no big deal.</li>
      <li>I also own an Andis T-bar which is solid and truly a professional tool.  </li>
      <li>This is our second pair, this was such a good deal that it was cheaper to buy a new shaver than to just replace the blade!  </li>
      <li>Still, I haven&#x27;t found many models that allow fine adjustments to the built in metal blades, except for (real) professional models, which are much more expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> These are great clippers, they don&#x27;t heat up and burn the scalp or pull and it&#x27;s not too difficult for an amateur to do a decent boy&#x27;s haircut with these.    My son has grown his hair rather longish these past few months but wants a buzz cut for the summer. So I guess it&#x27;s time to convince my boyfriend to give them back...or do my son&#x27;s haircut himself.    I&#x27;ve seen lower-quality clippers at grocery stores, T.J. Maxx, etc. They don&#x27;t cost much less than these but they&#x27;re definitely not worth it when you can get good quality right here. I&#x27;ve never had a problem returning anything when I order directly from Amazon with the free shipping either.</li>
    <li> Though it seems well made and stout and has plenty of power, mine developed a problem in less then 30 seconds of use - the cutting piece stopped moving back and forth.  It jammed.  I took the bottom &#x27;holder&#x27; piece off and reset it and oiled it well and it started working again, but I&#x27;m unsure if the same issue won&#x27;t come back as there isn&#x27;t a proper groove or position for this bottom piece to be in, near as I can tell.  For this reason, I gave it but 3 stars.  If, however it continues to cut well (which it did before it jammed) and the problem doesn&#x27;t come back, then it would be easily worth a 5 star rating.  Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I have so far used this item only once, but that was enough to satisfy me.  It&#x27;s a good, workable item,&#x27;though a bit heavier than I would like (that&#x27;s because I am 89 years old with bad arthritis in my hands.  As a trimmer, it cuts smoothly and close.  All in all, most satisfactory.</li>
    <li> This is just like the old clippers I had that just konked out after 40 years of use.  Good heavy qaulity for years of clipping.</li>
    <li> Before I bought these clippers I had been using a cheaper, battery powered set that would sometimes have trouble cutting through my hair, especially when the batteries started to get low.  These clippers are much nicer- they go through hair without trouble, and since they plug in there&#x27;s no worry about batteries getting low.    The other nice thing about this particular set compared with similar products is that it comes with what you need (different length guards, cleaning brush, oil), but not a lot of junk that you don&#x27;t, like plastic capes, combs, scissors, DVDs, etc..    Once the guard is snapped on, you can use the lever to smoothly adjust the length of the cut, allowing cuts from 1/32\\&quot; to 1 1/4\\&quot;.    My only complaint is that the clippers can get pretty hot after using them for an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmer last year and have used it about 10 times to cut my hair and beard.  There are two minor issues.  First, the trimmer does get very hot after a minute of use.  Not too bad if you leave a rake on it.  If you try to trim above your ears or do your beard/mustache afterwards you might get a good burn from it.  Second, I feel that it takes a few more passes to get all the hair cut than with my Oster I replaced it with.  Oster was much noisier and this one is nice and quiet.  I would recommend this to others, just beware that it does get hot quickly.</li>
    <li> Smooth cut and relatively quiet, especially like the pivot motor. Far better than cheaper retail Wahl or Conair. With daily oiling (using non-paraffin based) hopefully these will keep a sharp cut for a long time.</li>
    <li> Purchased September 28 2009. Used for two haircuts a month or ten haircuts. Then it stopped working. It runs but that&#x27;s about all. It&#x27;s a \\&quot;Hair Clipper\\&quot; that doesn&#x27;t clip. Or, looks like I got clipped.</li>
    <li> I got this so i could start cutting my husbands hair. He has very thick hair and the product works great on it. I would definently recommend this.</li>
    <li> i just recieved this product today, it looks great feels great and sounds great, i am so anxious to try it out in a bit today but just by lookin at it, it looks like one of the best heavy duty clippers you can get from andis.</li>
    <li> These clippers are excellent for black men. The first time I used them I got a great cut. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought these clippers mostly based on the outstanding reviews we already see here.  However, upon first use I felt compelled to write my own review. Out of the box the clippers were down right dull.  In fact, I had to dig out my old Wahl clippers, the unit I was hoping to replace with the Andis, to go back over the hair to make it presentable.  The clipped hair that was produced with the &#x27;second-over&#x27; using the Wahl provided me with confirmation that the Andis did a mediocre job.    I would also note that the Andis got very hot at the business end.  This is not something I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other clippers.  Warm? Yes.  Hot? No.  Maybe the heat is evidence that the clippers are not working properly but I expected better out of the box.</li>
    <li> Andis makes fantastic clippers.  If you buy one, with proper maintenance you should never need to buy another again.  I was happy with both the price and quality of this model.  Its more than sufficient for just using occasionally at home.  I also own an Andis T-bar which is solid and truly a professional tool.  I would say this clipper is best for home use but it cuts with the quality expected from an Andis clipper.  Comes with all the clips you should need including a 0 for blending.  Half increments can be achieved with the adjustable blade handle.  Keep the blade oiled and you should have this one for life.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my own head for years.      Usually I don&#x27;t look forward to it, as I would have to go over the same spots over and over to ensure that the clipper was cutting evenly.  Oftentimes I&#x27;d cut my hair and notice later that there was a spot that I somehow missed!      I&#x27;ve gone through half a dozen clippers over the years.  They would do the job for awhile, but eventually they would lose power or just die altogether.      My old, noisy Wahl clipper died in the middle of a haircut, and I embarrassingly had to go to the beauty supply store with half a haircut to pick up a new clipper.  I had heard a lot about Andis clippers being the best on the market, so I decided to spring a little bit and get a better clipper after so much frustration with cheap clippers that wouldn&#x27;t work after a year or so.      I was shocked by the jump in quality!  I was able to cleanly cut my hair in one run over.  The motor is much more powerful than anything I&#x27;ve used, yet the clipper is also the most quiet and well balanced (weight-wise) that I&#x27;ve handled.  I would never use another clipper again.  Makes my life so much easier.      This is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.  EXTREMELY pleased.</li>
    <li> These are the best i&#x27;ve ever used. In this day and time, i reverted to cutting my own hair, to save money from going to the barber shop. Over the years i&#x27;ve gotten pretty proficient at both cutting mine, and my sons hair, but i had always used Wahl&#x27;s. The problem with Wahls is that they die out too quickly. I would have to replace them every 6 months or so, and not only that, the motor would become annoyingly noisy after only a few uses...so after some research, i decide to give Andis a try. It was in the  same ball park as Wahl&#x27;s cost wise, so that was no big deal. As others have said, the quality of the cut is like night and day when compared to other clippers. The blades cut smooth and evenly with the variable guards in place, and the Andis blade guards actually stay put while cutting your hair! I&#x27;m actually upset that it took me this long to discover this product. Once you go Andis, there&#x27;s no need to look back!</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time this morning to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and they&#x27;re fantastic.  I&#x27;ve cut his hair for years and last year bought a set of Conair which were a real waste of money.  These went through his hair like butter and I finally got it short enough like he wants.  I highly recommend these clippers.</li>
    <li> Bought this clipper to trim by stubborn beards, really don&#x27;t need it to cut my hair.  I have been looking for a good fairly priced clipper to trim my beard with successfully.  I came across this and decided to give it a shot and i really like it, it trims my beard with ease and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  you can adjust it too i highly recommend it, i have tried a lot of beard trimmers and this is by far the best.  The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the attached combo sizes, they should have had more that is smaller.</li>
    <li> Works great but gets a little hot when using. Frequent oiling helps but still a little hot.</li>
    <li> A great clipper. Works way better than my last one. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was that it gets pretty warm after being on for a while and without an attachment (for close cuts) you notice it. I would recommend it highly though.</li>
    <li> Great clippers.  They cut close, no repassing, and they purr wonderfully.  Oh, and although it&#x27;s not pictured, also included in the package is the oil and a brush for cleaning the blade.</li>
    <li> Love this product. This is my 2nd one in 20 year. Hold up great and cuts very well. Just make sure you oil after every use.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my 2 cats, one medium-haired, the other long-haired. I wanted it to shave the mats they get under their arms, but it will not cut through without a lot of effort, and I ended up using scissors to cut them the rest of the way off. Very disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> After being disappointed and fed up with several Wal-mart and Target-style clippers which cost about $35 each, I decided to buy my son a good professional model.  This one is great.  It&#x27;s smooth and efficient and quiet and the best part is that it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than those inferior products you get in the discount store.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of good reviews about this product before I bought it.  It cut pretty well, but it got so hot it was burning my son&#x27;s scalp.</li>
    <li> I purchased these in August 2008 and it worked well for a few months. But then, it gets dull and requires more passes to get a buzz cut. I don&#x27;t use the attachments, as I got this model because it allows fine  adjustments (1/16 to 1/8) using the built in metal guard only. Of course, you need to oil them before you use them to maximize its cutting ability. It will probably work well for cuts that leave longer hair on your head, but I can&#x27;t speak to that as I haven&#x27;t used any of the plastic guards. In fact, I think I may have thrown them away.    Difficult to put back together if you take the blades off to clean them. Noise level is bearable and less than other clippers I have had.    In short, this model is OK, but a tight buzz cut will take longer as it gets used more. Still, I haven&#x27;t found many models that allow fine adjustments to the built in metal blades, except for (real) professional models, which are much more expensive. All in all, it is a better clipper than other brands I have had. If only it wouldn&#x27;t get dull in such a short period of time.</li>
    <li> Use this to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.  I previously used the less expensive ones from the drug  store but would burn them out very fast. Also use this without the comb to shave my dog&#x27;s  foot pads and underside. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> First trimming came out all right and after that I noticed it did not perform as first time. It is still working though and doing the job done sort of thing.</li>
    <li> When I bought these clippers July 2008, they worked fairly well for a few weeks for trimming my beard but then stopped cutting consistently.  Since I live within a few miles of Sturtevant, I brought the clipper set to the Andis factory to see about getting them repaired.  Instead they took my information and gave me a replacement on the spot.    The replacement sounded different than the original, much quieter and slower-sounding, but still it was apparently the same model.  It worked well as far as I knew, but recently I tried using it to trim the hair on my head.  Beard hair, being far coarser, gets cut fairly easily, but cutting head hair using anything but the shortest attachments is virtually impossible.  Using the one-inch comb, the clippers were more likely to push the hairs out of the way than to actually cut them!</li>
    <li> Plenty of power - enough attachments - no hair pulling - quiet - quality construction.  Have cut my hair and both my sons hair.  It cuts very well and quickly.  There is no storage case, which seems to be the only drawback, but the unit itself is great.</li>
    <li> I cut my hair to a low taper fade every week. These clippers are just what I needed. It allows me to go low, it cuts right the first time, and it keeps coming back for more. I highly recommend, especially for black men.</li>
    <li> These clippers cut very smooth. When i first bought them, there was a slight problem with the screws that attach the blade. I made a minor adjustment and they cut very very good and smooth. Plus they are quiet</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good set of hair clippers for a while and I&#x27;ve finally found some that work excellent.  They cut really easy and with very little noise.  I would recommend these to anyone searching for a great set of hair clippers.</li>
    <li> Works better than the other brands that I have bought.I cut my sons hair all the time an these work great,the atachments stay on better and get a really good cut.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Works well and is easy to use. The only downside: It gets a bit warm after using it for a while.</li>
    <li> I have owned many clippers through the years and this now is the only brand I will ever use.  I have had them for over a year and every time I cut my hair it is like they are brand new.</li>
    <li> I purchased the the Andis SpeedMaster PM1 clippers several months ago and have cut my hair several times with it.  This clipper works great and is a great value.  It has many attachments so one can precicely choose the length of the cut.  Just run the clipper over your hair back and forth and your hair will look great.      Just don&#x27;t do what I just did this week.  I thought I was using Attachment #8 for the top of my head when I inadvertently used Attachment #4.  Imagine my surprise when huge gobs of hair were stripped from the top of my head!  However, my father-in-law&#x27;s old adage will hold: \\&quot;The difference between a good hair cut and a bad one is about 2 weeks!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my second one. I use it for my 2 sons and after researching the best for the price for a quality item I keep coming back to this one. I replace mine every 24 months for hygene.</li>
    <li> This unit has power to go through thick hair and does a great job.  We use it at home, so it doesn&#x27;t get used too often...It is rather heavy, so you may want to consider how long you&#x27;ll be holding on to it.</li>
    <li> The clipper works well, has one conveniently located button, and comes with different sized attachments.    Pros  -Price  -Works well  -Various set  -Comes with small brush    Cons  -Gets ridiculously hot and is a pain when getting the hair around the ear area  -Loud</li>
    <li> Very nice clippers with all accessories, highly recomended!</li>
    <li> I shopped around and these where a bargin. They are sharp and should last a while. The item came on time and packaged correctly. I will order more supplies.</li>
    <li> Nice construction, high powered blades, great price, would recommend highly. Professional quality at amateur cost.</li>
    <li> These are ok clippers if you want a cheap pair of clippers that will last you maybe a year. It takes several passes through some types of hair to cut it. Next time I will spend an extra $40-50 bucks and get a decent pair.</li>
    <li> This is our second pair, this was such a good deal that it was cheaper to buy a new shaver than to just replace the blade!  They last for ten years!  Great clippers, good quality!</li>
    <li> Great set of clippers.</li>
    <li> Small easy to use hair product.  It&#x27;s small size makes it portable to take on trips.  The light weight of the clipper doesn&#x27;t exhaust your hand.</li>
    <li> This product broke one year and one month after I began using it. I looked at the warranty and surely enough, it was only for one year. Bad strategy, Andis, you are very mistaken that if you build low quality products, I will buy again from you when they break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am buying a Wahl next, at least they stand for two years (2y warranty) behind their products.</li>
    <li> Not a bad piece of equipment. You get what you pay for. I primarily use it for an even-all-over cut and trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- you get plenty of attachments&lt;br /&gt;- not overly loud&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get too hot to handle&lt;br /&gt;- fits comfortably in your hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t do very well if hair is even slightly wet from sweating&lt;br /&gt;- not very powerful&lt;br /&gt;- attachment teeth are pretty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;- attachments do not fit blade very well. Plenty of space is left between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
    <li> HAVE THIS FOR 5 YEARS NOW AND ITS STILL WORKING LIKE A CHARM. PLAN ON BUYING IT AGAIN BUT ONE WITH THE LINER. I GUESS I GOT LUCKY ON THIS PURCHASE AS SOME DISAGREE. WISH I BOUGHT 2 THE 1ST TIME. CUTTING YOUR OWN HAIR SAVES U ALOT OF MONEY. ALMOST 60-90/MONTH INCLUDING TIP, IF U CUTTING EVERY WEEK OR EVERY OTHER.</li>
    <li> The Andis Speedmaster Clippers are the same quality as the ones the professionals use. There are multiple comb attachments for cutting all types of hair. I especiallly like the blending attachment for my mustache. I have used a wide asssortment of different clippers down through the years and these are the best I have found..</li>
    <li> Amazon sent a USED pair had fingerprints, scratches and hair in it.. absolutely disgusting. I would never order anything like this again.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and does what you expect. We even use it on the Cocapoo. Get a training DVD. Get the oil. Also get that adapter for the ears. Dr Ron. Jupiter, Fl.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the clippers twice and so far I like them. The clippers fit comfortably in my hand,and the blade speed is okay. I&#x27;m not too keen on the location of the &amp;quot;On/Off&amp;quot; switch, or its light action. The teeth on the guide combs that came with the kit are a bit flimsy, (I ordered the Andis Magnetic Guide combs after my first use), but overall, I&#x27;m satisfied. I may revisit this review in 3 to 6 months. Update 5/29/2017, The blade adjustment lever has lost it&#x27;s tension. I have to hold the lever with one finger while cutting my hair. Contacted Andis, they no longer carry this model, and I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth taking to a repair shop. I&#x27;ll ride with them until they give out.</li>
    <li> I recently bought a pair of these clippers and all they did was tear my hair. Very painful to use. I have now returned. I am actually taking a loss on the shipping, which doesn&#x27;t make me very happy for a product that was defective,</li>
    <li> I bought thses clippers to replace an old pair that siezed up on me and these have been working great since I bought them</li>
    <li> I have arthritis and felt it was too heavy for my hands.  I gave it to my dau8ghter and so far she likes it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for manscaping! So armpit, butt crack, crotch, pubes and other unwanted body hair are very well trimmed and looking sexy ;-)</li>
