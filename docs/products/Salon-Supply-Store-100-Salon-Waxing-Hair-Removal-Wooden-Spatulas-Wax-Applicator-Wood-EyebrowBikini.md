    <li> Arrived faster than I expected! good product will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Lego ates de lo esperado! Buen producto, sin duda ordenaria otra vez!</li>
    <li> These are popsickle sticks, not wax spatulas.</li>
    <li> As described and very cheap, thanks!</li>
    <li> I was trying to order the bigger ones..the pic looks big..my mistake..that&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> These are terrible, I could of bought these sticks at the dollar store!!!!  I thought they were the big  ones, NOT popsicles size. Lame</li>
    <li> What can I say, they are sticks.</li>
    <li> Misleading- these are popsicle sticks!  They appear to be wider, like tongue depressors which is the search result they came up with.  I should know to check every little detail when it is coming from China because this has happened multiple times with things shipped from there.</li>
    <li> no more butt hair for me</li>
    <li> Item is exactly what it was advertised as and I am very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and work great.</li>
    <li> Work great but I think you can find them cheaper at the dollar store</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what was described in listing. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Yup, these are wooden sticks alright! I purchased them with a new waxing kit (why would a waxing kit only give you 10 sticks?) and they seem pretty legit. I also ordered Aztec clay and since you aren&#x27;t supposed to use metal with the clay, broke one of these babies out to stir and apply my clay/Apple cider vinegar mask to my face. Handy.</li>
    <li> They are not what I thought I was buying, these are simply Popsicle sticks, regular size. They are not the large tongue depressor size and you can pick these up anywhere probably cheaper.</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery and excellent product!</li>
    <li> Great buy!&lt;br /&gt;very small though.</li>
    <li> These work well for applying wax for hair removal.  They are good quality and the price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of them and they work well for a decent price.</li>
    <li> good product i love that  very good very prefesional iam very happy this wood very strong i like it thank you</li>
    <li> Not as appears! These (at least from the picture) look like tongue depressor size sticks and when they arrived they were popsicle sized sticks (these were shipped in a bag so unable to tell something was off til it was opened). Yes the title does say eyebrow near the end but I never came to the page and only saw part of the title and the picture when I bought them. So I find this very deceiving!&amp;#34;</li>
