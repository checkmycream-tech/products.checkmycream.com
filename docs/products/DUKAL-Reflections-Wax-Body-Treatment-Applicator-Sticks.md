    <li> These wooden strips are of a good quality. They are perfect for the job.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy (how fancy can you really get with something like this?), but they do the job. And if you don&#x27;t like them for their intended purpose, you can always use them for arts and crafts!</li>
    <li> They are Popsicle sticks. Nothing more. Served their purpose. The wife uses them for waxing her eyebrows and such. Cool.</li>
    <li> applicators sticks are definitely not worth the money.  the quality is the same as the dollar store and too expensive for its quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the GiGi wax oven and hot sugar wax. I like that they are small so I can do my eyebrows and mustache area. I use to be able to find this at Michael&#x27;s but lately I haven&#x27;t. I am clad Amazon has them.</li>
    <li> The size of these sticks are prefect for my eyebrows...their also light weight...just what I wanna it</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a little smaller than I was expecting however still a great deal for the price</li>
    <li> They are popsicle sticks. Exactly the same. Maybe a tiny bit better wood used? The width of these sticks is perfect for waxing upper lip.</li>
    <li> These are just popsicle sticks. Lame.</li>
    <li> These are too narrow and don&#x27;t hold the wax very well</li>
    <li> The sticks are too thin and easily break while using it for wax-body treatments.</li>
    <li> Too small in length and width&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy! You can buy these wooden applicators for half the price at Walmart in the art &amp; craft section.</li>
    <li> I would always use some thing else to remove and it would be a mess.  These work great and not messy. I learned a lesson these are great for hair removal</li>
    <li> These are not proper applicators. They are popsicle sticks. I have actual applicators that I compared these to and these are nothing but crafting popsicle sticks. Too thick for spreading wax. You need a thinner applicator</li>
    <li> Good Product! Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> These are REALLY tiny, but they&#x27;re perfect for precise applications. A little flimsy, but I do suppose that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> came on time and was exactly as it was shown online</li>
