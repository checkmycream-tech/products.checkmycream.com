    <li> I wore this lipstick for many years before it was discontinued.  I was excited to be able to buy it again!</li>
    <li> I love Amazon!  Let me explain why.  REVIEWS!  Thank you to all the people who raved about the Wild Plum shade of this product.  It was all the reviews that got me to order it.  What a gorgeous color.  It&#x27;s fabulous lipstick; I have several shades.  This one, however, I could wear the rest of my life with everything!!!  I have green eyes, fair complexion, and auburn hair that is turning white.  This shade is so flattering on my aging face!!!  No kidding.  I don&#x27;t think there is a single woman who could not wear it well.  I very seldom wear eye make-up, so this lipstick sort of takes center stage, and it does so beautifully.  L&#x27;OREAL PARIS COLOUR RICHE.....MAKE THE SHADE OF WILD PLUM A FOREVER AVAILABLE SHADE, PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE!!!  Thanks, Amazon, for having it available.  Seller is fabulous, too.  It arrived super super fast!!</li>

I Love the color (Wild Plum)! ... and it stays on well and feels very moisturizing. I would recommend L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Colour Riche Lipcolour for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am very upset with L&#x27;Oreal as they have stopped making this great color and I can&#x27;t find anything close to it in the L&#x27;Oreal line. The whole 600 series is gone!  Therefore, I am removing a star because of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s stupid business practices!!</li>
    <li> The color was matched exactly to my previous purchases…before this lipstick was discontinued!  I will definitely return to purchase other difficult to find cosmetics...</li>
