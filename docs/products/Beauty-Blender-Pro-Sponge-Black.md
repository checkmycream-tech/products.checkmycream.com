<ol>
      <li>I use the Beauty Blender while it is damp for the best application.</li>
      <li>Awesome deal!</li>
      <li>My makeup goes on flawlessly!</li>
      <li>a side note: I purchased the makeup brush cleaner from Sonia Kashuk and it works wonderfully on cleaning this sponge out.  </li>
      <li>however it blended my makeup PERFECTLY..</li>
      <li>Applies bb cream and liquid foundation flawlessly.</li>
      <li>Best purchased you will not regret!!</li>
      <li>Stain proof and perfect for men, self tanners and bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are also great to set your foundation with powders in the areas that tend to crease because you&#x27;re pressing it into the product!</li>

      <li>I honestly have no idea what the people who got the carrier were looking at.  </li>
      <li>Perfect tool for natural looking foundation</li>

      <li>I love applying my foundation with the Beauty Blender Pro Sponge.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>Both are stiffer than the Beauty Blender, but once they&#x27;re damp, they work just as well or even better.</li>
      <li>I love beauty blenders and will continue to repurchase them until they&#x27;re no longer made.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>the texture was more poress?</li>
      <li>My makeup looks flawless since using the beauty blender and I only use the beauty blender now, instead of using foundation brushes, concealer brushes, bronzer brushes, etc, etc.</li>
      <li>I can still kind of get coverage with it, but it doesn&#x27;t blend smoothly anymore because of the cracks everywhere.  </li>
      <li>but I have had better sponges.</li>
      <li>I was concerned after reading more reviews that I was not going to receive the Beaty blender sponge but get a case for a beauty blender.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the beauty blender...</li>
      <li>Love this sponge and will be replacing when it wears</li>
      <li>It feels really nice and smooth on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love love the way it blends your concealer on all areas if the face.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love my beauty blender.</li>
      <li>But make sure you see the size before you order.  </li>
      <li>it was going to be more money to ship it</li>
      <li>MAKE SURE</li>
      <li>absolutely love the beauty blender.</li>
      <li>My makeup looks flawless, it looks more like my natural skin than a face full of makeup.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for the airbrushed, flawless makeup look ;)</li>
      <li>so it works best for under the eyes and it works well when dry.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re especially wonderful for people with dry skin because of the moisture being pressed into the skin with whichever product you choose to use on the blender.</li>
      <li>Minis, and one full size!  </li>
      <li>It works well for both liquid/cream and powders, but it works best with liquids/creams, which can sometimes look cakey when applied too thickly by other tools.  </li>
      <li>Stains easily.</li>
      <li>The black sponge is the perfect solution!</li>
      <li>blends fine</li>
      <li>After trying cheap versions of the beauty blender, I never understood the hype.</li>
      <li>it will double in size and give a great finish.</li>
      <li>I love how easy I can blend everything and fast.  </li>
      <li>and i was so excited</li>
      <li>Defiantly worth the buy!</li>
      <li>But I think its so worth it!</li>
      <li>They say that it is much more effective than similar products</li>
      <li>As I understand it, you can pick up this kind of foundation better with the black Beauty Blender because it&#x27;s more porous.  </li>
      <li>YOU ARE USING IT THE RIGHT WAY!</li>
      <li>I Thought this was the full sized beauty blender.</li>
      <li>I love these beauty blenders so much.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the real deal or not</li>
      <li>to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use.</li>
      <li>Be sure to put a little water on the sponge before blending your make up; otherwise, the sponge will absorb most of the product forcing you to use more make up to get the coverage you want.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s holding up great and doesn&#x27;t show as many stains as the pink one did.</li>
      <li>Just as great as I expected!!!</li>
      <li>Amazing product second one I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
      <li>I rarely reach for my face brushes to apply foundation anymore</li>
      <li>so worth every penny</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve probably heard so many people hyping it up that I expected more from it.</li>
      <li>my favorite leaving me with a natural finish everytime.</li>
      <li>Beauty blender purchased from Amazon on the right.</li>
      <li>but since I love my pink Beauty Blenders I have no doubt I&#x27;ll be fine with this one as well.</li>
      <li>Clean after every use, allow to air dry sitting on top of the plastic container</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I received.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Just as great as I expected!!!</li>
    <li> Not the product it said it was</li>
    <li> So obsessed with these beauty blenders. I keep buying them over and over again because I can&#x27;t finish my makeup application without them! And my mother-in-law&#x27;s adorable but frustrating dog has eaten 3 of them! So expensive T-T But I think its so worth it!</li>
    <li> My BeautyBlender dries so much faster in this than just sitting on my bathroom counter!  I hang it by a little hook on the wall and the sponges are dry in only a few hours.  It will fit 2 full-size blenders, but it also fits my full-size solid cleanser, a Micro.Minis, and one full size!  The magnetic closure is nice and strong too.</li>
    <li> i guess this was my bad, when i ordered it i thought it was going to be a black beauty blender and i was so excited but i got the travel airport bag for it instead. I was so mad so i went back to read reviews and then read the description and it cleary states its not the beauty blender its self, its the travel case. So that was my bad. im giving it 3 stars because i like it but only 3 because it through me off and made me think i was getting something i wasnt. I now have the actual beauty blender and having a little case for it is nice.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the beauty blender...so worth every penny, if u don&#x27;t own 1 I recommend giving it a try...you&#x27;ll never look at a foundation brush the same</li>
    <li> This sponge is great for applying makeup. I was skeptical, but it really works well.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty blender! After trying cheap versions of the beauty blender, I never understood the hype. I finally decided to give the original beauty blender a chance and so glad I did! The dupes don&#x27;t even compare. My makeup looks flawless since using the beauty blender and I only use the beauty blender now, instead of using foundation brushes, concealer brushes, bronzer brushes, etc, etc. I decided to give the black sponge I try since I didn&#x27;t like how with the original sponge it looked so gross and dirty no matter how many times I would clean it because of my dark makeup. The black sponge is the perfect solution! A+ to the beauty blender pro sponge and the application of the pro!</li>
    <li> I bought it because everybody swears it helps the beautyblender drys up faster. It didn&#x27;t. I washed my beautyblender at noon and not the makeup sponge is still wet. So glad it only costed me $18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated: it&#x27;s the next day morning 8:30am PST and my beautyblender is still moist in the mesh bag. It didn&#x27;t reduced in size and still fluffy. NOT DRIED yet! I&#x27;m amazed!!!!</li>
    <li> The best thing ever! I never use my brushes anymore because of this little guy now! Defiantly worth the buy!</li>
    <li> Very misleading!  The picture needs to be taken down</li>
    <li> Big lover of the beauty blender and they are very much worth the price for a flawless face and a natural non cake face finish</li>
    <li> One of the best investments in beauty products! Works under the eyes immaculately.</li>
    <li> Our teenage girls love this.  They say that it is much more effective than similar products&lt;br /&gt;that they have tried because of its fineness.</li>
    <li> I hate to say this, but WASTE OF MONEY. I used to have a beauty sponge that was not beauty blender brand, I believe I purchased it for around $3. It lasted me over a year. Now, it took me a while to give in and get the real beauty blender, because I mean it is $15 for a sponge... It broke within a month, and I barely used it. Did nothing for my makeup application, I personally think a brush applies/blends foundation/concealer MUCH better. I am extremely disappointed!</li>
    <li> Perfect tool for natural looking foundation</li>
    <li> I use these all the time when doing clients make up and also myself. They are so nice at blending out harsh lines. If you dampen them it helps the sponge not absorb all your foundation and makes it blend out even better!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, leaves an amazing finish on your face!</li>
    <li> Item as described! Love it</li>
    <li> Love this sponge! Love the way it smooths my makeup on!</li>
    <li> I love these beauty blenders so much. I use them everyday</li>
    <li> This is an amazing beauty tool.  I have used other sponges and brushes, but nothing applies makeup to the face as light and smoothly as this.  It works well for both liquid/cream and powders, but it works best with liquids/creams, which can sometimes look cakey when applied too thickly by other tools.  Love this sponge and will be replacing when it wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is intended to be used after it doubles in size through being thoroughly soaked with water and then rung out.  Some people seem to not know this.  It feels really nice and smooth on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: I purchased the makeup brush cleaner from Sonia Kashuk and it works wonderfully on cleaning this sponge out.  I let the sponge dry a little bit after applying my makeup (sometimes an hour, sometimes all the way to the next day) and then spray this all over it and massage it into the sponge.  Rinse thoroughly and you will be all set!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical ordering this since it was cheaper than if I bought it in a store. It arrived promptly and it is the real thing. it looks small but wen you apply water as ou are supposed to it quickly grows to the size you see you tubers and professionals use. Wonderful product and authentic.</li>
    <li> My order arrived on time, but the Beauty Blender appeared a bit smaller that I expected...however it blended my makeup PERFECTLY..I will ordered more and from the same seller... Great Service</li>
    <li> I Thought this was the full sized beauty blender. It wasn&#x27;t, but it still work wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve probably heard so many people hyping it up that I expected more from it. It works great and it&#x27;s the spongiest sponge I own. I also have the Real Techniques Miracle complexion sponge and another sponge that I bought at TJ Maxx a while back. Both are stiffer than the Beauty Blender, but once they&#x27;re damp, they work just as well or even better. Compared to the other two, the beauty blender is smaller so it works best for under the eyes and it works well when dry. All in all, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the dupes but nothing compares to the real thing! Applies bb cream and liquid foundation flawlessly. Shipping was timely as well</li>
    <li> absolutely love the beauty blender. I love it even better in black, in my mind its easier for me to clean because i can see when its dirty better than the pink one. Also usually the beauty blender is $20, and this one was $15. Awesome deal!</li>
    <li> Finally gave in and purchased it. Decided to go with the black one because I don&#x27;t like pink and I don&#x27;t like how stained the pink looks after a while.  Let me tell you: you need this in your life.  It&#x27;s that good.  I love how easy I can blend everything and fast.  I am dreading the cleaning it part - but it&#x27;s part of it.  Amazon had the cheapest price around.</li>
    <li> Not really what I expected. It&#x27;s smaller than the regular (pink) beauty blender and flakes black spongey particles every so often. It doesnt seem to have the same denseness as the regular bb either, as when I squeeze it after it&#x27;s wet, it feels like it collapses too easily. With a regular bb there is a small bit of resistance and it&#x27;s difficult to measure this sort of complaint, but they don&#x27;t seem be the same despite how they&#x27;re supposed to only be dissimilar in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a faulty product, though next time I think I&#x27;d rather buy the the regular pink blender.</li>
    <li> Love love the way it blends your concealer on all areas if the face. I will be ordering another beauty blender soon.</li>
    <li> blends fine but I have had better sponges.</li>
    <li> Got a mini one which was not advertised! It&#x27;s the size of my thumb.. Useless.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the real deal or not but it was! I am so happy with my purchase and it has truly changed my make up application. It also seems to save me quite a bit of time applying my foundation.</li>
    <li> I was buying the air.port case for the beauty blender as the description not acurate</li>
    <li> Blends makeup like a dream. I ❤️ this product.</li>
    <li> Always love the beauty blender! MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING IT THE RIGHT WAY! You&#x27;re supposed to get the blender wet first (squeeze out all the excesse moisture then use to apply makeup) it will double in size and give a great finish.</li>
    <li> So,  this was the first beauty blender that I had ever bought.  I should have read the description.  This thing is so small.  It&#x27;s not the big one like all the makeup artists or anyone uses... It is still a blender but why would I want this small one when the big one is literally the Exact same price?  I decided  it was going to be more money to ship it back them to just keep it.  But make sure you see the size before you order.  I added a picture of it next to my house phone so can get a general idea.</li>
    <li> I have 1 pink and 2 black beauty blenders that I bought from physical stores and I compared them with this blender and you can easily see that they are not the same. The package that it comes in is the same (which is kinda duplicitous) but this one isn&#x27;t as bouncy, it&#x27;s pores are bigger, and it&#x27;s shape is more of a perfect teardrop shape than the original.&lt;br /&gt;But it still worked well enough for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because the price is higher than it should be for a dupe.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great product, it definately is better than anyother sponge I have tried. I only gave it four stars because I personally prefer the way a brush applies my foundation.</li>
    <li> my favorite leaving me with a natural finish everytime. MUST wash with its own soap</li>
    <li> Great product but bit of slow delivery.  The beauty blender works great with your makeup.  It gives you a flawless, airbrush finish.  I love it!</li>
    <li> EVEN BETTER than the original pink beauty blender!!! Highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for the airbrushed, flawless makeup look ;)</li>
    <li> not worth the price to me. Stains easily. Nothing that a regular wedge couldn&#x27;t do in my opinion</li>
    <li> I would have given this five stars because it does blend my foundation and concealer beautifully.  However, it is sooo difficult to clean completely and though I was extremely gentle with it and only used the beauty blender solid cleanser to clean it, my blender started getting cracks all over the surface of it after the first wash.  I can still kind of get coverage with it, but it doesn&#x27;t blend smoothly anymore because of the cracks everywhere.  Really bummed that I only getting to use it a handful of times.  Next time, I&#x27;ll get the Real Techniques Sponge or dampen a cheap makeup wedge.</li>
    <li> A good deal for two beauty blenders and the cleanser! I love beauty blenders and will continue to repurchase them until they&#x27;re no longer made. They&#x27;re especially wonderful for people with dry skin because of the moisture being pressed into the skin with whichever product you choose to use on the blender. I apply my moisturizer, primers, and concealer with the pink ones (ordered separately) and foundation and any cream bronzing with the black one. They are also great to set your foundation with powders in the areas that tend to crease because you&#x27;re pressing it into the product! I wash mine before every single use-which is really important because it does soak up foundation and will lock it in, causing stains and bacteria. I am definitely a beauty blender hoarder and want millions of them!</li>
    <li> Gives a &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; effect! Love this product!</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully every time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!  Be sure to put a little water on the sponge before blending your make up; otherwise, the sponge will absorb most of the product forcing you to use more make up to get the coverage you want.  I use this every single day!</li>
    <li> I would use it for a thicker foundation. With estee lauder doublewear foundation it sucks it up into the sponge and puts on a light layer than a brush. Much easier to get foundation out of than the traditional pink one, and the black doesn&#x27;t go down the sink like the pink does.</li>
    <li> Small! Not the giant full size</li>
    <li> I honestly have no idea what the people who got the carrier were looking at.  I see a black beauty blender in the photo, in its standard little cylindrical clear plastic container.  The Air Port Pro is a small black mesh carrying case to use when you&#x27;re traveling--it&#x27;s a completely different item and does not include an actual Beauty Blender.  What are these people looking at??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Black Beauty Blender Pro Sponge and that&#x27;s exactly what I received.  The reason I got the black one is that YouTube gurus recommend it for use with pressed powder foundation, i.e. MAC Studio Fix.  As I understand it, you can pick up this kind of foundation better with the black Beauty Blender because it&#x27;s more porous.  And yes, you still have to dampen it.  I have yet to try this technique but since I love my pink Beauty Blenders I have no doubt I&#x27;ll be fine with this one as well.</li>
    <li> How did we survive without this product!  DO NOT THROW AWAY THE PLASTIC CONTAINER.  Make sure to WET IT before you use it...:D  Functions like a dream.  Clean after every use, allow to air dry sitting on top of the plastic container it arrives in. When it drys it will pop down into the container and you can cover it.</li>
    <li> It was a lot smaller than anticipated but should do the job.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a freakin Beauty Blender!!!!! You should change your picture this is misleading!!! Uggghhhhh...</li>
    <li> Beauty blender purchased from Amazon on the right. Beauty blender purchased from Sephora on the left.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned about getting it wet with my hands, always making sure I have completely dry hands. Should they have used leather? I&#x27;m not sure?! So far so good!</li>
    <li> I love applying my foundation with the Beauty Blender Pro Sponge. My makeup looks flawless, it looks more like my natural skin than a face full of makeup. I use the Beauty Blender while it is damp for the best application.</li>
    <li> I am with a lot of the others who posted a review.  I thought it was the actual beauty blender, so I am NOT thrilled at all.  You do need to change your picture.</li>
    <li> A lot of people are reporting that they received a travel bag or something after purchasing this product.... I read all of the reviews AFTER I purchased it and began regretting my purchase immediately, tried canceling my order but it was too late... However, when my package came in I was expecting to me disappointed with what was inside the box, but when I opened it there was an actual beauty blender sponge inside (?) I don&#x27;t know why many people received travel bags, but I actually received a beauty blender. Anyhow, the reason I gave this 4 stars is because when the sponge came it looked a bit different. I understand that the beauty blender pro should be a bit different from the original,but prior to trying to cancel this order I ordered another beauty blender pro sponge  and when I compared the two, the texture was off. With the other sponge I purchased, it resembelled the texture of the original beauty blender, with this one the texture was more poress? And also, this sponge had a very chemical smelling scent to it, so I washed it thoroughly... On the other hand, I kept both and they work very well (:</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the pro beauty blenders before. I usually purchase mine from sephora. This one is to flimsy and doesn&#x27;t expand. Not only that but my package was lost, took forever to get the package to me, the company didn&#x27;t even bother contacting me. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I&#x27;m pretty sure this was a $5 blender and it was repackaged. I use it just to put powder under my eyes for now.</li>
    <li> There is a reason this is the ultimate beauty blending tool..it works!</li>
    <li> Not much you can say, that every one else has not said.. theres only one beauty blender and every women should own one at least! Best purchased you will not regret!!</li>
    <li> Love this! I rarely reach for my face brushes to apply foundation anymore this works wonders!</li>
    <li> I was concerned after reading more reviews that I was not going to receive the Beaty blender sponge but get a case for a beauty blender. I did receive a sponge and it came in the beauty blender packaging with sticker seals. It seems to me as this is the legit beauty blender sponge!! I haven&#x27;t got to try it out yet but this is softer than my real techniques sponge which they say the beauty blender is!</li>
    <li> It ripped it was no good</li>
    <li> I had a pink one that was falling apart and decided to try the black one. So far it&#x27;s holding up great and doesn&#x27;t show as many stains as the pink one did. My makeup goes on flawlessly!</li>
    <li> Amazing product second one I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
    <li> Item listed as beautyblender Pro Blender Single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: beautyblender Pro Single. The same beautyblender product in black. The universal color of professional makeup artists around the world. Stain proof and perfect for men, self tanners and bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a beauty blender, it is a beauty blender mesh bag for drying your beautyblender.  Misleading item description.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my beauty blender. One of the best makeup products I have ever purchased. Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about these sooner. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> pointless expensive brush.&lt;br /&gt;You could do the same with a cosmetic sponge.&lt;br /&gt;No thank you to the idiots that raved about this pointless product.</li>
    <li> FAKE BEAUTY BLENDER. THIS IS A KNOCK OFF. NOT AT ALL THE REAL THING. IT IS STIFF AND NOTHING COMPARED TO THE REAL BLENDER. Comes in packaging that is fairly similar but different enough to not be charged for copy right. The item itself is obviously different, I have the official black beauty blender and this is not even remotely close. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I thought it was bigger than it actually is.  Surprised I paid that much for it. Haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll like it.</li>
