      <li>It is my own fault, though.  </li>
      <li>nice travel size spray bottles.</li>
      <li>My bag smells nice though.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice idea for a product, but this one was not satisfactory.</li>

      <li>I have used the Walmart bottles since the silver refillable didn&#x27;t work, and I am completely satisfied with the Walmart spray bottle.</li>
      <li>This is okay.  </li>
      <li>It leaks out of the glass tube and into the silver part, then spills out of the top of the silver container.</li>
      <li>For the size these are, you are better off getting a travel spray bottle at Walmart.</li>
      <li>I bought this, not for travel but because I have a bottle of perfume that I love</li>
      <li>Perfect size, but wish the top could protect more from possible leaks while carrying it in front pocket</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Well made, does not leak, and easy to fill</li>
    <li> Well made and great mist. I keep in my car filled with rosemary to spray on a cloth and inhale for a quick aromatherapy pick me up during the day. You can easily fill with what ever fragrance you love; the mist is fine so your product will last and gives an ample spray too.</li>
    <li> works great.  hope it continues to work... It&#x27;s easy to use.  Nice size.  looks like the picture.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to fill with M-Pro 7 gun cleaning solution.  I made several small gun cleaning kits to keep in my camper, car and home using a combination of the M-Pro 7 and Otis gun cleaning products.  Holds the solution without leaking and sprays better than the OE M-Pro spray bottle.</li>
    <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s contents for very long, after a week or so you&#x27;ll notice that most of the perfume/cologne has vaporized. Found this with three different bottles I ordered.</li>
    <li> It works fine, but the bottle is larger than I&#x27;d wanted.  I&#x27;m only traveling with it around town, not around the world.</li>
    <li> Works great for what I needed!</li>
    <li> I received my product on time with no hassle. Product is what I expected. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to fill and use. Only giving it four stars because it has a dent in it, I&#x27;m guessing from shipping so the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on well.</li>
    <li> works well as a travel size no leaks and easy to fill</li>
    <li> Very good book for understanding the fundamentals of IPM</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel and looks nice</li>
    <li> The container was unbelievably hard to get open, you really have to use some elbow grease to unscrew it. The opening to pour the product is really small, so just take extra care to pour it. It sprays nicely, and when thrown into my gym bag it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because I broke a perfume that I like, and it was just perfect tomsave what was left. It looks nice, spray well, and doesn&#x27;t seems to leak for now. It&#x27;s what I needed.</li>
    <li> seems to do its job well and i find it easy to fill.</li>
    <li> This arrived shipped from China.  The container is very thin cheap metal and it arrived dented.</li>
    <li> it is very nice and functional. I haven&#x27;t had time to fill it yet to be able to say how well it works.</li>
    <li> Great for traveling!  Lightweight yet classy!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip. It leaked a bit when I used it, and once it leaks, it&#x27;s impossible to get the smell off of everything.</li>
    <li> this is not one of those refillable bottles that you expect. It&#x27;s just a simple plastic piece of junk that you literally have to pour whatever liquid into. It does not have the valve that allows you to transfer perfume from your bottle into this for travel purposes. If you want to break your own perfume bottle and pour it in here then this is what you should get. If you actually want a travel perfume carrier that you can transfer from your bottle to this you are not going to get it here! It is also very flimsy and falls apart in mediately!</li>
    <li> I like that I can now bring my perfume with me. Unfortunately the outside case had a dent in it.</li>
    <li> Love these!  perfect size and they are so pretty!  Easily refillable, too.  Getting two of them works out well, You can keep one in each handbag!</li>
    <li> I purchased some custom made perfume from a perfumery and I needed a spray bottle that could fit in a purse or travel case for it. The product took forever to get here and it doesn&#x27;t pump very well once it does get here.</li>
    <li> Stores don&#x27;t carry atomizers much.  These are perfect, purse sized bottles for the go.</li>
    <li> This wonderful atomize allows me to carry my favorite scent with me at all times.  Great construction makes it stay together for a long time!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s way lighter than popping in a body spray or perfume into your purse, durable, about as thick as my thumb. I take off the bottom protective metal jacket just to lighten it, but only by mere grams honestly. I&#x27;m just obsessed with cutting down the weight of my purse so every little bit helps.</li>
    <li> Did Not Like!!!!!!!!  They all leaked.  Would not recommend</li>
    <li> Quality was very poor. It didn&#x27;t last long. I used it to carry some scent when i am on the go, the content started to leak after a few days of use. I demaged my favorite work bag. So I ended up carrying it in a small ziplock bag. And while i was spraying the top cap fell apart in the public restroom. Of course, I ended up trashing it.</li>
    <li> The bottom won&#x27;t stay on this product!  I will NOT re-order from this company again.  I ordered two gold ones and they were fine but don&#x27;t know which company they came from - beware of this product!</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be perfect for travel but it&#x27;s not! First with some perfumes there&#x27;s just no way to get it in the bottle. I had searched for atomizers and this came up but that&#x27;s not what it is. (my fault, I should have read further in the description) I then tried using it with another perfume and it leaked all over the place.  Just unfortunately not good quality.  I attempted to return it but the return policy of course is no returns so that doesn&#x27;t help make me feel any better as a customer.  Unfortunate but I guess you get what you pay for- total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the design of this refillable perfume bottle. I love that the company provides excellent customer service via email.  The problem, however, is with the shipping method.  Twice the company has sent me this bottle packaged in nothing but a small plastic envelope and twice the item has arrived dented and scratched.  The item is still usable but is rather unsightly when I pull it out of my bag.  Seeing that the item is shipped from Korea, I believe, you would think that the company would provide adequate packaging.  Sadly, I will probably not be purchasing other items from this company in the future.</li>
    <li> They work better than most of my high end cologne atomizers, don&#x27;t leak, are pretty durable, and small enough for a travel bag.  I love them!</li>
    <li> This works well. Hasn&#x27;t clogged for me yet. Just keep it in my purse and for travel. Just wish it would hold a little more but other than that, totally worth it. Oh and the casing inside is glass, so be careful.</li>
    <li> The liquid I put into it leaks out.</li>
    <li> Great buy that will be something I can use longterm as a way to get more use from  expensive fragrances..</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this bottle yet.  Looking for the right fragrance to hold it.</li>
    <li> Really know your sizes before buying.  I was hoping for something to keep in my purse.  This wasn&#x27;t the thing (for me).  I bought one smaller. It also doesn&#x27;t have an adapter for perfume bottles.  That&#x27;s my fault though as I should have looked more closely.</li>
    <li> I love this! I put mouthwash in it and use it as travel breath spray because I have Invisilign orthodontics and can&#x27;t chew gum. I feel better because I know exactly what I&#x27;m putting in my mouth as opposed to the traditional breath spray that could have god know what ingredients in them. Also more economical and reusable. I fill mine with blue listerine :)</li>
    <li> works great and no leaks so far:)</li>
    <li> I am always going somewhere last minute and I work long hours. Having some cologe in the car is a life saver in those unplanned situations.</li>
    <li> Make sure you put this in a plastic bag of your going to carry it around in your purse. This leaked out all over the inside of my designer handbag and the oils ruined it. I do love the product it works just hate that it leaks.</li>
    <li> Arrived broken. Poorly packed. Very low quality, but you get what you pay for. Not worth returning.</li>
    <li> This perfume bottle leaks everywhere and was a complete waste of money. I would highly recommend using a different product.</li>
    <li> This helped me from having to pack my perfume bottle! Large enough opening to spray in your perfume and never spilled! Will probably be bringing this to work from now on too!</li>
    <li> I tried one which I took with me on vacation.  It worked great.  It&#x27;s easy to take the top off, spray in your fragrance and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;It felt sturdy, well made and not cheap by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, especially if you travel.</li>
    <li> fits almost anywhere and refillable what else do you need when you go out somewhere fancy and you want to smell on point when you get there</li>
    <li> this was a very nice surprise!  The quality it better than I expected and easy to refill and keep in purse; doesn&#x27;t leak either!</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go cologne</li>
    <li> Only one sprayer works while the other tends to leak if you accidently invert the spray (when in the bag).</li>
    <li> Looks attractive, not as cheap as the photos can make it seem.  Glass vial that is protected by rather strong casing.  Mine arrived a bit dented, but not enough to justify returning a &amp;#60; $5 item.  Nice mist and easily refillable.  The glass vial seems to be a little bit too lose when screwing in to me, but so far no leaks.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Doesn&#x27;t spray well and leaks!</li>
    <li> The silver refillable travel size perfume spray bottle needs to be about double the size it is currently, that way you could get silver refillable spray I carry in my purse to last a weekThat way, I can have thing</li>
    <li> Perfect size, but wish the top could protect more from possible leaks while carrying it in front pocket</li>
    <li> A little smaller then I had imagined...  You&#x27;ll need some kind of funnel to fill it which it does not come with...  Works fine..</li>
    <li> The bottom portion is loose - and therefore is almost never attached to the top unless it&#x27;s in a place where it can&#x27;t move. Not really what I wanted. The atomizer works fine - it&#x27;s the casing I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Leaked all of my expensive perfume out almost immediately.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel size, easy to fill, and cheap! I&#x27;ve ordered 3 total. I use them for perfume and Poo-Pourri (they sell a travel size container but it&#x27;s over-priced).</li>
    <li> I received it broken.  Not very happy</li>
    <li> I bought these to take on travel. I&#x27;m sure they would hold when kept upright but in a travel bag the contents leaked out.</li>
    <li> that is what I was looking for, got to many parfum bottles but can not travel with big sizes in airplane so this work great</li>
    <li> Wow, this item is hands over much larger than expected.  I was picturing an item half it&#x27;s size and was blown away when I opened the package.  Got to me in good time compared to other shipments I ordered the same day.  Will definately see if this is available the next time I need it.</li>
    <li> I pulled the top off my Polo bottle and used a straw to fill the silver bottle. It takes up less room abnd wieght in my pack.</li>
    <li> Just as stated in add. Takes a little while to get, but would recommed if this is something you can use.</li>
    <li> its just a spray bottle inside a thin container not an automizer cant pump liquid from other bottle into it</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Works great.</li>
    <li> good purchase except one of the two that I ordered was slightly dented - did not hamper operation but prevented me from giving it as a gift.</li>
    <li> Item says travel size so I expected this to travel well. Not the case. Opened up in my travel kit and although I closed it tightly and had it in it&#x27;s own plastic bag, I wasted 12 ml of good cologne. There are better options out there.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, nice looking</li>
    <li> Works great for me.  I usually buy the biggest bottle of my cologne possible (to get the best price per ounce).  I fill these small spay bottles and keep one in my travel bag and one in my bathroom.  Note:  Have had no problems with leaking etc.</li>
    <li> Spray bottles worked well for a little while and then started leaking.  Still was a good buy for the purpose for which I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these.. I fill them with &amp;#34;Poo Pourri&amp;#34; for my daughters and sister who work in offices. They work wonderfully for this purpose. They are small so they fit discreetly in their purse at work.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for travel. Easy to use with your choice of cologne, pump spray and all components high quality!  No issues with leaking etc, ie I fly with these.</li>
    <li> Well the idea was nice, it arrived on time, but the thing leaked all over the place multiple times. I brought it somewhere with me (with it outside of my purse because I was skeptical) and turns out it leaks a lot. I might&#x27;ve been the only one with this problem and I hope that nobody has had this leak on anything important. It leaks out of the glass tube and into the silver part, then spills out of the top of the silver container. It&#x27;s a nice idea for a product, but this one was not satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I mix a lot of cologne and perfume oils and also use if I want to put several perfume sample vials into one container. And of course, if I want to take my favorite fragrance but not the whole bottle. Perfect size.</li>
    <li> I needed a travel bottle for my perfume so this was good. It works and serves its purpose, but for me it sprayed a little too much. I like a hint (quick spritz) of perfume.</li>
    <li> Just the right size for me! Love it :)</li>
    <li> Exactly what we wanted!</li>
    <li> Seems nice - I will try putting perfume in there - but it&#x27;s larger than I thought so I might use it for something else. I do like the way the sprayer hose goes all the way to the bottom.</li>
    <li> Sprays well and is very cute in design. Does have a slight flaw to the cap but nothing too major. Great purchase especially for the price.</li>
    <li> It is the most effective and compact bottle. It fits in the back of my pocket if I am not carrying a purse.  Love it</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting, nicely manufactured and works great</li>
    <li> It broke after one week and a few uses. But it was inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Great travel size for 2 week vacation.</li>
    <li> Plastic top broke off after a week.</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool! Now i can just keep it in my school locker at the top and itll fit!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these because I didn&#x27;t like leaving my cologne in my car.  It gets really hot here so leaving my whole cologne bottle in my car really changed the smell of it.  Bought one of these and leave it in my car.  It&#x27;s great, convenient,  and really easy to refill.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it leaking or anything.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It seemed fine for the first week and then started leaking. No good.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 &amp; even though I screwed them nice and tight, they both leaked all in my suitcase and on my clothes. Good thing I like the smell.</li>
    <li> All of the bottles leaked. Because they were inexpensive, I threw them away and purchased replacements elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This travel spray is very well-made, and easy to fill and use.  It&#x27;s a little larger than the average travel spray (most of which are too small).  This one holds 12 ml of cologne/perfume, almost a half-ounce, which is more than enough for the average vacation (or for several vacations!).  And it puts out a pretty good spray for such a small bottle.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> Good quality.  Exactly what I wanted.  Good price.  Shipping time was fast.</li>
    <li> I brought this refillable spray bottle because I have perfume that was not a spray and I love it..</li>
    <li> Started leaking after a few months in my purse.</li>
    <li> Not a good buy!  Worked for about a week then fell apart and died.  So sad. There are better choices somewhere.</li>
    <li> This is a nice little atomizer, good for purse and travel. A bit hard to figure out how to open, but I think that&#x27;s also what makes it less likely to leak. Arrived on time and as described. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this, not for travel but because I have a bottle of perfume that I love but I made the mistake of buying in a regular bottle that you just dab on. Big mistake. It has very little fragrance without being sprayed. So I give it an A+. Plus if I do travel I have this handy container. It is well made and it seem pretty shatter resistant with metal container it comes.</li>
    <li> This is okay.  I&#x27;m not super crazy about it and have not used it yet.  It is my own fault, though.  It&#x27;s larger than I thought it would be.  I have switched to a small purse, and this is why I purchases a travel size perfume bottle in the first place.  This bottle is bigger than I  have room for in my small purse.  Since I haven&#x27;t used it, I don&#x27;t know how well it sprays or if it leaks, etc.  I am assuming, not.  It seems to look like it would work ok.  Sorry, that&#x27;s all I can say at this point.  If I decide to use it I will update my review.</li>
    <li> The inside is coated with plastic so it can say sanitized it will not drip if closed properly this.is for anyone who travels a lot</li>
    <li> How does no one mention how freaking difficult it is to get the metal sheath off of the glass tube? Holy God in heaven I resorted to holding it under hot water so that the metal would expand. I scratched up the case pretty badly trying to get the thing open. I&#x27;m a craftsperson so generally I&#x27;m pretty good at stuff like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the other reviewers are right in that it is fairly large. It&#x27;s pretty much the size of a smaller, regular-sized perfume bottle. Honestly you might as well just carry around the original perfume bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely end up buying a different, much smaller atomizer. This one doesn&#x27;t satisfy my needs at all. The metal is really cheap and it&#x27;s just too big for a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the essential oil mosquito repellant with catnip oil on it. I love this bottle, its great! The screw in vial keeps it leak free and the cap protects from accidental sprays.</li>
    <li> As many others have stated in the reviews, most of these leak. I ordered 5 and only 2 worked, and 1 of the 2 failed after a few sprays. For the size these are, you are better off getting a travel spray bottle at Walmart. I have used the Walmart bottles since the silver refillable didn&#x27;t work, and I am completely satisfied with the Walmart spray bottle. I would not recommend the silver refillable bottles.</li>
    <li> Spray a bit too much but nonetheless it is ideal to store in a purse or on your person. I personally use it because I have a massive eau de toilette bottle I received as a gift and didn&#x27;t want to fiddle and fart with the big bottle, so every once in a while I fill this sucker up and spray it on.</li>
    <li> these should be 99 cents. too expensive</li>
    <li> If I could give this no stars I would. It leaks and doesn&#x27;t spray. I realize it&#x27;s cheap, but I thought I might get some use out of it.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic! They are quite gorgeous bottles. As perfect as they look in the picture, they look even better in real life. Perfectly manufactured. The pieces fit snugly within each other, slide smoothly apart for refilling. You would pay a lot for this same bottle at a fancy retail store. They did take about a month to arrive, but if you&#x27;re in no hurry it&#x27;s worth the wait. Love, love! May buy some more!</li>
    <li> Great, secure no leaking, and cut refillable travel dispenser!!! I bought 3 and none have leaked despite being in purses, laying on their side in desk drawers, and beat around in a backpack!!! No issues with spraying or clogging!!!</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> I bought it to spray plants in a terrarium. It did not work for that but wasn&#x27;t designed for it either. I just hoped It would work getting into small areas</li>
    <li> First I love it! I have attached pictures so you can see why.&lt;br /&gt;The inside is a glass, not plastic - glass, bottle. The &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; lid screws on tightly. (I have held it upside down and in my purse and it does not leak.)&lt;br /&gt;It then slides with a nice tight fit into the outer &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; casing. It won&#x27;t come off unless you pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;Then the cap covers the spray pump.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pack of 2.&lt;br /&gt;Really nice!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the not so good part.&lt;br /&gt;1 came bent out of shape. The spray top part. everything else was fine with that one. Just the bent sprayer. So I opted to ask for a replacement. Instead they gave my a refund. This is a picture of the one that works wonderfully well.&lt;br /&gt;Still want the second one.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, take a chance and then inspect it as soon as it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering what I put into it. well.... Poo Pourri ;)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included step by step photos. Too many have commented on how to open it etc...</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t complain about the product except...how do I get the my cologne into this bottle?! If someone can explain, that would be great.</li>
    <li> This is good for traveling, the smell stay there. Its pretty wonderful little thing that keep you fresh and smell good</li>
    <li> I bought these as gifts and by all accounts they work great....  very well built and quite a useful little thing if you want to keep a freshen up shot of cologne in your car...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and they work.</li>
    <li> perfect for taking on the go, inyour purse, gym bag, to a meeting as a refresher, travel,&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t have to take the full size bottle and risk leakage or bulk</li>
    <li> These are easy to refill and just the right size, but both have leaked in my carry-on bag. Thankfully liquids are in ziploc bags, but it&#x27;s not pleasant for perfume to leak all over your other toiletries. They are fine to use at home, but I can&#x27;t recommend them for travel.</li>
    <li> these are great for the perfumes that I make!</li>
    <li> Planned to use these to store some cologne to carry around with me.  They would definitely fit in a purse fine, but not in a pocket - which was the intention.</li>
    <li> These started leaking in my bag and in my car soon after being filled</li>
    <li> Great for travel!  Saving lots of room in my cosmetic bag and i get to bring my fav scent with me!</li>
    <li> I used this as a discreet way to transport my Poo-Pouri at work. First off, it wouldn&#x27;t spray. Then, it leaked in my pocket. I smelled like &amp;#34;strong herbs and spices&amp;#34; (as my friend put it) for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t spray at all and LEAKED.  Sad, because I was really looking forward to having this product.</li>
    <li> Item leaks, sprays fine mist that accumulates which then leaks down the side.</li>
    <li> nice travel size spray bottles. Great for taking liquids with you. fits in a pocket or purse. would buy more</li>
    <li> This spray bottle is quite nice! I keep it in my car for quick and easy sprits while I&#x27;m out. Definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the size and I am afraid it will leak. I thought it was like the Travalo refillable spray.</li>
    <li> these little things are the greatest travel companions. The atomizer is pretty consistent adn they are pretty easy to re-fill.</li>
    <li> Wife loved it for vacations and pocketbook.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase for me.  The bottle is well made, easy to fill and didn&#x27;t leak at all.  The sprayer is excellent and I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Can somebody tell me how to open this thing? The metal sheah just seems to be deadly glued to the glass tube, I tried all the way I can but still couldnt open it. Am returning it!</li>
    <li> Think it&#x27;s just what I needed</li>
    <li> im glad it came with 2 of them because after the first week one has already broken. cheaply made and breaks easy</li>
    <li> Love these spray bottles for travel.  Small, beautiful and easy to fill.  Its a must buy for anyone to have</li>
    <li> This works perfect for homemade breath freshner to keep in purse or pocket.  Would work great for perfume also! Look nice also!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and was a quality product. I would recommend this to anyone who travels either for business or pleasure.</li>
    <li> Though this product is great for its portability, it has some flaws.  First, it sprays far too much to be subtle; with just one spray the cologne is very overpowering.  Second, it leaks which is a huge issue.  The product works as you would expect for something this price.  If you&#x27;re looking for a more reliable perfume bottle, spend the extra few dollars for a quality product.</li>
    <li> It leaks, plain and simple. Had a full bottle in the morning, half by noon. Can&#x27;t give give stars in good conscious.</li>
    <li> Got these for my wife and she uses them every day for essential oils and perfume.</li>
    <li> Do NOT waste your money. Worked fine when I first received it, but after sitting in my purse for about a week, I attempted to use it, and rather than spritzing out when I pressed the nozzle, it just began leaking everywhere and making a total mess. So the item literally did not even make it to a single real use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a replacement of my perfume bottle.  I had purchased some expensive perfume and unfortunately the little top popped off and would not go back on.  So I purchased this to transfer the perfume into.  Well, within the first few minutes, the top popped off.  I was pretty disapointed.</li>
    <li> It broke in my bag after about six days of having it. The silver top came detached from the glass bottle and no longer screws on securely so it leaked out into my purse. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t fill it more than slightly, as it would have been a waste of $150 perfume. My bag smells nice though. Thanks.</li>
    <li> We found these to be perfect for travel and my husband and I both use these to transport our favorite cologne.</li>
    <li> This turned out to be a really nice product.  I use it for cologne when travelling, and it is a really nice product.</li>
    <li> Very nice and amazing spray pump; it makes a little go a long way -- but be very careful, the inner container is made out of glass and will break if dropped.</li>
    <li> The bottle looks old and there were scratches and dents. Cheap quality. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If first I was happy but as I used them, suddenly the bottom sleeve does not stay on. It&#x27;s as if they stretched! I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
    <li> Great deal and quick delivery</li>
    <li> Took a while to get to me but man my wife loves it. She puts &amp;#34;Poo Pourri&amp;#34; in this little container. If you don&#x27;t know what &amp;#34;Poo Pourri&amp;#34; is look it up. Throws it in her purse to use in case you need to go &amp;#34;boom boom&amp;#34; at a friends house etc.</li>
    <li> Works great, however don&#x27;t store in your luggage. The pressure in flight will cause the contents to leak out.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again, the product when filled leaks when using.</li>
    <li> Great little spray bottle for my shave kit.  Small size does not take up a lot of room, better than schlepping a whole bottle of cologne around the globe.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles. They work perfectly for my business. They are very classy.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne comes in a bottle which makes it too easy to use too much.  Now that I&#x27;ve started using a spray bottle, I get the perfect amount every time without waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve not had any problems with leakage.  Granted, I&#x27;m not travelling with it all the time, but it has been packed a couple of times.</li>
    <li> These are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even notice how big this was going to be(its a good thing) i was expecting a very small bottle. but this is just fantastic, and the casing around the glass fits snugly so i don&#x27;t have to worry about ut breaking or coming apart in my suitcase, Very worth the 5 bux it costs, And FREE SHIPPING!!</li>
    <li> Very Sleak and easy to use. Not very small, but certainly carries enough cologne. I&#x27;m a man and use this freshen up when necessary and can conceal in coat pocket.</li>
    <li> I needed another atomizer because I misplaced my current one (which I actually found two days ago.) Love the silver color. Opening in glass insert was large enough for me to spray my favorite scent (Angel by Thierry Mugler) right inside. Spray nozzle is strong and sprays a nice mist. Product is very sturdy. Product shipped fast and arrived two days early. Will order more if I need to in the future.</li>
    <li> Loved them will order some more</li>
