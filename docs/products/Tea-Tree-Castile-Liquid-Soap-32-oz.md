<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps are amazing. My husband and I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years.  I love the fact that the ingredients are natural, and the oils moisturize and scent the skin without leaving any residue.  I love to use this as bubble bath as well.  We love the tea tree oil because of all the great health benefits of tea tree.  Although this soap contains oil, it never leaves a greasy feeling on the skin. It acts as aromatherapy while you shower or bathe. It foams nicely. We prefer to use it with a round pouf bath sponge.</li>
    <li> between the sense and a leather and the way it makes my skin feel, I will absolutely never purchased another soap.</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with Dr. Bronners soap.  While I don&#x27;t agree with what is written all over the bottle (his belief system) it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the pure castile soap is that, pure.  I use it in the bathroom, at the kitchen sink, but it hasn&#x27;t worked for washing hair.</li>
    <li> stick to the peppermint soap, tea tree not a good replacement, even if you save a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> Love all Dr Bronners products! This is great for a face wash or for post shaving to disinfect and comfort your skin</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m changing my original review.  I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used the tea tree, lavender, and peppermint soaps--both liquid and bar formats--and have been really pleased with both.  Now, I don&#x27;t use it alone as my main shampoo, as it makes my head Tangle City--but I do like to put a little bit into my regular shampoo when I feel I need a better clean.  But where I really think this stuff shines is body wash.  I get infections easily and have been fighting a systemic candida infection that also has had fun on my skin.  Washing daily with this has really helped.  As in noticeably helped.  As in I have two jugs of the tea tree and two of the lavender at home just waiting to be used after the one I&#x27;ve got in the shower is done.  Yep, a keeper.  Lasts quite a while, too.  For me, with skin issues, the tea tree is my favorite--though both of the lavender and peppermint also help the skin.  So, I&#x27;m keeping this on my shelf--and putting the bars into my pack.  The only parts of me (outside of my hair) that gets &#x27;too dry&#x27; with using this are my hands--so I just use some lotion to take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> This price is outrageous!  Whole Foods which is an expensive store has it for $11.99</li>
    <li> Shampoo, face, and body wash all in one with no cancer causing chemicals. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. Specially for those of us that like to use Tea Tree Oil. It eats up dirt pretty good and makes a lot of suds when used as a body soap. I normally use it as an additive when I fill in the tub for a nice soak after a long bike ride. I recommend it for those that like the all natural organic products.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bonner&#x27;s liquid soap is the best for your skin. I have used the bar soap version of this liquid soap and it is very good for the skin. I use this liquid soap as a body wash (and the bar soap works great to replace shaving cream).  I have been using only Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps since early 2004.  Before then I was using bar and liquid soaps that contain harmful chemicals and animal by-products (think your dead pet that the local animal shelter sells to cosmetic companies; Google \\&quot;terrible touch me nots\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap are very mild and smoothing to your skin.  Your skin will never feel softer and look better.  I have recommended this soap to my nephew who has terrible ache.  He has just recently told me that Dr. Bonner&#x27;s lavender soap is helping to reduce his ache outbreaks.  I use this soap in conjunction with colon cleanses and liver cleanses which help to flush toxins out of your body instead of forcing them out through your skin.  Once I switched over to Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap, stopped using chemical-based toiletries and did cleanses of my internal organs, my skin cleared up completely.  It actually only took one month for my skin to clear up, but then I never had really bad ache.  Other Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps that really cleared up my skin are eucalyptus and citrus - both are excellent but the eucalyptus is even better for making my skin so soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: If you have cats, keep tree tea oil away from them!!  I have read that it can kill them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Everything that touches your skin is absorbed into your skin and travels throughout your body via your blood stream.  Dr. Bonner&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t contain any harmful chemicals that will adversely affect your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI - I don&#x27;t use this liquid soap at full strength.  I purchased a 16 ounce squeeze bottle from my local beauty supply store that I fill with 50% liquid soap and 50% water which I shake before each use.  That dilution ratio is more than plenty to get the full effect from this liquid soap.  You can go with 40% soap to 60% water and it works just as well.this liquid soap.  You can go with 40% soap to 60% water and it works just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a myriad of sulfate free body wash products to try to find a soap that works well for my sensitive skin.  This is the best of the best, and also the most affordable.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> You get a lot of product for your dollar. At least twice the amount more. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a name I have always&lt;br /&gt;associated with quality. As soon as you smell the product, you know that you are getting a high concentration of tea tree oil. You don&#x27;t have to use much of the product so your dollar goes even farther. Indeed a great brand of tea tree oil soap!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps?  They are highly concentrated so they last a very long time, they are multi-function so you can eliminate a bunch of other products like dish soap, body wash, laundry soap, shampoo, etc.  They rinse cleanly without leaving a film and they come in a lot of different scents.  Our favorite is the tea tree oil, but the peppermint is nice, too.</li>
    <li> This was just what I needed. So glad you were able to have it. Great product.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Dr. Bronner soaps. My favorite is the peppermint scent, but the tea tree soap still works very well for that clean feeling.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love the smell although my daughter didn&#x27;t like it - she doesn&#x27;t think it has a good smell for some reason. Quick shipment.</li>
    <li> I was an Dr. Bronner&#x27;s almond and peppermint junky for the longest time. I&#x27;ve recently been trying the different blends with good results so far. The tea tree oil scent took me a little while to become acclimated to, almost an acquired taste.  Fun fact: tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic. Better than scrubbing everything down with the chemicals in antibacterial soap for sure.  This isn&#x27;t my favorite scent, but what can I say? I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. For a grade I give it an A.</li>
    <li> I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for years and years. It is truly wonderful and I feel good using it because it is safe and non-toxic unlike most commercial soaps today. I use it for bathing, face wash, dishes, cleaning, just everything! I even use it in my homemade organic garden pesticide for years lol Needs more than just 5 stars on Bronner&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am especially pleased to be a customer knowing that Dr. Bronners have contributed well over one million dollars to support gmo labeling in Washington state! I don&#x27;t live there but it is great to see. Thank you Dr. Bronner&#x27;s family!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vote yes on I522! and March Against Monsanto this Saturday :)</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I love how it makes my skin feel.  I highly recommend it!  Just look at the list of ingredients and you will see why it is so wonderful.  This is a true soap made from the process of saponification of all natural oils.  This version includes tea tree oil, which is a natural antibacterial and antifungal medicine for your skin, you can use this soap on a daily basis to prevent and treat of a wide variety of skin issues.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a solution to my problem skin. I have continually clogged hair follicles and body acne. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree oil soap for two weeks now and it has healed many lesions on my skin. I Have even started using this on my face. Although it is very thin (watery) a little goes a long way. The soap bar version of this product is a little easier to handle :D  The scent takes some getting used to but doesn&#x27;t seem to follow you around all day like some highly perfumed products.  My only negative feedback about this product is that it makes my skin feel very dry, although clean. I have found that a light lotion, like Cetaphil daily hydrating lotion, kicks this dry feeling.  Two thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> I use this for my son&#x27;s dandruff issues. I mix about 2 oz of the castile soap with 4 oz of water in a foaming soap dispenser and after two baths the dandruff is gone. I use it in all purpose cleaner with vinegar, water, and a couple drops of the soap. So useful. It goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> My grandson has seen a great improvement with his acne</li>
    <li> This brownish liquid has a consistency of an unadulterated water and a strong stench of some organic solvent (turpentine?), which I find intolerable. If added in large quantities - Tbs or more - it has some foaming action. I&#x27;m glad that the ingredients are fairly traded, though.</li>
    <li> Love their products...</li>
    <li> This soap is perfect! I love the all-natural smell and feel.Other chemical shampoos,give me a headache.This hemp tea soap fights bacteria better than any other soap around.A couple of nights,each week,massage this soap into your problem skin area.Smear this soap lotion,and then put on some white socks.Fights against athlete&#x27;s foot and fungal dermatitis.Let the soap set overnight and in the morning shower off.Spinkle some aloe powder,in your socks. The soap is the best.Better than cheap soaps and aerosal sprays.(It may sting,for a few minutes,yet your feet will heal up,after repeated weekly soap massages.)</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I use it for everything except hair. It smells really good as well. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Again  packaging was a problem or perhaps it was so roughly handled that the box came open in shipment and it came out of the box and was sitting strait up in the  open  box --on my portch</li>
    <li> Smells great and lasts long. You only need about one cap full to wash up or shampoo your hair one time, but make sure you moisturize after getting out of the shower. This stuff will dry out your skin if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever. I use it in the kitchen for hands and quick cutting board wash-ups. Here&#x27;s my trick for saving water. Buy any kind of foaming soap in a pump dispenser. They&#x27;re the ones designed to work with thin, watery soaps. Throw out the soap and rinse well. Refill with diluted Dr Bronner&#x27;s 1:8, soap to water. Using the foamy dispenser keeps it from sliding off your hand before you can get to it.    Pump foamy soap on dry hands, lather, scrub, then turn on water to rinse, it only takes a few seconds to rinse away.    It&#x27;s good for me, my senses, my pocketbook, and the planet. A quart will last forever.    Spread the word about the foaming pump dispenser!</li>
    <li> Kills odors VERY good, and kills germs.  Great value!  This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Girls like the smell, smells good to me too but it kinda leaves my skin feeling dry, so I stopped using it. I can&#x27;t say dry really but you know when you slide your hand down your skin how it feels smooth and it glides easily, you would lose that after using this product.</li>
    <li> There is no clean like Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Clean!!!! This soap is very powerful and it will leave you smelling great. The only thing that I would warn you against is using too much to this soap as the strong smell could overwhelm your nose.</li>
    <li> Although I bought for my hair, it&#x27;s better for cleaning. Even when watered down it leaves my hair super dry after less than one minute on my hair. but I definitely think it cleans it really good.</li>
    <li> What I love most about this soap is the smell, I adore the smell of tea tree oil (for those unfamiliar with it, it has an earthy sent like eucalyptus) however, the reason I purchased it is due to the rating it received on the Skin Deep website (a site that informs you of the chemical makeup of products we use on our skin).  It is one of the few liquid soaps that don&#x27;t cause cancer or some other health concerns and it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree is a nice touch because of it&#x27;s antiseptic and anti fungal properties so it makes for a great cleanser after cuts and scrapes (and doesn&#x27;t sting my kids when washing cuts- a big plus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that it does clump on occasion in the pump but the clumps come right out with the rest of the soap so essentially you get a small soap lump every now and again while washing.  It is a thin soap so I had to be a little more careful when using a pump as it can squirt out rather far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually recommends that you water it down when you use it and from my experiance this reduces the clumping in the pumps and coats my hands very well (which is nice because it requires less soap to get the job done).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the rave reviews, but am disappointed. I tried it as a shampoo, and it did nothing good, dried my hair out. Luckily I had a hairdresser appointment the same day and she was able to &#x27;fix&#x27; my hair. Don&#x27;t recommend shampooing with this at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried cleaning with it. It&#x27;s ok, but I prefer Simple Green for cleaning. It&#x27;s ok as hand soap but really, I can get cheaper hand soap anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found the same size, 32 Oz for $10 locally, where I paid almost $14 on Amazon. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again!</li>
    <li> Great soap but the smell is tea tree oil only.</li>
    <li> This is great for making homemade and more effective dandruff shampoo for my husband!  As a teacher and a mom, I also love using a little on me and my daughter every day to ward off lice! Lice hate tea tree oil!</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Peppermint Soap for ages.  It is great and leaves your skin clean and tingly so when I decided to switch to the Tea Tree I was a bit hesitant.  This doesn&#x27;t leave your skin tingling like the peppermint but it leaves your skin thoroughly clean with no residue.  Nice &#x27;earthy&#x27; tea tree scent to it (kind of like eucalyptus only nicer).  Tea Tree is a natural anti-fungal and antibacterial oil.  I&#x27;m on strong antibiotics and sometimes I get dry skin which I think is from fungal infections...but not anymore!  This stuff works.</li>
    <li> I found this cheaper at Whole Foods, so I bought a bottle. I diluted it about 1:8 (soap to water ratio) with filtered water to use in a pump dispenser for hand soap. Works very well this way, even though it feels like all I&#x27;m getting is water when I pump out soap to wash my hands. I always have to prepare myself for the smell first, and it still overwhelms me. It smells like the grease in an old car repair shop to me when I first pump out the diluted soap. I rinse my hands well, and the smell that remains on my hands is rather pleasant, a nice mild herbal scent. Got a bar version for the bath, too! Great stuff. This 32-ounce bottle will last a *long* time.</li>
    <li> Horrible smell and didn&#x27;t see it clean anything.</li>
    <li> We use this as hand soap in the kitchen and for general cleaning. A little goes a long way. So worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps!</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products have been a favorite with me for MANY years.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> As a matter of performance, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps are very hard to beat.  They have been around for many years, at least 50, and they know what they are doing!  It takes next to nothing to get enough soap to clean up so it lasts a long time.  The usual dilution ration is about four parts water to one part soap for shampoo, but that&#x27;s just me.  Follow the instructions on the container.  If your having problems with dandruff and other brands leave your scalp uncomfortable, try one of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps, it really is amazingly good.  Make the effort to keep it out of your eyes though, it&#x27;s old fashion and irritates the eyes - I can&#x27;t speak for the baby version because I haven&#x27;t tried that one, but I have used just about every other version they have offered over the years.</li>
    <li> Clears up acne and helps keep skin clean, I work in a manufacturing plant with steel machining and welding and I take a shower every night when I come home from work, and it cleans skin and hair amazing. It does rip the oils from your hair so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest washing your hair with it too often. Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> Since I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products this review might be bias. LOL. The Tea Tree does have a tree bark smell to it but I am into the organic non-fragrance stuff. If you do not like the natural earth/forest smell then stay away from this one. Eventually, you will get used to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap for about a year now. I use it mostly in the bathroom as a body wash, but I&#x27;ve also used it as a bathroom cleaner, in an insecticidal soap, and hair wash. I&#x27;ve also tried the Dr. Bronner bar soap, but I feel that the liquid is a better value. The bar soap didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected. It worked well, I just prefer the liquid. The Tea Tree is a nice scent, not too strong and I don&#x27;t notice a scent after I get out of the shower. I have also tried the citrus and lavender, both are very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so confused about this product. It made my hair freakishly dry. I didn&#x27;t use much like other reviewers said, but that didn&#x27;t matter- it still got incredibly dry afterward (and this is coming from someone with fairly normal hair that can get just a little bit on the dry side sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it and then putting on globs of conditioner afterward to balance things out, but my hair was still dry after. This left my hair tangled and feeling course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as body wash goes, it&#x27;s okay. But if it&#x27;s drying on my hair, you can guess that it&#x27;s drying on my skin. I prefer body washes that give a little more moisture to the skin. I also didn&#x27;t notice anything particularly special about it in terms of soap, although the reviews of this product say differently...</li>
    <li> I tried both this Hemp Tea Tree and the Hemp Lavender soaps and will copy my review at the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculously GOOD. Back in the 70s, this was considered &amp;#34;hippie soap&amp;#34; as many may know. I stayed with friends that used the peppermint variety and I thought it was the only one. I didn&#x27;t care for peppermint soap so never bought it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here it is, 2015. When I Googled for a soap for my face, avoiding the over-priced faux-luxury products that seem to be the norm, I kept running into Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. I kept reading what all it would do for face AND body AND hair and seemingly dozens of other uses.  This stuff is GREAT. I hadn&#x27;t been shopping for body wash, but I&#x27;ve tossed my usual product when I discovered that my dry, flaky ankles were suddenly softer and not dry at all. I&#x27;m going to use up my old shampoos too and never buy them again. I can&#x27;t get over how good this is.  And I was skeptical. No more. BUY IT.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t quite get the hype surrounding this product. It&#x27;s an okay soap--nothing special in performance or scent. I&#x27;ve tried pre-diluting it and using it full-strength, but neither methods really provide a good value; I still use up the soap quickly enough that it&#x27;s not a money saver at all.</li>
    <li> My wife uses it as body soap, dish detergent, laundry detergent, and for other household cleaning.  She has long fine hair, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well as shampoo as it seemed too dry and causes her hair to tangle pretty badly. She saw that it can also work as a make-up remover. So she first tested it out.  She put liquid eyeliner, pencil eyeliner, lip liner, and lipstick on her hand, and used the magic soap to wash it. It worked like a magic! You could see the make-up melt away and wash off immediately without much rubbing. No make-up residues left. Then she repeated the same test with Philosophy make-up remover (which she used to think it worked well), and regular facial soap. With the make-up remover, she had to rub her hand pretty good before all the make-up was gone. Regular facial soap just didn&#x27;t remove make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s in love with it.  When she travels, she can bring a small bottle of magic soap and it can work as body soap, face wash, make-up remover, and laundry detergent. That&#x27;s a log of space saved in her luggage. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Love this product..  Glad I found it on Amazon,  I will be ordering again.  I got it for many reasons , one of wich is to clean my old pots and pans.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Good for many uses.</li>
    <li> I had written about this soap and a lady asked about the bottle being sealed is any way when you get it and for the life of me I couldn&#x27;t remember for sure. Got another bottle today and yes they are. The seal is much like the seal on a bottle of bleach without the pull-tab. I hope you see this.</li>
    <li> Cut this 1:1 with water and it&#x27;ll last a long time. It is somewhat drying, so I don&#x27;t use it on my face. It&#x27;s great for a bodywash or as a hand soap (might want to lower the concentration even more). It&#x27;s natural antibacterial properties work great.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid area and mold can be problem.  I first realized how good tea tree is with this kind of thing when I bought a leather rug that had a mildew smell.  I mixed the soap with some water and applied it to the rug.  I threw in outside on balcony and waited a couple days.  The rug smelled faintly of tea tree, but the mildew smell went away. Its a one step process unlike baking soda and vinegar.</li>
    <li> This soap is amazing. Cuts through dirt, it&#x27;s kind on the skin and doesn&#x27;t  leave it clogged up and zitty. It&#x27;s extremely refreshing and you can use it to shave with too. I&#x27;ve even cleaned stains out of pants whilst on a business trip.  A little goes a long way too.</li>
    <li> I was so disappointed in this product because the you can&#x27;t read the miniscule writing on the bottle for instructions.  Then their website tries to get you to buy a book with all the wonderful formulars inside.  No Thanks.  I bought this like 6-7 months ago and its under my kitchen sink because I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> The soap seems ok, smells good, works ok.  But it is is very thin, very watery.  It&#x27;s not just a little bit thinner than normal liquid soap, but very much thinner.  The label lists water as the primary ingredient.  Be super careful if you use a pump bottle for this soap, it shoots out with lots of velocity unless you are very careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paid good money to ship water across country.  I wish they would let me add water after it arrived!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great soap!</li>
    <li> Great for clearing up acne. Cleaning the house and such a green product.  I just love this soap.  So many uses around the house.</li>
    <li> Castile soap is a must have in our house. It is all natural which is very important to me. Especially with allergies in our house. I use it to clean EVERYTHING! I put a few different kinds in a spray bottle with water and some vinegar and I clean everything with this solution. Also makes a great facial cleanser, body wash, and hand soap (a bit runny though for hand soap). I feel it is a bit to heavy and waxy to wash my fine hair with but works well in our 5 year old&#x27;s hair. Thanks Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for making an amazing natural soap!!!!</li>
    <li> I have loved this stuff since someone introduced me to it 40 or 50 years ago in the Haight in San Francisco (though that was the Peppermint version). One caution, it IS real soap and you will notice it (as will your kids) if it gets in your eyes, a cut, etc.</li>
    <li> been using this and like it very much!</li>
    <li> The soap is a little watery, but a small amount works well for the feet. I use it as a general anti-fungal soap. I didn&#x27;t start with fungus to kill, so I can&#x27;t tell you how well it works for that except to say that I haven&#x27;t had any fungus problems. I think the smell could be strong for some people, I started out not too fond of it but it grew on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would use this as a general body wash, tea tree oil can be pretty drying and seems a little too watery for a scrubby.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, just don&#x27;t read the crazy written all over the bottle or better yet get the bar version since there is less crazy written on it.  I used this for showers, to wash my Merino wool sweaters in, and rinse out my kefir and kombucha containers.</li>
    <li> Using it all the time now as my general purpose soap. Not sure about brushing your teeth though lol :)</li>
    <li> The soap has been good so far. However the lid got here broken so I couldn&#x27;t close the bottle, so I was spilling the soap whenever I use it.</li>
    <li> This is a favorite soap of mine due to it being all-natural and having excellent natural anti-bacterial properties due to the tea tree oil. It&#x27;s a great face and body soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have had many times where the pumping action in the pump dispensers of any kind I use it in, build up clumps that look like blobs of glycerine soap on the end of the pump with a bit of a clog...so you pump it a few times and WHAM it spews out. I can&#x27;t fault the soap totally for this as it&#x27;s a great soap if you use it in the container provided, but I did want the consumer to be aware in the event that you decide to switch it to a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago I did this and it sprayed directly in my eye. It had clogged the pump dispenser because the pumping action makes a glob build up. The pain was so intense I couldn&#x27;t stop screaming and it dried out my eye horribly. I simply couldn&#x27;t seem to rinse it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this clogging property happens to everyone who uses a pump with this. I wish they could make it not do that. That said, as an adult, as long as you know and remember to pump it once then clean out any dried glycerine blobs at the end of the pump dispenser, it could work just fine. Better yet, just don&#x27;t put it in a pump dispenser and use it directly from this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a technical difficulty and an inconvenience but not one big enough to hinder my love of the soap and the great ingredients in it. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time now and do love the soap, but wanted to give a heads up at the same time.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this shampoo/soap would foam up so much but it does and I love it! I&#x27;m so glad to find an all natural soap product that actually foams up more than the standard shampoo brands. I have bad sebborhea dermititus and I think it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile liquid soap, especially the Tea Tree variety.  I use that for everything from washing my hands after handling meat to cleaning the toilet.  I also like the Peppermint to wash my hair (don&#x27;t get it in your eyes) and the Citrus for general use.  The only problem is it&#x27;s getting a little too expensive so I may have to give it up.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair once a month (because that&#x27;s how long I keep my hair braided) and this soap lasted me for almost 2 years. I still have a little bit left on the bottom so I ordered another one in a different scent. I love it, it cleanses my hair really well and keeps my scalp clean &amp; my hair nice and soft.</li>
    <li> The name Dr. Bronner&#x27;s says it all.  This is some TOTALLY AMAZING STUFF!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.. I actually bought it after seeing an article about how it cleans up old cake pans. It did.. It got off most of the old burnt on stains without to much elbow grease.. I use it all over the place now.. Nice tea tree smell but it does have that castile soap smell with i find unpleasant so i wouldnt use it on my skin.. Cleans counter tops, soaked a messy old crockpot bowl for an hour and all that baked on crap wiped off easily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to get into the details as to what this stuff can be good for, but try it out on any type of skin condition or rash, or for daily use in the shower.  It has a light, refreshing tea tree scent, and works wonders as a medicine if used properly.  Tea tree oil is amazing!  You can also buy tea tree oil whole and add a bit of it to this soap to strengthen its microbial properties!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product!  For an everyday household cleaner (bathroom &amp; kitchen), I add 1/4 cup of soap to a full spray-bottle of water.  It leaves my counters and sinks clean and shiny.  I even use it to clean up spills on my wood floors.  The bottle of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap will last me a lifetime with how little I need to use for a full bottle of cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using it for a household cleaner as described above, this product is truly environmentally friendly (unlike your Clorox and other like products) and it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than other store-bought green cleaners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor, and buy your favorite Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap to make your own household cleaner!</li>
    <li> I loved it! Tea tree is good for acne and things of that nature, so it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is amazing for the skin and it does its job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint for some time and really like it so I wanted to try the Tea Tree version. While it does clean well and rinse clean, the tea tree tends to leave a white residue after it dries. Our sinks, the soaps dispenser, etc; anything that may get splashed while using this variety ends up with a white film. I&#x27;ll be switching back to the peppermint from now on.</li>
    <li> Loved it cleared up my skin to a point where my skin looks clear and very healthy I defiantly recommend this product</li>
    <li> but next time I will buy it without the Tea Tree in it. It would give me more option to add different smells to my soap.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for more ways to be all natural, so this soap was something we wanted to try based on reviews. We bought this bottle months ago and we still have a lot left. We use it to care for our 104 year old hard wood floors and wood-work, body wash, coffee maker, clothes stain remover and lots of other uses. The only downside is the smell.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  I don&#x27;t care for all that spiritual crap printed all over but the ingredients are all organic and have not received any allergic reaction from me or my ferret, which both are hyper allergic to perfumes and additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers quite well too, I&#x27;ve found myself using much less than in comparison to body washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Definitely recommend it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> Lathers well, and gets me feeling clean, but not too dried out. This is not a harsh soap and the size I got lasts for quite a while, 32oz. I like the tea tree oil, which is the only one I&#x27;ve purchases so far, next I think I&#x27;ll try the eucalyptus one. I definitely recommend. I don&#x27;t have any allergies, but I&#x27;m thinkin this would be great for people that can do stuff like dove or swauve.</li>
    <li> Like that I was able to mix it with baking soda and be able to clean my bathroom and it&#x27;s non-toxic and clean.  Weird that it can cut through so much grime.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and body, and not positive if I will continue doing so.  Do like the ability to clean with it and price is comparable to going to a big box store.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product to use in my garden. Safe and organic for the Animals. Very satisfied with this soap will purchase again.</li>
    <li> With essential oils and gentle soaps, this all in one body wash has been my family&#x27;s favorite since we started using it 10 years ago. Perfect for baths and showers, this soap lathers nicely and leave my skin feeling and smelling amazing. It&#x27;s gentle while effective. Not to mention, the price! Great company too. The Tea Tree and Lavender are my favorites!</li>
    <li> We use this in our laundry, on our armpits, for dishes, handsoap, etc etc.. sometimes even as a toothpaste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great, safe product. Watch the documentary if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
    <li> Everything that I expected it to be.  It was exactly what I was looking for and more and I will order more shortly.</li>
    <li> This stuff is almost as runny as water.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the peppermint version of this line of soap, and the Hemp Tea Tree was as good in terms of functionality... but it smelled very strong, and it had a vague aroma of gasoline, which I&#x27;m not a fan of bathing myself in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was going crazy, but other people who used it said the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weird. But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into, you&#x27;ll love the soap.</li>
    <li> I use this soap for all kinds of things.  I like to use it after going in the pool or hot tub at our complex since tea tree has some antimicrobial properties.  I also mix it with coconut milk and use it to wash my hair.  I dilute it 50/50 with water and one bottle lasts forever.  Helps my husband&#x27;s acne and my eczema.  I especially love this one or the peppermint one on a hot summer day because the soap feels cool on the skin.  Love that it&#x27;s organic and free of sulfates and silicones.</li>
    <li> We started using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for shampoo, but now also use it for body wash, hand soap, in home made shaving cream and multi-purpose cleaner. It&#x27;s great soap and the tea tree oil is an added bonus great for dandruff and as an antiseptic also.</li>
    <li> This body wash has a nice but not overly strong smell of tea tree. The liquid isn&#x27;t thick, and sometimes I think I would like to have it pour a little more sedately so I don&#x27;t overuse it--I did transfer it into a pump bottle (reused) so it&#x27;s a bit easier to handle.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really clean all that well - especially if you are going to use it on your hair.  It weighs it down too much.</li>
    <li> In short: Tea Tree Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap (2x day) + Vitamin E Oil (night only) has essentially cured the mild acne problems I&#x27;ve had since I hit puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details:&lt;br /&gt;Product:  Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, 18-in-1 Hemp Tea Tree  (NOT peppermint, others are untried)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some quick facts about me:&lt;br /&gt;-I have had constant, mild acne since puberty, but never enough to justify expensive medication&lt;br /&gt;-I have a mixed complexion; I used to think it was oily, but have found that was just because my skin was overproducing oil because of the salicylic acid and benzoil peroxide in the products I was using.&lt;br /&gt;-I have tried almost all over-the-counter products (From AcneFree/Proactive to Kiss My Face/Toms)&lt;br /&gt;-I have also been to a dermatologist twice and had worse results than with the over-the-counter products, for 4x the cost&lt;br /&gt;-I do have a price limit... I don&#x27;t want to spend more than $30/month (yearly average) on my face, because at that point I&#x27;d rather have the red spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I try a product, I would use as recommended for one month and then determine if I should go back to what I was doing before or continue to use that product.  Using this method, I was able to get to a place where I was happy if I:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Used a face masque several times a week&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliated several times a week&lt;br /&gt;-Used a blue light device on any &amp;#34;hidden&amp;#34; acne areas&lt;br /&gt;-Used moisturizer in the morning after washing my face&lt;br /&gt;-Used oil-absorbing powder and/or cream foundation after the moisturizer soaked in&lt;br /&gt;-Used Vitamin E oil at night after washing my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, this was a silly amount of work/time spent on getting rid of some tiny red spots.  I then tried Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap on my body and LOVED it.  For some reason, though, it dried out my face too much and I ended up breaking out more than I did with my previous &amp;#34;best choice&amp;#34; soap.  So, I was about to reorder my peppermint when I read a review on here saying that the Tea Tree oil soap was better for acne.  After trying it, I fell in love with it after just 3 days of use!  I didn&#x27;t even need the full month to start kicking items out of my routine for good.  Now, I am acne free and all I do is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Wash my face in the morning&lt;br /&gt;-Use Vitamin E oil at night after washing my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get rid of the vitamin E oil, but it&#x27;s too good.  It&#x27;s very sticky and shiny, but when you sleep with it on, you&#x27;ll see that your skin heals much faster and looks much healthier as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best yet, this soap is so good that I am using it for everything but my hair.  I love my current shampoo/conditioner, but who knows, maybe in time I&#x27;ll manage to switch that out as well :)  The best part, though, is that now my entire hygiene routine is now 4 bottles (soap, shampoo, conditioner, e oil) and costs only about $50/year, or a little over $4/month, over half of which is for the shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just for curiosity&#x27;s sake, I tried switching back to my previous routine after 6 months just to see if it was a coincidental hormone change that caused this wonderful result, and my acne started coming back!  I switched back to the tea tree soap + e oil and it faded away :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so thrilled with this soap that I will never need to experiment with another skin washing product again :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr, Bronner&#x27;s for years and it has never let me down. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the imposters. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tee Tree is the best thing for problem skin, and cleaning anything, from your clothes to your house. It makes a great foaming hand soap. When properly diluted it works up suds like mad. It leaves hair squeaky clean and conditioned and, in a pinch, one can even use the peppermint to brush one&#x27;s teeth. I don&#x27;t recommend that though because it tastes horrid. Best stick with Crest for that.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Magic Soap is the best thing I have found for the fungal infections I get on my skin.  I only have to wash once and it goes away.  I would recommend this to anyone with skin fungus.</li>
    <li> I drank half the bottle of this before I realized that Castile Soap is also just &#x27;soap&#x27;. Tea tree is not a flavor, it&#x27;s a scent.</li>
    <li> this is a great product it work great i used it every day i love it thank you so much</li>
    <li> Have been using da Doctor since da 70&#x27;s and now with Hemp oil and their Social Responsibility it&#x27;s now even more Awesome&#x27;er !</li>
    <li> I like that this product is organic and a good disinfectant, but the smell is not to my liking.  To me it smells a lot like tar.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product :) I use it to wash my face and my sister also uses it she&#x27;s very happy and it&#x27;s so lasting, it&#x27;s already been a month since I&#x27;ve got it and we still haven&#x27;t even used 1/10 of it!</li>
    <li> Tea Tree Oil Soap is just amazing.  After using for almost a month it helped with the itch of bug bites, dried up diabetic sores and soothe summer heat rash.  Smells a little funky like a mix of citronella and moth balls but quickly dissipates after washing.  Great Camping soap! You can wash whole body with a cup warm water and a squirt of soap on a washcloth.</li>
    <li> Always the best soap.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t quite work like it showed on Pintrest... a bit disappointing</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I was looking for a facial cleanser that would double as a makeup remover. The first two weeks or so that I was using this, I noticed that my skin was more clear and some of my dark spots were fading. It was also an excellent way to remove makeup as well without having to use two products. But after a month it started to dry out my skin pretty bad. My skin was peeling, producing tons of oil and breaking out. It was so embarrassing. I stopped using it but I still had nearly the whole bottle left so I was looking for other ways to use it. Next, I tried to clean with it and I noticed a residue in my bathroom sink from this soap so that was a no-go. Now I am using it on my body and it is a bit drying and leaves a slight residue BUT it has really helped to fade dark spots that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for a long time. I also feel safe using it on my lady parts because it&#x27;s all natural and the tea tree is anti-bacterial and treats bodily odors. Because it is drying though, I will probably use this every other shower until it&#x27;s gone and then try a different product with tea tree in it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products before and always liked them. This one is no different. The ingredients are pure and safe to use. No GMO&#x27;s to worry about in here! No petroleum products either. My son is very sensitive to ingredients such as coloring and sodium sulfates so it&#x27;s not always easy finding soaps or shampoos. This can be used as body soap, shampoo, floor cleaner, laundry detergent, dish detergent, pet shampoo (Careful with Tea Tree and cats though), rug cleaner and more. It&#x27;s concentrated and a little bit goes a very long way. We use this in our hair but if you have easily tangled hair you&#x27;ll want a natural conditioner as well. There&#x27;s no sudsing agents although it suds up really great.</li>
    <li> I have had my dreads for 4 months now and I have used this shampoo from day 1. Great Shampoo and I love the way it smells!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a product that would be good for my hair that was sulfate-free and I found it in this Castile Soap.  I make my own shampoo and I love it!</li>
    <li> Great soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a film. I have used it for hair, toothpaste and body wash. Highly recommended for those sick of the crappy soap</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have been using to make my own multi-purpose cleaner and it works really well.</li>
    <li> Easy, natural way to clean. Great alternative to antibacterial soap!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 15 years now. It is the best. Dilute so it isn&#x27;t drying and of course to stretch it even further. I only use it for body wash, but it can be used in many other different ways. Great Stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a long time.  It&#x27;s my favorite soap to use and the tea tree oil is a natural antiseptic, especially good for people who have issues with skin infections.  I squirt a bit on a washcloth and lather it up.  It doesn&#x27;t take much and this size bottle lasts for several months.</li>
    <li> We love this soap. It is so fresh smelling and we don&#x27;t feel as if our skin in all dried out after bathing with this.</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps really are magic. I love the tea tree and lavender as well as the eucalyptus. All three that I have tried have such pleasant, natural odors to them and they leave my skin feeling great. This does not work as a shampoo though unless you use a lot of conditioner after. It will make you hair very dry and tangily without following with a conditioner. I also hear you can use this as laundry detergent which sounds lovely. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a fantastic alternative to nasty chemical-filled name brand soaps. Give it a go and you will be surprised!</li>
    <li> I have used nothing but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s since I bought my first bottle.  I have sensitive skin and it&#x27;s pure and gentle, non-irritating, smells clean, rinses clean and easy unlike other bath soaps with all the chemicals that you have to rinse and rinse to get off your skin.  Tea tree oil has antibiotic properties.  I use it in place of antibacterial soap.  I&#x27;ve also used the peppermint and the lavender.  I like them all.  A big bottle lasts me and my husband several months of showers.  It goes a long way.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months and it works great, i love it for my hair, I have Thick Curly hair, my hair feels clean and i really enjoy the Tea Tree smell, I&#x27;ve used this soap to wash various types of vegetables, I&#x27;ve washed raw chicken with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Pure-Castile Soap, i just let the produce or poultry soak for 3-5 minutes in a clean sink filled with water and a few squirts of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, pat dry and the Tea Tree smell will go away when its dry, over all fantastic soap i will be buying lots more! and Recommending to people i know  , and i also recommend getting a shower filter so u can get the full benefit from this Organic Soap!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin prone to drying and unfortunately infections.  My doctor said to use certain soaps, as some people are prone to infections.  I was seeking a natural remedy and this has worked wonders!  Great product.  Numerous studies have shown that tea tree oil kills bacteria.  Last over a month for the whole family, we use as a body wash.  Also, if you have kids, lice HATE tea tree, so great as a shampoo for the over 3 crowd (but don&#x27;t get it in your eyes!).</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful. I have problems using regular soap on my skin and this does the trick, rinses off completely and has the added advantage of containing Tree Tea Oil which is good for my problem skin</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff. Use it for showers, dog baths, floors, laundry, exterior clean up...</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my face and it works great to clear skin up from breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;**Side note** Avoid eyes! Not just for the sting, but because I notice my eye lashes fall out. I know, that sounds strange, but I think it&#x27;s quite harsh for the sensitive areas of your face. I put a good moisturizer on afterward and my face has been breakout free. That&#x27;s what I got it for, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Great scent (I hate the perfume-y scent of a lot of women&#x27;s personal care products), gentle, good for the environment, and tea tree oil has antibacterial properties. If you put it on a sponge a little goes a long way. I also use this to refill a smaller bottle that I use in the shower.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of Dr. Bonners I recommend them without reservation.  They are very effective and do not dry out my skin like many soaps do. Do not expect huge piles of suds like some liquid soaps. just expect a through and gental cleanning product with a nice natural scent.</li>
    <li> I love the dr bronner soaps, and the tea tree is my absolute favorite. It smells lovely. And, because tea tree is a natural antibacterial, it keeps me smelling fresher for longer. This product lasts for months and months. Just a warning, keep the lid shut because it does clog over time.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. So glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great body soap!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me relax and feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s fair-trade item!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it and you will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and at good price</li>
    <li> Tea tree isn&#x27;t for everyone. Anyone who&#x27;s familiar with the pungent tea tree fragrance yet still prefers tea tree for its healing properties will likely be happy with purchasing this particular Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap. As with all DB soaps, a little goes a long way. For myself, the tea tree version has helped to cure my itchy scalp and even healed up some minor persistent skin problems. I use a bit of this for a shampoo but then follow it with regular shampoo afterwards. Works great for me this way. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s tea tree soap is much easier on your skin than tea tree essential oil.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated, smells nice. Not too drying on skin. Really deep cleans just about anything. I&#x27;ve been advised not to use on hair, though.</li>
    <li> This soap is great--basic, free of chemical crap, and they all smell great. Peppermint and eucalyptus are refreshing, the almond is kinda relaxing... Can&#x27;t speak highly enough of this stuff. Use this as shampoo and keep the perfumes and SLS the hell away from me. STOP POISONING YOURSELF!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid backpacker and camper. When I learned about this soap, I was excited about all the uses it claims to have, and wanted to try it. So I ordered the tea tree oil version since I&#x27;ve heard tea tree oil can be an antiseptic, and it&#x27;s nice having that when cleaning out wounds. I took about three ounces on a four day camping trip, and had about 3/4 of the bottle remaining. I used it for everything I could think of:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Body wash and Shampoo - The soap left my skin and hair clean, and left a faint, earthy scent.&lt;br /&gt;2) Toothpaste - It cleaned my teeth and removed my bad breath, but it was still soap and I was tasting that earthy scent for a little while afterward. Still, it works if you can take the taste.&lt;br /&gt;3) Worked into a lather it can be a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;4) Washed out my pots and pans.&lt;br /&gt;5) Washed my clothes and fabrics of dirt and removed nasty smells.&lt;br /&gt;Anything I needed cleaned I used it and it worked with just a few drops of soap, and water. I&#x27;ve also heard it can be used to clean floors and wash windows, but I&#x27;ve not tried that yet. I was pleasantly surprised at how many toiletries and cleansers it replaced, and how little I used up when I used it so much. 32 ounces of this stuff is going to last months, even with daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great for outdoorsmen, campers, backpackers, travelers, or people who want to save money by replacing so many things with one.</li>
    <li> The Castile shampoo containing tea tree oil is absolutely fantastic and is gentle on the skin.  The antiseptic qualities of tea tree oil are quite evident.  This is the only so I use!</li>
    <li> I purchased this yesterday.  I&#x27;ve been itching and scratching all day at work. It made my skin really dry, much worse than soap.  I would never recommendd this to anyone.  I have no idea what these people are talking about, this stuff is awful.  Years ago I had purchased the peppermint and it was just as bad.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, won&#x27;t buy any of Dr. Bronners products again.</li>
    <li> Aside from the obvious pluses of being environmentally friendly, smelling good, and being extremely versatile, the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree has actually helped clear my skin. After about a month of use, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s quelled the breakouts that I&#x27;ve had for 10 years or so. Tea Tree oil might have done this on its own, but incorporating it into soap, which you use everyday as a matter of course, was a bright idea. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Wow - this stuff works great.  Use it to wash your body.  Use it to wash your hair. Mix it up in a spray bottle and clean the kitchen cabinets.</li>
    <li> I use this strictly for washing dishes with a little citrus oil added.  My dishes are cleaned and sanitized at the same time, and it rinsed off clean.</li>
    <li> I am 27 and have been dealing with face and back acne since I was 13. Nothing severe but def embarrassing. I know that tea tree is good for acne, and have seen the Bronner&#x27;s soap line around at co-ops and other retailers but never got it. I finally decided to give it a shot and can&#x27;t believe the results. I have no new breakouts on my back. I love the smell of the product. It seems so clean, natural, and amazing. I have used so many products over the year and it&#x27;s amazing how you get so much for the price and how it really works. Love it!</li>
    <li> This all natural, non-stripping cleanser saves us money on buying regular liquid hand soap. I pour a bit of this soap into my foaming dispenser and add water. Would def recommend doing the same thing!</li>
    <li> Since I discovered I am allergic to formaldehyde and its many cousins in personal care products (body wash, hand soap, dish soap, shampoo, clothes detergents) I needed to find something else to use in the shower. A friend recommended Dr Bronner&#x27;s - she was using peppermint - so I checked it out and tried it. I have used the baby soap, the almond, the peppermint and the tea tree oil. This is great as shampoo and body wash. A little goes a long way. I like the almond or this baby unscented for body wash; peppermint for an invigorating shampoo; and tea tree for hand-washing because of the antibacterial properties. Also use the peppermint or tea tree for making creamy liquid cleanser to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sink. All the Dr Bronner liquid castile soap products I have tried - baby, almond, peppermint and tea tree - have been excellent.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Seems a little expensive for soap but a little drop can go a long way.  This will have you feeling extremely clean and leave no film at all.</li>
    <li> I purchased Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap after reading about it . It will clean pans like you would not believe! A must for every kitchen, in my opinion</li>
    <li> received in a timely manner.  product is not as described though.  Left my cabinets sticky.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap, great value!</li>
    <li> The smell is strong, I&#x27;ve been using to wash my face and  the jury is still out, it&#x27;s going to take sometime to get the sense, but so far I kind like it.</li>
    <li> I learned about this soap through a posting on Pinterest.  After I run the self-cleaning cycle on my oven, with the shelves taken out, I still had the burnt-on stuff on the shelves.  The old-fashioned oven-cleaner spray would take the stuff off the shelves but wouldn&#x27;t leave them shiny, and they wouldn&#x27;t slide.  I learned this from previous ovens.  This magic soap melts the burnt on stuff right off.  I have to put them in the bathtub and leave it to soak with some paper towels overnight, and they come out shiny.  The same thing with old roasting pans, they come out like new.</li>
    <li> It smells like paint thinner. I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s Magic soaps, but just this scent is not one for me</li>
    <li> All Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are 5 star. I have been using this brand/this particular soap for quite some time and I can say with confidence that the product I received was watered down, or maybe just old. If you are a loyal Dr. Bronners user you will be able to tell right away that it is less fragant and the coloring is not as amber as usual. I will never again purchase this product this way (my fault for being lazy) I recommended ordering directly from the site [...] Or going to a trusted retail shop. Being that the original product is ultra concentrated, someone who has never used the original may not know what to expect....this isn&#x27;t it!</li>
    <li> Smells Like Gasoline... which means it has -real tea tree oil- in it instead of menthol and other herbal-smelling chemicals, making it among the best all-natural anti-bacterial soaps you can get, noticeably less stank coming from me in the car after an overnight backpacking trip, dilute it 10:1 and make a great face/foot rinse, or just get nekid, lather up and jump in a creek for a few secs, boom, clean and serene for the hike out.</li>
    <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but the Hemp Tea Tress scent is a bit much for me.  The smell does not linger past the dryer, but it is quite strong when washing.</li>
    <li> Oh magical, magical Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps.  What CAN&#x27;T you do?  Well, to be honest there are limitations.  Consider the following...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work as rocket fuel.&lt;br /&gt;That cat won&#x27;t eat it.&lt;br /&gt;It will not replace normal transmission fluid.&lt;br /&gt;It can not reanimate the dead, nor will it stop the undead.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad at karaoke.&lt;br /&gt;Not intended to be used as a transvaginal mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect there may be other things it can&#x27;t do.  My experimentations with this so called &amp;#34;liquid soap&amp;#34; will continue.</li>
    <li> This is one of two items I bought to clear up adult acne prone skin because I wanted to get away from proactive and the like since they stopped working and were too harsh..works great. I still get a few but use it twice a day with a moisturizer at night (along with other item, estroblock) and I don&#x27;t get hardly any breakouts anymore...and the ones I do get are very small and go away fast.</li>
    <li> I use this on dishes, handsoap, floor soap, shampoo.....it&#x27;s a handy item to have around the house.  This is my favorite fragrance so far, although peppermint is a close second.  Pretty good price here on Amazon as well.</li>
    <li> Great!!! I love it for shower... Jus a tiny bit goes a long way! And, wonderful for my two dogs. After bathing them in this, honestly, they haven&#x27;t &amp;#34;smelled like dog&amp;#34;.  I am hooked!!!</li>
    <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s is the best soap. It truly works on pretty much everything. The Tea Tree soap helps keep my skin healed from small scrapes.</li>
    <li> Read many reviews raving about this product, I have not had the same experience of super cleaning to replace my other cleaning products.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as hand soap, and like another reviewer suggested, you should mix this with water (1:5, soap to water) and use a foal dispenser.  If you don&#x27;t you end up wasting a lot of soap b/c the bottle just squirts out at you.  i love the idea of using natural, non chemical products that are good for the environment and apart of a fare trade system!</li>
    <li> I really love this tree tea oil soap.  It worked very well, and have a great scent.</li>
    <li> We bought it to use as body wash but now that we&#x27;ve tried it as body wash, we don&#x27;t use it that way. It&#x27;s not a great body wash- too thin and makes your skin \\&quot;stripped\\&quot; and almost sticky afterwards. It&#x27;s a fabulous kitchen hand soap and I bet it would be a fabulous floor cleaner. I would love for my house to smell like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> To help reduce my exposure to chemicals I decided to buy this product.  I use it mainly as a shampoo for my hair.  I have dreadlocks, and dreadlocks tend to hold onto things, so it is highly recommended to use shampoos that will not leave residue.  This soap works perfectly.  I also use this soap as a body was.  I have also used it to clean my bathroom.  I am more than pleased with this product and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You can literally use it for everything: body wash, shampoo, laundry, household cleaning....  I use it mostly as a body wash.  It doesn&#x27;t smell incredible, but it feels so good and helps to keep my skin clear.  I occasionally wash my hair with it.  It leaves it feeling dry but I like to do it a few times a month to take a break from harsher shampoos.  It does a great job if you have skin issues like rashes, discoloration, or sun spots.  This bottle also lasts for a very long time - worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Surprised i really like thos soap.  i use it on my face and my ski is clearer</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.  Will never go back to using regulars soaps and shampoos again.</li>
    <li> I have used this strictly as my body, hair and face soap for the past two months. It does get you clean. I don&#x27;t use a lot. One drop for my face, 3 to 4 for my hair and body. Some one with dry skin may get very dry skin. I have not noticed it getting rid of blemishes like some reviews but we will see over time.&lt;br /&gt;More than anything I like that it is all natural and good for the enviroment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years as my body wash. Sadly as the company and product line grows, so do the prices and ingredient list. The most recent addition to the ingredients, now ahead of olive oil and hemp oil, is &amp;#34;organic palm kernel oil&amp;#34;. I used to be able to happily tell family and friends that &amp;#34;this is the soap I would make if I spent the time to do it myself&amp;#34;. This is no longer the case, as &amp;#34;palm oil&amp;#34; is well known to be a cheap filler oil. What would Emmanuel Bronner think? To add insult to injury, the company has failed to update their product description or photo, which tempts me to return my purchase in addition to buying (or making) my soaps elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This soap is really great for someone with sensitive skin.  I use it on my face and body.  My favorite combination is a couple of pumps of Dr Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree with a couple of pumps of Dr Bronner&#x27;s Lavender soap and it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning and calming.  My fiance uses the tea tree soap in his hair as well, and hasn&#x27;t needed any additional styling products because his hair is so clean and manageable afterward.</li>
    <li> Great soap. I use it for everything. Bath soap, hand soap, shampoo - it really does the trick. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering but definitely has that tea-tree aroma that you either love or hate. I will definitely purchase again and will probably try out the other scents at some point. I&#x27;ve also tried the lavender and it&#x27;s equally as awesome.</li>
    <li> I became a big fan of body wash when I realized how much more efficiently I can get through a shower.  I then decided I wanted to get something that was less perfume filled and would keep from feeling like I just bathed in my deodorant. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was an excellent choice, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, it rinses clean and it&#x27;s supposed to break down better, meaning it&#x27;s better for the environment.  I also can get about 6 months out of the 32oz container, a little goes a very, very long way.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Been using this soap for a long time. Now it is quick and convenient to get them online.</li>
    <li> If you use this a a shampoo I would recommend using this then following up with a normal shampoo. If not, this leaves a film in your hair that you&#x27;ll notice in your comb after a few uses. It&#x27;s also really hard to comb your hair after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea tree oil is supposed to stimulate the scalp/hair follicles and help fight dandruff, so it is good for that. My hair is long and thinner and when I use this with a regular shampoo it gives it the perfect amount of weight to it and actually makes it feel thicker. It&#x27;s a good price for a tea tree oil shampoo too since they can be quite expensive.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to (not as much lather) but once you do...i believe it will be a staple for a long time around here.</li>
    <li> This huge bottle of Cr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soaps pure-castile soap is a steal!  I lasts forever and works beautifully.  It is very concentrated so use sparingly.  I use it for the face and body daily, and for a good scalp scrub once a week.  Hope this review was helpful.  thank you</li>
    <li> It is OK but you have to love the scent of Tea Tree to like this, the original is my favorite</li>
    <li> This was the first time I purchased the 28 in 2 Hamp Tea Tree oil soap. effective cleaner.  performs as expected . Love the tea tree oil scent.</li>
    <li> If you have already used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, you don&#x27;t need a review to convince you to buy more.  If you are a first timer, just go for it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and love it. My husband won&#x27;t shower without his tea tree oil soap. I suffer from very delicate and sensitive skin and have had no problem with rashes or breakouts.</li>
    <li> It does the job. However I feel like my skins isn&#x27;t so soft after using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this product for it&#x27;s cleansing capabilities. It does have a different smell, however, once you towel off, all you smell is clean. As this product has tea tree oil in it, I also massage it into my scalp, which leaves it feeling refreshed and without any itching afterwards. I recommend this product to anyone who is tired of feeling like there is a film, or like a perfume bottle was spilled on them, on their skin. This product is perfect for the &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; person.</li>
    <li> This product had come highly recommended so my wife and I were looking forward to using it. However, I started having a rash and itching first, then my wife did too. She stopped using before I I did and stopped having the rash and itching. I stopped soon after that and my hives/itching remitted soon after. We are not allergic to the listed ingredients, so quite a mystery.</li>
    <li> this soap is perfect for skin conditions. i have granuloma annulare, and in the summer months, it flares up. this soap helps keep it under control without using steroidal skin creams. Also , my son likes adding it to his shampoo to keep his scalp in good condition.the scent is typical of tea tree, a little on the strong side, but not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell much, but it doesn&#x27;t stay on you after the shower.  Nice soap as ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> This scent was too overpowering for me. It would be good to use for anything but as a body wash.</li>
    <li> This is pure, undiluted soap and not watered down with thickeners.  A tiny squirt is all you need.</li>
    <li> It cleans hair, body, and anything else you could probably think of. Plus it smells vaguely of my grandparents guest bathroom.  Oh nostalgia.</li>
    <li> OK, maybe it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but a bottle sure does last me a long time!  I will admit, I wouldn&#x27;t use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s in every recommended category, but there are certain things I love it for.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with it for the clothing I hand wash, and it leaves my clothes smelling fresh but not overwhelmingly so.  I don&#x27;t tend to be a fan of strong scents, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s scented soaps just smell good (especially the tea tree!)  It&#x27;s also a very mild and gentle soap, which has worked wonders for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I prefer Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap for bath use, but I have a special use for the tea tree infused soap: It makes a superb safe bug spray for plants, as tea tree oil is a natural insect repellant. A dilute solution of the soap in water will kill many mites on plants indoor and out. Adding a bit of oil to a soap solution  will create an emulsion that&#x27;s idea for aphids and other suckers- I spray it all over my garden. Mix a tablespoon of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and a tablespoon of any light vegetable oil in a gallon of water. Pour into a garden sprayer, agitate well, and spray the leaves and trunk of any plant or tree you wish to protect. It&#x27;s totally non-toxic, and even safe for vegetables. (For smaller batches, mix a teaspoon each of soap and oil in a quart of water.)</li>
    <li> I have nothing bad to say. I&#x27;m so pleased with the choice I made to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap.</li>
    <li> I made the choice to move away from all products with toxic chemicals. this is a great product to replace lots of shower stuff! It is mild and a lovely sent with out poisons!</li>
    <li> I use this as a flea-bath for my pup. It works perfectly. And it rinses very easily. And I swear, her fur is softer since I&#x27;ve been bathing her with this product, once or twice a month.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been using this for 7 months and it&#x27;s still not even close to being done.  I use it for everything and its great for just about anything you do in the kitchen and bathroom.</li>
    <li> Best soap i love the smell and makes so much bubbles.</li>
    <li> This magic soap is often. It feels so good on the skin and is absolutely refreshing. I highly recommend this product.  great product, good price, prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Has helped reduce the amount of Sebhorreic Dermatitis by leaps and bounds.  Only shampoo I use.</li>
    <li> Never knew how powerful this thing was until I actually tried it. You could easily use this as an industrial cleaner. Must dilute this with water very heavily or you will be sorry (skin will be very dry).I put some on a big cockroach in Hawaii and the roach died. Yeah, you don&#x27;t want it to do that to your hand and so please dilute. Otherwise I think it is a great natural cleaning product with many uses. Just experiment with it before using it or you may be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was looking at several different soaps that claimed to have tea tree oil in them and finally decided to go with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, since it seemed to have good reviews.  When it arrived I opened it up and could immediately tell, by the somewhat strong smell, that it does have tea tree oil in it.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> i love dr brommers but this soap sucks its not good stick with other ones so save your money for others</li>
    <li> I use this for everything and I do mean everything.  I use it as a shower soap and I use it to clean the shower.  I use a couple squirts in a bucket of water to clean nearly every item inside and outside the house.  The blend of castile soap, hemp and tea tree is perfect.  It has cleaning power and anti-bacterial properties, too.  Last week alone I used it to scrub the kitchen floor, clean the gunk off the riding lawn mower and to bathe with.  You can&#x27;t find a more versatile cleaning product for any amount of money!</li>
    <li> First, this rating is for the VENDOR-DAB Unlimited, not the soap, which I have used for years. My carrier handed me the box in a big plastic bag, with the soap pooling in the bottom. The entire tiny box was saturated with the soap..no cushioning, no taping of the cap which had broken off in transit.&lt;br /&gt;The carrier said this mess had covered an entire load of mail, other people had their packages soaked in soap, and the PO sorting room was a mess from this. BAD JOB! Learn how to pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH! The soap. Excellent if overpriced by Bronner-rinses very clean, leaves no residue, cures skin problems especially in summer. Might be a bit strong for dry or fragile skin. If you live in a hot, humid climate..you need this.</li>
    <li> With the recipes that i found online i wanted to try it , guess what it works. once you add it to the cleaners your using a great natural way of cleaning .</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is everything I want from a soap; all natural with no toxins....but I was expecting a bit more when it said &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; on the bottle.  I&#x27;ve put it in excellent positions to surprise me with magic and it&#x27;s failed every time.  The closest I got was almost convincing the TSA that the stuff was magic when it was found in my carry-on.  The massage I received immediately following that conversation was magic, so maybe there was some magic in it after all.</li>
    <li> Bronner&#x27;s is great! And can be used in many ways..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in hand wash, laundry, I have even used Bronner&#x27;s on my kitty and he smells so great after his baths, and his fur stays very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin and hair feeling a little weird even after diluting but still does its job of getting me clean!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this for my oily facial skin. It has been enjoyed now by my wife for our daughter, too.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t count how many times I have bought this product - It&#x27;s my daily body shampoo.  I had a time getting rid of acre and this stuff does the trick, no residue left on your skin - just squeaky cleanness.</li>
    <li> Mix a small amount of Bronner&#x27;s with some water to fill foaming hand soap dispensers and it works perfectly. Bronner&#x27;s is the best soap you can buy. It&#x27;s natural, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I used to have dreadlocks and used this stuff every time I&#x27;d shower. My hair smelt (smelled?) great 100% of the time, and since tea tree oil is a natural fungicide, I didn&#x27;t have to worry about anything growing in my dreads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, I still have my dreads in a bag in my basement, and last time I opened it to look at them they STILL smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of.. maybe I should toss those things out... one day.</li>
    <li> Wife bought this and the hemp peppermint for general use throughout the house.  Very satisfied with the product.  The soap is well concentrated, smells great, and has worked as intended in every use to which she&#x27;s put it.  Goes great in homemade bathing soaps mixes and in laundry detergent.  The homemade laundry detergent featuring this stuff is noticeably less expensive than the store brands, and we haven&#x27;t noticed any drop in cleaning quality.  Would highly recommend this castile soap.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Use it for most everything that needs to be cleaned.  Bath soap, dish soap, general cleaning.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> I loved  loved her the soap. I am sure I will shop with you in the future. Love the products.</li>
    <li> My sister recommended this to me and I was skeptical.  I am nt a hippie and I don&#x27;t camp.  Turns out we love this stuff, it has a nice scent and cleans well.  I mostly use it as hand soap in a foaming dispenser, and in a spray bottle to clean the kitchen counters. Tried it in the shower and was not impressed as body wash or shampoo.  God soap and seems like a good value.</li>
    <li> The perfect soap for dispensing at the kitchen sink! Adding a squirt of this to a foaming dispenser bottle that&#x27;s 3/4 full of water makes this concentrated liquid soap last for over a year at our house. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> All my life I have had very dry rough skin on my hands. Nearly all of the hand lotions burn my skin when I use them and give me a terrible rash. As a child my knuckles would actually crack and bleed. That was my usual state. My mother would only buy one type of lotion and that was the type that was the most irritating to my skin. As an adult I was able to find lotions that worked much better, but I was never able to completely get rid of the dryness on the sides of fingers and around my nails. Then as I got older the skin on my knuckles seemed to thicken and deep wrinkles formed especially at the base of my little fingers. About 2 months ago a friend gave me a bit of Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Hemp Tea Tree soap. I have sensitivities to many things including mint so she made a point to give me something she thought would not bother me. With in 3 days of using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soap my hands looked better then they EVER have before. The skin on my fingers was soft and the wrinkles on my knuckles smoothed out until they were almost gone. My hands look better then they did when I was in my 20&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t even been using lotion. The redness and burning and stinging and itching is gone. If I had known about this years ago I could of avoided years of pain and embarrassment about the condition of my hands. The really amazing thing is that I only use it to wash my hands. I still use all my regular cleaners and soaps for others things. Granted they are all perfume and dye free and biodegradable but so was the hand soap I was using before. Dr. Bonner&#x27;s has been great &#x27;medicine&#x27; for my hands and really does seem to be almost magic.</li>
    <li> I have a pretty bothersome case of seborrheic dermatitis, and I read on a pretty popular forum that this stuff really helps. I&#x27;ve tried Jason shampoo for dandruff, which states that it helps seborrheic dermatitis, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I also tried several other shampoos, like tgel and selsun blue, and they didn&#x27;t work for me either. the only one that did anything besides this was nizoral but i wanted something less harmful. I wash my hair every other day or every 2 days, and after trying this stuff the itchiness, red patches and flaking was gone. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and I dont have issues anymore. The fact that it can also be used as a body was is even better, less cluttering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  11.19.12 I switched to Nizoral just to see the different effects. I have to say that it works better in controlling it. With Bronners after 2 days my seborrheic Dermatitis starts to kick in with itching etc. With nizeral sometimes I&#x27;d go 3 or even 4 days and I&#x27;m okay. This might be just me, but I&#x27;ve also noticed less hair loss. Still like Bronners though since it&#x27;s the next best thing and its more natural than anything else, plus i use it for numerous other things.</li>
    <li> This soap is aromatic and good for you--and the fact that it&#x27;s multi-purpose makes it an incredible buy. I&#x27;m very pleased with the overall quality and price. I will definitely be ordering more. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> You can clean anything with this and leaves a nice smell but it cleans beautifully! I have more of this stuff home and will keep buying it for years to come.</li>
    <li> I love it for cleaning the house and for face and body wash. Tried to use it to wash my hair like I&#x27;ve seen others mention. Did not work well for me..... Woke up the next morning and couldn&#x27;t even comb through it. Made it worse by trying to use a detangler. :-/ Will keep using it for cleaning around the house and body/face soap though.</li>
    <li> Mixed with water, makes an excellent foamy hand soap for Bathroom and Kitchen  - my Grandmother loves the Lavender scent</li>
    <li> Great soap for a real body cleanse. Be careful around your Private areas it will tingle you a bit.</li>
    <li> I love my Dr. Bronners!</li>
    <li> Washes clean and helps keep oily skin clear.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, this was a real experiment on my part.  I always use a non-soap cleanser, a very expensive one, and I still buy it for my face.  But I continued to have problems with my skin, break-outs, etc.  I expected to (a) be allergic to this product as I am to almost everything and (b) to dry up and blow away after using something that was billed as &amp;#34;soap.&amp;#34;  Imagine my surprise!!  My skin is smoother, even in the most difficult places, its fragrance, after I adjusted to it, is bracing, and it tingles!  In a good way!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  What a fresh clean on a warm and humid summer day!  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I mainly got this as a replacement for another tea tree oil product I have used. You get way more in this bottle then in the other one I was ordering and I&#x60;m just as happy with it.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ruined a very expensive favorite pan. I burned milk in it, actually oyster stew. I heard that Bronners Magic soap worked to take out this kind of burned food and restore the pan to new. Know what I did not believe it but it worked on the pan and the stove pans on my stove and 101 other things will recommend to friends, family who ever will listen. It is made by a green company. I am also glad I bought it from amazon for the best price and fastest shipping. The bottle paid for itself</li>
    <li> Good soap but seriously watered down.  I suppose to fill up 32oz at this price the comp. watered the product down and when you try to squirt it out from a soap dispenser it squirts out like water.  Other soaps we have used have not had the same problem!</li>
    <li> Simply awful. Mainly, a venue to preach via their label.  Soap leaves a residue.  It basically a ruse to preach their religious beliefs.</li>
    <li> it has tee tree in it , which helps with acne and its made of natural ingredients so like this product quite a lot.</li>
    <li> Love Dr.Bronner&#x27;s! Natural, American made!</li>
    <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s everything for my house&#x27;s bathroom!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I love it. I use it as a body cleaner, face wash, shampoo, and shaving cream. It&#x27;s perfect</li>
    <li> Love! I Make my own hand soap for all the bathrooms &amp; kitchen. I do add a few drops of vitamin E oil and either peppermint oil OR sweet orange oil then some water gently mix  &amp; put in foaming soap dispenser.  Feelmy hands are so clean!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product with the purpose that was suggested on facebook, but it did not perform for that.  I will use it strickly as a soap.</li>
    <li> I have normal Asian skin. I needed hand soap so I bought this. But it drys out my skin too much. Never had any hand soap drys me like this. And the Tea Tree smell is not pleasant to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like how clean my dishes are. I&#x27;ll just use it as a dish soap.</li>
    <li> A++++++! Excellent product</li>
    <li> leaves a filmy feeling on skin. Nice scent but had to re-wash after with another shower gel to get the filmy feeling off.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite soap! I use it to wash myself and my dogs!</li>
    <li> I had suffered from various skin issues. Since using this product, the areas of concern are non existent. There is a heavy medicinal scent that may not be appealing for some. To me the benefits outweigh the scent.</li>
    <li> works wonders! I had a large juice stain on my counter tops and with very minimal scrubbing it took it right out!</li>
    <li> I use a clear foaming dispenser in the kitchen. This soap gets cloudy in the dispenser so it looks like you&#x27;re washing your hands with dirty water. It smells amazing, so I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it, just as a body wash, not a hand soap.</li>
    <li> My teenage son gets acne on his back.  We wanted to try something natural to treat it, after trying so many of the typical acne products out there. I saw some reviews for this that talked about helping acne, so decided to give it a try. This has worked much better than the acne products he&#x27;s tried, and best of all it&#x27;s not full of chemicals.  We&#x27;ve begun using it in our household cleaning as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on the recommendation of my dermatologist to help treat folliculitis which prior to this had only been responsive to oral antibiotics. The soap really has been helping to keep this skin condition in check and also really cleans the skin without excessive drying. I would recommend this product to people who have oily skin or who suffer from folliculitis.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as a household cleaner and love it!  It has a very strong tea tree oil smell though, so make sure you like that scent before purchasing.</li>
    <li> She was thrilled to get this.  She had run out of the bottle she purchased from a brick-and-mortar store, and they didn&#x27;t have any left when she returned.  As usual, this Amazon partner performed up to Amazon&#x27;s exceptional standard of service.</li>
    <li> The best ever ,,,and amazing for the skin with tea tree oil inside ,,,this produt is amazing i can t use anything else than Dr Bronner s for my skin since i discover this brand</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Makes my scalp feel great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this as a facial wash and also add a very small amount  to a foaming hand soap bottle and mix with water.  I will never buy hand soap again.  This is the perfect all natural replacement.  Also try the Lavender and Peppermint...YUMMY!</li>
    <li> Great products does every thing that it says it does. recommend to your family and friends! Would buy again and again! My favorite is almond.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and last for so long.</li>
    <li> I received my order promptly without issue! I will use this company again. Still using the product and so far I am happy!</li>
    <li> Wonderful price and fantastic ingredients. I use it with a foaming soap pump and dilute it 1:4. It doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my skin, but it does well enough. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I meant to add I&#x27;ve used a lot of natural stuff. I used awildsoapbar before. They&#x27;re both great. This being liquid just makes it much better. It&#x27;s suppose to last awhile. I think I need a new pump, because mine doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be a wonderful product. Husband had diabetic dermatitis, the product doctor recommended has not been available for over a year our son suggested Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap, we gave it a try and it has worked.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap daily for years as my shampoo &amp; soap. I keep it in the shower. We have used many different scents &amp; I never travel without the 2oz travel-sized bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have not found this to be a good dish soap but we know some people who swear by it. It does not create many suds &amp; the dishes do not appear to get super clean. We have taken this soap camping to wash dishes, occasional clothing, utensils, camp stoves, etc. We do like to use this while camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We uses the Sal Suds Concentrated Soap to wash our floors, bathrooms, fruits &amp; veggies, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 1 bottle lasts me almost a year so I become a little tired of the smell. It is intense. I made the mistake once of buying a gallon to refill my bottle &amp; I was so sick of the smell that I almost dumped it down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp; take the time to read the bottle (or watch the documentary).  This guy is a hoot!</li>
