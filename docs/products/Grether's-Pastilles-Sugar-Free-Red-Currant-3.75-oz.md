    <li> Since Pine Bros. Honey Cough Drops re-introduced their &amp;#34;original formula&amp;#34; drops, which are nothing like the original formula, I&#x27;ve begun using these to sooth my throat when I&#x27;m working. (I&#x27;m a singer/songwriter by trade.) Expensive, but each lasts a long time in the mouth. The sugarfree don&#x27;t have that weird undertaste so many sugarfree items have. Very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> Good for the throat and so happy they are sugar free.  But a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these candies.  I eat 2 or 3 every day until they are gone.  You can let them melt in your mouth, or if you are like me you&#x27;ll chew em up.  They are chewy, but not enough to pull your fillings out.  I wish they were available in larger quantities and a lower price. Oh well I love them so I pay the price every so often.  I love that they are sugar free which makes them guilt free.  The ones with sugar aren&#x27;t better as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Yikes, I forgot they aren&#x27;t supposed to be candy, they are for sore throats etc, but they are candy to me.  Absolutely no mediciny taste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d read the ratings on this product, and expected it to be delicious.  It was instead, waxy and tough.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My daughter swears by these!!! She is a vocalist and the fact that they come in sugar free is an added bonus!!!  They soothe a soar throat and provide the right moisture for a soar throat.  Just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I put #3 because I am not sure how I feel about the Pastilles.  I am sucking on one right now.  I think it does not taste like currants.  The chewiness is different from any lozenge I have ever used.  It seems to be soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is odd as lozenges go.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter is a vocalist.  I saw Kathy Lee Gifford talking about these one day so I purchased them &amp; then reordered</li>
    <li> Am&#x27; trying this product for the first time. The deliver time was perfect. Thanks.</li>
    <li> i was at a singing lecture and the presenter recommended these.  They are wonderful for tired voice or tickle in throat...I don&#x27;t leave home without them...</li>
    <li> Cant do without these</li>
    <li> Fairly tasty;  I think that they are very pricey for what they are and I would like them better at a lower price point.</li>
    <li> I love these. They last a long time in the mouth and taste delicious. They are expensive, though, which makes them a rare treat.</li>
    <li> These pastilles are so addictive but can be pricy. They have a great taste and they give the voice and good coat.</li>
    <li> I have a dry mouth as a result of taking a particular medication.  I like these drops because they are sugarless and doesn&#x27;t dissolve as quickly as a mint</li>
    <li> Best for raspy throats...and delicious, too.  So happy Amazon carries this great product!</li>
    <li> No help for my throat/ cough.  No likely ingredients which would:  maltitol syrup, gelatine &amp; agar-agar, ascorbic acid, glycerine, redcurrant juice...  Sweetner is acesulfame-K.  Poor value as candy.  Instead try Halls sugar-free.</li>
    <li> These work really well to remove that \\&quot;wool coat\\&quot; feeling in the throat when you have a cold, or are fighting one. The red currant flavor is bright and tangy compared to the black currant pastilles, but neither is overwhelmingly strong.</li>
    <li> They really soothe the throat and were recommended by a voice specialist at Duke.  Most OTC throat lozenges have alcohol in them and actually dry your throat.  These don&#x27;t.  They are well worth the price!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the servic</li>
