      <li>Great price and great product.</li>
      <li>Love these!!</li>
      <li>They are a great size, good quality</li>
      <li>It has a waxy feel on the skin, but works fair, if used&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really nice for washing your face in the shower.</li>
      <li>I am loving my Bella Sha.</li>
      <li>Very good price, high quality item.</li>
      <li>It feels more like rolled oats soaked in water.</li>
      <li>in fact I would like these to be a bit rougher for better exfoliation.</li>
      <li>Just a heads up these things are about the size of a golf ball, super tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was kind of expecting them to be the size of my hand</li>
      <li>Good if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>These smelled like mold right out of the packaging.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed in order to exfoliate with the cleanser of my choice.</li>
      <li>and you can really scrub with them!</li>
      <li>Also the elastic on the back stretches out very quickly.</li>
      <li>The thing I&#x27;m not crazy about with these is that the fibers are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re exfoliating at all.</li>
      <li>This product cleans the face pretty well, but I expected it to feel more coarse than it does.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s very soft</li>

<li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s very soft</li>
<li> They work, rougher than had expected - can&#x27;t seem to find the brand I had prior which exfoliated but was a bit softer to the touch.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d been looking for something like this for a long time.  </li>
<li> Not too rough at all...</li>
<li> Not too abrasive, not sure if it&#x27;s actually exfoliating my skin.</li>
<li> The loofah is a little stiff, in my opinion, to be used regularly on the face.  </li>
<li> use it on my face everyday</li>
<li> These are poorly made.</li>

    <li> Exactly what I needed in order to exfoliate with the cleanser of my choice.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are great!  This is my second time ordering this product.</li>
    <li> This product cleans the face pretty well, but I expected it to feel more coarse than it does.  It has a waxy feel on the skin, but works fair, if used&lt;br /&gt;with the proper facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> Very good price, high quality item. Just big enough to use on the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for something like this for a long time.  They are a great size, good quality and you can really scrub with them!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  These work great.</li>
    <li> I actually got these to use in the shower as a mini loufa. I&#x27;ve gotten some different ones before that were the same size and they worked great. The thing I&#x27;m not crazy about with these is that the fibers are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re exfoliating at all. It feels more like rolled oats soaked in water. Also the elastic on the back stretches out very quickly. If you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s very soft this may be for you, but not if you&#x27;re looking for actual exfoliation on your face or otherwise.</li>
    <li> these are a perfect size</li>
    <li> This is not for your face.  These are poorly made.</li>
    <li> These smelled like mold right out of the packaging. I just threw it away!!!</li>
    <li> Really nice for washing your face in the shower.</li>
    <li> Not too rough at all...in fact I would like these to be a bit rougher for better exfoliation. Good if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The loofah is a little stiff, in my opinion, to be used regularly on the face.  However, it is well made and I can use it in the shower too.</li>
    <li> Love these!! Part of my facial cleaning routine for years!!</li>
    <li> Great price and great product.</li>
    <li> Works great on face and neck. I like that it is not a woosie pansy loofah, it actually cleanses!</li>
    <li> They work, rougher than had expected - can&#x27;t seem to find the brand I had prior which exfoliated but was a bit softer to the touch.</li>
