### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>All great products!</li>
      <li>BEST.</li>
      <li>Color is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Very nice non oily moisturizer which works as a perfect carrier for the serums I make and use on my face.</li>
      <li>and this had it and had great reviews.  </li>
      <li>but it reminds me of my great grandma.  </li>
      <li>you want an AMAZING cream (although no foundation), see my review of the L&#x27;Oreal Ideal Moisture</li>
      <li>It is a good product, but overpriced.</li>
      <li>GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
      <li>I looked around a lot for a good one that had SPF, good coverage and anti-wrinkle</li>
      <li>but I pushed forward and after it goes on it looks good.</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I really love this lotion; it has everything you need in one step!  </li>
      <li>AND REALLY LIKED IT.</li>
      <li>Absolutely think this is one of the best products Olay puts out.</li>
      <li>I love it now...</li>
      <li>AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin.</li>
      <li>The product quality is ok.</li>
      <li>I wish I could explain it better, so not to offend anyone.  </li>
      <li>I was no longer able to find it in stores but was able to get it through Amazon.com.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin looking healthy and moist.  </li>
      <li>I really love it.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice size container, but runs out of product quickly.  </li>
      <li>Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 Oz]]</li>
      <li>This Total Effects, recommended by my daughter, has proven to be a perfect light foundation and moisturizer for me.  </li>
      <li>Looks natural and is also a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>For me, it&#x27;s fine, because I&#x27;m tanned at the moment.  </li>
      <li>You would think that a moisturizer with a touch of foundation would be light.  </li>
      <li>a moisturizer should go on smooth, which this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I will continue using this product because it is fragrance free, but in addition: oil-free and has SPF-15.</li>
      <li>I use it on the days when I don&#x27;t want to do my full makeup but still have a couple errands to do</li>
      <li>Unlike other tinted moisturizers which either sit on my face or are too dry, this one truly absorbs quickly on clean skin and looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing on my face--which is perfect for men who need a bit of coverage but don&#x27;t want to look like they&#x27;re wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>right after I get out of the shower when my face is still moist</li>
      <li>Good for gym days also cause you don&#x27;t want a bunch of makeup running down your face</li>
      <li>It went on easily and was not messy.  </li>
      <li>I ordered the olay with a touch of foundation and when it first comes out it will scare</li>
      <li>Well, this smell reminds me of too much ole&#x27; lady make-up!  </li>
      <li>This was my first try at bb/cc cream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times because the touch of foundation color (there is only one color) is way too light for my skin and the tone looks greyish on my skin which isn&#x27;t appealing.</li>
      <li>Also I cannot use this product daily since I find that I have an allergic reaction to the strong perfume if I apply it too often.</li>
      <li>But you know how your sweet ole&#x27; grandma wears far too much make-up and no one wants to speak up and tell her so?  </li>
      <li>though I don&#x27;t think cheap enough for how much you get).</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t stand it.  </li>
      <li>but I know at night if I get really tried</li>
      <li>The coloring in this product is too intense to wear as a foundation.</li>
      <li>The first time I wore it, my 6 year old gave me a kiss, wrinkled his nose, wiped his mouth, and said \\&quot;yuck Mommy!</li>
      <li>I also have a bit more discoloration from previous acne as well.</li>
      <li>This particular product does not contain any SPF</li>
      <li>May have &#x27;total&#x27; effects (unsure what they are) but the stuff is only ok.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and it is not easy at all to find.  </li>
      <li>(I live in Barbados)</li>
      <li>I am trying out new products to find a moisturizer/foundation combo that I can wear throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need a heavy foundation but just something natural and light to gently cover the flaws in my skin.</li>
      <li>A tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve use in the past and absolutely love, is [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>But I feel it looks very natural and is so much easier to apply than regular foundation.  </li>
      <li>I only gave it 4 stars because the touch of foundation doesn&#x27;t cover quite as much as I would like.  </li>
      <li>It just has that \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell to it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definitely reorder this products very soon.</li>
      <li>apparently it does have SPF 15 according to Olay.</li>
      <li>so I use it in conjunction with Olay Complete Defense Daily Moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male</li>
      <li>I normally do not wear makeup but having a light foundation to my face during the day helps cover up dark spots and even out my skin tone while improving my skin at the same time.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;touch of foundation&amp;#34; was more heavily colored than some of the regular foundations I have used in the past</li>
      <li>Feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t see anything in the actual product that has UV protection (except in the UV version which isn&#x27;t tinted as far as I know).</li>

<li> Wish I had read previous comment.</li>

<li> This product is very heavy and perfumed.</li>
<li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with fair/medium skin tone.</li>
<li> It goes on so thick, ugh.  </li>
<li> It was too thick and did not spread well.</li>
<li> &quot; if you know what I mean.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick.</li>
<li> I mean, VERY thick!</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes to my face yet.</li>
<li> They again have sent the wrong thing.</li>
<li> Received the wrong product.  </li>
<li> In other words, it was terrible.  </li>
<li> After 20+ years of wearing Olay, this poor product had me switch to another brand. :-(</li>
<li> Not too bad, but not exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The product quality is ok. However, the design of the outlook still needs some improvement. Everytime I use this product, I have to put the small pin back, otherwise it will become dry.</li>
    <li> I will continue using this product because it is fragrance free, but in addition: oil-free and has SPF-15. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder this products very soon.</li>
    <li> This was my first try at bb/cc cream. I looked around a lot for a good one that had SPF, good coverage and anti-wrinkle and this had it and had great reviews.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times because the touch of foundation color (there is only one color) is way too light for my skin and the tone looks greyish on my skin which isn&#x27;t appealing. I&#x27;m an nc42 in Mac so you can judge by that if this is for you.</li>
    <li> Wish I had read previous comment. They again have sent the wrong thing. I suggest you do not order from them if you actually want this product.</li>
    <li> May have &#x27;total&#x27; effects (unsure what they are) but the stuff is only ok.</li>
    <li> I am trying out new products to find a moisturizer/foundation combo that I can wear throughout the day. I don&#x27;t need a heavy foundation but just something natural and light to gently cover the flaws in my skin. I am in my late 50&#x27;s with fair/medium skin tone. I have purchased several products and thought I would try them out until I find one that I like. &#x27;Olay total effect 7-in-1 Anti-Aging&#x27; is one of the products that I recently purchased. This product is very heavy and perfumed. The coloring in this product is too intense to wear as a foundation. Therefore I plan to use it as a blush for the contour area under my cheek bones. Also I cannot use this product daily since I find that I have an allergic reaction to the strong perfume if I apply it too often. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 30 yr old male and I&#x27;ve tried just about every drug store moisturizer (from Neutrogena, CeraVe, Cetaphil, others from Olay, etc.) and lots of heavy foundations (Rimmel, Covergirl, Neutrogena, Revlon) to cover some redness--this combination absolutely takes the cake. I definitely prefer it to the Definity Color Recapture, and it&#x27;s cheaper (though I don&#x27;t think cheap enough for how much you get). Unlike other tinted moisturizers which either sit on my face or are too dry, this one truly absorbs quickly on clean skin and looks like I&#x27;m wearing nothing on my face--which is perfect for men who need a bit of coverage but don&#x27;t want to look like they&#x27;re wearing makeup. I pair it with a tiny amount of the Olay/Covergirl corrector and I&#x27;m off to work. I will DEFINITELY keep buying and I pray they don&#x27;t discontinue this product.  My only gripe: Amazon lists this as having UV protection. Feel free to correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t see anything in the actual product that has UV protection (except in the UV version which isn&#x27;t tinted as far as I know). So don&#x27;t expect sun protection.  EDIT: apparently it does have SPF 15 according to Olay.</li>
    <li> Absolutely think this is one of the best products Olay puts out. Looks natural and is also a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very nice non oily moisturizer which works as a perfect carrier for the serums I make and use on my face.</li>
    <li> Why did you stop making the Regenerist Touch of Color?  This is not the same, at all.  It goes on so thick, ugh.  I really can&#x27;t stand it.  After 20+ years of wearing Olay, this poor product had me switch to another brand. :-(</li>
    <li> Received the wrong product.  Got the one without \\&quot;touch of foundation\\&quot; which I could have just bought here (I live in Barbados)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THE PRODUCT BEFORE AND REALLY LIKED IT. I&#x27;VE USED A FEW OTHERS BEFORE REORDERING THIS, AND THINK I LIKE IT BEST. I LIKE THE LIGHTNESS OF THE MAKEUP.  GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> It was too thick and did not spread well. The &amp;#34;touch of foundation&amp;#34; was more heavily colored than some of the regular foundations I have used in the past AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin. As a result, the color would rub off in spot and look blotchy. Also, it started making my skin peel after a few uses in a row. In other words, it was terrible.  I did give it a second star, though. The reason is that it did seem to make my skin look and feel a little nicer after you would wash it off. I am only 30 years old, but I noticed a slight discoloration around my eyes from years of the sun starting to show through. I also have a bit more discoloration from previous acne as well. Overall, I would say my skin is average. Not too bad, but not exceptional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an AMAZING cream (although no foundation), see my review of the L&#x27;Oreal Ideal Moisture Even Tone cream. I really love it. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P4OWBH1VSBUF/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00AYWN8OY</li>
    <li> I really love this lotion; it has everything you need in one step!  I only gave it 4 stars because the touch of foundation doesn&#x27;t cover quite as much as I would like.  But I feel it looks very natural and is so much easier to apply than regular foundation.  I use it every day, as well as the Total Effects serum at night (you have to try that!), and also with Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing serum in the morning.  All great products!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation.  When I saw this product, I thought I would give it a try.  So, after washing my face with the total effects cream cleanser, I applies the moisturizer with foundation.  It went on easily and was not messy.  But for me, it accentuated my dry areas (around mouth and eyebrows) and made them looky flaky instead of moisturized.  It&#x27;s put away in a drawer.  I might use it again, but I will have to moisturize with another Olay product before using this one.  Not really a time-saver like I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> When purchasing this item, I thought I was getting a moisturizer with a \\&quot;touch\\&quot; of foundation.  In my mind, I thought it would be a moisturizer with a hint of color.  Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick. I mean, VERY thick! When applying it to my face, it&#x27;s so thick that little balls roll up.  I don&#x27;t think it has any moisturizers in it, or at least it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like it.  Seems like a moisturizer should go on smooth, which this doesn&#x27;t. The color is also dark.  For me, it&#x27;s fine, because I&#x27;m tanned at the moment.  If purchasing a foundation, this color would fall into the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; colors.  You would think that a moisturizer with a touch of foundation would be light.  I don&#x27;t like the way that my skin feels after putting it on.  It feels too much like a heavy foundation!  My skin feels \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; if you know what I mean.  And lastly, the smell.  I just can&#x27;t take the smell of it.  No offense meant ladies........but it reminds me of my great grandma.  It just has that \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; smell to it.  I wish I could explain it better, so not to offend anyone.  But you know how your sweet ole&#x27; grandma wears far too much make-up and no one wants to speak up and tell her so?  Well, this smell reminds me of too much ole&#x27; lady make-up!  The first time I wore it, my 6 year old gave me a kiss, wrinkled his nose, wiped his mouth, and said \\&quot;yuck Mommy! what&#x27;s that smell?!?! please wash your face!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So, I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a moisturizer.  Heck, because of the smell, I wouldn&#x27;t even recommend it as a foundation.  A tinted moisturizer that I&#x27;ve use in the past and absolutely love, is [[ASIN:B001E5EKM4 Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 Oz]] But I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s been discontinued and I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t be able to always buy it, therefore I&#x27;m on the search for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and it is not easy at all to find.  Never looks like I&#x27;ve put on make-up, enhances like foundation.  Color is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> It is a good product, but overpriced. It comes in a nice size container, but runs out of product quickly.  I took it apart, and within  the big container there is a small one about the size of a thimble witch contains the tinted moisturizer.  Not a lot for your money.</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for about a week now. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic changes to my face yet. I will say that I extrememly like the fact that this lotion has a built in foundation. I normally do not wear makeup but having a light foundation to my face during the day helps cover up dark spots and even out my skin tone while improving my skin at the same time. The down side to the foundation aspect is that it does feel a bit heavy on my skin but no different that if I were wearing regular foundation. I would recomend this product to someone else as long as I see results within a month.</li>
    <li> This Total Effects, recommended by my daughter, has proven to be a perfect light foundation and moisturizer for me.  It leaves my skin looking healthy and moist.  I was no longer able to find it in stores but was able to get it through Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I ordered the olay with a touch of foundation and when it first comes out it will scare you cause it looks really dark but I pushed forward and after it goes on it looks good. Almost like it fades to your skin tone. I try to put it on right after I get out of the shower when my face is still moist (it goes on alot smoother). I love it now...I use it on the days when I don&#x27;t want to do my full makeup but still have a couple errands to do cause it still has the coverage but I know at night if I get really tried I don&#x27;t have to worry about washing all my makeup off I just head off to bed and my face never breaks out. Good for gym days also cause you don&#x27;t want a bunch of makeup running down your face but this will still give you that coverage you want.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  @ 43 I&#x27;m starting to see some signs of discoloration on my face but I didn&#x27;t want to start wearing a heavy foundation.  This particular product does not contain any SPF so I use it in conjunction with Olay Complete Defense Daily Moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  I add a touch of the Total Effects to my moisturizer and mix together.  I get the SPF protection along with a touch of coverage that isn&#x27;t too dark or greasy.  I will never use anything but Olay products!</li>
    <li> Ole Olay!  Olay is the only moisturizer I use these days.  I admit I have tried others, I always go back to Olay.  Well done, Olay, well done.</li>
</ol>
