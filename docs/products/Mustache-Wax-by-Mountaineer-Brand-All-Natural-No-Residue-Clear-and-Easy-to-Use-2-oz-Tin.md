      <li>And the smell was more like pine needles.</li>

      <li>that mountaineer gives you more product than most others.</li>
      <li>Great ingredients/smell and decent price</li>
      <li>I think it has worthwhile hold, does not seem to easily vanish, nice to apply, pleasant forrest pine aroma and NATURAL product.</li>
      <li>A good smelling wax that holds reasonably well.</li>
      <li>Good wax - fast shipping</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best styling wax and doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I expected, but it works fine for keeping stray hairs under control.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a very mild saw mill sort of smell.</li>

      <li>Easy application.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>you even handlebar&amp;#34; is as strong as this stuff.</li>
      <li>But that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>It is non-greasy, goes on smooth and easily, and helps get rid of beard dandruff.  </li>
      <li>This is a large tin of wax that has a nice smell.</li>
      <li>I would suggest this to be a used as primary</li>
      <li>This is fantastic for mustache, beard, and even hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it was just strong.</li>
      <li>but once it has absorbed into the hairs it fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
      <li>Good for general grooming.</li>
      <li>I have tried a couple wax&#x27;s and this is by far my favorite!</li>
      <li>But not bad.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to get the Mountaineer Brand 100% Natural Moustache Wax for my husband since we are true Mountaineers!!</li>
      <li>Some kid with a Super Honker might smell this all day.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>Overall a good product, plus you get so much more product and for a cheaper price than most other competitors.</li>
      <li>I wont give names or ratings here for the others but will conclude by saying That out of 5 this is my second favorite!</li>
      <li>Great little gift.</li>
      <li>Economically priced.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice, it is very easy to work with, and its consistency is light enough you don&#x27;t look wet or gooey when you&#x27;re wearing it.  </li>
      <li>I read the other reviews and some people just loved it.</li>
      <li>These days convenience and ease of use are important, so I&#x27;m offering this advice up considering the times we live in.</li>
      <li>There is a nice subtle hint of refreshing beeswax smell.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>First moustache wax I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>First mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
      <li>I will buy more in the future.</li>
      <li>This is the first mustache wax I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I personally didn&#x27;t love it, I was kinda neutral about it.</li>
      <li>It held my moustache exactly where I wanted it.</li>
      <li>All waxes smell because they go right there where your nose is and nothing on this planet is odorless, really.  </li>
      <li>The scent is rather like having kissed a number of pine trees; masculine, not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>I have fine white hairs that curl and spiral every which way and decided to let them grow rather than trim every 3 days.  </li>
      <li>Once you have some length and get close to 1in curls, you&#x27;ll want to move on to gel, pomade, or a much stiffer wax.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the problem that I have is that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
      <li>It has a very earthy sagey smell to it....</li>
      <li>The better the hold, the harder it is to work up and apply.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really do much with it</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>and we both really like</li>
      <li>and if you are doing tips/handlebars maybe get a stonger product for tips for an all day good form hold as secondary.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Hard as a rock.. doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the tube stuff I use.. no applicator or comb.. Thinking about using my stove to soften up the wax..smells like wood.. probably start using ChapStik.. after I run out of both</li>
    <li> Does the job...mostly.  I think the product is fine, and simply prefer a different product.</li>
    <li> My yesss. *said in an evil villan voice while twisting my MUStache.</li>
    <li> Conditions beard well. Could use some work as far as the scent goes. If you like smelling like a Christmas tree then this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Keeps the stash in place for most of the day, smells like pine tar, doesnt change the color of your hair.</li>
    <li> This is my first foray into mustache wax, so I can&#x27;t compare it to other products. It works well - I&#x27;m not doing any extreme styling, just getting some stray bits held into place. My only complaint is that at times it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a whole day.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many mustache waxes in my search for the perfect wax. I have a very thick and long mustache and beard. My hairs are coarse and unruly so I need a strong wax that will tame my mustache while not appearing too waxy or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best Mustache wax I have used yet. Due to the holding power of this wax I only need a fraction of what I used with other brands. I wax 2x/day using a dab of wax slightly larger than a grain of rice. I rub the wax between my pointer fingers to spread it evenly then between my thumb and pointer finger on each hand before applying to each side of my mustache. Be sure to run your fingers over the mustache a few times to work the wax in and use a comb to really spread the wax before finalizing your shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned quickly to not over-apply this wax. Due to its thickness using too much will result in no body in your mustache, just a mass of hair and wax. Use this stuff sparingly for the best look with a tamed, shaped mustache with lots of body to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is of Pine needles. When initially applying them smell is stronger but once it has absorbed into the hairs it fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Good for general grooming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of mustache waxes and this is my favorite.  The scent is nice, it is very easy to work with, and its consistency is light enough you don&#x27;t look wet or gooey when you&#x27;re wearing it.  I will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> A good smelling wax that holds reasonably well. I sometimes need to reapply but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. Easy to apply. Lasts a good while being a 2 oz can.</li>
    <li> Great ingredients/smell and decent price but seems to disappear in 2 hrs tops unless you&#x27;re outside in the cold.</li>
    <li> Arrived as expected, on time with no issues.  What more could a guy want?!</li>
    <li> A medium to high holding moustache wax.  Larger quantity added bonus.  Low odor.  Easy application.  Moderate time for holding (2 - 3 hours).</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get the Mountaineer Brand 100% Natural Moustache Wax for my husband since we are true Mountaineers!! This is a large tin of wax that has a nice smell. My husband scoops this out of the tin with his fingers, then applies it to his mustache. He has had no complaints regarding this. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> This product works very well.</li>
    <li> The functionality of the product is good. It held my moustache exactly where I wanted it. However, the scent is a little strong. I also believe that I am allergic to one of the oils used for fragrance. Take my mishap into consideration when choosing a fragrance or product.</li>
    <li> works great They have other products I want to try</li>
    <li> Great awsome product thanks</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews and some people just loved it. I personally didn&#x27;t love it, I was kinda neutral about it. It was not what I was expecting. It only held my mustache up for a little while, then the handle bars started falling (didn&#x27;t last more than about 30min). I thought maybe it I just didn&#x27;t apply enough, but I was wrong. I applied a large amount, then my stash was white. And the smell was more like pine needles. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it was just strong. I didn&#x27;t hate the product, I just didn&#x27;t love it either. I couldn&#x27;t really do much with it so I trimmed off my mustache :-(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t realize this was a pune smell.  Also the wax seems to wear off after only an hour and I need to reapply another layer of wax to my mustache.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand! It has a very earthy sagey smell to it....I love nestling in his neck to smell it :) He loves how it makes his mustache hairs stay down or in place instead of poking out  everywhere.</li>
    <li> Came in a nice small container. Application was easy. There is a nice subtle hint of refreshing beeswax smell. If i were to imagine, it would remind me of a faint smell of cedar tree. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and 10/10 would buy again. I received a discount on this to share a review.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s waxy and it works.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works good also</li>
    <li> Good value for the price but the problem that I have is that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well. I realize that everyone&#x27;s beard and moustache is different but 10 minutes after I put it on my moustache is drooping. I also use Stache Bomb which has a better hold. You can immediately tell the difference when you put them on your finger. I&#x27;m actually looking for an even stiffer wax.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold, scent is very strong</li>
    <li> The men with the mustache are love this was said it the best they had tried like it and said great product..</li>
    <li> This is fantastic for mustache, beard, and even hair. It has super firm hold, and gives a dry clean look, no greasy appearance.</li>
    <li> Have been growing &#x27;stache for over a year.  Have tried half a dozen waxes and will buy Mountaineer again.  Large tin, easy to apply, and holds very well without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> I do not have a Fuller Brush under my nose.  I have fine white hairs that curl and spiral every which way and decided to let them grow rather than trim every 3 days.  Wacky Tacky sounded like the best but it apparently is dark, something not good on a white mustache. Now on every mustache wax, there&#x27;s a trade off.  One thing is the smell.  All waxes smell because they go right there where your nose is and nothing on this planet is odorless, really.  So what you want is something you can go &amp;#34;Nose-blind&amp;#34; to or is tolerably pleasant.  This one happens to be both for me, but it might be I have Old-Man-Nose.  Some kid with a Super Honker might smell this all day.  But that&#x27;s fine.  It smells like Christmas.  The other trade off is between hold power and ease of application.  The better the hold, the harder it is to work up and apply.  I use a nail file to skim it from the can and work it in.  This one is fairly easy to apply so it is not the best holding.  But it keeps my little wild hairs a little more tame.  And I&#x27;m a delicate flower so I want something that won&#x27;t make my skin go all pimply.  This doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve had a lot worse.  It aint perfect but it will do.</li>
    <li> This wax is best used for the beginning stages of hair growth. As soon as your whiskers start tickling your lips, grab some of this soft wax and use it to start training the hairs. Once you have some length and get close to 1in curls, you&#x27;ll want to move on to gel, pomade, or a much stiffer wax.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the smell is quite manly. It&#x27;s a very mild saw mill sort of smell. My wife didn&#x27;t love it, but I sure did.</li>
    <li> This was my second time purchasing wax. This particular wax has a decent hold (I apply twice a day) the scent isn&#x27;t the greatest compared to other brands but I do like how this wax doesn&#x27;t build up when applying and has no white film once applied. Overall a good product, plus you get so much more product and for a cheaper price than most other competitors.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and natural oils that are used, but Mountaineer Brand doesn&#x27;t stand up the the summer humidity like my old brand.  Application is easy,</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.</li>
    <li> Works for a short while (2-3 hours); then loses strength. Smells nice and goes on well.</li>
    <li> Good wax - fast shipping</li>
    <li> Fsst shipping  and ot works great</li>
    <li> The balsam smell was ok at first, but became unpleasant quickly. It&#x27;s strong too have directly under your nose unless you are trying to block out other smells. My order is going in the dumpster as soon as a different product arrives.</li>
    <li> First mustache wax I&#x27;ve ever used so I have nothing to compare it to. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but it&#x27;s not bad. The hold is a little disappointing, seems to just keep falling out of shape and stray hairs keep popping back up. It does pull it out of my mouth and keep it pulled to each side relatively well though. All things considered I like it but I do wish it was a little stronger hold.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It works like it should, holding my unruly mustache in place while never getting stiff or fake looking. The only issue I have is the packaging. It would be better if it came with a little scoop or something. I use my finger to get a small amt. out and it ends up under my fingernail. These days convenience and ease of use are important, so I&#x27;m offering this advice up considering the times we live in.</li>
    <li> This is the first mustache wax I&#x27;ve tried.  I also purchased their beard oil.  I was expecting a firmer hold, after a few hours you need to reapply.  It&#x27;s near impossible to hold shape if you have applied the beard oil prior to using the wax.</li>
    <li> First moustache wax I&#x27;ve tried. I like it but the hold isn&#x27;t as good as I thought it would be. It does keep the whiskers in place for a time though.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works bit the person I gave it to loves it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes, so far I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;Fisticuffs is similar, but my girlfriend prefers the scent on this one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think &amp;#34;Do you even handlebar&amp;#34; is as strong as this stuff.</li>
    <li> Works well, but can feel  greasy. The scent is rather like having kissed a number of pine trees; masculine, not unpleasant. Economically priced.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son. He&#x27;s very pleased. Great little gift. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing a few different waxes, this one being #5. I wont give names or ratings here for the others but will conclude by saying That out of 5 this is my second favorite! I think it has worthwhile hold, does not seem to easily vanish, nice to apply, pleasant forrest pine aroma and NATURAL product. Would prefer and buy over some of the others on amazon. I would suggest this to be a used as primary and if you are doing tips/handlebars maybe get a stonger product for tips for an all day good form hold as secondary.Price+quality&#x3D;value. Will buy more when time comes.</li>
    <li> Smells great too! (Received this product at a discount in exchange for a review)</li>
    <li> It would work for a couple hours, then slowly lose it&#x27;s hold over the course of the day. I also had problems with the wax clumping, and flaking off or damaging the actual hair. I&#x27;d recommend buying a different product.</li>
    <li> It works, that simple</li>
    <li> I love the wax, smells great and holds my mustache for about 6 hours</li>
    <li> Not as firm of a hold as I would like..would only stay for a couple hours.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance. This is the first wax he has used and is very happy with it. The smell is subtle and outdoorsy. The smell combines well with the mountaineer brand beard balm but he does wish the balm had better oils in it.&lt;br /&gt;He is very happy with this mustache wax and we both really like that mountaineer gives you more product than most others.</li>
    <li> Still experimenting with it.  But not bad.</li>
    <li> I liked it but it does not have the hold power that my mustache needs.</li>
    <li> I have tried a couple wax&#x27;s and this is by far my favorite! Smells great and holds even better! I only have to apply twice a day, with the others I had to apply about 4 times.</li>
    <li> Perfect brand of wax works great</li>
    <li> Excellent moustache wax.  The best I have ever used.  It is non-greasy, goes on smooth and easily, and helps get rid of beard dandruff.  Smells great as well...has a manly forest scent.</li>
    <li> DOES THE JOB FOR ME KNOW COMPLAINTS</li>
    <li> First time we used this - great consistency, wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff, great value.</li>
    <li> stinks..works well but stinks.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells just like walking through a spring cedar forest. It&#x27;s really easy to use either with a comb or by scraping a bit with your fingernail. It&#x27;s not the best styling wax and doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I expected, but it works fine for keeping stray hairs under control.</li>
