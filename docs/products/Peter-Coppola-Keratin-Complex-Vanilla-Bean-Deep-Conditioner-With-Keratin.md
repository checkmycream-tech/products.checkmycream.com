      <li>-- they have all radically changed my hair for the better</li>

      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>Best ever deep conditioner!</li>
      <li>it smells good but honestly didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair after use.</li>
      <li>Smells great, but I have really processed hair and this seems to make it break more easily.</li>
      <li>Works best if you have at least a good 10 minutes to let it do</li>
      <li>I tried this out for the first time today and am very happy with how smooth and soft my hair is feeling afterward.</li>
      <li>It smells so sweet too :).</li>
      <li>Noticed a difference with the very first use!  </li>
      <li>Was not Coppola but a cheap knock off.</li>
      <li>Using these two products together is a more budget-conscious solution that gets results and is worth the investment.</li>
      <li>first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products.</li>
      <li>I have to say I noticed a significant difference in how my hair blow-dried after using this product.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair super smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>Great for dry ends.</li>
      <li>This product is great for my hair,especially my dry ends.</li>
      <li>good conditioner for those with the Keratin process, have purchased about three so far and find it helps worth the cost.</li>
      <li>Who knew finding the right product would make my life with my hair so easy.</li>
      <li>Honestly, it takes away even my natural waves.</li>
      <li>I apply it for the full 20 minutes and put on a shower cap to maximize the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I still feel like it was a good complement to my recently coppola keratin treated hair.  </li>
      <li>there are so many better deep conditioners out there..</li>
      <li>This particular item I LOVE.  </li>
      <li>10 mins under a dryer with this on and my hair is super conditioned.</li>
      <li>I use this as a leave in for my mixed texture curls and it is so amazing.</li>
      <li>(right now it&#x27;s all purple.)</li>
      <li>but afterwards it still felt kind of dry.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and easy to style.</li>
      <li>YOUR HAIR LIGHT, SOFT AND MANAGABLE..</li>
      <li>I also use the Infusion Therapy product daily before styling, which makes my hair more manageable and seems to help it hold</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much and it glides right through my tangles.</li>
      <li>My hair was oily but not really soft or in better condition.</li>
      <li>The price on lone is so much cheaper than at the salon.</li>
      <li>will keep it just for the very ends of my hair, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I expected more.</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this at my local beauty supply.</li>
      <li>Very small amount needed, so it renders a good amount of treatments.</li>
      <li>The product itself feels a bit weirdly slick in the hand, but smells nicely of vanilla.</li>
      <li>I do a quick rinse leaving some conditioner in my hair, but it never feels greasy or weighed down, just soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely dry and uncontrollable, but with this product I find that I have smooth silky hair and manageable curls.</li>
      <li>It also smells yummy which means i am more likely to continue regular use</li>
      <li>I used the vanilla bean deep conditioner - left it under the cap for about 20 minutes - and my hair was night-and-day better.</li>
      <li>highly recommend it</li>
      <li>Has really helped my hair, especially in the hot, humid summer weather.</li>
      <li>so i paid double for this, but still worth it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, not bad, not great....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised this conditioner has a high rating.</li>
      <li>I use it about twice a week, following the directions pretty closely, to include putting my hair in a shower cap for a while after application.  </li>
      <li>I first began using the Infusion Therapy four months earlier at the recommendation of my stylist.</li>
      <li>My frizz is not totally gone like it might be with the expensive salon smoothing treatment, but it is dramatically improved at a more comfortable price.</li>
      <li>It does give my hair a shine,and my hair feels so soft after using it.  </li>
      <li>As much as I wish I could, I simply can&#x27;t afford it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. Was recommended by my hair stylist. The price on lone is so much cheaper than at the salon. Delivery was quicjk &amp; packaging was wonderful.</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference with the very first use!  Has really helped my hair, especially in the hot, humid summer weather.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells great! It does give my hair a shine,and my hair feels so soft after using it.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> this conditioner is awesome. i got it at walmart for 5 bucks on clearance so i paid double for this, but still worth it b/c its peter coppola, i mean, hellllo :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  It conditions well.</li>
    <li> This product is great.  I get Keratin treatments for my hair and after using this product it&#x27;s almost like I just had a treatment.  Smells great too!</li>
    <li> While I wasn&#x27;t blown away with the conditioning effects of this conditioner...I still feel like it was a good complement to my recently coppola keratin treated hair.  I like that the product contains keratin and has a wonderful vanilla scent!</li>
    <li> Smells great, but I have really processed hair and this seems to make it break more easily. I&#x27;m sticking to Wen!</li>
    <li> I use this as a leave in for my mixed texture curls and it is so amazing. It smells so sweet too :). It&#x27;s so soft.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy, i use this a lot, either alone or with the keratin restructuring serum. 10 mins under a dryer with this on and my hair is super conditioned. Still looking for a product that works for more than 24 hrs though, i still wake up frizzy.</li>
    <li> I just tried this and am hooked. It&#x27;s super hydrating and the vanilla smell is sooo good! I didn&#x27;t do the whole 20 minute treatment they recommend, but after just putting it on in the shower and then rinsing I noticed a big difference in the softness and smoothness of my hair. When I have time, I will follow the directions! Overall, I have become a big fan of the Coppola Keratin line of products, because they really do what they say, and are much much cheaper than Bumble &amp; Bumble or any other similar quality brand. My daughter&#x27;s colorist commented after two months of using the Coppola Keratin shampoo and conditioner the condition of her hair had improved so much she couldn&#x27;t believe it was the same hair! My daughter has very long highlighted hair that was damaged, but now is glorious! I have been using it too and the results are amazing. I would recommend any of the Coppola Keratin products.</li>
    <li> Was not Coppola but a cheap knock off. Did not do what it claimed. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> I should preface this by saying that I am completely devoted to Coppola&#x27;s Keratin products.  The Keratin treatment itself, the shampoos, conditioners, etc. -- they have all radically changed my hair for the better and I recommend anything they make without reservation.  This particular item I LOVE.  I use it about twice a week, following the directions pretty closely, to include putting my hair in a shower cap for a while after application.  I generally leave the product on a bit longer than the bottle says (20-30 minutes instead of 10), which I think helps my especially difficult hair.  Honestly, I can tell the difference between when I use this conditioner and when I use others.  It really does keep the frizzies down and keeps my hair looking like hair instead of a wild snarl on my head.  (This is especially good b/c I have not had the actual Keratin treatment in over a year, but the shampoo and conditioner keep my hair looking relatively normal, even without the treatment.)  Love.It.</li>
    <li> best product for keratin treated hair and an AWESOME price to boot!! highly recommend it and i recommend putting it on your hair and leaving it over night like a hair mask and your hair will have added shine and luster in the morning! love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> For some reason this conditioner caused my hair to break.  I only used it once.  My hair regained strength immediately after I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of conditioning and smells delightful. However, this is a very heavy product that drenches hair in moisture. It is heavier than coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;After I use this my hair is limp and straight for two or three shampoos. Since my hair has never been curly or frizzy, Coppola may be an overkill. Honestly, it takes away even my natural waves. I don&#x27;t want sad, limp, straight hair, however.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep it just for the very ends of my hair, but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> it smells good but honestly didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair after use. Hair felt nice when washing it out but afterwards it still felt kind of dry. Probably won&#x27;t buy again but will finish what I have.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Hair feels silky after application.  Very small amount needed, so it renders a good amount of treatments. Highly recommend, especially for dry hair.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT ALL THE TIME AND IT SMELLS DELIGHTFUL!!!!&lt;br /&gt;LEAVES YOUR HAIR LIGHT, SOFT AND MANAGABLE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ma Donna M</li>
    <li> Works best if you have at least a good 10 minutes to let it do it&#x27;s job. My course, brittle hair is so soft after using this product</li>
    <li> I have used this twice as a heavy duty conditioner and can tell a difference afterward. I leave it on for about 15 minutes and cover my head with Saran Wrap and for a few minutes put blow dryer on it for heat. My hair feels soft and keeps away frizz</li>
    <li> My natural hair is curly, frizzy and dark brown, almost black with a few grays in the mix. Always hated it. After color processing to blonde, blow drying and flat ironing, it is a frizzy lifeless mess. Since I started using Deva Curl No Poo to cleanse and Keratin Complex Vanilla Bean conditioner my hair has been tremendously improved. I do a quick rinse leaving some conditioner in my hair, but it never feels greasy or weighed down, just soft and smooth. I don&#x27;t have to use much and it glides right through my tangles. I also love the smell. I originally purchased this at my local beauty supply. This is authentic and at quite a savings.</li>
    <li> I love the Coppola Keratin Complex Vanilla Bean Deep Conditioner.  I have used it once a week, for five weeks now and notice a big difference.  My hair is significantly less frizzy and dry and more shiny and soft.  I also use the Infusion Therapy product daily before styling, which makes my hair more manageable and seems to help it hold it&#x27;s style longer. I first began using the Infusion Therapy four months earlier at the recommendation of my stylist. That alone made somewhat of a difference.  But adding the Deep Conditioner to my routine made an even bigger difference.  I believe these products working together are the reason I am personally so pleased. Although if you are not looking to get both products, I believe you will still get noticeable improvement with just the Deep Conditioner after a few applications. I apply it for the full 20 minutes and put on a shower cap to maximize the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist has been urging me to get the salon smoothing treatment for several hundred dollars every 3-4 months to tame my ridiculously dry and frizzy hair, which includes a lot of gray under my color. As much as I wish I could, I simply can&#x27;t afford it. Using these two products together is a more budget-conscious solution that gets results and is worth the investment. My frizz is not totally gone like it might be with the expensive salon smoothing treatment, but it is dramatically improved at a more comfortable price. And the Amazon price for both products was lower than at the salon.</li>
    <li> Even before I had the Keratin and Keratin express treatments done  on my hair my friend recommended this product to me. I have to say I noticed a significant difference in how my hair blow-dried after using this product.  Of course now that I have Keratin treatments on my hair for 10 months I haven&#x27;t used anything but this conditioner and I absolutely love it. It keeps the hair feeling soft and sleek.</li>
    <li> I bleach my hair and I like to dye it funky colors (right now it&#x27;s all purple.) All the dying made my hair stiff and frizzy. I use this conditioner once a week, I just leave it in for 10-15 mins then wash it out and my hair is sooo soft and manageable. It&#x27;s crazy how my hair can go from feeling like straw to feeling so silky with just one product. The smell is also nice, too. Vanilla bean!</li>
    <li> Great for dry ends. Leaves hair soft and manageable. Smells nice.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  Would recommend it to anyone as it seems to strengthen the hair and helps to keep it manageable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised this conditioner has a high rating. It seems average, leaves a waxy feeling on hair, didn&#x27;t tame dry broken strands. I will stick to joico or nexus next time.</li>
    <li> I like the scent of this conditioner a lot.  It makes my hair super smooth and silky.  However, I have to rinse it thoroughly otherwise my hair gets sticky easily especially if it is humid.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner, it is rich ,smalls great and does an excellent job on my hair. Makes my hair soft and easy to style.I use it weekly.</li>
    <li> This product is incredible. I use it instead of conditioner. My hair is extremely dry and uncontrollable, but with this product I find that I have smooth silky hair and manageable curls. I also use the shampoo in this product line. I can&#x27;t tell you how many compliments I get on the fact that my hair looks incredible. Who knew finding the right product would make my life with my hair so easy.</li>
    <li> I tried this out for the first time today and am very happy with how smooth and soft my hair is feeling afterward. The product itself feels a bit weirdly slick in the hand, but smells nicely of vanilla. It doesn&#x27;t leave any lasting vanilla scent in my hair, as far as I can tell - but I also have short hair so your mileage may vary!</li>
    <li> This product gave me hives. Itching and redness with bumps all over my neck, chest, and arms. Not sure how long it will take for the hives to dissapate.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it was a lot cheaper than my salon sells it for even with the shipping. I was thrilled to try it and it works very good. It smells awesome and I left it on a little bit longer. I have my hair highlighted so, it needs a lot of T.L.C. and this made it soft and shiny. Very happy with this product. My hairdresser recommended it and I had wanted to give it a&lt;br /&gt;try and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Smells really good.  It seems to work as well as anything else I have purchased.</li>
    <li> Intoxicating scent and excellent detangler...</li>
    <li> I have been using the conditioner for almost 3 years and it does a great job, smells good and creamily mositurizes your hair.  I tried other sulfate free conditioners for my keratin treated hair such as Loreal and Burt Bees but they left my hair crunchy and stiff.  The cost of the product is worth, less expensive that a retail store purchase such as Ulta.</li>
    <li> Eh, doesn&#x27;t work so well. Smells amazing! But doesn&#x27;t condition my hair hardly at all! My suave professionals brand works a thousand times better than this! Pass unless your hair is in amazingly good health.</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 2 years now. Every time I buy something different I regret it. This is my go to. I use it almost every time I shampoo. It does not weigh my hair down. It makes my hair feel soft and stronger. Love love love it!! It is a pretty thick conditioner so a little does go a long way, totally worth the money!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not bad, not great....there are so many better deep conditioners out there..and I have the Keratin Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy again......I would suggest Alterna Caviar and Nexxus Humetrix deep conditioners instead, they are a million times better than this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use at home after getting a keratin treatment at a salon. It made my hair feel like silk after using and I loved the vanilla scent. Yummy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Please see the extensive proof cited below about how this company has knowingly put customers at risk.&lt;br /&gt;The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products.

    <li> good conditioner for those with the Keratin process, have purchased about three so far and find it helps worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting the Coppola Keratin treatments for a couple years now, and love it. I recently was a little \\&quot;bad\\&quot; to my hair with an extreme ombre color that I wanted. The double-processing and teasing of the hair had me leave the salon with slightly crunchy very dry hair. I used the vanilla bean deep conditioner - left it under the cap for about 20 minutes - and my hair was night-and-day better. Awesome, highly recommended product!</li>
    <li> I have used other products from this line, and I have to say this is the only one that made my hair extremely dry.  I have curly hair and do highlights. All the hair that had been highlighted turned into a horrendous frizz,  and it&#x27;s taken me using 3 other products to get my  hair back to where it was before I used it.  Never again!!!</li>
    <li> Received wrong item.item sent to me is very different than the pic and the ingredients are very different. And it was awful didn&#x27;t work on my hair</li>
    <li> This product is great for my hair,especially my dry ends.It also smells yummy which means i am more likely to continue regular use</li>
    <li> After having a keratin treatment...before going to beach...my stylist recommended that I get this to make the treatment last longer.  Amazon&#x27;s price was unbeatable.  The shipment was ASAP and I use this every 7-10 days and on the other days use just the regular Keratin Complex shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND...from one who deals with humidity due to natural curls...</li>
    <li> Item worked well but not great. I expected more. My hair was oily but not really soft or in better condition. I ended up trying the Aussie miracle conditioner and it works much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one year.  I get a treatment for my hair that takes the friz out and this product helps that treatment last a lot longer.  I think that my hair is healthier and although I am in desperate need of a haircut i do not have split ends.  Last haircut was in early June.&lt;br /&gt;In addition the price at Amazon is the best price I have been able to find anywhere.</li>
    <li> Best ever deep conditioner!</li>
