      <li>Happy By Clinique For Women.</li>
      <li>I also get the clinique happy in the body butter..</li>

      <li>The Happy body smoother became a staple at any party scene</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is the perfect scent from the many Happy variations there are out there now.  </li>
      <li>This scent is the perfect blend of light citrus and a hint of flowers.  </li>
      <li>but it puts me in a good mood.</li>
      <li>But it still smells good--upliftingly, bubblingly good.</li>
      <li>I loved it, but the thing is, I don&#x27;t like smelling like everyone else....</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pleasant fragrance that&#x27;s just right!  </li>
      <li>Very refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>I have been using Happy for many years</li>
      <li>Clinique happy is a cute scent.</li>
      <li>have tried Happy Heart and Happy to be, and the Classic Happy, is still #1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and not overpowering, but smells just sooooooo good!</li>
      <li>The scent was so fantastic, and all of my friends loved it!  </li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>one spray lasts most of the day!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a light and airy beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>This perfume is the perfect combination of citrus and floral notes that smell fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>A very summer scent and very good for all ages.</li>
      <li>It has just the right amount of everything to make it a beautiful light citrus scent.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear it every day but most.</li>
      <li>It is so refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say that I can detect it, but it seems an interesting ingredient.</li>
      <li>but this isn&#x27;t the most sophisticated of smells</li>
      <li>It does have a delightfully citrus-y fragrance that is sweet, but not too sweet, and light, but not too light.</li>
      <li>Okay ladies this perfume is \\&quot;the bomb!\\</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, the lotion actually smells better in Happy Heart (IMHO!).</li>
      <li>Even when I put on more than I planned, it&#x27;s still isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>It is a great fragrance for a young woman.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong, just like the Jessica McClintock.</li>
      <li>This is such a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>I have liked \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; since Clinique first introduced it.</li>
      <li>I was first turned on to Happy when I was given a little tube of Happy body smoother at a rave party.  </li>
      <li>It is an all around exciting fragrance that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and lasts all day.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s light</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet, goodness, and light all in one bottle.</li>
      <li>It is a clean, sweet citrus fragrance that is not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>This perfume is light, citrus-y and fresh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 19 and I would recommend this to teens or anybody who wants a light \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; scent!</li>
      <li>Received this today and it is way too sweet.  </li>
      <li>Any more than one spray and the whole neighborhood will know your perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Other perfumes give me headaches, but I have not had that problem with Happy.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure why I liked this perfume so much, until I read in the product description that it contains Bergamot, which is the main flavoring agent in Earl Grey tea (my favorite tea).</li>
      <li>I find intriguing about the product description</li>
      <li>A citrus light floral mix, very uplifting (hence, the name...)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fun</li>
      <li>(thanks mostly to the Ruby Grapefruit scent) AND Flowery (thanks to the spring mimosa and the Hawaiian Wedding Flower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just right.  </li>
      <li>As some of the others have said, it is right for the office, or after hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how long it lasts as well -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve yet to find a fragrance that i love to smell on me constantly.</li>
      <li>It is definitely not super sweet nor strong.</li>
      <li>Everywhere I go, I get compliments and people asking (I hope I don&#x27;t use too much).</li>
      <li>I can spray it on as much as i like and not have to give anyone else a headache..</li>
      <li>.they cost too much ;</li>
      <li>More so than any other fragrance that I have worn.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s very appropriate for casual use or even work if used with a light hand.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
      <li>Although perfumes are a very individual decision, I think this perfume is outstanding--it&#x27;s different enough to stand out, but light enough to be refreshing.</li>
      <li>Even though it clearly lists the fragrance ingredients in the product notes, I&#x27;m just going to put this out there -</li>
      <li>Young, old, feminine, sporty...</li>
      <li>-))Thus,I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good for casual use and for anyone .</li>

    <li> Happy is the perfect scent for me.   Even when I put on more than I planned, it&#x27;s still isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  It&#x27;s a very pleasant fragrance that&#x27;s just right!  Very refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I have had my bottle of Ralph for about two years now (1.7 oz). I don&#x27;t wear it every day but most. It is a great fragrance for a young woman. This would be a great gift for birthday, Christmas, or just to give! Me LOVES IT &amp; and get compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I was first turned on to Happy when I was given a little tube of Happy body smoother at a rave party.  The scent was so fantastic, and all of my friends loved it!  The Happy body smoother became a staple at any party scene I was at... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I got the perfume for Christmas that year from my boyfriend and wore it often.  Shortly after that I got pregnant and thought I hated it so I gave it away!  After the pregnancy and my thought processes got back on track, I realized I didn&#x27;t hate it and wanted it back...  No can do! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the perfect scent from the many Happy variations there are out there now.  It&#x27;s not too citrusy, and it&#x27;s not too flowery.  It&#x27;s perfect and I love it! &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This perfume is light, citrus-y and fresh. As some of the others have said, it is right for the office, or after hours. I like a perfume that lasts all day but is not so heavy that it overwhelms. This perfume is perfect for women of all types. Young, old, feminine, sporty... I get compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful perfume.  It&#x27;s not overpowering and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.  It&#x27;s sweet, goodness, and light all in one bottle.</li>
    <li> This scent is the perfect blend of light citrus and a hint of flowers.  Never too heavy... just right.  Other perfumes give me headaches, but I have not had that problem with Happy.  It is so refreshing.  Spritz it on the morning and you&#x27;ll feel like facing the day!</li>
    <li> A citrus light floral mix, very uplifting (hence, the name...) one spray lasts most of the day! Any more than one spray and the whole neighborhood will know your perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Happy Heart and Happy to be, and the Classic Happy, is still #1!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it everyday and the 1.7 oz lasts me about a year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the lotion actually smells better in Happy Heart (IMHO!).</li>
    <li> Received this today and it is way too sweet.  It smells VERY similar to Jessica McClintock perfume.  My mother happens to wear Jessica so \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; will be going to her for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I will say that it lasts a LONG time (kind of making me sick).  I sprayed it on to test several hours ago and it&#x27;s still going strong, just like the Jessica McClintock.</li>
    <li> I got this perfume when I was 18 (I think..) Everywhere I go, I get compliments and people asking (I hope I don&#x27;t use too much). I like it for its freshness and the citrus touches it has. It is definitely not super sweet nor strong. You might think I am slipping but it puts me in a good mood. A very summer scent and very good for all ages.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s some tips involving Clinique&#x27;s HAPPY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) three simple words. SMELL BEFORE BUY. I&#x27;m not you and you&#x27;re not me thus we may OR may not have the same opinions . . . .So go to your local department store and try it before you buy it (buy it here on Amazon of course). . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Even though it clearly lists the fragrance ingredients in the product notes, I&#x27;m just going to put this out there - It&#x27;s BOTH Fruity (thanks mostly to the Ruby Grapefruit scent) AND Flowery (thanks to the spring mimosa and the Hawaiian Wedding Flower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I&#x27;d say this fragrance&#x27;s scent strength is moderate . .Not too subtle and not too overpowering . . Just purrrfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)No offense, but this isn&#x27;t the most sophisticated of smells (though I don&#x27;t mind . .I&#x27;m not a big fan of the \\&quot;sophisticated\\&quot; smells anyways . .they cost too much ;-))Thus,I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good for casual use and for anyone . .Adult OR Teen . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) I&#x27;d say this perfume, on average, lasts about 8 hours  . . . perfect for a day at work or school or whatever .  . .</li>
    <li> Clinique happy is a cute scent. It lives up to it&#x27;s title and is a very happy thing to wear. It&#x27;s fun and it&#x27;s light and I would recomend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to be over powered.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance since it came out and I continue to get comments on it.  More so than any other fragrance that I have worn.  I love it!  It&#x27;s light and not overpowering, but smells just sooooooo good!</li>
    <li> I loved it, but the thing is, I don&#x27;t like smelling like everyone else....But it still smells good--upliftingly, bubblingly good.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for several years and have gotten numerous comments on it.  It is a clean, sweet citrus fragrance that is not overpowering.  It&#x27;s amazing how long it lasts as well - I put it on in the morning and when I return from work 9 hours later, I can still smell it.  It is a wonderful spring/summer fragrance that can be worn by women of all ages.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B000C1Z3LS Happy By Clinique For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces]]    This is such a beautiful scent. It&#x27;s flowery but not old lady like. It&#x27;s a light and airy beautiful scent. It wears well too. This is one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure why I liked this perfume so much, until I read in the product description that it contains Bergamot, which is the main flavoring agent in Earl Grey tea (my favorite tea). It does have a delightfully citrus-y fragrance that is sweet, but not too sweet, and light, but not too light. Although perfumes are a very individual decision, I think this perfume is outstanding--it&#x27;s different enough to stand out, but light enough to be refreshing. I think it&#x27;s very appropriate for casual use or even work if used with a light hand.&lt;br /&gt;What I find intriguing about the product description is that the perfume also contains boysenberry! I can&#x27;t say that I can detect it, but it seems an interesting ingredient.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies this perfume is \\&quot;the bomb!\\&quot; The frangrance is sweet,citrusy,light,sexy,lingering,alluring,edible..the list goes on and on. I&#x27;ve yet to find a fragrance that i love to smell on me constantly. I can spray it on as much as i like and not have to give anyone else a headache..when im at work it lingers down the hallway long after ive left..i would drink it if i could! I also get the clinique happy in the body butter..mmm oh so yummy!</li>
    <li> Happy is the type of fragrance that you can wear at the office or in the evening for a night out...It is an all around exciting fragrance that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and lasts all day.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I have liked \\&quot;Happy\\&quot; since Clinique first introduced it. It has just the right amount of everything to make it a beautiful light citrus scent. If your into the really heavy scented perfumes this one is not for you. I&#x27;m 19 and I would recommend this to teens or anybody who wants a light \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot; scent! I LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is the perfect combination of citrus and floral notes that smell fresh and clean. I like this as a day fragrance. I have been using Happy for many years and it&#x27;s a scent I never get tired of.</li>
