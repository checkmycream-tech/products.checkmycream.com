      <li>I don&#x27;t even know what currency it was originally in.</li>

      <li>I am so glad I won&#x27;t be spending so much on hair products now!</li>
      <li>My husband got this for me for Christmas a couple years ago at a special booth at the Mall</li>
      <li>JUST AN OVERALL GOOD PRODUCT</li>
      <li>I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister&#x27;s Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.  </li>
      <li>and they&#x27;re all very perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong for me.</li>
      <li>Smells soooo good and makes your hair feel super clean and weight less.</li>
      <li>They are worth it at the price that Amazon sells it at, but not at the price at the kiosk.</li>
      <li>The seems so fresh and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have straight, fine hair, which is hard to find a shampoo that does a good job.</li>
      <li>Leaves ur hair super super soft.</li>
      <li>and this shampoo is much better than anything you can find in a regular store.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is more goopy and thicker than regular shampoo but lathers well.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for a larger bottle</li>
      <li>/&gt;~(&amp;#60;^..^&amp;#62;)</li>
      <li>I really like the smell too!</li>
      <li>Along with the conditioner it leaves my hair so silky smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>I being willing to try anything, tried it out</li>
      <li>and I was amazed at how soft and clean the shampoo made my graying hair.</li>
      <li>so you need to use a very little bit to get a good amount of cleaning.</li>
      <li>I was spending a lot more on expensive brands, and I like this stuff better!</li>
      <li>You really cannot beat the price.</li>
      <li>It lathers up so much that you don&#x27;t have to use a whole gob.</li>
      <li>Try it, you really have nothing to lose.</li>
      <li>Use all 3 products and have straight sleek hair.</li>
      <li>I would definitely say it&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
      <li>There is nothing essentially different in this shampoo than others on the market, so if you are looking for a unique formula or no chemicals - this shampoo is not it.</li>
      <li>The sales guy threw in a shampoo and conditioner for free to entice me to purchase the flat iron.</li>
      <li>It is a shame because the conditioner at the mall that is not made in china and is a great product as well but here on amazon they are selling the made in china brand which is not tha same, it actually sucks.</li>
      <li>it is highly concentrated</li>
      <li>I wish it lathered up a little better.  </li>
      <li>shiny, soft, very manageable.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I tired it and loved it.</li>
      <li>leave my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized!  </li>
      <li>But my hair developed a buildup after using it 3-4 times in a row, I had to swap a use out with another shampoo.</li>
      <li>It makes hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>The fragrance on the shampoo is a bit unusual, ad you have to get used to it since it is really not a traditional smell for shampoo.</li>
      <li>Her Styler Shampoo makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>Does leave hair soft but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
      <li>It takes only a tiny bit, so it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
      <li>It really helps with my very long very curly hair and vurtually gets the knots out, I use Herbal essence conditioner with it since the condition I purchased on Amazon is not the same qualty as the shampoo.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and use well water that can be very harsh on your hair.  </li>
      <li>I was skeptical about it all, but really have been nothing but satisfied with the results of the straightener, shampoo, conditioner, and styling serum.  </li>

    <li> My hair has never been in better condition....shiny, soft, very manageable. It takes only a tiny bit, so it&#x27;s worth the cost. I love this shampoo and the conditioner!</li>
    <li> I originally got this shampoo at the mall at one of those kiosks that sells Herstyler products. The sales guy threw in a shampoo and conditioner for free to entice me to purchase the flat iron. I also got a free hair serum, which I also love. The guy tried to tell me that the shampoo and conditioner were each $25, but id you look at the label the amount is not in US dollars, so I don&#x27;t know what it comes to when you convert the currency. I don&#x27;t even know what currency it was originally in. Anyway, I tired it and loved it. It makes my hair really soft and manageable, and it smells great. I have straight, fine hair, which is hard to find a shampoo that does a good job. I was so glad to see that Amazon sells these products. They are worth it at the price that Amazon sells it at, but not at the price at the kiosk.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister&#x27;s Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.

    <li> [[ASIN:B0044C0PA0 Herstyler Shampoo, 6.4 Ounce]] This product is exctly as the shampoo sold at the mall. It really helps with my very long very curly hair and vurtually gets the knots out, I use Herbal essence conditioner with it since the condition I purchased on Amazon is not the same qualty as the shampoo. It is a shame because the conditioner at the mall that is not made in china and is a great product as well but here on amazon they are selling the made in china brand which is not tha same, it actually sucks.</li>
    <li> With only a pea sized squeeze I get sufficient lather to wash my short hair. My wife bought this shampoo and the conditioner too. She has long curly black hair and she hates most shampoo and conditioners because they do not work well. She loves this shampoo. I being willing to try anything, tried it out and I was amazed at how soft and clean the shampoo made my graying hair. As I move up in age my hair has been getting coarser and less manageable, the shampoo has brought back the softness and has made it easier to style again. It does have a bit of a perfume scent, so you might want to pass if you are worried about such things.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best shampoo I have ever used.  My hair is so healthy, no tangles, no static electricity and it smells heavenly!!  You HAVE to use this!!!</li>
    <li> es un produnto exelente, precio rezonable justo lo que necesitaba estoy muy contento con el muchas gracias..saludos y que se la pasen bien happy holy day</li>
    <li> Does leave hair soft but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Used shampoo, conditioner,&amp; serum and they&#x27;re all very perfume-y.&lt;br /&gt;Way too strong for me. Would like to use again but the longer I sit here the worse it gets.&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t like strong perfume smell, don&#x27;t get this...</li>
    <li> I really love the shampoo and conditioner.  I have tried every single shampoo in a regular store and always feel my hair is greasy or limp after a day or two and this shampoo is much better than anything you can find in a regular store.  I also love the smell :)  You only need a little squeeze of it.  I would definitely say it&#x27;s worth buying!</li>
    <li> The fragrance on the shampoo is a bit unusual, ad you have to get used to it since it is really not a traditional smell for shampoo. I like the way it leaves your hair silky and manageable. You get an extra day or two of not having to wash your hair. But my hair developed a buildup after using it 3-4 times in a row, I had to swap a use out with another shampoo. The bottle size is on the small side, especially for anyone with long hair. The consistency is more goopy and thicker than regular shampoo but lathers well. There is nothing essentially different in this shampoo than others on the market, so if you are looking for a unique formula or no chemicals - this shampoo is not it.</li>
    <li> Really a nice shampoo and definately helps with the fly-aways in this cold winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend. Use with the HerStyler Serum and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> The bottle was split at seem on bottom of tube</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always you and twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HerStyler Nourishing &amp; Moisturizing Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;HerStyler with the Nourishing Moisturizing Hair Mask&lt;br /&gt;HerStyler Hair Serum with Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dry it and curl it.  The seems so fresh and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~(&amp;#60;^..^&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo for my hair. It lathers up so much that you don&#x27;t have to use a whole gob. It smells really nice too. My only complaint is that the tube that it comes in is small. I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying more for a larger bottle but it is not available in a larger package.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy it, Bought 4 to share with others.  Gave one to a girlfriend who is a hairdresser.  She loved it.  It makes hair soft and manageable.  Will buy more!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GOOD CLEANS WELL HAS AN OILS IN IT JUST AN OVERALL GOOD PRODUCT THE CONDITIONER IS JUST AS GOOD</li>
    <li> It is simply the best shampoo I have ever used. I came across Herstyler Shampoo and Conditioner as a give away with the purchase of  a  flat iron.  Love it !</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product that I have ever used. Will order this product and conditioner again! Thank you</li>
    <li> My husband got this for me for Christmas a couple years ago at a special booth at the Mall and I love it.  Unfortunately, I could not find it locally again and the closest seller was 130 miles! So I tried Amazon and found it at a much less expensive price! So that&#x27;s where I get the shampoo and also the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and makes your hair feel super clean and weight less. It is a really good product. Better for people with short hair but works great on ling hair too.</li>
    <li> cleans well without stripping color</li>
    <li> This is the greatest shampoo for my hair.  I have fine hair and use well water that can be very harsh on your hair.  Her Styler Shampoo makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I got this for free at one of the booths in the mall when I purchased a straightener. I was skeptical about it all, but really have been nothing but satisfied with the results of the straightener, shampoo, conditioner, and styling serum.  You really cannot beat the price. I was spending a lot more on expensive brands, and I like this stuff better! I was even more excited when I found it on Amazon at a great price. The mall lady said it would be 2/$25, so it&#x27;s a steal on Amazon. Try it, you really have nothing to lose. I am so glad I won&#x27;t be spending so much on hair products now! I really like the smell too!</li>
    <li> The smell of this stuff is awesome!  Along with the conditioner it leaves my hair so silky smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Although I like the product I received (2) Shampoo&#x27;s rather than the (1) I ordered.  What i actually ordered (2) of, i got one, SMH.  To return it, would mean that i would need to repurchase it rather than having it replaced for what I purchased.</li>
    <li> Good stuff.  Use all 3 products and have straight sleek hair. Best hair days ever when using these 3 together. I bought this at the mall kiosk for 10 times the price that I purchased it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Shampoo container split open during shipment</li>
    <li> I love this! Smells so good and u can smell it all day. Every1 asks what im using. Its way cheaper here than in the malls which is a plus!  Leaves ur hair super super soft. I bought the cond to :) shipping was on time.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo!  It smells great and not just while in the shower, I can smell it all day!  I wish it lathered up a little better.  I have recommended it to friends!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I discovered it about 6 months ago, and have used nothing else since. My hair feels and smells awesome. The price is great. I recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> i will be reordering since i use this weekly and alot cheaper here then in the mall where i originally bought</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on how shiny my hair looks!</li>
    <li> Very nice product - I love the smell and it is highly concentrated so you need to use a very little bit to get a good amount of cleaning.</li>
