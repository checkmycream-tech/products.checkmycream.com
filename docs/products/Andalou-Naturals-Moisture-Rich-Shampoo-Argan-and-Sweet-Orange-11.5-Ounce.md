      <li>REVIEW: I&#x27;ve been using Andalou products for a couple years now, and I love them.</li>
      <li>Both my daughters love it.</li>
      <li>also love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Smells FANTASTIC!  </li>
      <li>I also have the conditioner and love the combination.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love all the products from this company..</li>
      <li>After getting over the shock, I decided to educate myself, and wound up getting rid of most of my hair products that contained silicone in them.</li>
      <li>and it gets me fabulous hair!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which of the Andalou shampoo choices to pick.</li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo, cleans my hair, and smells great...</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m really pleased to have found this product.</li>
      <li>Love &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>IF you like the scent of candied oranges and nice clean hair you will love this.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is perfect for users who have sensitive skin but need a shampoo that will clean thoroughly.</li>
      <li>and I feel very clean after using it.</li>
      <li>Also it has an amazing sweet orange scent.</li>
      <li>love this, and the conditioner as well, made my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
      <li>First, this shampoo smells great, not necessarily a requirement for me, but a pleasant surprise.  </li>
      <li>As a bonus, it has a mild orange/vanilla scent that&#x27;s lovely.</li>
      <li>I started trying argan oil products and this one has been fantastic.</li>
      <li>They all sound heavenly, but am in my mid-40&#x27;s and my hair is getting brittle from graying.</li>
      <li>Finally no split end fly aways.</li>
      <li>This is a good opportunity to heal your hair, but many think the product is to blame and go back to the silicones, which just perpetuates the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love the organic ingredients, the philosophy and paying the farmers &amp; workers who are a part of growing the ingredients in this shampoo properly, and the smell is pretty great</li>
      <li>I am very pleased to have finally found a shampoo that eases my scaly itchy scalp while smelling lovely.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite shampoo!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited.</li>
      <li>It was the right choice!</li>
      <li>My excitement was short-lived when I saw that the Sweet Orange Argan &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; hair products contained silicones (dimethicone).</li>
      <li>In fact, now that I&#x27;ve healed my hair, I&#x27;ve even gotten away with skipping the conditioner, after using the Sweet Orange Argan shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am allergic to a specific ingredient that is in 95% of shampoo&#x27;s and shower baths, but this works well, has a nice scent, and is very mild.</li>
      <li>Makes our hair shine and super silky.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this shampoo I noticed a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair.</li>
      <li>Andalusia Naturals leaves my hair clean, soft, and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I have very light, fine, dry hair.  </li>
      <li>I also bought the anti-aging shampoo which did not work for me, dried and stripped my color, this formula is very nice</li>
      <li>This didn&#x27;t happen right away, but probably around 3 weeks of using this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Love the light scent and that it&#x27;s safe enough for our entire family.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very much, causing me to use more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Keeps hair looking healthy during alternate washes.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo especially in combination with it&#x27;s conditioner.</li>
      <li>- keeps the frizz away and helps get me really pretty ringlets.  </li>
      <li>It freaked me out the first time a clump of hair came off  </li>
      <li>I was first sold on their skin care, so when I had seen that they also offered hair care products</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
      <li>I was raised organic and I find that some organic products are too gentle to get the job done - but not this one!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells amazing and also makes my hair feel soft, so I will definitely be buying it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a very happy shampooer! This smells fantastic and lathers beautifully but the real test was after shampooing.....easy to comb through my past shoulder length hair and dries with shine and manageability. No need for conditioner which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy,</li>
    <li> A very good product.  I have long fine straight hair and wash every day.  Not drying at all.  The scent is very nice.</li>
    <li> EDIT: The new packaging now lists dimethicone as an ingredient again (in the conditioner). So I am no longer using this product. I&#x27;m not sure why they removed the dimethicone for awhile, only to put it back in (??). I know silicones make your hair feel nice at first, but it&#x27;s a false sense of smoothness. They only coat the hair, keeping moisture out and actually making hair shaft drier and and your hair more unruly with time. Eventually, people start to think they need &#x27;cone shampoos to tame their hair, but it&#x27;s only because of the coating on the hair. If you don&#x27;t use the &#x27;cone product hair seems unruly, but it&#x27;s the &#x27;cone products that are actually causing the problem. Sigh. Such a bummer, Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: I&#x27;ve been using Andalou products for a couple years now, and I love them. I was first sold on their skin care, so when I had seen that they also offered hair care products I was so excited. My excitement was short-lived when I saw that the Sweet Orange Argan &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; hair products contained silicones (dimethicone). I was beyond disappointed. I couldn&#x27;t understand why they would taint their product with a silicone ingredient. I actually sent them an email, expressing my disappointment and suggesting they consider removing the &#x27;cones&#x27; (because I wouldn&#x27;t be using their shampoos until then). This was over a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I was passing the Andalou shampoos at my local health food market, when I was struck by a curiosity to read the ingredient panel of the Sweet Orange Argan shampoo - you know, just in case. I didn&#x27;t see dimethicone or other cones anywhere on the label. I read it over again... and again... then I brought it home with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, thick, wavy hair, and I used to keep my hair under control (or thought I was) by using products containing silicones (dimethicone, etc...). I, thankfully, realized long ago to no longer fall for the temporary smoothing effects of silicones. They initially make your hair feel great, but that seal they create to smooth down the hair shaft is only locking out moisture and making your hair drier and drier. So, yes, if you&#x27;ve been using silicones, when they&#x27;re finally stripped off, your hair will feel like straw. This is a good opportunity to heal your hair, but many think the product is to blame and go back to the silicones, which just perpetuates the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it does clean your hair well, but it&#x27;s not harsh. I wouldn&#x27;t consider it a clarifying shampoo; it&#x27;s just not laying down a new layer of silicone or other build up. It does seem to provide some moisturizing qualities, which, again, your hair can only absorb if it&#x27;s not coated with silicones. In fact, now that I&#x27;ve healed my hair, I&#x27;ve even gotten away with skipping the conditioner, after using the Sweet Orange Argan shampoo. My hair is down to my waist, so that&#x27;s no small feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it. My hair likes it.&lt;br /&gt;I have one other favorite shampoo, so I&#x27;ve added Andalou into a rotation to mix it up a little. I really hope they leave the current formulation as it is. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase.d my hair, I&#x27;ve even gotten away with skipping the conditioner, after using the Sweet Orange Argan shampoo.

    <li> Smells delicious!! This is a nice shampoo. It cleans well, rinses well and leaves my hair soft and manageable. I have medium-length, naturally curly (loose curls) hair that runs on the oily side.</li>
    <li> I use this every day and my grandchildren love it!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo, unfortunately, it did not work for my hair.  It would leave my scalp greasy and smelling dirty.  My husband mentioned that my hair smelled dirty as well.  Maybe for others it has worked, but not for me.</li>
    <li> very nice. Love it. IF you like the scent of candied oranges and nice clean hair you will love this. I will be back when I run out.</li>
    <li> love this, and the conditioner as well, made my hair shiny and smooth. I also bought the anti-aging shampoo which did not work for me, dried and stripped my color, this formula is very nice</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing shampoo. My hair is thin and breaks off easily and very dry. Just one use made a big difference. My hair became soft and after a week of using it my hair felt fuller. Use it with the conditioner and you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was not good for my hair. I gave it to a friend who said it was great on her hair. Usually I like these products. Don&#x27;t pass it up just because it didn&#x27;t work for me. I have very light, fine, dry hair.  I just need a different shampoo.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Plus it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores</li>
    <li> I had oily scalp problem ever since I use this, my hair stays better!</li>
    <li> My hair had become such a problem! It was really oily within 24 hours of washing as well as my scalp being extremely itchy and flaky! It was awful, truly awful. The first time I used this shampoo I noticed a huge difference. The flakiness was almost gone as well as the itchiness! The next day I expected the same old oily gross hair but to my surprise it still looked clean!! FANTASTIC!! As a bonus, it has a mild orange/vanilla scent that&#x27;s lovely. I highly recommend this product to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I was raised organic and I find that some organic products are too gentle to get the job done - but not this one! It cleans perfectly with one lather, and that&#x27;s saying a lot considering I have hair to my butt and it&#x27;s curly and thick. Smells heavenly without being too sweet, and is a good price for the product. Also, the company&#x27;s environmental  pedigree is great. I have an actual skin reaction to sulfates and parabens, so I cannot use drug-store products. This shampoo is perfect for users who have sensitive skin but need a shampoo that will clean thoroughly. The conditioner makes me get perfect ringlets:)</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells great but what I really like is that I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner and my hair seems to stay cleaner longer. I now only shampoo every 3 days.  I haven&#x27;t noticed if it helps with losing hair but my hair does seem thicker.</li>
    <li> My hair loves this shampoo and conditioner.  I have fine straight hair. With this product it has body, shine, moisture is perfect. Finally no split end fly aways. Highly recommend this all natural product!</li>
    <li> Good quality product!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which of the Andalou shampoo choices to pick. They all sound heavenly, but am in my mid-40&#x27;s and my hair is getting brittle from graying. I chose this one because of the moisture-rich formula. It was the right choice! I have tried other natural shampoos and this one truly moisturizes from the first application, smells great (like creamsicle), and lathers well (have tried others that don&#x27;t lather).</li>
    <li> I fell in love with my other Andalou Natural products so I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, it made my hair fall out excessively. It freaked me out the first time a clump of hair came off  but I thought maybe its just a fluke.  But it happened again and again. I haven&#x27;t heard of this from other customers so maybe there&#x27;s something wrong with me. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the conditioner or shampoo since I bought both. But I notice the large hair shedding while conditioning. I also didn&#x27;t like that I felt the need to use a lot of shampoo to feel like I&#x27;m getting decent leather. Smells great but I&#x27;m still looking for that miracle shampoo. My friend gives Desert Essence Organic coconut shampoo very high regards so I will be trying that next.</li>
    <li> This product has a great aroma. It is almost like the smell of orange blossoms. It lathers up nice and I feel very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this line for a few months now and love it! I was using DermOrganics but this is more &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and works great! I have color treated thick hair and my hair is soft and manageable using their line of products. I leave the conditioner in for a few mins b4 washing out, makes a big difference. I just wish they were larger bottles. Their Hair BB cream is wonderful too. They all smell yummy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get my bonafides out of the way.  I have cancer.  I am on chemotherapy which plays havoc on my hair follicles and my once thick hair is now VERY thin. I was looking for \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; to retard the hair loss/thinning process.  First, this shampoo smells great, not necessarily a requirement for me, but a pleasant surprise.  I use just a little (but then I don&#x27;t have much hair).  Over the past month or so, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair loss has slowed down (a whole lot less hair strands showing up on my pillow, in the shower, at my computer keyboard, etc.. and my hair does feel thicker (not sure if that&#x27;s wishful thinking or not).  So as long as I still have some hair, I&#x27;m going to continue to Andalou Naturals shampoo.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo and conditioner! I will never switch!</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this shampoo, big props for moving to all natural ingredients - that was the reason I bought it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell of this shampoo. I was happy with how it lathered and rinsed. I only wash my hair every 3 or 4 days, so I&#x27;d guess I used this shampoo fewer than 10 times before I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started developing big dry patches of scalp around the front of my hairline that turned red and irritated. This didn&#x27;t happen right away, but probably around 3 weeks of using this shampoo. I had a hair appointment the same day I first noticed the redness &amp; my hairdresser recommended that I stop using the shampoo. I did. It took a few days for the redness to go away but it did. I went back to my regular old Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and haven&#x27;t had any outbreaks of redness/patchiness around my hairline since. And honestly, my hair felt SO SOFT after going back to the H&amp;S shampoo -- I&#x27;d become accustomed to the dry hair feeling that it was a very noticeable change to feel soft hair again. I wish it worked for me!</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo!!  My sis introduced it to me...the fragrance is heavenly and my hair seems healthier and thicker. Will order again.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to a specific ingredient that is in 95% of shampoo&#x27;s and shower baths, but this works well, has a nice scent, and is very mild.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful. Not only are the ingredients amazing, but it truly is moisturizing, which has been hard for me to find in a natural shampoo! Also it has an amazing sweet orange scent. Very glad I found this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, cleans my hair, and smells great...&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of orange sherbert... and it doesn&#x27;t take much shampoo to get a&lt;br /&gt;nice lather..&lt;br /&gt;Rinses out clean.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells wonderful</li>
    <li> I try out a lot of shampoos purely because the scent intrigues me. This shampoo smells amazing and also makes my hair feel soft, so I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I already wrote a review on the shampoo and love it, also this conditioner smells soooo good and makes my long fine but thick hair so soft and shiny! Love all the products from this company.. Face hair and body!! And very reasonably priced. All products a little goes a long way. Love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, I love the smell and it makes your hair really nice.</li>
    <li> Everything about this shampoo is perfect. Nothing needs to be changed at all.</li>
    <li> I buy this all the time</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling shampoo on the planet. Not only that, but it is a quality product which is very healthy for your scalp and hair. Both my daughters love it. My oldest daughter says it smells like Brach&#x27;s Nougat candies. I think she nailed it. (runner up was &amp;#34;like a dreamsicle&amp;#34;) I highly recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Great smell and a small amount goes a long way.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is fragrant and cleans my hair without leaving buildup or residue.</li>
    <li> Smells FANTASTIC!  Keeps hair looking healthy during alternate washes.  We use this scent plus the lavender, whole family uses them.</li>
    <li> Makes my normally difficult hair feel soft</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have finally found a shampoo that eases my scaly itchy scalp while smelling lovely.  I also have the conditioner and love the combination.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this shampoo. I really did. But, when I first started using it a few months ago, it left my hair feeling like straw. What I didn&#x27;t realize then, was that this shampoo stripped off all the silicone my hair dressers and I have been dumping into my hair for years. After getting over the shock, I decided to educate myself, and wound up getting rid of most of my hair products that contained silicone in them. And my hair is healthier for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the organic ingredients, the philosophy and paying the farmers &amp; workers who are a part of growing the ingredients in this shampoo properly, and the smell is pretty great too~&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very much like a previous shampoo I had been using, which is viscous like syrup. The first wash lacks suds because it is cleaning your scalp, and then the second wash just erupts into bubbles, so be careful of how much you pour into your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great product, just not one I can see myself purchasing again for my hair type.</li>
    <li> This shampoo Isn&#x27;t all that natural. It contains sodium laurylglucosids and sodium methyl.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t lather very much, causing me to use more.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance smells like  Delsym cough syrup.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had frizzy hair, but this shampoo made it frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the conditioner too. My brush slid through my wet hair nicely without snagging it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I only like the conditioner, but I don&#x27;t know which product caused the frizz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently been trying to transition to natural/organic hair and facial products.  I have purchased several sets of shampoo and conditioners such as Acure and Chaacoco as I was not impressed. When I tried this shampoo along with the conditioner I was so pleased! My hair is moisturized and smells great.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo especially in combination with it&#x27;s conditioner. Makes our hair shine and super silky. Love the light scent and that it&#x27;s safe enough for our entire family. My daughter was having some strange reaction to a couple of other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos and conditioners that we were using - they would leave her hair so greasy it was as if she never washed it and I&#x27;d have to wash her hair with something else except that then it was drying her hair out so I&#x27;m really pleased to have found this product. We&#x27;ve been using it for several months now with no issues and her hair is so silky after the conditioner - I can&#x27;t speak highly enough of it&#x27;s performance.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have long red-brown curly prone-to-frizz hair that is a bit coarse and I am Caucasian. This shampoo works really great on my hair - keeps the frizz away and helps get me really pretty ringlets.  Smells wonderful as well.  I also use the conditioner and leave-on conditioner as well as a dab of Bumble &amp; Bumble curl-defining cream and it gets me fabulous hair!</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick and long hair. It&#x27;s hard for me to find a shampoo that lathers enough and works through my hair, while not making it dry and frizzy. I started trying argan oil products and this one has been fantastic. I don&#x27;t need to use as much as other shampoos and the argan oil makes my hair soft and shiny. I follow it up with conditioner and my crazy hair is totally manageable and smooth. I resorted to buying it online because every store I go to now - these are always sold out!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best plant based shampoo and conditioner I have used. In my quest for cutting chemicals out of my life, I have tried many natural/organic shampoos on the market. Many of them left my hair dull and sometimes it felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair at all!  Not to mention how difficult it was to manage and style after. Andalusia Naturals leaves my hair clean, soft, and easy to manage. I don&#x27;t think I will ever have the need to use a different brand ever again!!! Oh, and did I mention is smells heavenly!!!</li>
    <li> My new favorite shampoo!  My hair feels clean and I am happy knowing I am not using any products that are bad for me.</li>
    <li> Lovely shampoo!!!  Hair feels clean but not dried out, smooth and delicately fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a great deal.  Happy I tried it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars on the smell alone.  It washes hair and I like that it&#x27;s natural.  It smells like creamsicle!!!!!!</li>
