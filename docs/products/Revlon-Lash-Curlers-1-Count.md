      <li>If you&#x27;re new to curling your eyelashes, it&#x27;s easy to figure out and has good results.</li>
      <li>but it works just fine.</li>
      <li>For the basic thing, it worked great.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>I have used that method since I first bought my curler MANY years</li>
      <li>revlon beauty tools lash curler, curles my lashes great and love to use it everyday to go out or just stay home.</li>
      <li>One that will go close to your lid without pinching and do a nice natural looking curl.</li>
      <li>Will pay more for better one next time.</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;shield\\&quot; part on top that crimps your lashes is taller than normal and has a decorative embossed quilt pattern.</li>
      <li>The product came very quickly, and it works really well.</li>

      <li>so it&#x27;s a little hard for me to use just any curler, but this one is a good size and it works perfect for me.</li>

      <li>I have very straight lashes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this is my first time i do have a question, when should we replace the pads?</li>
      <li>This was my first time using an eyelash curler</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had better low end curlers for this price.  </li>
      <li>Good if you rarely use it, otherwise invest in a more expensive product.</li>
      <li>I use it every day and my eyelashes definitely look better.</li>
      <li>Search for Whiplash lash curler spend the extra money, and enjoy!</li>
      <li>Does not work very well!</li>
      <li>Finger grips came off during first use.</li>
      <li>but I feel this would be a similar problem for most women.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is my first eyelash curler ever.  </li>
      <li>, this one is better in that it leaves more room for your fingers, but it is also pops off if you squeeze too hard.  </li>
      <li>In my experience the top part of this curler is way too long.</li>
      <li>I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them.</li>
      <li>It gives your lashes a great curl for approximately 2hrs the first 2 months.</li>
      <li>that it&#x27;s easy to find replacement pads; of course the curler itself if made to last forever too!</li>
      <li>It seems to work fine -- I am a daily eyelash curler user for about 40 years now, so I&#x27;ve been through lots of them.  </li>
      <li>My lashes seem much longer after I use the curler.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very portable.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this curler</li>
      <li>but it works really well for me.</li>
      <li>I figured I just had really straight lashes.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>Since I could not find exactly what I needed, I opted to purchase a new lash curler.</li>
      <li>I thought this would be similar since it looks like my original Revlon one</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>When I took the rubber grip off figuring I&#x27;d never needed a cushion on my eyelash curlers before, it turns out that the metal handle is thinner than normal.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the slightly bent shape, the larger head, the silicone pads, or what, but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer.</li>
      <li>Do not care for the new style.</li>
      <li>The new design pinches and the silicon padding makes my eyes water.  </li>
      <li>and it cleans the curler pad like it&#x27;s new.</li>
      <li>So far, this receives high marks from her.</li>
      <li>Not what I had ordered I am a fan of the old revlon curler not the new ones they sell now</li>
      <li>This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I&#x27;ve previously owned</li>
      <li>It was a little bigger on top and had padded finger holes.</li>
      <li>and I never had problems with the old one (I lost it in a move).</li>
      <li>I still have my old one, but I needed the rubber piece to replace a worn out one.</li>
      <li>Looked old and rubber has rusted mark on it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to replace my old curler but wanted 2 curlers (one for my makeup at home and one for travel or purse).</li>
      <li>most complained about here.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GOOD GOOD GOOD! YOU LOVE IT</li>
    <li> Not the same as pictured but still an eyelash curler made by Revlon.</li>
    <li> MY EYES ARE SMALL, SO IT DOES NOT FIT MR EYES</li>
    <li> Short and sweet...this product worked perfectly. It gives a nice curve to your lashes and is light and durable. For the basic thing, it worked great.</li>
    <li> Happy with this lash curler. Certainly a bargain and does a good job. I bought this based on other reviews and the price and I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> It works, it&#x27;s cheap, the shipping is fast.  What more can I ask for?    :)  One press and your eyelashes will go up!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried two of these and both had the rubber liner fall out (and it is impossible to put back in where it stays in the correct position). Then after putting the rubber liner back in, it cut my lashes! Stay away from this one!</li>
    <li> Does not work very well!</li>
    <li> This curler does not hurt your eye when you curl your eye lashes and it opens up your eyes to be able to see better too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a very large person (5&#x27; 2&amp;quot; tall) and my face is similarly proportioned.  By the looks of this eyelash curler, it was made for someone about twice my size.  I can&#x27;t even reach my eyelashes with it, rendering it useless.</li>
    <li> I think the eyelash curler is great, but where does one find the replacement parts.  Is Revlon trying to get us to buy another eyelash curler?  Do I need to switch to another brand?  Help!</li>
    <li> It does the job, so I have no complaints. I will buy it again, when the current one wears out.</li>
    <li> Not what I had ordered I am a fan of the old revlon curler not the new ones they sell now and the pic showed what I was looking for but I was shipped something different ,,,beware</li>
    <li> Certainly not like their old lash curler. I still have my old one, but I needed the rubber piece to replace a worn out one. Since I could not find exactly what I needed, I opted to purchase a new lash curler. Do not care for the new style. It does not curl eyelashes like the old one. The picture above shows the old one, not the new style.</li>
    <li> Very bad. Opened and torn pack. Looked old and rubber has rusted mark on it.</li>
    <li> I actually had trouble finding these in the regular stores to replace my old pair which must have been at least 10 years old!&lt;br /&gt;I went online; very reasonably priced and they worked great!</li>
    <li> As good as eyelash curlers can be.</li>
    <li> The one I received was not like the one pictured. It was a little bigger on top and had padded finger holes. It is a little bit bigger than my old one but it works just fine. I finally threw out the old one and made the switch to this one. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Out of all the eyelash curlers I have tried this one is the one that has been doing a great job. I have big eyes and natural long and full eyelashes so it&#x27;s a little hard for me to use just any curler, but this one is a good size and it works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> It gives your lashes a great curl for approximately 2hrs the first 2 months. Afterwards the curl doesn&#x27;t last very long and you have to squeeze the curler longer.  Good if you rarely use it, otherwise invest in a more expensive product.</li>
    <li> I constantly search for the perfect curler. One that will go close to your lid without pinching and do a nice natural looking curl. This one was flimsy and the lash bridge was thin. It feels like you are going to slice off your lashes and also pinches when you try toget close.</li>
    <li> I have a Revlon eyelash curler from several years ago that is wonderful and this is not similar. I didn&#x27;t need to replace my old curler but wanted 2 curlers (one for my makeup at home and one for travel or purse). I thought this would be similar since it looks like my original Revlon one but it is not at all. The handle for your fingers is very awkward- I&#x27;m talking it&#x27;s hard for me to use because the handles are so spread out and slide together weirdly. I am a fairly petite woman but I feel this would be a similar problem for most women. The handles themselves are at an awkward angle so it&#x27;s weird trying to move the curler to get your eyelashes in it. I literally thought I was going to hurt my eye trying it. Very disappointing - just going to stick to my one curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself seemed well made and had extra curler pads. I guess that&#x27;s nice if you replace them but I never do - I just use baby oil (buy small travel size at Target) to get the mascara off then rinse with hand soap and water. Then I thoroughly dry before using. I have used that method since I first bought my curler MANY years and it cleans the curler pad like it&#x27;s new. No need to waste money on replacements and it curls just as great as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this curler for anyone. Seems like Revlon tried to improve their curler but it&#x27;s been at the expense of making it difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Does not curl. Finger grips came off during first use. Threw away immediately.  I&#x27;ve had better low end curlers for this price.  Will pay more for better one next time.</li>
    <li> These are terrific!  Great quality and easy to use.  No pain.  Longer lashes.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
    <li> This was my first time using an eyelash curler and i was very satisfied with it. it curled them so beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Although this is my first time i do have a question, when should we replace the pads? What happens if you dont replace them?</li>
    <li> The black filler is too bulky and doesn&#x27;t curl as well. You just need to press a little harder :/</li>
    <li> I was expecting something better for the price. The quality of this product is same as the one sold in 99 cents store.</li>
    <li> My eyelashes aren&#x27;t particularly short, but they do go straight outwards so are very hard to see. The curler is a very good buy for the price and works great and it&#x27;s very portable. I use it every day and my eyelashes definitely look better.</li>
    <li> These work very nicely and fit my eyes just fine. They do their job, giving my lashes a lovely curl - what else is there to say?</li>
    <li> The item I received was for a different curler with a black insert and black grips on the handle.  It pinched my eyelid.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who thinks her lashes need a little help, she likes it so far.  I had to give her some pointers to not actually cut the eyelashes off.  So far, this receives high marks from her. Easy to use even for a beginner.</li>
    <li> not all lashcurlers are the same... and definitely will pull out your lashes if you don&#x27;t use it correctly!  i like that it&#x27;s easy to find replacement pads; of course the curler itself if made to last forever too!</li>
    <li> I have very straight lashes. This curler does the job okay, but for me it doesn&#x27;t work great. I wish it would curl my lashes more naturally.</li>
    <li> top of the line in company and in products for i always like to have some cosmetic products to help bring out my best attributes.</li>
    <li> This is not as pictured. I ordered 5 of these because I thought they were the old curlers in the picture (white pads and non-padded handle). They were not!! They need to update this picture</li>
    <li> I have had this product for two months, and I use it daily. It gives my eyelashes a perfect finishing touch, and makes them look noticeably longer. I have no complaints at all about this curler. I love it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  I used to use all the time and now that my lashes are &amp;#34;thinning&amp;#34;, I wanted to get another lash curler to make lashes appear to have more volume.</li>
    <li> Good quality not expensive compared to other brands</li>
    <li> The product came very quickly, and it works really well. My lashes seem much longer after I use the curler.</li>
    <li> In my experience the top part of this curler is way too long. It hurt my eyes and left indents. I gave mine away to a friend who has bulging eyes and she is the only person this has worked for.&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, I have found the holy grail of curlers!! Search for Whiplash lash curler spend the extra money, and enjoy!</li>
    <li> It works but not like Maybelene</li>
    <li> This is not what I ordered.... I ordered a Revlon lash curler... And it&#x27;s very uncomfortable and not great, to say the least I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> First, other reviewers are correct that what is pictured is not what you&#x27;ll receive. The shape is different, the handles aren&#x27;t the same shape, the pads are silicon rather than the rubber we&#x27;re used to, etc. It threw me for a moment... but then I used the curlers. I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them. This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I&#x27;ve previously owned so I don&#x27;t care that they aren&#x27;t what is pictured. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the slightly bent shape, the larger head, the silicone pads, or what, but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> This is my first eyelash curler ever.  It&#x27;s simple to use and it works.  I was really worried due to the negative comments, but I don&#x27;t seem to be having any of the issues most complained about here.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because I have no frame of reference.  If you&#x27;re new to curling your eyelashes, it&#x27;s easy to figure out and has good results.</li>
    <li> My wife asked for these for Christmas - amongst other things. She was a very pleased lady to pull these out of her stocking. So that makes me happy, her happy and your spouse happy too.</li>
    <li> I have had better lash curlers.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this curler but it didn&#x27;t really do a good job curling my lashes. I figured I just had really straight lashes. I have used this for a few months and now I have no eyelashes. The Revlon curler guillotined my eyelashes. Cut them right off. I just tossed this in the trash today as I am not going down this road again. I understand it takes about 60 days to grow out eyelashes and I will just use falsies until they grow back in. This is my second Revlon curler and I never had problems with the old one (I lost it in a move). If you decide to use this, just be real careful.</li>
    <li> my daughter loved this very much.  I would highly recommend this to other girls....</li>
    <li> this is like a baby lash curler, or 1\2 a lash curler. Maybe for those odd women who curl their daughters eyelashes to place in in beaut. pagents.</li>
    <li> Not what I received. Shouldn&#x27;t show picture if that is not exact item. Had been looking for this model from revelon as it is no longer available in stores as they came out with another type which is terrible and doesn&#x27;t work and that is what I received.  Futhermore to make matters worse, I sent email to get authorization to send back and never received a response. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>
    <li> Very comfortable, easy to use, good brand. Curls lashes well.  Rubber tip stays soft for a very long time.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> It seems to work fine -- I am a daily eyelash curler user for about 40 years now, so I&#x27;ve been through lots of them.  Like most faithful users, I am still outraged over the switch from rubber pads to silicon pads.  My old Revlon eyelash curler got slightly crushed a year ago and hasn&#x27;t been the same since, so I thought -- how silly to fuss with this, just get a new one.  But this one is someone&#x27;s attempt at a \\&quot;deluxe\\&quot; version.  The \\&quot;shield\\&quot; part on top that crimps your lashes is taller than normal and has a decorative embossed quilt pattern. The finger holes have an added rubber grip meant to cushion your fingers.  Similar to the rubbery cushion on some other brand&#x27;s models, this one is better in that it leaves more room for your fingers, but it is also pops off if you squeeze too hard.  When I took the rubber grip off figuring I&#x27;d never needed a cushion on my eyelash curlers before, it turns out that the metal handle is thinner than normal.  So it cuts in a little when you grip without the extra cushion.  Again -- why couldn&#x27;t they leave a perfectly good product alone???</li>
    <li> revlon beauty tools lash curler, curles my lashes great and love to use it everyday to go out or just stay home.</li>
    <li> Always have used revlon they are the absolut most dependable make up source around. Just watch out, you might pinch your lids!</li>
    <li> Perfect item and perfectly priced! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s not outstanding or anything but it works really well for me. Really pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Terrible! The new design pinches and the silicon padding makes my eyes water.  I&#x27;ve used Revlon Lash Curlers for years, but never again!</li>
    <li> I bought this with visions of curly lashes.  Alas, I am not as excited about the results as I thought I would be.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed. Do not buy. The picture is not what you are going to receive. The one that I got is very uncomfortable and does not work.</li>
