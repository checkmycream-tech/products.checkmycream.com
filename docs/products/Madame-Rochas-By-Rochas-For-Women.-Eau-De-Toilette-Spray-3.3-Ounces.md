      <li>I would not recommend it to anyone that had the original!</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t to strong adn</li>
      <li>Like the Fahrenheit from Dior, one of those, strong and unique.</li>
      <li>I enjoy it</li>
      <li>Even with a light spray and a mist walk-through, aldehydes are all I smelled for a couple hours.</li>
      <li>It reeks of cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
      <li>This is a nice parfume for a older woman&lt;br /&gt;didnt</li>
      <li>This product has completely meet our expectations, we like it and we will remain loyal to it like good friends</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s a a sip from the original one.</li>
      <li>Timeless parfum for special ladies</li>
      <li>True to the scent of Madame Rochas.  </li>

      <li>This Madame rochas is nothing like the one my husband got me when we were first married!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon for making Christmas shopping so much easier!</li>

      <li>I have discovered that classic fragrances are released on a cycle.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a classic one from Rochas.</li>
      <li>However, the aldehydes were far too much for me to handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never smelt the original, and apparently the new formula is the victim of cost-cutting.</li>
      <li>mother used it when she was young till now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a steal , we recommend buy it.</li>
      <li>It is a classy, timeless fragrance.</li>
      <li>near what it used to be.</li>
      <li>His was my favorite in the late 70s!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the same as the old one perfume you remember from 80s.</li>
      <li>Soft, simple fragrance.  </li>

    <li> This Madame rochas is nothing like the one my husband got me when we were first married! I was really disappointed in it. I would not recommend it to anyone that had the original!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a a sip from the original one. The smell is the same but it evaporates in 10 minutes. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars just because I used it as car perfume.</li>
    <li> Have used Madame Rochas for many, many years. It is a classy, timeless fragrance. I did not find any change in the scent. Hope it will never be discontinued.</li>

Now owned by Procter&amp;Gamble and is being&lt;br /&gt;discontinued ??? Yeah throw away the classics and bring on the obnoxious&lt;br /&gt;man made toxins of today ... yeah ....progress</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a classic one from Rochas. It last all day and even after shower. Like the Fahrenheit from Dior, one of those, strong and unique.</li>
