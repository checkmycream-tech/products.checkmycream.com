      <li>It is much lighter for day use but equally as amazing.     </li>

      <li>I have sensitive skin and most products I try will cause me to break out or cause irritation, redness, or dryness.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for day use if you have to put make up on right away, but if you don&#x27;t have anywhere to be and have time let it sink into your skin</li>
      <li>perfectly safe and non irritating ( the products for dry eyes like genteal are made from sterilised mineral oil and vaseline only, so this is a very safe and gentle and cheap to boot awesome way to intensly hydrate your face.</li>

      <li>I am not too sure those are qualities I want in my facial moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The one soaked in water was soft and smooth after but the one soaked in vaseline was unchanged which shows its the water if first applied to the skin which will be retained if the moisturiser is applied after.</li>
      <li>When I first saw this balm and its ingredients I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>Either way, this is my staple for a deep moisturizer :)</li>
      <li>i first put it in my hand</li>
      <li>When I do need to get ready right away</li>
      <li>100% pure healing balm.  </li>
      <li>I like all 100% Pure products.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I get allergic to most facial creams out there.</li>
      <li>I am a big fan of this brand, I have their nourishing facial oil which is better than those hottie tottie stuff at the fancy dept stores with the snotty uptight snobby counter creeps----great for the MT winters!</li>
      <li>and I actually have noticed my fine lines improving.</li>
      <li>It is very oily</li>
      <li>Very concentrated.</li>
      <li>I have not broken out at all with this product</li>
      <li>You have to really work it into your skin.</li>
      <li>I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>this fixes the white glob problem and the water ( i learned years ago) is important for any moisturiser to work</li>
      <li>but you don&#x27;t use much.  </li>
      <li>I get the feeling they are all extra special.</li>
      <li>I really wish this balm worked for me since it has all those natural ingredients that are full of anti-oxidants.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of lavender is strong to say the least.</li>
      <li>Its more of an occasional dry skin therapy or a night time</li>
      <li>I always look around and try new things though</li>
      <li>I have dry skin and pretty much no wrinkles thank God</li>
      <li>If I take a small amount and rub between fingers it does soften a bit so that I can put it in my face better.</li>
      <li>Am anxious to try more 100%Pure products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at the 1-star reviews, but I have heard some who are new to using natural skin products will go through a detox period, which may explain the breakouts.</li>
      <li>I use 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s Organic Acai Berry Antioxidant Facial Cream.</li>
      <li>Nice to find product without all the chemicals, and it is very moisturizing, a little goes a long long way.</li>
      <li>My skin feels and looks soft and supple.     </li>
      <li>Arrived before I finished the old one, but when I opened it there were granules in the product.</li>
      <li>I love this organic thick cream.</li>
      <li>I love the lavender smell and thick texture.</li>
      <li>I first received this moisturizer in the winter when the air was extremely dry.</li>
      <li>Especially in winter when my face is super dry.</li>
      <li>Oh, and you don&#x27;t need much product for each use so it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>Instead to give myself a greasy natural overnight treatment i mix a little mineral oil (baby oil minus the fragrance) with vaseline and put it on a freshly scrubbed (i scrub with sugar or very gently with a pumice stone) face while damp</li>
      <li>It goes on a little greasy but that goes away quickly.</li>
      <li>100% pure was the only brand that seem to use similar ingredients.</li>
      <li>It might be a little too greasy for the face, but is good for dry rough areas like the back or your hands.</li>
      <li>It is very greasy and I use it where I use to have dry spots on my skin</li>
      <li>Smells wonderfully natural and light, slightly greasy which is expected.  </li>
      <li>I right now am so over this grossly globby mess.</li>
      <li>I initially wanted to order a balm by the new Korean brand \\&quot;skinfood\\&quot;, but decided to see if there were similar products that were made and shipped locally.</li>
      <li>Even though its a bit thick and oily, it a super duper skin hydration.</li>
      <li>but because this is an all natural product and orgainc to boot and gives my dry skin such a moisture boost i forgive it.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical about this product though; It was cheap and I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but it was worth trying.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It depends what you will be using this product for.  It is a small bottle but you don&#x27;t use much.  It is very greasy and I use it where I use to have dry spots on my skin and I want to keep them moisturized.  I really like the product.  Just remember to put your finger in the jar very carefully.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> 100% pure healing balm.  It does a good job.  I probably should have given it 5 stars, except it&#x27;s gritty.</li>
    <li> I just got this balm today and I am already amazed at the results.I initially wanted to order a balm by the new Korean brand \\&quot;skinfood\\&quot;, but decided to see if there were similar products that were made and shipped locally. 100% pure was the only brand that seem to use similar ingredients. I was a little skeptical about this product though; It was cheap and I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand before, but it was worth trying.&lt;br /&gt; I have very sensitive skin, so I get allergic to most facial creams out there. This product did not give me a reaction. In fact, it cleared up all the red spots I had for months in just a couple of hours. I love the lavender smell and thick texture. My only concern would be using it during the summer. It&#x27;s a bit greasy. Not the type of moisturizer you can use with foundation either. Its more of an occasional dry skin therapy or a night time cream.&lt;br /&gt; I love it though, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this product...smell is lovely, if you like lavender. Very concentrated. A little goes a long way. Am using it on my face, along w/ tamanu oil, which helps make the balm more spreadable, after surgery to help w/ scars and skin health. Am anxious to try more 100%Pure products. I get the feeling they are all extra special.</li>
    <li> I love this company and I LOVE this product. I am 28 years old and am just noticing some fine lines around my eyes. I have been looking for a night cream that does not make me break out. I tried Oil of Olay Regenerist and was not happy with it, amongst many other products. I got little bumps on my face and my skin still felt dry by the morning. After doing research on many many products and reading on organic vs non organic I realized that the cause of clogged poors is because of all the fillers used in non organic products, not to mention they are way overpriced.     So, after reading reviews and researching as many Organic products I decided to try this one. The price was right and the reviews were great. I am glad I did because this product feels fabulous. It is really thick which is what I like because I want to feel like my face is being moisturized. It goes on a little greasy but that goes away quickly. I have not broken out at all with this product and I actually have noticed my fine lines improving. My skin feels and looks soft and supple.     I first received this moisturizer in the winter when the air was extremely dry. Because it felt so good and my skin literally drank the moisture, I decided to try it during the day too. It did go on greasy like I said but that went away with in about 30 min. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for day use if you have to put make up on right away, but if you don&#x27;t have anywhere to be and have time let it sink into your skin it is great. Make up goes on great over this product once your skin has absorbed it.     When I do need to get ready right away I use 100 Percent Pure&#x27;s Organic Acai Berry Antioxidant Facial Cream. It is much lighter for day use but equally as amazing.     Oh, and you don&#x27;t need much product for each use so it lasts a long time. Most products say this but in this case it is true!</li>
    <li> Nice to find product without all the chemicals, and it is very moisturizing, a little goes a long long way.</li>
    <li> This product was everything I was looking for - organic, great smell, definitely does moisturize. Only thing I took off a star for was the texture - it is kind of granular and difficult to spread (although I would imagine this is probably due to the fact that there are no &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; chemicals in this....small price to pay I guess!). If I take a small amount and rub between fingers it does soften a bit so that I can put it in my face better. Just be forewarned that you cannot take a scoop and rub on your face, you almost have to do small 1-2&amp;#34; square patches of your face at a time to get good coverage.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this brand, I have their nourishing facial oil which is better than those hottie tottie stuff at the fancy dept stores with the snotty uptight snobby counter creeps----great for the MT winters!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and most products I try will cause me to break out or cause irritation, redness, or dryness. This moisturizer is amazing because it does none of those awful things, and I believe it&#x27;s due to it being all-natural. It is very oily so I use it at night and tie my hair back so it won&#x27;t stick to my face. By the morning, my skin and neck feel amazing. The consistency is a little thick so I feel I use a lot of the product, but I only use it twice a week to stretch my money. I&#x27;m really surprised at the 1-star reviews, but I have heard some who are new to using natural skin products will go through a detox period, which may explain the breakouts. Either way, this is my staple for a deep moisturizer :)</li>
    <li> Very good for the winter for the chapped and dry skin. This would be way to thick for summer time and you definitely can only wear it at night.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this balm and its ingredients I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I only used it as a night cream because it is way to oily to be used during the day. Every time I use it I got terrible zits even though the ingredients are free of harsh chemicals and artificial stuff. I really wish this balm worked for me since it has all those natural ingredients that are full of anti-oxidants.&lt;br /&gt;The smell of lavender is strong to say the least. When I received it in the mail and opened it, the smell was so strong that it hit me in the head right away. I actually got a head ache. Perhaps that is what is causing the acne--the lavender.</li>
    <li> I love this organic thick cream. I use it mostly for super overnight moisture on my hands, elbows and also dab on lips. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve used other products, but realized over the years that this is the balm that works for me, actually puts some moisture back into &amp;#34;dish water&amp;#34; hands. I&#x27;ll dab a tiny bit on my face in the winter as needs by rubbing a tiny bit between my palms and tapping or placing my hands on my face. It gives winter protection from chaffing.</li>
    <li> Even though its a bit thick and oily, it a super duper skin hydration. Especially in winter when my face is super dry. I use it at night before bed! and no nasty chemicals!</li>
    <li> This balm is gritty. You have to really work it into your skin. I would never use this around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  BUT, the balm is too thick for a face moisturizer.  If they softened it just a bit, it would be perfect!  You sometimes get chunks and have to rub them into your skin...should be creamy.  Smells wonderfully natural and light, slightly greasy which is expected.  I will use the jar and maybe purchase a different product from their line next time.</li>
    <li> Arrived before I finished the old one, but when I opened it there were granules in the product. I tried to return, but was past the thirty day return. The granules didn&#x27;t cause any problems, but were annoying.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m addicted to neutrogena light night cream and have used that for day and night for over a decade. I always look around and try new things though and i love natural things so i tried this and although it is waaay too greasy for daytime use and impossible to use under makeup it is fantastic for nightime use. I have dry skin and pretty much no wrinkles thank God and i started using retin a 2 nights a week at night and this cream the rest of the nights and when i am at home during the day without makeup. It does have 1 annoying flaw though..I does not go on smooth...it is like there are peices of it that are hardened and you have to smush them or else when you put it on you will see little white globs on your face..I would normally never use a product like that but because this is an all natural product and orgainc to boot and gives my dry skin such a moisture boost i forgive it. The way i use it is a bit different than i do any other moisturiser which i&#x27;d just smear on..Buty this product because of the globbies in it i first put it in my hand then wet my fingers with water and rub it a bit until all the globbies get smushed then put it on my face..this fixes the white glob problem and the water ( i learned years ago) is important for any moisturiser to work and thats why it should always be applied to a damp face. I once saw a research article which to this day guides me on my moisturiser applicateion and is why i always use it on wet skin..The experiment was taking a cuticle skin and soaking it in water..and another one and soaking it in vaseline for a week. The one soaked in water was soft and smooth after but the one soaked in vaseline was unchanged which shows its the water if first applied to the skin which will be retained if the moisturiser is applied after. Applying a moisturiser to dry skin doesn&#x27;t make the skin less dry but watering it first does. Sorry for the long review but this info has served me so well that i wanted to share it.UPDATE: I give up..This has these little globbies that if i am  alone in the house i can tolerate but i can no longer deal with these white blobs all over my face and neck...If someone comes to the door I have to mad dash to a mirror and try and squish all these globbies into my skin or it looks horrible and I had to get the door the other day and couldn&#x27;t for the life of me squish them all so had to explain (lie) to the delivery man that I had an oatmeal mask on my face..that was the last straw with this item! Instead to give myself a greasy natural overnight treatment i mix a little mineral oil (baby oil minus the fragrance) with vaseline and put it on a freshly scrubbed (i scrub with sugar or very gently with a pumice stone) face while damp and it is the most increadible soft (no globbies) result even using the retin a...and it is safe to put right on your eyelids and under your eyes..perfectly safe and non irritating ( the products for dry eyes like genteal are made from sterilised mineral oil and vaseline only, so this is a very safe and gentle and cheap to boot awesome way to intensly hydrate your face. I right now am so over this grossly globby mess. I wonder how much costlier it would be for the company to just spin this around a few xtra times that they have to sell it this way.</li>
    <li> This healing balm is extremely moisturizing, especially for the hands.  It might be a little too greasy for the face, but is good for dry rough areas like the back or your hands.</li>
    <li> I like all 100% Pure products. This one, however, is not atop my list. It is very thick and grainy. I am not too sure those are qualities I want in my facial moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dry face but it caused breakouts after one night. This product is not for me. I wish I could return it.</li>
