      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many months now, and will continue to enjoy the results!</li>
      <li>However, I am not at all satisfied.</li>
      <li>more bottles today, 9-15-12.  </li>
      <li>keeps my eyes wrinkle free almost all day!</li>
      <li>but with no results I will use some more and see if I can get better results</li>

      <li>This is wonderful - no puffy bags under the eyes when using this - it takes very little and truly is magic!</li>
      <li>Absolutely ingenious product temporarily takes away fine lines and puffiness.</li>
      <li>Took roller ball top off and bottle was filled.</li>
      <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t have the right kind of wrinkles.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this works the best</li>
      <li>It hides fine wrinkles and darkness under your eyes for the day.  </li>
      <li>the price was cheap.</li>
      <li>it lightly by \\&quot;TAPPING\\</li>
      <li>You get more than your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
      <li>so you look fabulous on the wedding pics.</li>
      <li>THEY&#x27;RE PUTTING WAY TOOOOO MUCH ON !!!  </li>
      <li>but I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>Worth a try!</li>
      <li>Lasts most of an 8 hour day, remains about 75% effective up to 12 hours if my skin is prepped properly (no moisturizer, foundation, powder, toner, etc in the application area.  </li>
      <li>I am happy with product, but my results seem more subtle than most experience.  </li>
      <li>and it actually made my fine lines look more prominent.</li>
      <li>It &#x27;s a cool feeling .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I apply it in my car, with a/c going full blast</li>
      <li>Less is best, if you apply too much it leaves a chalky residue on your skin.</li>
      <li>Strange applicator, good product.</li>
      <li>I would say not for overly baggy eyes, but great for allergy puffy eyes and slight lines</li>
      <li>Oh well...it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>But, since I&#x27;m in the business of helping people stay young and healthy, I like to try competing anti-aging products</li>
      <li>Keep trying and be patient, you will learn how to use the right amount.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin, and a little of Gone</li>
      <li>Then I put the top back on.  </li>
      <li>If deep lines nit sure how it will work.  </li>
      <li>My sister first purchased it for me.</li>
      <li>definitely reduces wrinkles for most of the day.</li>
      <li>does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>Do exactly like I said; USE THE Q-TIP.  </li>
      <li>Works pretty well.</li>
      <li>I used the hair dryer and went exactly by the instructions.</li>
      <li>Really does work as advertised!  </li>
      <li>The first one didnt work</li>
      <li>Again, key is to be sure to not over apply, or re-apply.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
      <li>If you have to re-apply during the day, I recommend rinsing and drying the area first.</li>
      <li>but it goes a long way and simply put its cheap but effective .</li>
      <li>Good for traveling too because the bottle is small so there is no problem going thru security at the airport.</li>
      <li>I find the best way to apply it is to put a finger on my cheekbone and pull down slightly to open up my under eye wrinkles and then with the other hand, use a fingertip to tap the product lightly onto the whole under eye area and around my crows feet.  </li>
      <li>Better than a facelift, cost alot less and is not dangerous.</li>
      <li>Instead of plumping out any deep lines I (don&#x27;t) have, this did NOT fill in my fine mesh-like &amp;#34;laugh lines.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I first came upon this particular product years ago.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted it to work</li>
      <li>Based on the reasonable price, I thought this might not work</li>
      <li>If you use too much it cakes (which they warn you about)</li>
      <li>and you don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
      <li>This product works really well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to speak of.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much product at all so even though you won&#x27;t see any difference immediately, don&#x27;t be tempted to use too much.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have fine wrinkles starting criws feet starting no botox.  This does in fact temporary erase lines .  Be careful nit to put to much it will leave a white thin film if you do.  A little water pat on to eliminate.  Follow instructions.  If deep lines nit sure how it will work.  My eyes looked refreshed open used on eye misunderstood brow area too.I lilike For a quick fix perfect.</li>
    <li> Great for under the eye wrinkles.</li>
    <li> This product I didn&#x27;t like at all. As the day went on after using it, it turned white and flaked. I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all, I threw mine in the trash.</li>
    <li> Well, uh huh. At least it does not leave streaks and discoloration as some other firming products do.  It is expensive for how much the tube contains and the tube most often falters at delivery.</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work but hate to say that it did absolutely nothing for me. It goes on transparent but later it turns white around the edges where it was applied.  Also it does not feel natural on the face. It feels like a thin mask.</li>
    <li> When you use this  product be careful to use a small amount. Also use a blow dryer on low and cool until it&#x27;s dry. If you don&#x27;t the product flakes when you put on the rest of your make up. This is not good especially when your the make up artist!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s face glue waste of money...</li>
    <li> Arrived 3 days ago..used it 2 days and tried to, the third day, nothing is in the bottle!! It&#x27;s empty..Shook it to see if that would help, nope. Can&#x27;t open roller top to see if anything is left inside. Waste of my money and not worth the money to ship it back. So, I have no idea how good this product is or isn&#x27;t....    UPDATE...  Took roller ball top off and bottle was filled. So not empty as at first thought. Item is OK and does some \\&quot;lifting\\&quot;, but........Will change to 4 STARS.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t find this product to perform as I hoped, but wrinkles are relentless.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> I have seen products come and go with great Claims, I Have been is show biz since I was 16 years old, So yes I own my fair sized share of Vanity. I just turned 55 last month, I have seen this product on T.V., the set seemed open and honest ...No Smoke or mirrors...just a great approach, friends sitting around with each other waiting to see what one of there friends had discovered. Well the short of it, after applying this product to each one of them, there is a clock ticking away to reach it&#x27;s 60 second mark.........If I did not watch it for myself, My mind would have started looking for the scam....But you know what...No Scam. So I ordered it, got it in the mail like 2 days later, And It&#x27;s a good thing I play keyboards, Because I am doing a standing Ovation as I type. This Product is Everything the company says it is..I am sold I will Re-order over and over. And if you want to make your self look 10 + years younger this is FOR YOU. Hey this works and it last about 7 to 8 hours.....Love it :)</li>
    <li> When I need to look younger this is the best creme out there!!!! U place it on ur face and use ur fingers , then it sounds nuts but it works apply a hairdryer on your face so it dries. It will make u look 10 years younger. I guarzantee it!!</li>
    <li> This product instantly smooths wrinkles.  I use it everyday.  It hides fine wrinkles and darkness under your eyes for the day.  Have used it for about a year, everyday.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Just not happy with the application process  definitely reduces wrinkles for most of the day. Less is best, if you apply too much it leaves a chalky residue on your skin.</li>
    <li> It works, but less is better, it only takes a small amount, otherwise,you get visable residue.</li>
    <li> leaves white lines on your face! thought would be nice as the aminogenesis filler, did not turn out as hoped.</li>
    <li> works good no white resI due</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive this product after reading some really great reviews. However, I am not at all satisfied. I followed the directions exactly and it actually made my fine lines look more prominent. Another one of those \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; products but I had to give it a try.</li>
    <li> The first one didnt work So i bough thé 2 pack one improved still doesnot work i do not recommendwaist of money false adverstiment</li>
    <li> It actually works!!!  Lasts for hours and works under makeup. My sister first purchased it for me. Does not have dried \\&quot;egg white\\&quot; effect that some products do.  I have reordered!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, it does erase the wrinkle for few hours, too bad that it leaves a white layer that looks like skin peeling off.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  My under eye wrinkles and crows feet literally do disappear within a few seconds, giving me a much more rested and youthful look.  I agree that the rollerball isn&#x27;t the easiest to use as it&#x27;s difficult to squeeze out the right amount, which results in too much product being used.  So like many other reviewers, I just remove it.  There&#x27;s usually enough product on the bottom of the rollerball &#x27;cork&#x27; for one use.  I find the best way to apply it is to put a finger on my cheekbone and pull down slightly to open up my under eye wrinkles and then with the other hand, use a fingertip to tap the product lightly onto the whole under eye area and around my crows feet.  You don&#x27;t need much product at all so even though you won&#x27;t see any difference immediately, don&#x27;t be tempted to use too much.  Release the skin and allow to dry - with or without a hairdryer it takes less than a minute. Trying to put anything over it, even powder, seems to undo the effect and actually makes wrinkles look more pronounced, so it should be the last thing you do.  Put on all your makeup, even lipstick, and fix your hair.  THEN put on this product so you can keep your face still while it dries.  After drying, you will feel a tight sensation in that area, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable.  And unlike that other similar and way more expensive product (PTR brand), it does not go crusty or leave a white residue.  Even with daily use, my first bottle lasted over 3 months and I am so happy with it, I just ordered another 4.  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> My skin is still relatively young looking but my eyes can appear somewhat tired with a few faint lines. I tried light application, medium application, heavy application and with and without a blow dryer. I tried popping off the roller balls and using a Q- tip as suggested by another reviewer. No matter what there was absolutely NO difference whatsoever. Don&#x27;t waste your money as I did!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used.  So much better than another product I was using at 3 times the cost.  A little goes a long way.  some have complained that the rollor balls don&#x27;t work, I remove the top and use a special brush, this allows me to apply it whereever I need it.  You get more than your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
    <li> This product is like Elmers glue... It goes on...lines disappear as it&#x27;s drying...feels and looks like glue.... you think it&#x27;s working... then you put makeup on.. or touch it... and it peals off in little flakes that look like skin pealing.  Should know that nothing short of surgery is going to work.  oh well... lesson learned!</li>
    <li> What a waste of money, did NOTHING, and I tried it on several people</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to see anything when I use this except I get white residue even using the blow dryer I followed the tips on reviews but with no results I will use some more and see if I can get better results</li>
    <li> Its like a fountain of youth in this lil bottle. I swear by this stuff. I have spent SOOOooo much money over the years looking for something that actually works and dont leave them white cakey lines and after cr*p on my face. I will always be grateful for this stuff, just too bad it dont come in a larger container.</li>
    <li> I would not be without this. I use all the time.</li>
    <li> This product does not work.  It is hard to apply and I don&#x27;t think it does a thing. I had hoped!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I actually expected this to do, as at 50 I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to speak of. Tiny elevens and couple slight forehead furrows when I am stressed are really all I can see. But, since I&#x27;m in the business of helping people stay young and healthy, I like to try competing anti-aging products so I can recommend the best products with a good conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this weird goo just leaves a funny residue on the skin, without &amp;#34;filling&amp;#34; or improving the look of fine lines in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the other reviews and tips to see if I was applying incorrectly. Still no positive results. Well, at least I know what NOT to recommend, right?</li>
    <li> Works very well, but the dispenser design is poor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and this works the best so I guess I&#x27;ll stick with it until I find a better one.</li>
    <li> It really does even though it temporary. The moment you put it on you see the difference. Better than a facelift, cost alot less and is not dangerous.</li>
    <li> Was not happy with this product at all.  I&#x27;ve tried using it for over a week now without any visible results.  Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t accept returns which I think is wrong, even drug stores accept returns on make up and any other beauty product if you&#x27;re not satisfied with it. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> Its does work and the price was cheap. .5 oz doesn&#x27;t last very long, if there was a larger amount I would&lt;br /&gt;order it. Good Stuff</li>
    <li> This stuff works! I take the silver ball top off and apply with a q-tip. It seems to work better and you don&#x27;t need as much.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  I use it for those lines in between the brows.  It says it is best used with a hair dryer. I apply it in my car, with a/c going full blast and I pull the skin taut while it &amp;#34;sets.&amp;#34;  Also, just use a small dab.  If you have a chalky residue it means you have used too much.</li>
    <li> It works great.  As long as you use it sparingly it&#x27;s a miracle worker</li>
    <li> Absolutely ingenious product temporarily takes away fine lines and puffiness. Definitely gone in 60 Seconds. Essential for mothers of the bride/groom so you look fabulous on the wedding pics. Buy it you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> This is wonderful - no puffy bags under the eyes when using this - it takes very little and truly is magic!</li>
    <li> No effect except to feel a tightness on the area applied. Left crusty residue, no matter how little or much used.</li>
    <li> It works, but doesn&#x27;t last all day.  If you use too much it cakes (which they warn you about) If you have to re-apply during the day, I recommend rinsing and drying the area first. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I used this product like instructed and my face did not do what the demo video did. It showed the women on the video applying the eye cream to her eyes and it took her wrinkles away. I even tried the blow dryer like it instructs and that didn&#x27;t work? I keep trying hoping it will work. No such luck so far.</li>
    <li> Based on the reasonable price, I thought this might not work but it does...leaves a smooth, dry finish on the skin. I notice the effect does not last as long as some of the more expensive line smoothers but I was not disappointed. Worth a try!</li>
    <li> I am happy with product, but my results seem more subtle than most experience.  Hate the rollerball applicator. Have taken it off, as another reviewer suggested.</li>
    <li> I love it My friend recommend this product to me It does lighten your dark spots under your eyes I like this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every product, spending BIG $$$$$&#x27;s This is by far the best ever. Just use a small amount. I take off the roller ball off and use my finger to to apply a very small amount, then use my blow dryer (on low) for about a minute. Amazing is all I can say. People who write bad reviews are not using this correctly. Keep trying and be patient, you will learn how to use the right amount. If you don&#x27;t love it you probably are not using most of your face products correctly.</li>
    <li> I first came upon this particular product years ago.  It was just something I thought I would try.  Well I didn and I&#x27;ve never gone&lt;br /&gt;without it since.  It&#x27;s  a &amp;#34;  miracle  &amp;#34; in a small bottle.  Just a little bit goes a long way.  You can put it on before you put  your&lt;br /&gt;makeup, carry it in your purse,  retouch at night if you think you need it.  It&#x27;s just perfect!..I hope this particular product never&lt;br /&gt; ceases to exist because I would  be one extremely sad customer.</li>
    <li> It &#x27;s a cool feeling .&lt;br /&gt;It is pasted .&lt;br /&gt;Just so .&lt;br /&gt;I did not get the effect of the advertising of this product .</li>
    <li> Strange applicator, good product. Am a professional make up artist. Find it works best if rolled onto the back of my hand and then patted on with a finger. Roller ball applicator is not effective. Needs to be re-designed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but leaves too much film unless you are really careful applying it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It was introduced to me by my beautician but now I buy a couple of them at a time to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  Good for traveling too because the bottle is small so there is no problem going thru security at the airport.</li>
    <li> Great product for under-eye hollows.  Lasts most of an 8 hour day, remains about 75% effective up to 12 hours if my skin is prepped properly (no moisturizer, foundation, powder, toner, etc in the application area.  You can always catch up with moisturizers during bedtime.</li>
    <li> OMG !  I&#x27;ve been using this for (2) years.  I saw it on HSN.  I&#x27;m 65 years young; I swear by this product.  YES ... \\&quot;Less\\&quot; is best.  Take it from me, I&#x27;ve got the Application down to a science !!!  Girls, listen to every word I&#x27;m saying; it&#x27;s the God&#x27;s Honest Truth.  I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;Roller Ball&#x27;; didn&#x27;t work for me.  I remove the Roller Ball (very easy).  Then I put the top back on.  Shake it a little.  Then tap the BOTTOM of the bottle in the palm of your hand.  This way, when you remove the cap, there will be just a little in the cap.  NOW LISTEN TO ME CLOSELY !!!  I dip a Q-TIP in the cap and then apply to my wrinkles.  I have Crow&#x27;s Feet and some wrinkles under both eyes.  DON&#x27;T RUB IT ON !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Apply it lightly by \\&quot;TAPPING\\&quot; the Q-Stick over your Wrinkles.  The Q-Stick works WONDERS !!!  Especially when applying to the Crow&#x27;s Feet.  Girls ... when I tell you this stuff makes me look 10 YEARS YOUNGER, I MEAN IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;m gonna order (5) more bottles today, 9-15-12.  I just keep praying to God that they NEVER STOP MAKING IT.  Girls !!!  Do exactly like I said; USE THE Q-TIP.  You&#x27;re gonna LOVE it !!!  The other REVIEWS that say &#x27;It doesn&#x27;t work; leaves white residue&#x27; --- THEY&#x27;RE PUTTING WAY TOOOOO MUCH ON !!!  GIRLS ........... YOU&#x27;RE GONNA THANK ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!  Really does work as advertised!  I was truly amazed how it tightened the wrinkles under my eyes!</li>
    <li> You can buy a similar product at much less money at your local drug store. I think I was buying something different because when it arrived and after my first use I just wanted to throw it away.  Just a stupid product that really doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product regularly since purchase..... does exactly what it says. No skin irritation problems. Excellent price, compared to similar products on the market. Would recommend product.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. Did not help with wrinkles at all. Leaves a white residue on my skin where applied.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but, use very little, and do not touch after applied, it will flake and be white. Again, key is to be sure to not over apply, or re-apply. If it gets chalky, wet fingertip slightly and dot on area and it normal again. I would say not for overly baggy eyes, but great for allergy puffy eyes and slight lines, If applies over make up, I uses 24 hour color stay foundation, agian, do not over do it!</li>
    <li> Of course I was skeptical, but w/I about 90 seconds my under eye wrinkles were gone.  I felt a very slight tightening of the skin and it lasts for most of the day.  However....it needs to be applied to clean dry skin and you can&#x27;t wear lotion or make-up over it either, or it gets blotchy and cakes with a white film.  I find if I apply it to my finger and dab it around the area, I have better control in application.</li>
    <li> Aminogenesis does not remove dark circles and or undereye puffiness. What a Hoax!!!.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 2 weeks I realized this was not the answer.</li>
    <li> Did -0- for even the finest wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old, since using this product people&lt;br /&gt;find it hard to believe my age. I have small wrinkles below my eyes, when I smile it makes me look older . This product conceals that problem... Small bottle but it goes a long way and simply put its cheap but effective .</li>
    <li> Nobody feel I look different after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Nobody feel I look different after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Nobody feel I look different after I use it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well.</li>
    <li> My second tube. Love it</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. The bottle wouldn&#x27;t work properly. I had to take the lid off to use it. I used the hair dryer and went exactly by the instructions. Not only did it not work, it left a residue that looked like scaly skin. Save your money! You will just be throwing away $20.</li>
    <li> Love it!!  Best product for undereye.</li>
    <li> I saw a demo of this on a television shopping channel and believed what I saw. Maybe I don&#x27;t have the right kind of wrinkles. Instead of plumping out any deep lines I (don&#x27;t) have, this did NOT fill in my fine mesh-like &amp;#34;laugh lines.&amp;#34; Oh well...it was worth a try.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of years trying different products to help reduce the look of wrinkles around my eyes. I did my research, tried going to different skin care sites, asked for opinions from people who posted their suggestions, and I finally came to the conclusion that I had to search for a different method of wrinkle reduction. I decided to stop spending money on various products for the eye area----they did nothing for me----and I decided to try Gone In Sixty Seconds. I have been using this product for many months now, and will continue to enjoy the results! I have fair skin, and a little of Gone In sixty Seconds applied to my dry eye area, keeps my eyes wrinkle free almost all day! If applied correctly, I have no fear of a dried out under eye area, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about peeling or white residue appearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carolyn</li>
