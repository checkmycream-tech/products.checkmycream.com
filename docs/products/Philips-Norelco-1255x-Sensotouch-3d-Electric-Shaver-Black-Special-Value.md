      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and the battery life is great.  </li>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a great shave.</li>
      <li>shaves so close that I don&#x27;t feel a stubble ,it does not shave great close to my nostrils ,I get out my Braun for that .One</li>

      <li>This is a very nice electric razor.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, and you gonna love it!</li>
      <li>needs to wise up to its customers and to the realities of online reviews.</li>
      <li>, I know a good thing when I have</li>
      <li>The RQ12 needs to be produced at a fair price, or I will go to Braun for my shaving needs.</li>
      <li>Feels good in the hand (ergonomics).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>it is just as good as I can get from a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A good choice</li>
      <li>my question is how good a shave can I expect after 6 months ?</li>
      <li>and he says he gets as good a shave with this as with a razor.</li>
      <li>Philips/Norelco recommends using for three weeks - without using another shaver - as a fair test.  </li>
      <li>I find it simpler to hit the areas around the Adam&#x27;s Apple with a razor and all is good.</li>
      <li>find yourself spending close to 1/2 hour taking the shaver apart cleaning trying to coax a good shave out of it</li>
      <li>, the this one is really good and solve a lot o problem of the formers models.</li>
      <li>that I think it&#x27;s almost as good as a blade</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional razor, and I even use it to keep head shaved.</li>
      <li>Shaves exceptionally well.</li>
      <li>This is an exceptional razor.</li>
      <li>Great product as most Norelco shavers are.</li>
      <li>Sure, the $70.00 Norelcos do a great job, but, by comparison, feel a bit lightweight and plasticy.</li>
      <li>Still pretty impressed by the smoothness it gave; I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this close/</li>
      <li>This Norelco shaver is amazing.  </li>
      <li>It was simply amazing.    </li>
      <li>amazing.  </li>
      <li>Amazingly this model is still made in Holland.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Conclusion: It&#x27;s a good shaver with appropriate battery life and affordable price, GO FOR IT.</li>
      <li>+ - with the model number implying some kind of improvement.</li>
      <li>If you are only happy with the best, go for it!</li>
      <li>(it is by no means better than razor, no electric shaver is) that being said it is good shaver.</li>
      <li>I thought that was the best the technology could do (and was highly rated).  </li>
      <li>Easy to replace and one heck of a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very easy to use and also very easy on the skin.  </li>
      <li>and this is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with one.</li>
      <li>This is my 4th or 5th Norelco shaver, and by far the best.</li>
      <li>Awesome shaver, used to get nicks from my old rasor</li>
      <li>I think it does a great shave for an electric razor and coming with an extra head unit makes this a great value in my opinion.</li>
      <li>A good choice。The use of good, very convenient.</li>
      <li>A good choice。The use of good, very convenient.</li>
      <li>about this shaver I voted 5 stars and honestly it deserves more I would give this a perfect 10 if such a thing existed in Amazons rating</li>
      <li>that is full of good info</li>
      <li>For more background information on my quest for \\&quot;</li>
      <li>By the way, even the trimmer on the cheaper model works better than the trimmer on the 1255X!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Use it in the shower with your favorite goop.</li>
      <li>that you should be able to find on Amazon for about $18.00.  </li>
      <li>I love the moving heads that help catch all the hairs on your chin, neck and under the chin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Costco seems to be currently the best deal when offered below 140 USD (with spare shaving head) about once a quarter.</li>
      <li>- just make sure they cut your whiskers and not you skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So for now the quest for the perfect shaver is over and this is the second place runner up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and if I skip a day shaving, it looks like most guys looks after a week.  </li>
      <li>The Norelco shaver is outstanding and will recommend it to anyone, anytime</li>
      <li>BTW I notice the vendor has raised the price to $191 about $40 more than I paid for it .I</li>
      <li>I recommend this for sure to anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
      <li>I guess it&#x27;s just more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>around if you travel for more than week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shaver.</li>
      <li>I decided to try a more &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razor and purchased a Panasonic razor.  </li>
      <li>have no idea what Norelco thinks it&#x27;s doing here, selling a $49.95 razor (the AT790) that is noticeably better than their $215 dollar (Amazon&#x27;s prices here) shaver, but it sure doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this product is really outstanding.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaver.</li>
      <li>Be sure to read the booklet</li>
      <li>Is this ever a fantastic shaver!  </li>
      <li>would say it doesn&#x27;t save any time, and you&#x27;re better off using the cheaper alternative of a blade.</li>
      <li>Also the shave goes a bit faster with cream, I don&#x27;t have to pass over an area quite as many</li>
      <li>EXCELLENT RAZOR - but a MASSIVE scam for the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
      <li>After 4 months it takes longer to shave, the shave not that close and many missed hairs .&lt;br</li>
      <li>have a XL9160 that shaves ok but not great,after replacing the cutters in Jan .</li>
      <li>It is a top quality.</li>
      <li>My husband love his.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased the 1255x to replace a Philips 700 series shaver from 2004 which also had pivoting heads like this.  This one still has three heads like the old model, but the new ones flex and pivot much more.  Especially in the outward direction, which I think makes a big difference, especially when you&#x27;re shaving where the neck meets the jaw and other areas with lots of contour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor.  It works fine completely dry, which is great for travel, but at home I use a light amount of creme shave from a tube... I think the lubrication of that will make the blades last longer compared to dry.  Also the shave goes a bit faster with cream, I don&#x27;t have to pass over an area quite as many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery definitely lasts longer than my old unit ever did even when new.  I guess it&#x27;s just more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that the sideburn/clipper attachment on the 1255x is very limited compared to the one on my old 780 or whatever the old one was (probably still visible somewhere on my Amazon reviews! ha.) In fact I am saving the old unit and charging it up just for that purpose.  The clipper on the old one was wide enough and stuck out far enough to do a great job edging the bottom of a sideburn and then working over the ear in either direction.  The clipper on the 1255x is too narrow and does not stick out from the body of the shaver far enough to be useful for either of these things.  It is barely adequate for trimming an occasional hair that sticks out too far somewhere, but doesn&#x27;t really suit the purpose of sideburns and over the ear.</li>
    <li> Very good at shaving, but trimmer is a waste of time. With it&#x27;s location and the large head you can&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re doing. Kept my old Norelco just for the trimmer.  Phillips really screwed up this design.</li>
    <li> If this is the best electric on the market, then electrics are probably not worth it. At least they aren&#x27;t if you have sensitive skin or a tough beard. This shaver gave me bumps and tore up my neck, while doing a marginal job at best. The only way to even get a marginal job is to shave every day, stretch the skin, take multiple passes, and use a wet shave. The dry shave was pointless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it doesn&#x27;t save any time, and you&#x27;re better off using the cheaper alternative of a blade. I&#x27;ve shaved with a straight edge, cartridge, and both types of electric (rotary and foil). I would say if you really want an electric use a foil type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really thin facial hair and it doesn&#x27;t grow much, and your skin is not sensitive at all, then the positive reviews are probably accurate for this shaver. I consulted co-workers who confirmed issues with electrics too.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving. Two negatives:  1. High cost of replacement heads 2.  Shaver cannot be charged without the stand -- a nuisance when travelling.</li>
    <li> This is the fourth electric razor I have tried.  First a norelco spectra, then a Panasonic, then a Braun series 5.  The Spectra was ok, but never shaved my neck very well, the braun did a great job on my cheeks, but was horibble at shaving each side of my neck next to my adams apple.  So after a year of complaining, I broke down and bought yet another new razor.  I had relatively low expectations, and was hoping it just worked as well as the Spectra (which broke after 6 years).  I have very thick stubble and if I skip a day shaving, it looks like most guys looks after a week.  So my first use of this razor, I hadn&#x27;t shaved for a couple days.  Typically electric razors clog up and simply can&#x27;t cut it, so I have to use the stand by gillette.  This razor gave me the best shave I have ever had with an electric razor.  It was simply amazing.    I have read a bunch of reviews where people complain about a razor irritating their skin.  That is the down side - this razor shaves very close and it leaves a little irritation, buy aftershave.  This is an exceptional razor.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT RAZOR - but a MASSIVE scam for the replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;Ever bought a printer for $50, only to find that to replace the ink costs $120? Well, that has now translated to the electric razor world with this wonderful device from Philips. Whereas other electrics made by the brand have $30-75 replacement heads, this one has skyrocketed to $150 - MORE than the purchase price I paid for this whole device at Costco. RIDICULOUS. But that&#x27;s not all...&lt;br /&gt;Philips created a &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; replacement - the rq12+ - with the model number implying some kind of improvement. An improvement it is not - read the reviews for yourself, and you&#x27;ll see that they replaced a triple-track head with a dual-track head. Many report yanking and most report less efficient, less close shaves. Way to sell that &amp;#34;+&amp;#34;, Norelco!&lt;br /&gt;This is a massive fail by Norelco, and I hope that a backlash online will show them their folly. The RQ12 needs to be produced at a fair price, or I will go to Braun for my shaving needs. I can&#x27;t deal with a company bent on squeezing every dime out of my wallet. If I wanted that, I would switch back to the overpriced Mach4 blades!&lt;br /&gt;Philips needs to wise up to its customers and to the realities of online reviews. People aren&#x27;t stupid. And if you aren&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll wait to buy this razor until they&#x27;ve made a way for you to replace the head without having to repurchase the entire device.</li>
    <li> Model 1255X is the latest model that also includes a complete extra saving head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A replacement shaver head lists for $64.99 and is currently available through Amazon for $49.97 on Amazon Prime; thus the cost of this offer $175.49 less $49.97 makes the resulting cost of this shaver $125.52.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This offer does not include the Norelco \\&quot;Jet Clean System\\&quot; - You can find the Norelco 1280X/42 for $279.99 on Amazon with the Jet Clean System.  The \\&quot;Jet Clean System\\&quot; can perhaps be thought of an a nice luxury option, however, I have found by following the operating instructions for daily cleaning with hot/warm water one does not absolutely need this luxury option that also requires ongoing purchases of Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution, 10 Ounce, currently selling on Amazon for $10.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to try occasionally using the Norelco AL80 Razor Lubricant on Amazon for $7.35 to lubricate the shaver blades and screens to enhance performance and extend shaver head life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One accessory I would recommend trying is \\&quot;Lab Series Men Electric Shave Solution\\&quot; that you should be able to find on Amazon for about $18.00.  The bottle has a small opening so you can use the rather expensive pre-electric solution sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other recommendation is at least for the first three weeks take an extra minute or two to shave carefully and genteelly so you face will be able to comfortably adjust to your new shaving system.  All razors and shavers have blades and blades are designed to cut - just make sure they cut your whiskers and not you skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If possible I would have given this new model a 4.5 to 4.7 star rating; it&#x27;s not perfect, but it is a significant improvement to previous Norelco shavers I have use in the previous decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy and use extra care, especially during the first three weeks or so as you adjust to this new shaver.  Keep in mind, not to press too hard unless you want to cut your skin instead of just your whiskers.  You and the care you take will make a big difference in your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WET SHAVING:  I have found using a shaving gel works good with this shaver, especially when you add warm water to it so on your face it become more wet than foam.  I like Gillette Fusion HydraGel with Aloe and Cocoa Butter.</li>
    <li> gets a close shave but if im lazy and dont shave for 3 or more days, i&#x27;d end up rubbing my skin raw before it gets all the hair (specially the fine hair on the neck (havnt tried wet shave)). another thing, if you have a beard or mustache, you cant shave right up to it cause it will randomly cut a few long hairs (long slits in foil for long hairs, but doesnt do well with long hairs), and the trimmer is the worst iv ever used, doesnt get very close and randomly misses a lot of hairs, not to mention its awkward position. Haven&#x27;t decided yet, but im  considering returning it and getting a cheaper one, moneys not really an issue, but if you pay high end prices then you should get what u pay for, I still have to pull out my trimmer or razor if i havnt shaved for 3 or more days, and still need razor for sideburns and to shave close to the beard</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve had a number of other brands before and the last two have been Norelcos, but nothing I&#x27;ve had comes close to the shave this model gives me.  I can&#x27;t get over the articulation of the heads and how they conform to all the contours of my face and neck......amazing.  I use a shaving gell and water while shaving and this Norelco gives me the closest thing to a blade&#x27;s shave that I have ever had.  I shaved this morning and it is now early afternoon and my face is still smooth.</li>
    <li> It definitely works better than our old one and we thought it was pretty good.  Not so sure about the fragile looking heads but they are extremely easy to clean and so far haven&#x27;t had a problem.  We don&#x27;t like the push out mustache trimmer - it&#x27;s really awkward to use.</li>
    <li> a clean face results in a clean mind</li>
    <li> Will never go back to a blade..... Unless we run out of electricity... Just kidding -- It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver about 1 month ago and for the first couple of weeks I only did Wet shavings &#x27;cause I was pretty sure it will irritate my face (very sensitive skin that gets reddish with (too) much ease). Was using it about once about every 3days so that my skin had enough time to adjust to the new rotating shaver method, and the results were slightly better than my old razor. Still pretty impressed by the smoothness it gave; I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this close/good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real strength lies in its DRY shave. Since 1 and a half weeks, I am using it every morning and it only takes me about 3min to cover the whole face and make it (baby)smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downsize is that I am unable to use after shave gel/cream/wtv because the damn thing will cause irritations; but this is just my skin being (way) too sensitive... The Norelco shaver is outstanding and will recommend it to anyone, anytime (it makes for a perfect gift too!).</li>
    <li> This is my 4th or 5th Norelco shaver, and by far the best. The other reviewers go into great detail, and I appreciated their input when doing the research for which model to buy. No sense repeating what was already stated, so I&#x27;ll just state that I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver. Great design, great feel in the hand, great close shave. Sure, the $70.00 Norelcos do a great job, but, by comparison, feel a bit lightweight and plasticy. If you are only happy with the best, go for it! The 45 day no-risk trial period takes the worry out of the purchase. Rinsing the heads with hot water after each shave, as recommended, takes just  a minute because they pop open very easily when needed. Be sure to read the booklet (I know, guys hate doing that!) that is full of good info so you get the most from your new shaver. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  edit: My shaver is now 3 ½ years old, and I&#x27;m still using the original shaver head; either an indication that this is a quality shaver, or an indication that I&#x27;m too stingy to put on the new head. ;-)</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for any man in your life.  Very easy to use and also very easy on the skin.  My husband love his.</li>
    <li> shaves smooth and easy</li>
    <li> The battery lasts forever. Light indicators tell you when you need to charge. It is very easy to clean. Shaves exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> Update 2012-07-06 Still 5 stars all the way. Two days ago I used a regular razor blade to shave with again for the first time since purchasing this. #1. I got razor burn from the regular razor #2. The shave was not as close as the shave I get from this electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this review was from when I first purchased this. I stand by everything written before it is still true today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could say it only took one electric shaver to bring my quest to an end but honestly no one electric can do it all or so it seems. For more background information on my quest for \\&quot; The Electric Shaver\\&quot; please see my Braun 7 series review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Braun-Series-Pulsonic-Shaver-System/product-reviews/B003YJAZZ4/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_top_recent?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;showViewpoints&#x3D;0&amp;sortBy&#x3D;bySubmissionDateDescending&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about this shaver I voted 5 stars and honestly it deserves more I would give this a perfect 10 if such a thing existed in Amazons rating system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The motor is powerful and turns the blades very swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry Shave: The blades are extremely sharp and the glide is incredible during a dry shave even after 1 days growth this shaver mowed it down without a snag or a hiccup and gave me a razor close shave, totally unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2a. Wet Shave: I purchased this for the dry shave ability but the wet shave is truly incredible when using EDGE shaving gel, I did not encounter the mess some reviewers talk about when wet shaving with an electric shaver and this thing glides like crazy and delivers an even closer shave than when dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The time it takes to shave is greatly decreased due to factors 1 &amp; 2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The comfort is very good no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The pop out trimmer is smaller than on other shavers but honestly who needs a big trimmer on a shaver anyway? it does a great job on nose, ears &amp; sideburns etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The display is a big help nice to know whereyou are with a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The ability to plug the razor in and shave is a great bonus especially when the battery is discharged this is the one thing I do not like about this shaver but it was not enough to make me take away a star or not buy it, I knew this going into the purchase but I do wish that this was available I am adult enough not to electrocute myself when using a electric wet dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. The shaver DOES NOT dump clippings on you while you use it. I guess if you are lazy and do not take care of your equipment they could build up over time and dump on you but that is the fault of the operator not the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Cleaning the razor is extremely easy just pop open the heads individualy ( they open from the inside out I will try to upload some photos of this ) and run hot water over the spindle area briefly and over the cutting heads to flush them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. I have read where other reviewers could not get close to areas like their nose or upper lip I did not find this to be true at all. I guess if you do not tension the skin a bit this might happen but this is the fault of the user not the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. The shave quality is excellent it is just as good as I can get from a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12. The last thing I can think of to write is that the extra heads you get are all one unit, that is to say the three foils and the entire upper portion of the shaver are 1 unit and simply click into place over the body of the unit. How Cool is that? Easy to replace and one heck of a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in closing I think some people just need to learn how to use an electric shaver and it just comes easier to some than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also like to take the time to debunk the break in period myth surrounding electric shavers. This shaver proved to me that if it works it works period no break in period required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lawn never needed a break in period when changing mowers why should my beard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one shaver that is close to this one it is the Phillips Norelco Speed-XL 8250 I also purchased here on Amazon and I will be keeping it, I know a good thing when I have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002B4VBV0 B002B4VBV0]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver for all of the reasons I have posted above. These are the things I wish were more clearly spelled out when I was making my shaver purchasing decision and I hope this is of help to someone trying to figure this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-02 UPDATE: I still use this shaver but only once per week or when I feel like a wet shave which is only about once a week. This is still and awesome Shaver but has taken second place to my other Norelco Shaver the Phillips Norelco Speed-XL 8250 So for now the quest for the perfect shaver is over and this is the second place runner up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013-07-15 UPDATE: The last Update is still holding true and both Norelco Shavers are still working perfectly.</li>
    <li> This thing everything I hoped it would be and I was at first very hesitant about moving away from a razor. This gives a very close shave for an electric. Though not quite as close as a razor, it&#x27;s very close and the girlfriend approves. It&#x27;s especially good on my neck and doesnt leave any razor burn or cuts which was always difficult even with new blades on my old Fusion 5-blade. Though I will say I takes linger to get a shave than my blade, but I dont have to stand in front of a mirror and can go about doing other things which is great during busy mornings. I, with some frequency, spend a good amount of money on higher-tech products that fail to deliver what I bought them for or leave me dissapionted in some way, but this definitely wasnt one of them. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 months and hopefully itll last. Im especially pleased because I bought this in the US with an extra replacement head for about $140, but I&#x27;m in Taiwan currently and it retails here for $600-900 depending on the version. Yes! I highly reccomend this razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco shavers but this one shaves so well, reaching every spot precisely on my trident tee. And it just plain looks cool!</li>
    <li> need to pass a lot of times over same spot to get close shave, it misses a lot of hairs. To the point that I&#x27;ve gone back to the older model. I could not return it since I threw the packaging away, rookie mistake, I know.</li>
    <li> Holds a charge well.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  Another reviewer said it was like being shaved by tiny robotic kisses.  The end.</li>
    <li> My husband says it because it moves smoothly over his face.  I like it because it&#x27;s quiet and is fast to clean, dry and recharge.</li>
    <li> Feel so comfortable and it shaves clean and clear. The noise controls very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product, and you gonna love it!</li>
    <li> Though fancier than other Norelco shavers and more expensive, it is not really better. The trimmer is clumsy to use--not only because it is very small, but because the three big shavers block one&#x27;s view unless one goes to considerable length to avoid that. The charger calls for a big production and is a long step down from the more standard models.  Neither the more recent shavers nor this one gives a warning when the battery is about to be empty; it just stops mid-shave.  A nuisance. The new version of cutters give a decent shave but not a faster one.  A minor plus: it is much quieter.</li>
    <li> Not a very good razor in my opinion. You folks should compare it with others on the market. I have been using electric razors for over 50 years. Yours is being returned for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Edwin M Clark (age 96)</li>
    <li> Ok for now I&#x27;m hooked ,but lets call a spade a spade .I have been using Norelco formerly known as Philishave in the late 1940&#x27;s almost exclusively since then .So I have used a lot of shavers .My main beef when they are new they shave well ,after 6 months ,it&#x27;s a grind .You find yourself spending close to 1/2 hour taking the shaver apart cleaning trying to coax a good shave out of it .After 6 months your cutters are worthless and you pay 1/3 to 1/2 the price of a new shaver with marginal improvement .I have a XL9160 that shaves ok but not great,after replacing the cutters in Jan . After 4 months it takes longer to shave, the shave not that close and many missed hairs .&lt;br /&gt;The XL8240 which I bought 2 years ago is worthless even after putting new cutters in last year .I use this shaver at my summer home 3 months a year and I can&#x27;t get a close shave after 4 months of use .I would point out that years ago the cutters were advertised as self sharpening ,no longer, has Norelco come to the conclusion they don&#x27;t want their cutters to last ,so eliminated the self sharpening feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the 1255X which I have only used twice and like all those 5 star reviews I concur ,it is a great shaver and I haven&#x27;t had this close a shave ,well I don&#x27;t remember when .Again my question is how good a shave can I expect after 6 months ? I just don&#x27;t know ,but I will tell you after 6 months .First the 1255X is really the 1250 with an extra set of cutters .This makes it a bargain because these cutters cost around $55 yet the shaver is priced pretty much the same as the 1250.When I registered the shaver it would not recognize 1255X,therefore I called Norelco ,it seems the 1255X is the Costco version but is really a 1250 .If you can find the 1255X buy it it&#x27;s a bargain because if my experience serves me well you will need the extra cutters .&lt;br /&gt;To sum up ,I wish I didn&#x27;t have to use the stand all the time to charge ,the older models you could plug directly into the shave ,for travelling that was great.It&#x27;s very quiet ,simple to use ,doesn&#x27;t irritate your neck and right now the Remington or Braun can&#x27;t touch it .You get a very generous warranty 2 years add another 6 months if you register online .They also give you 45 days to try it ,now that&#x27;s real confidence that you will like it ,6or 7 months ? we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/13/2013&lt;br /&gt;After a week of close comfortable shaves ,I tip my hat to Norelco .This has to be the best shaver of all time .I have a 2 day beard the 1255x easily took care of it ,and did very well under my neck.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic that this shaver will be a winner a few months down the road .Unlike previous Norelcos this should continue giving me great shaves for a few months .I will let you know because these cutters are so expensive around $55 ,so if I don&#x27;t get a year out of them ,I will be disappointed.BTW I notice the vendor has raised the price to $191 about $40 more than I paid for it .I think that is a little predatory ,I would say that I would not ever have paid $191 after all it&#x27;s only a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;9/30/2013&lt;br /&gt;I have been very hard on Norelco&#x27;s for years mainly because I never got a close shave from any of them after a couple of months .&lt;br /&gt;Now I am raving about this one after about 3 months.It shaves so close that I think it&#x27;s almost as good as a blade .It shaves so close that I don&#x27;t feel a stubble ,it does not shave great close to my nostrils ,I get out my Braun for that .One thing I notice is ,the next day after a close shave my face is like sandpaper which never happened with other shavers ,and I have gone 3 days without a shave .This shaver has no problems ,it also cleans easily under the tap .It doesn&#x27;t however travel well because you have to bring your charging stand and cord along .Too much to carry .Right now there is no other shaver to touch this one .&lt;br /&gt;3/8/2014&lt;br /&gt;After 7 months as expected the blades are not as sharp ,and it takes longer to get a shave .It still does a decent job ,but you have to work on it .I guess to get a quicker better shave I need to buy new cutters ,at around $50-$60 you hesitate to do that and so stretch out the old cutters .I do say that sometimes on weekends I don&#x27;t shave for 2 or 3 days ,and yet the shaver does the job reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver ,there are none as good as this type,a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;6/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;Well finally it wont shave anymore .Actually I only got 8 months out of it ,I didn&#x27;t use it in May because I had bought another one for home and moved it to my vacation home .I am a little disappointed with the cutters life because the implication in their ad is \\&quot;change blades every twelve months for best results \\&quot;,Clearly an implication that you should get 12 months out of them .I am taking a star off for that .Final result a remarkable shaver with cutters not lasting as long as implied .Cutter cost at least $50 and up.Norelco agrees that the implications are that 12 months should be average but not a warranty .That is unfortunate ,I expected better.t job ,but you have to work on it .I guess to get a quicker better shave I need to buy new cutters ,at around $50-$60 you hesitate to do that and so stretch out the old cutters .I do say that sometimes on weekends I don&#x27;t shave for 2 or 3 days ,and yet the shaver does the job reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver ,there are none as good as this type,a real winner.&lt;br /&gt;6/24/2014&lt;br /&gt;Well finally it wont shave anymore .Actually I only got 8 months out of it ,I didn&#x27;t use it in May because I had bought another one for home and moved it to my vacation home .I am a little disappointed with the cutters life because the implication in their ad is \\&quot;change blades every twelve months for best results \\&quot;,Clearly an implication that you should get 12 months out of them .I am taking a star off for that .Final result a remarkable shaver with cutters not lasting as long as implied .Cutter cost at least $50 and up.Norelco agrees that the implications are that 12 months should be average but not a warranty .That is unfortunate ,I expected better.</li>
    <li> This razor is super quiet and provides a smooth close shave. I had a previous version of this razor and while very happy with it, this is improved. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my first Sensotouch Norelco and I love it. I have been using Norelco savers since the 1960&#x27;s but this one is the best. It gives a close shave and even gets my neck close without shaver burn. Yes, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a great shave.</li>
    <li> I was user of an old version of the product and I already like the system, the this one is really good and solve a lot o problem of the formers models.</li>
    <li> Fails to cut hair reliably if not used every day. Cumbersome, poorly balanced charging stand. Absurdly expensive replacement heads. I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for years, and this is the first one I regretted buying.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but this product is really outstanding.  By far the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric, and maybe as close as I&#x27;ve gotten with a razor.  It&#x27;s smooth, quiet, fast and very comfortable.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months and the battery life is great.  Easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve just run it under the tap after every use.  Seems to be all it needs. I&#x27;ve been using electrics for over 40 years, and most of them seemed more or less the same, so I was hesitant to spend what I thought was a lot of money for this shaver.  I don&#x27;t regret it at all.  I even got an extra set of blades with it, so it should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I have decided to change my rating on this shaver as Philips has recently decided to change the head used for the product. Below is my 5-star initial review. But, as meticulous of a shaver that I am, I can definitely tell that they have greatly lowered the quality in their \\&quot;new\\&quot; shaving head. Now, I must make many more passes to achieve my desired shave, and sometimes, I simply cannot get the close shave that I could with the previous head. I am very disappointed with the price of the new head, and much more disappointed that the shaver performs much worse now! I can get a decent shave with it now, but I just don&#x27;t get the closeness that I once had.    *************************  I have been using this shaver for a bit over a year now, and I have greatly benefited from it as I have very sensitive skin and am a meticulous shaver. It gives me a close shave on my cheeks, jaw line, and upper lip with fewer passes than the Panasonic ES-LF51 foil shaver and Philips shavers using the hq9 heads. My only thumbs down on the unit is that several passes are needed to get a close shave around the Adam&#x27;s Apple and most of the remainder of my neck. But, I think these struggles are common with most shavers. I find it simpler to hit the areas around the Adam&#x27;s Apple with a razor and all is good. Additionally, I find that the shaver works best in the shower, and shaving is improved with soap or shaving cream. But, it works very well with only using water.  The shaver only needs a good rinsing in the shower for cleaning, and rinsing the heads is accomplish simply by opening each head and allowing the water to rinse it.  Head replacement is also simple as the entire head assembly easily detaches, and the new one is easily attached in its place. Further, this shaver comes with an extra head replacement pack which I greatly appreciate. Finally, though it has a separate charging base, it is small and easy to pack down into a shaving kit, and it charges quickly and holds a charge for several shaves. If you appreciate rotary shaving, this product is a great option to consider.</li>
    <li> I  gave my husband this shaver as a Christmas gift, and it works great he is very happy with it, and will recommend to family and friends.</li>
    <li> handle went complete dead after 6 months.  Thankfully there is a 1-800 on the back of unit, and Phillips made good on sending a replacement handle.  Like the waterproofing and shape of handle, but only shaves Ok, with lot of friction and complete misses more than it cuts of two day old growth.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using it for about 3 months now and he says he gets as good a shave with this as with a razor.</li>
    <li> I had them all. A Sunbeam back in the 70s, then several Braun´s and a Remington Sport and Wet (awfull) before I switched to razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips beats them all. Smooth, low-noise, the 3D head allows a perfect dry shave as well as wet. For the wet shave the gel or foam is mandatory. I recommend this shaver to anybody with thin and soft hair.&lt;br /&gt;Costco seems to be currently the best deal when offered below 140 USD (with spare shaving head) about once a quarter.</li>
    <li> I think it is a very good electric shaver, it is not noisy, gives you good close shave (it is by no means better than razor, no electric shaver is) that being said it is good shaver. I got this from Costco, $115 is extremely good price for this shaver, i have use braun and mostly panasonic shavers in the past, currently i was using panasonic Arc4, it has been one of the best shaver i have used but lately have to change blades every few  months, the replacement blade quality was poor, that made me look into buy new shaver, i was inclined to buy another panasonic,  i saw this norelco at costco, so i decided to give it a try, i have very thick beard and this shaver is very comfortable to use, i used the circular motion as suggested in one of the reviews and it helped for close shave. i always do wet shave with shaving cream and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the dock is is designed to avoid electric shock and is not very good for travel but with 2 weeks life of battery it should not be issue for short trips, for long trips i guess there will large baggage accompanying travel, should not be a big issue (the cradle folds, it does not take much space), my panasonic shaver was so loud i have to go down stairs for shave if it is very early in the morning, this shaver is very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the shaving is extremely easy in the neck area, i moved to electric shave due to cuts i used to get with razor and even with foil shave i occasionally get cut in the neck area, the rotors pivots very well and there is no discomfort at all and no cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned about cleaning as it required to run warm water after every shave, i am not sure how much is the stand alone cleaning kit cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this shaver, i am not sure how good/bad it is with dry shave, with my thick shave dry shave is very irritating no matter how good shaver is.</li>
    <li> Great shave. Super easy to clean, under hot water. Came with 2 heads. Light, quiet. Great product as most Norelco shavers are.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feeling about this product. Here&#x27;s my comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Excellent close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Quiet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Feels good in the hand (ergonomics).&lt;br /&gt;4. Quality look and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1. The trimmer is nearly useless. Very poorly positioned and it&#x27;s narrow.&lt;br /&gt;2. There&#x27;s very little room in the shaver head to contain the cuttings so they just fall out where ever you happen to be shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3. The only way to charge the thing is with the stand so you have to haul that around if you travel for more than week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality shaver and I like how it shaves but for me the negatives are annoying enough that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> This razor was to replace my 10 year old Norelco. It cuts considerably better and much more comfortable on sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t use the razor wet, but it is nice being able to rinse it with water when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor only charges on the stand, which is rather bulky. This isn&#x27;t a problem unless you travel a lot....which I do. The carry/storage pouch is only big enough for the razor itself, not the stand and power cord. I kept my old Norelco for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slide-out trimmer head is rather small and somewhat of an awkward position when trimming sideburns. It works, but I like the old Norelco trimmer better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The distance between the cutting head and edge of razor head is too great. Shaving the upper lip and up to the bottom of my sideburns is difficult. Bottom line - tough to get into tight spots.</li>
    <li> A blade is still closer. But this is a wonderful electric shaver! Use it in the shower with your favorite goop. Plus, it comes with an extra head- superior value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using e-shavers for 20 yrs and this is by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten with one. I&#x27;ve used every brand there is and spent a pretty penny searching for the \\&quot;ONE\\&quot;. This is it folks, I have a very heavy beard and like previous reviewers I look like a skid row bum after 2 days. I get a clean/close shave everywhere, even the neck. No nics or cuts and that&#x27;s with increased pressure. No burning stubble and I don&#x27;t have to shave every 12 hrs. if I&#x27;m going out in the evening. Ease of cleanup is a snap, I love that feature, the charger actually turns off when it&#x27;s done, don&#x27;t have to put the damn thing on a timer. All in all a 9 out of 10, just wish the replacemant heads were cheaper. I haven&#x27;t had it long so I don&#x27;t know if the heads will last a yr. like they say. It&#x27;s worth the price if they only last 6 months maybe even not as long. I love this shaver.</li>
    <li> Bocce balls!  Is this ever a fantastic shaver!  I was using a top of the line Panasonic wet-dry shaver, and it only did an OK job, even wet, which I usually had to follow up with a blade.  It was my first recent attempt at an electric in a couple decades, so I thought that was the best the technology could do (and was highly rated).  It *never* gave a close shave and took about 5 minutes to do a mediocre job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neck area is a particular problem, since the hairs lie down very close to the skin and seem to grow in different directions.  Electric shavers have always had a problem there.  Using a blade every day really tore up my neck and dermatologists couldn&#x27;t help.  This Norelco shaver is amazing.  I use it wet and it shaves nearly as close as a blade, in no more time than a blade (90 to 120 seconds) and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin *at all*!  It&#x27;s not heavy at all and is very comfortable in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, no $$$ cleaning cartridges or noisy cleaning base to boot.  Just rinse it off under the tap and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GET THIS SHAVER!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It is low in sound and shaves very vell. Very smoth in use. It is a top quality.</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much, the only concern is when it gets to the neck it fails to provide a clean cut unless rolled over again and again which results in a red rash on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the product works as described both wet and dry. I have been reading abt how people have been using it and i am trying to do the same and hope to get a better cleaner shave in some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this. my friend already bought one after i showed him mine.</li>
    <li> It gets almost all hair either short or tall with ease, what made me not give her 5 stars is:&lt;br /&gt;1- the hair collection chamber is relatively small so some hair gets on your cloths while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;2- I hate the need for the stand to charge, older models of smart touch used to have the option to plug the charging cable into the shaver directly with no need for the stand which really comes in handy when travelling for couple of weeks, but they did this modification for safety issues (actually I couldn&#x27;t figure it out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: It&#x27;s a good shaver with appropriate battery life and affordable price, GO FOR IT.</li>
    <li> My hubby love it and uses it everyday he love the shape the color the light when it&#x27;s charging he likes it all</li>
    <li> I will never go back to disposable razor again! This is an exceptional razor, and I even use it to keep head shaved. The best!</li>
    <li> Starting to like this razor more.  My beard has gotten used to it some.  Light weight, easy care and close shave.</li>
    <li> I have used it dry, with soap, with shaving foam, and with shave cream.  Also with Nivea for Men.  Works well with all of the above, or dry.  I am no razor connoiseur, but I really like this one and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Pro: The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise: 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Braun Series 7 (79-80 db); with the Braun Series 5 in the middle.  (The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Abrasion - This was the show stopper.  On my third use, I had substantial abrasion under my chin (also some abrasion on earlier use).  With an electric shaver, it is important to stretch the skin you are shaving and to shave against the grain, as it were.  (Using a Braun, I have cut myself under my mouth, when I failed to stretch, but I have never had significant abrasion.  Rotary shaving is multi-directional, while the Brauns make shaving against the grain easier.)&lt;br /&gt;Charging - This shaver charges only on its stand, which seems OK when you are at home.  When traveling, the stand will be an inconvenience, and it might get broken.  The instructions say to unplug the small wall-wart when not charging - do not charge continuously - another liability.  (I dump my Braun into the more convenient, connected charger/cleaner whenever I am at home.)&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Flip open each of the three heads and clean under running water.  Then leave the heads open to dry.  This means you cannot pack it up for travel, and it is more vulnerable to damage when open.  Cleaning in water and air-drying cannot be good for cutting edges.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer - the only trimmer I have tried that is unacceptable for getting those hairs that sneak out my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:  Fully charged in 1 hour.  Put finger behind a rotor to improve shaving of upper lip.  Can shave wet (not tested); this might be the forte of the shaver, but I want to shave dry.  The 1255x appears to be the same as the 1250x, but with an extra head included.  Philips/Norelco recommends using for three weeks - without using another shaver - as a fair test.  I judged the 1255x could not get as good as the Braun Series 5 with such a test, so I quit.  I was relieved to get back to theBraun.  YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Related products I have reviewed:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] (Pete: 2-stars)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]] (Pete: 4-stars)&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] (Pete: 4-stars)</li>
    <li> This is a very nice electric razor. I have used cheap $30 electric razors for a long time, and once I decided to upgrade I chose this one after a fair amount of research. Definitely worth the high price tag. Close shave and finally I found a razor that gets rid of razor burn.</li>
    <li> The shave is exceptional for an electric and so much faster than the time wasted by a safety razor. It does not cut as close as a manual, but it&#x27;s coverage makes for an overall better shave and thus it feels closer even though it isn&#x27;t in any one spot. The difference isn&#x27;t enough to justify the time of a manual at all. Clean out better than any electric I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these shavers and have thought they were excellent!  This order however did not leave me with much to write about.  The recharge piece of equipment did not seem to provide any power to the shaver and none of the of the meters even displayed any light. on the shaver handle.I still would like to purchase this item since I know not all items such as this one are free of flaws.</li>
    <li> Awesome shaver, used to get nicks from my old rasor/irritation on the neck, the 3D shaving head is the only shaving head that does not do it. OBVIOUSLY expensive, but it pays for itself in the long run. Dont go to the bar for one night, save some money and buy it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is probably the best shaver i have had in all 10 years i am shaving so far!&lt;br /&gt;It has a solid build that when dropped, does not break like my old shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It is waterproof (a must for anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet tried shaving underwater). It is particularly good for me as i have delicate skin and begin to get all sorts of spots on my face soon after i shave. I got this shaver at costco for $115 after mail-in-rebate which is a pretty sweet deal considering that the shaver itself is worth more than that and it comes with a extra shaving head replacement! I love the moving heads that help catch all the hairs on your chin, neck and under the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem i have with this shaver is that it is much bulkier than my last shaver and it does dispense shaving cream. Hence the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that i would recommend this shaver based on performance to anyone that is looking for a high quality shaver for delicate skin.</li>
    <li> The use of good, very convenient.A good choice。The use of good, very convenient.A good choice。The use of good, very convenient.A good choice</li>
    <li> Does not cut very close and will not cut long hairs. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this buy a old cheap one it will work better.</li>
    <li> I owned Norelco razors for years and was pretty satisfied with them.  I decided to try a more &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; razor and purchased a Panasonic razor.  I used it until the battery died.  It was OK, but required more passes then the Norelco razors to get a clean shave.  My beard tends to lay down quickly and the Panasonic&#x27;s foil head just didn&#x27;t seem to pick up the hairs as well as the slotted head of the Norelco.  With the death of the Panasonic I decided to move back to the Norelco.  So far I am happy that I did.  The new heads are terrific.  The shave is close and quick.  I&#x27;ve had a little razor burn, but not much and should subside once I get used to the heads again.  There have been some complaints with the trimmer and I have to agree it is not the best, but serves it purpose.  I get a little over a week on a charge.  Amazingly this model is still made in Holland.</li>
    <li> I like it so far. I think it does a great shave for an electric razor and coming with an extra head unit makes this a great value in my opinion. The only grip for me is I feel the trimmer part does not really do anything, I still have to use a razor to do any beard/side burn trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is kind of expected from me anyway so not the biggest deal in the world. I recommend this for sure to anyone looking for an electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the regular (non 3D) shavers for years and they&#x27;ve all worked acceptably well, until their cutting heads became worn. This 3D model seemed as good as the older styles at first, but as someone else has said, this shaver is rather abrasive with a dry shave, and does NOT shave the upper lip very well at all! In fact, it kind of attacks your upper lip area for some reason, and I think it has to do with the new design.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it and going back to the older style Norelco...&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE on October 24, 2013:  Note, I have reduced my rating on this product, to two stars from my original 3 star rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hadn&#x27;t taken this (1255X) shaver back yet, but instead I got a much cheaper Norelco (the AT790/40, which sells for $49.95 here on Amazon), and I have now compared the two shavers.  I am SHOCKED at how much better the CHEAPER model is than the 1255X. I highly recommend you DO NOT BUY the 1255X, it is a very flawed shaver!  As I said when I first wrote this review, the 3D/expensive 1255X is abrasive when used as a dry shaver, it does not shave the neck area or the upper lip very well at all, and basically it is not nearly as good a shaver as the cheaper model. By the way, even the trimmer on the cheaper model works better than the trimmer on the 1255X!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what Norelco thinks it&#x27;s doing here, selling a $49.95 razor (the AT790) that is noticeably better than their $215 dollar (Amazon&#x27;s prices here) shaver, but it sure doesn&#x27;t work for me. And now I&#x27;m returning my 1255X shaver to Costco. I&#x27;m just lucky that they will still refund my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is simple and clear:  Just buy two of the AT790s for a total of just under $100, and get a complete backup for less than half the cost of one of the more expensive 1255X/3D Norelcos.</li>
    <li> My Husband uses this product to replace another electric razor that lasted him for years. He consider this much better and if it holds up as long as the other one, and maintains its superior qualities, it will be worth the purchase price. Extremely&lt;br /&gt;happy with its performance and highly recommend it to other customers.</li>
