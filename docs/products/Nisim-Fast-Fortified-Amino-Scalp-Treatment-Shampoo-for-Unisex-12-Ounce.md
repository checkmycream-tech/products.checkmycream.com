      <li>I will try to add more info in a month to see how this product does.</li>
      <li>For this price, I would just buy an organic really healthy shampoo for volumizing.</li>
      <li>So hope this helps answer some people&#x27;s questions or concerns! :-)</li>
      <li>I LOVE the way my hair feels.  </li>
      <li>Ok so like everyone said already,it drys out your hair and it does have a smell to it.but my hair</li>
      <li>Something way better.</li>
      <li>My doctor says biotin helps promotes healthy hair,skin nails and over time can prevent hair loss..</li>
      <li>maybe they just noticed it more because they were paying attention to their hair more..</li>
      <li>I have to say I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
      <li>OK.</li>
      <li>down.its an ok produced.</li>
      <li>so I can compare aftar more time of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
      <li>once a week,(all this to keep it moisturized and healthy to minimize breakage and ensure a quicker growth)</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked better</li>
      <li>Thankfully!! :)</li>
      <li>My hair got more oily.</li>
      <li>Pretty sure it works!</li>
      <li>The other day I asked my best friend how my hair looked and</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself is fine</li>
      <li>It smelled fine.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;should be fine</li>
      <li>If you have color treated hair I would recommend the sulfate free version of the Nisim F.A.S.T. Shampoo.</li>
      <li>and I wish Nisim would make an unscented or lightly scented shampoo for those who don&#x27;t like walking around smelling like you just walked into a cheap perfume store.</li>
      <li>I bought one for my friend also , at the time , and she experienced the same as me.</li>
      <li>code I used for the free samples:&lt;br /&gt;FAST</li>
      <li>also wanted to mention Nisim has come out with a sulfate, paraben free verison</li>
      <li>It does smell good and makes your hair soft though.</li>
      <li>Despite the good reviews, I was still surprised that this seems to be working so noticeably.</li>
      <li>LUV FAST SHAMPOO GREAT FOR GROWFEST YOUR HAIR SUPER FAST!</li>
      <li>My hair grew significantly longer in the 3 months i&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
      <li>2 years ago chopped my super baby fine hair into a chin length bob.</li>
      <li>I LOVE NISIM FAST!</li>
      <li>the clean feel and smell of this</li>
      <li>Gets my hair clean.</li>
      <li>She said she used it too for growing her hair super long and was happy with it.</li>
      <li>nothing special with my hair.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing in the aspects of it giving you soft hair with volume and helps hair growth.</li>
      <li>So basically, my hair grew more than twice as fast</li>
      <li>The original shampoo with sulfate will strip the color right out of your hair.</li>
      <li>For most people that is way below normal but for me that is steady and more growth.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased, already got my second bottle.</li>
      <li>After about a week&#x27;s worth of use, I begin to see the acne subside.</li>
      <li>I read very positive reviews</li>
      <li>and I pretty lucky my hair grows about an 1inch per month..</li>
      <li>The smell is not at all as good as other reviews said it was.</li>
      <li>But, I bought a bottle of FAST shampoo, based on past experience with this wonderful shampoo, and began to see fast growth within two weeks.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t link it to the shampoo right away.</li>
      <li>Use some sort of oil treatment massage it into your scalp once or twice a week to promote blood circulation, eat right and exercise..</li>
      <li>have bleached blond hair that is thinning even more due to hypothyroid, so I am hoping to use this shampoo to grow it out fast so my hair gets healthier more quickly.</li>
      <li>but honestly I would rather have dry</li>
      <li>and if you go to their facebook page and click the \\&quot;click here for special offers\\&quot; in red top mid of page you can get this set for $20 with free</li>
      <li>I contacted the company directly to see if they could offer any free samples that way</li>
      <li>Okay, let me start off by saying my hair is on the fragile side.</li>
      <li>As with any product, you have to try it out first.</li>
      <li>and I can already tell my color is being faded FAST!</li>
      <li>and i will be buying more next month!</li>
      <li>and i will definitely buy more once i run out.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you deep condition pretty often.</li>
      <li>and I feel like they are closer to being able to get pulled back into my ponytail.</li>
      <li>My first purchase was shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I say 1-2 inches because I know my hair grew, but I don&#x27;t know the exact measurements.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Extremely drying to the hair. Didn&#x27;t suite my hair texture!</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> Despite the good reviews, I was still surprised that this seems to be working so noticeably. Really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviewers mention that it dries your hair out - which it really does, but not as dramatically as some people mentioned. I&#x27;ve solved this by only using this shampoo every OTHER time I wash my hair, and making sure to use a strong conditioner along with it.</li>
    <li> Okay, let me start off by saying my hair is on the fragile side. It isn&#x27;t very thick and it fries and breaks off easily. My hair was to the middle of my back and I LOVED IT! I have naturally medium brown hair but I liked to dye it myself to a dark mahogany brown. And then I decided to go blonde with some light brown lowlights mixed in...BAD IDEA. I loved the way the blonde looked on me, but the bleach just absolutely KILLED my hair. Over the course of a year it slowly broke my hair off, making it shorter and shorter. I finally decided to go back brunette because I was so upset about my hair breaking off. My hairdresser dyed it back and trimmed the dead ends off to help jump start the growth. By the end of it all my hair was just passed my shoulders in length. I was DEVISTATED! I wanted my long hair back so bad! I tried everything. Taking vitamins, using a hair glaze twice a week, a hair masque once a week, a home deep conditioning treatment once a week,(all this to keep it moisturized and healthy to minimize breakage and ensure a quicker growth) I only used heat on it when necessary and always used a heat protector spray. And it seemed to grow to a certain length and stay there. Just above the middle area of my boob. (Just above the nipple) I found out about the Nisim F.A.S.T. shampoo while searching online for hair growth methods. And I was very skeptical. I did my research. Watched many YouTube reviews and read reviews people wrote on it, and from what I got from that was it seemed to work on a little over half of the people. So I decided to test it out and see. A lot of people claimed the shampoo really dried out their hair, I didn&#x27;t notice that it did. But I continued to use my intense conditioning as I did before so maybe that&#x27;s why. Also people complained about the smell. The smell didn&#x27;t really bother me. It does not smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like other shampoos. It really just smells like \\&quot;clean.\\&quot; Like soap. Not a floral or fruity scent. For me my bottle lasted a little over 2 months, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday like it says to. I wash mine every other day. By the end of the bottle, so about 2 months time of use, my hair had grown about an inch and a half. Hair normally grows at a rate of 1/4 inch a month, and that&#x27;s about how fast mine grew. But it broke off so much it was as if it really didn&#x27;t grow. So basically, my hair grew more than twice as fast it&#x27;s normal rate! I am very satisfied! My hair is now passed my nipple and I&#x27;m about to buy my second bottle. So, in all, I would recommend this product to at least try out. If you have color treated hair I would recommend the sulfate free version of the Nisim F.A.S.T. Shampoo. The original shampoo with sulfate will strip the color right out of your hair. I personally didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner because I wanted to still condition my hair with what I normally did and it didn&#x27;t seem to matter that I didn&#x27;t use it. Anyway, sorry for such a long review, but I really wanted everyone to know my hair background and my complete experience with this product. So hope this helps answer some people&#x27;s questions or concerns! :-)</li>
    <li> I have to say that I honestly did not like this shampoo, it didn&#x27;t make my hair look awful or anything, but it did make my scalp break out and itch. I guess I must have had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients in the shampoo, so if you have a sensitive scalp, I would not recommend this shampoo, but it could work for you. As with any product, you have to try it out first. I have seen positive reviews for this shampoo, so obviously it does work for most people. I&#x27;m sad it didn&#x27;t work for me, but oh well :(</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but in this case I had too..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a double process blonde and I pretty lucky my hair grows about an 1inch per month.. However, after some breakage and a bang cut that went horribly wrong.. I decided why not it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try to see if my hair would grow a little faster..&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if this product does help your hair grow faster because its only been a week.. During the past week and following directions my hair has turned into straw and turned brittle.&lt;br /&gt;One cause of that is because shampooing your hair everyday is not good for you hair especially if you are a double process or use any other chemicals in your hair... After my hair turning into straw after a weeks use, I decided to research their claims if you use fast shampoo your hair will grow faster...&lt;br /&gt;They claim that there shampoo FAST can grow you hair faster is confusing for me.. I googled and researched there ingredients and did not find anything that can make the hair grow faster..&lt;br /&gt;Yes biotin is in their ingredients, BIOTIN DOES NOT help with hair growth.. My doctor says biotin helps promotes healthy hair,skin nails and over time can prevent hair loss.. especially patients with thyroid disease.. There is no scientific proof biotin can speed up hair growth.. So I&#x27;m baffled..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m  not saying people that use this that claim that their hair grew faster are not telling the truth... maybe they just noticed it more because they were paying attention to their hair more.. The testimonials I watched and read seem pretty average rate of growth.. But there is no product ingredient in that shampoo that can speed up growth..&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money especially if you have chemically processed hair.. Buy some biotin for healthy hair, usually biotin takes up to 2 months for it effects to work.. Use some sort of oil treatment massage it into your scalp once or twice a week to promote blood circulation, eat right and exercise.. Oh and say away fromheat as much as possible..&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say after one week I&#x27;m stopping using FAST shampoo and conditioner and going back to my regular routine.. My regular shampoo and conditioner never dried out my hair like this!!!</li>
    <li> My wife reported soon after getting it that her hair began falling out.  Unfortunately, this becomes one of those closet stuffers of unfinished products that promised things it didn&#x27;t deliver on.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product works great for my hair..after using it for just one week I  have noticed way less hair loss and normally my hair is all over after a shower or brushing and combing it,since using this product that is not the case at all my hair seems healthier and a lot fuller..and if it helps some I am African American...</li>
    <li> Pretty sure it works! My hair has grown fast. Thankfully!! :)</li>
    <li> THIS WORKED. MY DAUGTHERS HAIR GREW WAY FAST. AWESOME PRODUCT</li>
    <li> This shampoo did not help with any growth, it only dried it out and my mlhair brittle.</li>
    <li> Nothing as expected and advertised. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle and hair longer in a month , but I went trough the whole battle and haven&#x27;t seen any change , my hair didn&#x27;t look any better . A little too dry instead. The smell is not at all as good as other reviews said it was. Not too expensive , but still for the price you can find sulfate free shampoo that are gentle and don&#x27;t dehydrate your scalp and are not texted on animals ( for anyone who cares about that ). I bought one for my friend also , at the time , and she experienced the same as me. I wanted to try , but first and last time</li>
    <li> It has been almost 2 months... my hair has grown maybe a half inch or so. I follow the directions. Lather... massage in my scalp. I let it sit for at least 30 seconds. I rinse and repeat. But nope.. nothing special with my hair. The shampoo itself is fine I guess. Gets my hair clean. My hair is fine and gets oily if I dont wash it daily, so no issues with drying out like some other reviewers. But ultimately my hair isn&#x27;t growing any faster.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is only commercial it dint make my hair grow and I massaged my scalp with it for 30 min. and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair grow don&#x27;t waste your money this shampoo is only commercial this shampoo doesn&#x27;t  even make your hair soft.</li>
    <li> Hey guys I am starting it of with 4 stars.I have never Reyes this shampoo but I am going to try it out!I may lower the stars to 3 because a lot of people said that it dryers their hair out but some people said it maid their hair oily but honestly I would rather have dry hair.:)but honistly I have really silly hair so I am looking forward to long silky hair!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t progressed in growth at all I&#x27;m kinda upset cuz I spent 25 dollars on this product and it sux</li>
    <li> My hair grew significantly longer in the 3 months i&#x27;ve been using it.  I would recommend this to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;I massage my scalp with this every time i wash my hair.</li>
    <li> worked well on my daughters hair gave her volume that other hair products did not work for her hair type.</li>
    <li> I am giving 2 stars because the shipping was excellent. However the product itself was the worst purchase I have ever made. I read the reviews and saw that some women had bad experiences, thinking it might be a 1/100 bad review, I ordered the product anyways. I should have listened to those other ladies. I bought the shampoo, not the conditioner because I read the shampoo really dries out your hair, so I paired it with the Aussie Moist conditioner. Unfortunately even the conditioner couldn&#x27;t repair the damage this shampoo has done. Not only have I noticed no change in my hair growth but my hair started getting extremely dry and breaking, it felt like straw! Within a few days I started loosing clumps of hair. So I discontinued use after about 2 weeks. A month later I am still pulling chunks of hair from my head throughout the day..</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! I am growing out a pixie cut and I wanted to help my hair grow faster (it&#x27;s slow growing typically). I read on several hair blogs that this was recommended. I am four months in so far, and I&#x27;ve gone from a short pixie and am almost to a stacked bob. This is well worth the extra expense over a drugstore brand. The last time I grew my hair out I used regular shampoo, and this time it&#x27;s growing out much faster. For me, that&#x27;s all the proof I need. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it doesn&#x27;t bother me, either. My first purchase was shampoo and conditioner. When I ran out, I purchased the shampoo only the second time around. My regular conditioner works fine in conjunction.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it. I lathered up the shampoo like the bottle said and massaged it into my scalp; it left my hair sooo soft and bouncy! It&#x27;s too early to know if it&#x27;s helped my hair grow but I would keep buying it just because of how amazing my hair feels.</li>
    <li> Nice product works well</li>
    <li> I cut my hair super short about 5 months ago and it has not been growing the way I wanted it too. I stumbled upon Fast and read all the good and bad reveiws , I was skeptical but hopeful. I have used this product for a month now, every other day . My hair has definitly grown and my husband can tell. I have not measured the inches however before I started I had just alittle hair coming out at a pony tail and now I have enough hair that I can actually put it in a pony tail and curly it. I would by this agian , I have a goal of my hair down to the middle of my back and I am ecstatic at the progress so far. Here&#x27;s to long hair again!! I will update again in another couple weeks. (The bad) does dry hair out, make sure to use a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair extremely dry. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> I ordered this product twice and it dried out my hair very badly. I had read that in some of the reviews but wanted to try it anyway. I purchased two bottles and used as directed and my results were dried out hair and breakage. I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAMPOO FOR GROWING HAIR REALLY HELPS WITH GROWING HAIR.I WOULD TRULY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I never get acne anymore, but although I REALLY wanted to love this product, it dried out my scalp EXTREMELY and caused large cystic acne all over my head and hairline. I didn&#x27;t link it to the shampoo right away. Only as it started to get much worse did I think back about what changed and immediately stopped using this product. On a positive note, I did notice new hairs popping up (that&#x27;s why it gets 2 stars), but boy was it NOT worth it. PASS on this one.</li>
    <li> LUV FAST SHAMPOO GREAT FOR GROWFEST YOUR HAIR SUPER FAST! I HIGHLY APPROVE OF THE SHAMPOO  IF REALLY THANK YOU</li>
    <li> best shampoo i have ever used</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! I went and got a haircut that I totally regretted (not the first time!). I was miserable (and still am - it&#x27;s only been a month). But, I bought a bottle of FAST shampoo, based on past experience with this wonderful shampoo, and began to see fast growth within two weeks. Normally, my hair grows 5/8ths of an inch a month. (Yes, I&#x27;ve measured it. Again, this isn&#x27;t my first miserable, regrettable haircut.) But, every time I use this shampoo, it doubles my hair growth to 1.25 inches a month. Additionally, I suffer from acne on the scalp. FAST is wonderful for my scalp acne, as well. After about a week&#x27;s worth of use, I begin to see the acne subside. I&#x27;m a believer! Thank you Nisim!</li>
    <li> Using for a week. So far, not enough time to see any results in growing hair. I&#x27;ve photographed the hair&#x27;s lenght so I can compare aftar more time of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Some people complained about feeling the hair drier. I&#x27;ve seen just the opposite. My hair got more oily.</li>
    <li> This product, along with the Nisim Fast Conditioner, did make my hair grow 1-2 inches in a month. I say 1-2 inches because I know my hair grew, but I don&#x27;t know the exact measurements. I know it grew at least an inch. When I started, the hair on the crown of my head to the tips of my hair was 14\\&quot;, now it is 16\\&quot;. Very pleased with this product and will continue to use it.   My only complaint is that I started to get bumps on my scalp. I don&#x27;t know if it was from the use of these two products or if it was something else, but it did not occur until after I started using the products. Hope this review helped. :)</li>
    <li> I just got this two days ago. So far, I have used a quarter sized amount in the shower two days in a row. It lathers up well, and I tried to scrub it into my scalp the best I could. It seems to rinse out well, but my hair did feel like a brillo pad after it was all rinsed out. I used a lot of Pantene conditioner next, which made my hair soften very quickly so I don&#x27;t feel like the dryness will be a permanent thing. It smelled fine. I use a wide toothed comb in the shower to comb out my hair, while the conditioner is in it, so I don&#x27;t have any tangles when I get out of the shower, and so I lose less hair that way. I have really thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bleached blond hair that is thinning even more due to hypothyroid, so I am hoping to use this shampoo to grow it out fast so my hair gets healthier more quickly. I am also going to take biotin supplements. I will try to add more info in a month to see how this product does. A few other websites listed it as a good shampoo for hair growth so I thought I would try it. I did not buy the conditioner that goes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update after a month -&lt;br /&gt;My hair was not growing out at all and this shampoo made my hair feel no better than a regular generic basic shampoo from the store after a month of use. I am not buying it again for the price! For this price, I would just buy an organic really healthy shampoo for volumizing. Something way better. Cause I felt like I was using Suave for .97 from Target.</li>
    <li> So, the only time i&#x27;ve ever had long hair was when i was young until my mom decided to chop it off. I&#x27;ve tried different products and this was my miracle in a bottle. I was skeptical at first, but i decided to order this anyways without the conditioner. This has worked wonders for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday since March 8th, and my hair has grown alot.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wear 18&amp;#34; extensions because my hair is a little past shoulder length and i&#x27;ve been wanting long hair. The other day I asked my best friend how my hair looked and she was shocked that i wasn&#x27;t wearing extensions. My hair is now at mid back length and it&#x27;s still growing.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells amazing and i will definitely buy more once i run out.</li>
    <li> I bot this shampoo and the pakech didnt have my shampoo i ask the fedex he said he didnt no nothing</li>
    <li> This works! 2 years ago chopped my super baby fine hair into a chin length bob. It was cute, but I started wanting long hair again and was impatient with how slow my hair grows so my hair stylist suggested I use this. She said she used it too for growing her hair super long and was happy with it. I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner and washed my hair every other day. I know the package says to wash your hair daily but I only usually wash my hair 2 times a week so I switched to every other day using this shampoo. The conditioner was not moisturizing enough for the ends of my hair so I stopped using the conditioner and just used the shampoo. I noticed my hair growing much faster than it usually does. I suggest buying the shampoo but not the conditioner and using a very moisturizing conditioner with it because the shampoo does dry the hair out more than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used. So to combat the dryness, get a nicer conditioner like Pureology&#x27;s - the purple one. And then use a weekly moisture mask and that should help how dry your hair gets using this. But I truly think it works well! I went through 2 bottles of the shampoo until my hair was finally a nice length and I switched back to my Pureology brand shampoo.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any negative effect on my hair but I don&#x27;t think it grew anymore then it normally does without use of this products.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> First, it smells terrible! Second, the top was broken when I got it. Third I didn&#x27;t see any results! Terrible product, save your money!</li>
    <li> Same review as the conditioner. This did nothing for my hair at all. May work for others but not for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, it works, has a good clean scent to it too.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, you won&#x27;t grow 20 inches over night but it really does seem to work. I&#x27;ve gone from about 3 inch hair length to about 5 inches I think in about 4 or 5 weeks? Just a guesstimation though.</li>
    <li> Definetely noticed growth, also my hair is stronger and thicker. Very pleased, already got my second bottle. My hair feels very soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Probably not many reviews out there by guys.  so here it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 17 year old white male.  and after a bad hair cut that left me with about an inch of hair i decided i needed something to help my hair grow fast.  i found this product online and decided to give it a shot.  so i ordered it off of here and to my surprise the product actually worked.  my hair grows about a quarter inch per month in normal conditions.  after a week i realized that my hair was growing a quarter inch a WEEK!!  i was able to get two months out of a single bottle and with that my hair grew about 2-2 1/2 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the results of this product and would recommend it to anyone who is recovering from a bad haircut or wanting to grow their hair out.</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL RESULTS! atleast half an inch! maybe even more! i bought this 21 days ago... AND my hair barley covered my ears, my bangs went a little past the tip of my nose... so atleast 17 days of faithfully using, my hair is now to my sholders, and my bangs are past my lips! I LOVE NISIM FAST! Being young in a very judgemental society it has helped me gain my confisence! i love this stuff and i will be buying more next month! i use it once a night!the conditior is NOT worth the money in my opinion. BAD PART it drys out your hair, BUT i use a deep conditioner made by l&#x27;oreal that i leave in 5 minutes and it is as soft as can be! nisim fast, we are going to be best buds for sure!!!</li>
    <li> My niece loves it and it really works on her ..her hair has gotten thicker and longer I went ahead and ordered another one</li>
    <li> The Shampoo does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s heavily scented and I wish Nisim would make an unscented or lightly scented shampoo for those who don&#x27;t like walking around smelling like you just walked into a cheap perfume store.</li>
    <li> Godd shampoo but you have to use it every day!it really helped me to grow my hair!Thank you,will by again.</li>
    <li> Got this shampoo awhile ago, didn&#x27;t write a review til I could see any results.&lt;br /&gt;Yes this shampoo had my hair growing faster then usual.&lt;br /&gt;Love the clean feel and smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.  Hair grew at least four inches in 8 months</li>
    <li> Not sulfate-free! Says its safe for color-treated hair, but I have hardly used it and I can already tell my color is being faded FAST!</li>
    <li> This product surprisingly worked wonders. Use it like it says (don&#x27;t use the conditioner), and really massage your scalp. It will dry it out, but it works to cancel out a bad haircut in a matter of a few days/weeks.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this and I have already reorder it. We have taken pictures of her hair growth over the last 3 months.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working and it makes your hair Extremely SOFT also. My daughters hair has grown at least an inch so far.</li>
    <li> OK. I have to say I don&#x27;t know for sure if this works.  I am using it in combination with biotin and MSM.  But I have used it every day as directed.  Due to age and thyroid problems, my hair grows about 3 inches a year.  I have been using the Biotin and MSM for 3 months now and the shampoo for about a month.  In that time, I have seen my hair grow about an inch (as measured by me not dying my hair).  For most people that is way below normal but for me that is steady and more growth.  So I give it a thumbs up but again, I cannot say that I have had that growth due to the shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback is that it is very drying.  I have oily hair so when I read other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t worried.  But no....it is EXTREMELY drying.  I am talking you have to deep condition every other day just to keep your hair from not feeling and looking like straw.  Consequently, I have stopped dying my hair because I was worried about it healthiness.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!  It has worked wonders for some and seems to be helping me and your hair cannot grow any slower than mine used to!  Just make sure you deep condition pretty often.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my head itch like crazy! I wouldn&#x27;t buy anymore.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo about a week ago.  I use it just like it says and I do wash it twice.  It suds up a lot so a little goes a long way.  I still use my regular conditioner or a leave in conditioner.  I have to wash my hair everyday before work because it makes it easier when I pull it up.  I LOVE the way my hair feels.  I work with all men and they have been petting my head because they say my hair is so silky lol.  Like I said I have only used this a week but I feel like my hair is growing faster.  I am growing out my bangs and I feel like they are closer to being able to get pulled back into my ponytail. The only thing I would say could be a negative is the smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it stinks but it isn&#x27;t my favorite smell.  It&#x27;s kind of bland, but my conditioner overpowers the smell of the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Excellent for hair, beautiful smell, very efficient .</li>
    <li> So glad I took a chance on the Nisim hair care line! This shampoo is amazing in the aspects of it giving you soft hair with volume and helps hair growth. I made sure to do my roots prior to starting this to track my growth, and my hair definitely grew faster then usually. I had small roots 2 weeks after. This shampoo is excellent. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> In reading all the reviews good and bad I was totally confused about whether or not I wanted to try this product. I wanted all the benefits that were mentioned but then there were just some nasty reviews that nearly scared me away. I contacted the company directly to see if they could offer any free samples that way I wouldn&#x27;t be out $25 if I didn&#x27;t like it. They emailed me a code and all I had to pay was shipping (around $6) I received the samples like in 2 days and I love it. I love the smell and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel hard at all, it actually feels soft after using the conditioner. I&#x27;m african american and I have type 4 hair. I just started using it so I haven&#x27;t checked my length.&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention Nisim has come out with a sulfate, paraben free verison and if you go to their facebook page and click the \\&quot;click here for special offers\\&quot; in red top mid of page you can get this set for $20 with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The code I used for the free samples:&lt;br /&gt;FAST Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST 2oz (2 Pak) Shampoo and Conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;Coupon code: SUFSA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail Value of $12.80 for the set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...if the code I was given doesn&#x27;t work for you just email them, they are very nice and helpful (o&#x3D;</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for a shampoo but I have not noticed any hair growth, other than what I normally expect. It is drying and will strip color out of hair but for me, has not worked as far as helping my hair grow.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this shampoo!!!!!! I read all of the reviews and was a bit weary at first but after my first bottle I was hooked. I followed the reviews and paired it with Aussie 3-minute conditioner and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> it works to grow longer hair just as the bottle says!</li>
    <li> I got this on a whim HOPING it would work because I got an awful mullet-looking haircut. 3 weeks later my hair is a whole inch longer. Must be the shampoo-- I didn&#x27;t buy the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS a little bit drying (but I&#x27;m not sure since I have been swimming more, it might be the pool) so I use a deep conditioner every time. Also I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily, usually every 2, 3 days.</li>
    <li> Ok so like everyone said already,it drys out your hair and it does have a smell to it.but my hair does seam to be a bite longer over a month of useing this.it also stoped my hair from comming out so much when i was useing reg shapoo.so it gives your hair a lot of body if thats what u want.it seams longer because it took away alot of my curls,because it ways my hair down.its an ok produced.</li>
    <li> This stuff really does work, when I use it my hair feels stronger, longer and so much healthier. Great product!</li>
    <li> my hair only grew a quarter of an inch in 1 month. It does smell good and makes your hair soft though.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo even though it makes my hair dry but I have no problem because I do use hair cream after it</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to work. I have been growing out my hair to donate it. I saw the other reviews about it drying out your hair and I thought, \\&quot;should be fine I have oily hair anyway; maybe it will balance out.\\&quot; WRONG dried out my hair! Wish it would have worked, but plain and simple it did not work for ME. I did like the smell though and packaging was great.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I fell for the \\&quot;grow your hair faster\\&quot; crap and bought the F.A.S.T Shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used it for one month and noticed NOTHING!!!!  I am very disappointed, but then I guess I knew better.  Nothing can actually make your hair grow faster than the average half an inch per month!!!!</li>
    <li> I started to losse hair, big area, at a point that I started to become bald. I tried quiet a few products includint vitamins and nothing worked. I found this product while searching for something else. I read very positive reviews and I decided to give a try. I don&#x27;t regret it. About teo weeks after started to use this product, new hair started to grow. At firts, I started to use this shampoo like 3 times aweek, then twice a week. I now try to use it at leadt once a week. This product really worked for me.</li>
