      <li>It works great and can be used without having to change to other conditioners to get the same effect.</li>
      <li>If you have shorter hair and don&#x27;t over-wash your hair, this large 16.9 oz.</li>

      <li>yet it&#x27;s somehow light and absorbent without weighing down my hair or making it greasy (despite the fact that my skin and scalp tend to get oily).</li>
      <li>Really brings back life.</li>
      <li>I use it with every shampoo, since my hair is now so blonde and, therefore, requires intense nutrition and moisture.</li>
      <li>I alternate between this and the Absolute.</li>
      <li>When I am especially dry or will be out in the sun all day I will leave some in after a shower or apply to damp hair as a leave in...be sure to rinse away from neck and hairline as it can cause small blemishes due to its rich emulisfiers</li>
      <li>I prefer the Age supreme for my fine thin hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect.....love this stuff. Hard to get in salon now... this is same stuff less expensive.</li>
    <li> When I went back to very blonde, my hairdresser recommended this conditioner. It is by L&#x27;Oreal, but it isn&#x27;t the same L&#x27;Oreal that&#x27;s sold in drugstores. It is much better, sold to hair stylists by the representatives who visit salons and boutiques. Thanks to Amazon, we the customers can now purchase it for home use. I use it with every shampoo, since my hair is now so blonde and, therefore, requires intense nutrition and moisture. This conditioner smells clean and lovely, and it helps control dryness and frizz, yet it&#x27;s somehow light and absorbent without weighing down my hair or making it greasy (despite the fact that my skin and scalp tend to get oily). At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about the price, but it really is worth it. If you have shorter hair and don&#x27;t over-wash your hair, this large 16.9 oz. tub will last a very long time, making it even more cost effective.</li>
    <li> works amazing but it&#x27;s so full of chemicals..I&#x27;d love to find a more natural alternative...</li>
    <li> Good stuff, great price</li>
    <li> My hairstylist recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I have really dry hair and it seems to do the trick. I have bought numerous times and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I prefer the Age supreme for my fine thin hair</li>
    <li> I have curly hair that I usually straighten out plus I color treat my hair. This product is the best I&#x27;ve found and it only takes the tiniest amount. The big tub has lasted over a year. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for many years as a daily conditioner. I have long highlighted hair and it is very healthy as a result.</li>
    <li> Got this a year ago and live the change in my hair! My hair is dry and it gives it the moisture it lacks, I use it every three days and leave it on for at least 3 min!</li>

    <li> Won&#x27;t be without... very nutrient intense, maybe not for fine hair...I have blonde curly hair, often dry..this is mothers little helper for hair.

    <li> I am a pretty thrifty girl. I think most hair products are overpriced and overrated. However, the L&#x27;Oreal professional series is Superior stuff. This hair mask took my dry coarse hair and made a noticeably softer difference. I use it twice a week at first, Then weekly, now it is about once a month. I have a lot of very thick dry hair. I don&#x27;t need much project to saturate my lochs. I&#x27;ll buy it again (in a year) when I run out. I use it in Conjunction with Suave keratin shampoo and conditioner. It is two bucks a bottle and is almost as good as the L&#x27;Oreal kerastos.</li>
    <li> Best hair conditioner ever.  Have used it for years and takes just a dime size for soft beautiful hair. All my family uses it also.</li>
    <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
    <li> AMAZING STUFF!!!!  I have thick course black irish hair and this stuff keeps it soft and manageable as well as keeps my glossing nice and shining from the salon.  A must have for anyone with think or course hair...trust me...it took years to find this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the only conditioner that truly works on my hair: fine, frizzy, chemically treated hair.  I love it and use it every 3-4 days.</li>

    <li> Love this hair repair. It works great for adding moisture to your hair and controlling the friz look. Much more reasonable to pay this amount as salons tend to double their price.</li>
    <li> Really great conditioner.  Once you find out what you beautician uses on your hair go out and buy it.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have ever used! Great for dry, damaged, or color treated hair. Really brings back life. Try with L&#x27;oreal Serie Expert Power vial (only need to use the vial every 5-6 weeeks) to keep hair in good condition.</li>
