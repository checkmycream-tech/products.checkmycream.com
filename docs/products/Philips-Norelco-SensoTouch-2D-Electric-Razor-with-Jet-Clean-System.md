<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Meets &amp; Exceeds my expectations! This was a gift to my 19year old son and he looks amazing everytime he uses this Razor!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this razor, I like the look, I like the features, but just like razors of 5 years ago the shave is horrible.  I don&#x27;t have super thick facial hair and it still misses a lot on my face.  To get done what I could do with a Mach 3 takes me 5 times longer with this and my face is torn up afterwards.  They say to give your face a good month to get used to it, I have given it a year and it still sucks.  I should have given up during the money back guarantee period.  Save your money, buy a good blade, or maybe try a safety razor, that&#x27;s my next adventure on the quest for a better shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my father. I have the SensoTouch 3D (which I love by the way), and my father has come over and tried mine out a few times, but didn&#x27;t want the same one and color as mine. So I found this one which is almost as good as the 3D in every way (almost, but I got this one a lot cheaper). It shaves for and against the grain very well, and it holds a long charge and cleans very easily.</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my son and said he loves how close a shave he gets. He also likes that he can use any shaving gel or shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This electronic razor is wonderful</li>
    <li> For my entire life, I&#x27;ve always used foil type electric razors.  I kept seeing the commercials about these, and when my razor died, finally decided to make the switch.  It took my beard about 2 weeks to adjust to this new razor.  However, I can run it across my face 2-3 times and my face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Lol!  I open mine after each use, dump the hairs and tap the 3 shaving heads against the sink to clear it out.  Every 2 days or so, I take the little brush and clean it out real good, and once a month use the cleaning system.  I use mine until the battery is completely dead, and have so since day one. So, I don&#x27;t actually have to charge my razor but every 3 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a high-quality razor that performs well, and actually meets all the hype in the videos.  It&#x27;s worth every dollar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves close and quickly without too many passes&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t yank, snag, or pull hairs&lt;br /&gt;Battery stays charged very long time between charges&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable to hold and use</li>
    <li> Very nice so far!  The last time I used an electric razor was about 15 years ago and didn&#x27;t like the experience.  It also was a tri-head model, but it didn&#x27;t work very well.  This one shaves quite nicely, and the self-cleaning feature is nice.  I rinse it myself in water cleaning it the best I can and then use the self-clean to extend the cleaning fluid life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it about a month and a half, so I can&#x27;t speak as to the durability of the product, but I have been happy with other aspects of it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really know where to easily buy more of the jet-clean fluid, however, unless I want to purchase it online as well.  I suppose I will have to.  I don&#x27;t see it in any local stores.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of getting all the whiskers and the base cleans the head very good.Would recommend it to buy.</li>
    <li> Everything we expected and more!</li>
    <li> the best shaving solution, use it in the shower with shave cream, rinse it under the shower head, then put it in the cleaner pod. The cleaning cycle automatically dips the shaver in some poured-in Norelco Jet Clean solution several times while activating it, providing a ready to use, lubricated clean rotary shaver the next use. Very innovative since I remember having to take apart my old razor, clean it with a brush, stubble everywhere, and it always seemed to give me razor burn or some skin irritation from skin bacteria residue left on the blades. Great product, lets see how long it lasts :)</li>
    <li> When this razor disposed to 60 dollars after you used a coupon, i ordered it without hesitation.the jet clean system is worth to buy and it&#x27;s so cool, even i love it without considering the cleaning result.</li>
    <li> The cleaner/charger station broke after 2 months of use.  The Shaver works great but now is in need of a new razor (supposed to last 1 year)</li>
    <li> Not impress at all, is to big, probably next time I will go for Brown products</li>
    <li> Hubby has had this system before and was very pleased!  This awesome price can&#x27;t be beat for everything you get!!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Norelco shavers for decades (yeah, we&#x27;re that old) and we&#x27;ve always bought &amp;#34;the best and brightest&amp;#34; when the previous version stopped shaving really well. We&#x27;ve had the shaver for a couple months and this is BY FAR the best they&#x27;ve made. The shave is close and comfortable whether your beard is dry or wet, with a day of stubble or a long-weekend&#x27;s worth. I had assumed the &amp;#34;Jet CleanSystem&amp;#34; was just another cute gimmick... WRONG. This this ROCKS. It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver every other morning. It is also easy to clean manually, something not to be said for several of their previous versions. When one of us travels on business now, a serious battle ensues over who gets to have &amp;#34;the cool razor&amp;#34; and who has to use &amp;#34;that old one&amp;#34; for a week. Odd to write a rave over a bathroom appliance, but this is a really superb buy.</li>
    <li> The razor was easy to charge and clean.  My husband really likes the way it shaves.  He&#x27;s had a couple of different razors in the last few years, and this is the best.</li>
    <li> SHAVE SHAVE I HATE TO SHAVE- I ALWAYS USED TO RANT AND RAVE BUT WITH THE NEW NORELCO 1160 MY HONEY BOUGHT ME YOU KNOW I KNOW LOVE TO SHAVE-HMMMM-HMMMM------GEORGE W.</li>
    <li> Have owned several Norelco shavers over the years. This is the far best of he lot, one you get used to it and let it glide over your skin.</li>
    <li> It is everything that I expected; it&#x27;s also a replacement for my older norelco shaver,which I believe to be the best for me.</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave -no skin irritation even though I had never used anything but a blade for 40 years. very good product.!</li>
    <li> Philips is my only choice when coming to electrical shaver, period. I used other brands before, Panxxxx, Brxxx, and I want waste no time no those brands no more. Anyway, just my preference.</li>
    <li> Great razor ! Works great and doesn&#x27;t give me razor burn. I have a very sensitive face and constantly cut my self with a bladed razor. This works great and my face was smooth even after the first shave ( takes a couple weeks for  the razor to get best results ) any way love it</li>
    <li> Such a good razor! The greatest thing about this electric razor is that it includes the cleanSystem. Oh and the thing is freaking waterproof!</li>
    <li> yes, I admire this brand very much. in fact, I used Philips so many years. Norelco is very expensive shaver for me. I very enjoy this product because it is smooth and easy to take.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, I plan to buy it again when I need</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric in over a decade.  I wet shave with an old school saftey razor while my Dad has progressed through the Norelco line since day one.  My last Norelco was the 985, purchased I believe in 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue was simple, lots of beard, couldn&#x27;t get close enough, much neck irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned to my Dad that I wanted to try an electric that I could wet shave with, and he surprised me later that evening when I arrived for a visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several shaves since with multiple levels of growth and I am in love.  I brush on my favorite soap and wet shave with this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a shave it provides.  After not using an electric in two decades, I am glad to report that it is everything I could ask for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting head is sublime, and it wet shaves like a dream, with nary a sound.  Works great dry too, but if possible, I like a Wet Shave.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One improvement would be to provide a one button release for the shaver head, but I see that has been improved on the 3D model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok Norelco, I give.  You have won me back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 of these and both have failed for the same reason - the Jet Clean system produces an &amp;#34;not filled&amp;#34; error and it cannot be corrected. I&#x27;ve spoken with Phillips and they have no fix to offer.  There are 1000&#x27;s of similar complaints online, but Phillips has done nothing about them. The razors fine, but do not spend the extra money for the cleaning system.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my dad.So far he is very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This is about the sixth electric razor I&#x27;ve used.  This is the best one I&#x27;ve come across yet. If you travel this is a must.</li>
    <li> This is a good use of the razor, very comfortable, clean and convenient, but also suitable for use with out</li>
    <li> This razor truly has it all. I bought it for my husband and after using an old one for 5 years he was thrilled to see the wet/dry feature and the flexibility of the blades.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have Had yet. The Jet Clean System keeps razor at top performance, always count on a close shave!</li>
    <li> The razor was easy to charge and clean. i am very satisfied with the way it works. The shave is close and leaves face smooth.</li>
    <li> The jetclean system that came included with this item never worked properly, and package was past return date when I finally figured that out.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the new design, but I was wrong.  I LOVE the cleaner/charger accessory.  Close and comfortable, this is probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this razor. It is just what he wanted for his birthday. He has cancer and so easy for Him to use. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Really smooth shave and the clean up is a breeze.  I definitely think using the cleaning solution every other shave is the way to go.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever own!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my man to use at my house so he didn&#x27;t have to bring a shaving kit when he stayed over. Now it is his favorite. May have to buy him another for Xmas.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
    <li> brand new, good quality, but if you want to shave 100%, use non electric razors like gillete mach 3 or fusion.... when i shaved on my skin appeared eruptions and it&#x27;s hurted like woun ... I don&#x27;t recommend to that persons who use non-electric razors</li>
    <li> Ordered from Australia. There was no note that it would be a US power point plug. Had to buy an adaptor to suit. Product works great thanks , Janine</li>
    <li> This razor FINALLY has me not second guessing my decision to go electric. Every time my other electric razors made me spend five minutes on one spot, I vowed to give up. With this razor, that&#x27;s all in the past. 2 Minutes - Done!</li>
    <li> Great shave, and close. I prefer the bald look. Every morning I shave my face and scalp, and afterwards the smooth skill is appealing. The kid has a traveling charger and a home based charger. The home base brings a solution to clean (pour into the cavity of the base) the heads numerous times. Great machine. As for price in comparing outlet and store, Amazon gave me the better price. I recommend this product unconditional.</li>
    <li> razor is good direction on how to use the cleaner hard to understand pictures dont help better direction needed will be ol</li>
    <li> A very good razor that took no time at all to get use to. Wet or dry I get a great shave.</li>
    <li> Perfect razor, quite quiet, easy to clean especially with cleaning system.</li>
    <li> Great product as usual. Have used Norelco for years.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Does a nice job with a close shave and is quick and cleans up easily.</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;Philips Norelco 1160X/47 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor with Jet CleanSystem&amp;#34; to replace my blade razor and a broken Walmart electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow is this thing smooth. Close, smooth shave that doesn&#x27;t tug at all! Will cut through 1/8&amp;#34; thick stubble without any pulling. The one star was docked because the power of the razor left a bit to be desired, needing to go back for a couple passes to ensure everything was cut. With that said, this lack of power might lead to less tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning kit was a charm, makes the razor smell very nice, but I do the daily clean (opening and shaking) myself. Weekly clean using the station. This thing holds a charge! Will easily go a week with daily use not needing a charge.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to purchase the shaver. It doesn&#x27;t get super close. I shave my body with it and does a good job but wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you are getting it for face or head unless you don&#x27;t need it very close</li>
    <li> Such a great razor. This is my second one. I bought it as a replacement for one lost in a fire. They are both great but the first one did melt in the house fire. Many times I pop the head and clean it in the sink. Then I put it in the cleaning station to sanitize it.</li>
    <li> ITS THE PERFECT RAZOR. YOU FILL IT  SO SMOOTHLY, AND MY FACE  IS NO MORE IRRITATED. THE BATTERY FULLY CHARGED WORKS FOR 33 DAYS!!! AMAZING!!. AREALY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I got this razon for my husband for Christmas, he likes it a lot. I can&#x27;t really tell you much about how it works or feels since I don&#x27;t use it but he is very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> High quality and shave softly, charger quickly and the head cleaner is easy. Ergonomic it’s ok. I recommend this product</li>
    <li> received package on time and was pleased!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a Braun 5 series razor for well over a decade.  I bought it and liked it because I preferred the straight razor edge instead of the 3 circles.  However, when my razor died last fall, I went on the search for a replacement.  I ordered this one as a gold box special and have been thoroughly pleased with it.  The cut is close and clean.  The battery life is excellent.  I am very satisfied with this razor.</li>
    <li> Product looks good but is really noisy and find myself going over the same spot 100 times to try get a decent shave</li>
    <li> The product is good. I bought it for my father, and he likes it very much. And it deliever fast.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Phillips SensoTouch 2D shaver two days ago and surprisingly it arrived today!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received the item, I opened the box and used it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works like a charm, shaved all the spots nice and clean in which my old Phillips Philishave 686 couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> this is the best electric razor that i have ever bought. the main reason that i have bought this is self cleaning and wet/dry. the self cleaning feature is great everytime that i have ever used it. their is minimal irration with this when using it dry which is great. the wet feature with shaving is great when you have 5oclock shadow. finally great package deal for this and amazon hassle free packging is great nicely packed and saves money for you.</li>
    <li> After several try out, this one was my best.  works well dry, even with shavingcream.  No rash very clost shave and I also like the rotating motion which just picks up every bit of hair.  Thanks to Philips Norelco 1160X/47 Senso Touch</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my Dad as a Christmas present and when he received it he was so happy his smile when from ear to ear.  He has used it since and loves it.</li>
    <li> Without any exaggeration I can state that the Philips Norelco 1160X/47 gives at least as close a shave as any razor that I&#x27;ve ever used and a far superior shave to any other electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been waiting my entire adult life for an electric shaver that would perform this well. In fact, the 1160X/47 shaves difficult areas around my chin better than I&#x27;ve ever been able to do using a razor. I&#x27;ve only had the 1160X/47 for 24 hours, but I&#x27;ve found that I needed no learning period for getting a remarkably close shave. Specific directions for the cleaning and care of the 1160X/47 are provided, and as I want to continue to get an excellent shave, I will follow them to the letter. If the shave quality drops off over time, I will post that information as well. Realize that with the 1160X/47, you cannot just toss it in the corner and expect the same quality shave day after day. There is required cleaning as explained in the owner&#x27;s manual.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, norelco is a brand I always trust.&lt;br /&gt;And it was cheaper than in store with shipping!</li>
    <li> Nice, easy to use and clean. Shaves even, if you did not shave for 4 days. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. ONLY PROBLEM WAS I PURCHASED THIS FOR A VALENTINES GIFT AND THIS WAS SHIPPED IN ORIGINAL PACKAGING, SO WHEN MY HUSBAND RECEIVED THE PACKAGE, HE  KNEW WHAT IT WAS IMMEDIATELY.  ENDED UP GIVING IT TO HIM 12 DAYS EARLY AS HE ALREADY KNEW  WHAT IT WAS.  PRODUCT IS GREAT THOUGH.  VERY INTENSE TO PUT TOGETHER THOUGH.</li>
    <li> I got one of these razors 7-21-2012.  Within 30 days of use, it started exhibiting a problem.  It wouldn&#x27;t start it&#x27;s cleaning cycle!  It would dip the razor into the cleaning solution, but, it would not activate the razor&#x27;s motor to spin the blades in the solution.  Effectively, the razor stopped cleaning itself.  I had managed to get it working by first unplugging the razor after it dipped into the solution and then plugging it back in and restarting the cleaning cycle.  That, though, stopped being effective after a while and the only thing that worked was holding the razor in place in the cradle while the unit dipped the razor into the solution.  It is now 10-9-2012 and the automatic cleaning has stopped working altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also some fundamental design flaws.  There are too many moving parts to this model, which just invites trouble.  The unit has a moving arm that dips the razor into the cleaning solution.  The Braun models do not do this.  The razor recharges between 2 clips that are supposed to hold it in place, but, gravity causes the razor to fall out from between these clips after a short time.  The cleaning solution resides in a pan inside the unit.  Braun&#x27;s self cleaning units have removable cartridges that contain the solution, which is a better design paradigm.  The Braun models only need 1 of these cartridges a month.  This Philips unit requires replacing the fluid in under the every 2 weeks the manual says it needs replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave this razor delivers is fairly good, actually, but, it&#x27;s just not a very well made product.  So, I say pass on it.</li>
    <li> This razor does an amazing job of shaving and leaves my face smooth. It doesn&#x27;t cause my face to burn like some razors do. I really like how easy it is to clean.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco razor, the XL variety of several years ago but it was a job cleaning and maintaining.  This new design is so easy to clean it is amazing.  Gives a great shave too.</li>
    <li> Better deal than I thought.  Nice shaver.  Bought it because I had similar model.  Turns out that it has more bells and whistles than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Buy!</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. good quality no problems.</li>
    <li> Did not shave as close as advertised or instructions advised</li>
    <li> Close shave, esay to use, not as durable as my old electric razer. The head pops off if you drop it. But can be reassembled after some guesswork..</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco years ago, but after it quit working I went back to blades because it never cut close. This Norelco appears to cut very good. Only been using it for a week, but really like it. No more nics from blades. The cleaning solution base is a nice addon too. Just bought a 6-pack of solution with this razor, which should last me for awhile.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for my son&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it! Very close shave, no nicks or cuts and it cleans itself! Perfect for a gift!</li>
    <li> Love that it cleans itself. Gives a very good shave. Very light to use. I would recommend this razor  to anyone</li>
    <li> I was pleased to see that the package includes a sideburns trimmer. That was something I wanted but was not in the description. Very solid and reliable. the Jet CleanSystem really works well to clean  the blades without the usual bother.</li>
    <li> gives a much closer shave than my old Norelco even tho old one has new heads on it. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I like the wet shave feature.  It is almost as good as a blade without the nicks and razor burn.  The combo blade cleaner and charger keeps my razor clean and fully charged.  I am glad I finally replaced my ten year old Norelco cordless.</li>
    <li> Well due to some surgery I am using a tracheotomy ( im shure I butchered the sp) and I am on a blood thinner so they dont want me shavin with a reg I have tried electrics before but cheap ones and they just RIP my face to pieces well the ol sayin A\\&quot;ya get what ya pay for\\&quot; IS FACT in this case that razor got me almost as close as my barber does lol I would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAAAAAAAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++++++ to norelco and to amazon plus amazon is close to signing off on a 1,000,000 sq ft dist center in the dallas area</li>
    <li> I recently picked this up after reading an article about how the model above it (SensoTouch 3D) was the best shaver the editor had ever used. My Panasonic ES8109 cleaning system stopped working properly (the water wouldn&#x27;t drain out anymore) so after cleaning it would be sitting in the icky shaver water. In looking for a comparably priced mid-range option I chose the SensoTouch 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system seems to be pretty advanced with motorized dipping mechanism that lowers the shaver into liquid and tells you when said liquid needs to be replaced. However the important part is the shave and that is where this item falters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have been spoiled with the quality of my Panasonic, but I rarely had issues with it getting all the hairs cut. I would sometimes go many days w/o shaving and have to use the trimmer to cut it down to a manageable length otherwise the shaver would pull hairs. The Norelco seemed to do a better job at this, and was actually a very comfortable shave. But it missed many hairs and I had to go over areas many times trying to get one of the 3 disks to pick them up properly. You see, when you use the Norelco, you shave in circles instead of back and forth making precision pretty terrible especially on the upper lip. I eventually gave up and used tweezers on the few stubborn hairs that didn&#x27;t want to get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel the design just might not be right for my face, and better suited for people with facial hair that grows in random directions. Mine grows pretty straight, so that might be why the Panasonic is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the sideburn trimmer is an attachment which makes it easy to replace if it goes bad or gets dull, but is a hassle to deal with putting it on and taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it a few more times before the 45 day guarantee ends to see if it improves the shave over time, and will update if anything improves.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good</li>
    <li> I replaced my old norelco 8200x (10 years old) that finally crapped out.  This razor works better than I ever remember my old one working.  The sideburn trimmer is a bit wide, but should work in a pinch.  I use my wahl sideburn trimmer for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and I like it cause of the smooth shave it gives him. He likes it cause he gets no break outs using it.</li>
    <li> My Husband loves this razor, especially that it cleans itself after every use. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> IT IS ALL MY HUSBAND EXPECTED OF A RAZOR, HE LOVES IT AND&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT USE ANY OF HIS OTHER RAZORS AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS ONE.</li>
    <li> After 6 years, I decided to move up from my corded Norelco rotary to a new cordless 1160 with the jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;Rotary action really makes fast work of the beard even after 3-4 days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Simple, straightforward jet clean system.&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;For me; not very egronomically designed.&lt;br /&gt;Inability to use the charging cord for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Tricky blade retainer.&lt;br /&gt;AND THE BIGGIE; my first 1160 lasted four months and replacement lasted only 3 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it&#x27;s usual Sunday charging, on Monday morning the razor failed to activate.  Placing in the jet clean charger also did nothing, no lights came on.&lt;br /&gt;Both 1160&#x27;s died in the same way.  Although the first razor&#x27;s plastic outer cover began cracking near the on switch.&lt;br /&gt;I took very good care of both razors and only used them at the sink with shaving lotion, not in the shower.  Always put the razor in it&#x27;s vertical base, not the jet clean, to let it drain away water.&lt;br /&gt;After over 30 years (with the exception of one foil screen razor) of being a loyal Norelco rotary shaver, the 1160 has dissapointed me in the reliabililty department for the last time.  I have moved on to a Braun Series 7.</li>
    <li> I feel this razor is kind-of cheap design. If you have a three day old beard, this razor does not give a close shave. Don&#x27;t know what happened with Philips Norelco over the years, but this is cheap design.</li>
    <li> googood thin g s  a  n d r e c  e i v e f a s t e  r</li>
    <li> Good but very expensive</li>
    <li> great product, no more shave with razor, grat skin, jet clean is perfect and you can use water shave.... df</li>
    <li> When my 15 yr old Norelco battery would no longer take a charge, I plugged into the wall and used it two more years.  After reading the description of the 1160x/47, I assumed it would work the same way. I was wrong.  Even though this model offers a 5 minute quick charge for a single shave, I like the old design better.  I got two more years of shaves after my rechargeable battery went dead.  Quality of shave is 5 star.</li>
    <li> .Work great and just what I was looking for. Charges quickly and performs as advertised. You can buy with confidence.</li>
    <li> One word, perfect. I should have this before, amazing it is shave like if you use a blade handle razor. I&#x27;m impress, thanks amazon. Plus the delivery went-in early time that was planified.</li>
    <li> I was able to find this razor at Kohls without the cleaning system. The price I paid was at half the price shown on here at the moment (120 dollars for this particular model with cleaning system). I am glad that mine came without the cleaning system as I know I didn&#x27;t need it (and I didn&#x27;t need the extra space it takes up on the counter top). I use the razor as a dry razor. It may take a couple runs to get all the hair, depending on your type of hair and how often you shave. But, it does a great job and is a quality product. It&#x27;s able to deliver a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bends near the top to help get the hair under the chin and in the neck area&lt;br /&gt;- The shave is very close to the skin&lt;br /&gt;- The design of the shaver is good, is easy to hold and feels good in the hands, its very light, and the LED display is nice&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer attachment is easy to use, and swap with regular blades to get into tight areas&lt;br /&gt;- Charging stand that I use, with the model I use is very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Honestly for the price I paid, I don&#x27;t there is a con to this razor. If you play full price with the cleaning system it may be considered over-priced by many people out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer electric razors over manual razors. This razor does the job for me. It will be interesting to see how long the blades last (and currently they sell for about 30-40 dollars) and apparently they are supposed to last about one year.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this as a birthday present to himself and regretted it ever since. It&#x27;s really nice looking and comes with a lot of attachment pieces and it self cleans which is neat. But the actual blades are so dull and it barely shaves hair off at all. Basically my pink disposable razors from the Dollar Tree work better. I would not recommend wasting your money on this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son. He says it&#x27;s absolutely perfect.  He loves it.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> The price was right, not really sure if my husband would like this razor, but he was currently using a Norelco, so I took a chance and ordered this Senso Touch--he was suprised and really likes it a lot--in fact our son asked for one just like it for his Birthday.</li>
    <li> I have an older Norelco that I have used for about 5 years and thought it was time for an upgrade. Sadly this one fails in how close a shave it gives and you to go over and over and over again to trim some hair.. Of course I&#x27;m not looking for a razor shave, but with this one I have to shave everyday unlike my old one which I could by without two days, maybe three. Only good things is that it is gentler on my face, but then again its not doing much work. Definitely helps cleaning using the cleaner, and it really cleans out the hairs from the blade housing. Another positive is it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap and the extra trimmer attachment works really well.</li>
    <li> This is lighter weight than the razor it replaces, but has a solid feel. Lighter weight turns out to be a plus. I have had PN razors for a long time. I especially like the new cleaning system. Fill the bottom container with fluid, lay the razor in the cradle, and push the go button. It automatically lowers the razor into the cleaning fluid, starts and stops the razor in a washing action, then raises the razor for a drying cycle. If the razor needs charging, it will do that during the drying time. The fluid is special purchase but I cut it with 50% water. (we have soft water, hard water might not work).&lt;br /&gt;Overall very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Was a gift but he loves it</li>
    <li> It was a gift. I have not received any complaints.</li>
    <li> good razor great price</li>
    <li> It has been a good experience. It has develivered as promised. I would recommend it to others. It delivers a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> The cleaning system is the best thing about it. Shaving is not that great but since I spend the money I have no choice than use it.</li>
    <li> I have a very thick beard and through college just l never shaved. I still have a beard now but every now and then I decide to shave it for a few weeks and this is great. Before I would have to settle with using a beard trimmer without a guard, but this works like a charm. The shave is very close and I love that it can be used wet or dry. The only problems I&#x27;ve had is with my neck. I have to pull the skin tight to get a good shave the first try. Overall very good razor</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve purchased many lower priced razors in the past.  So far, this is the one that my husband is happiest with!</li>
    <li> Because the razor is very confortable.&lt;br /&gt;The disadvantage is I can&#x27;t find the clean product  in Brazil&lt;br /&gt;Yes I&#x27;ll recomend this product</li>
    <li> Working very well. Much closer shave the the earlier model it replaced. I very much appreciate the travel pouch.</li>
    <li> i am middle eastern and we have thick hair so when i would shave with a razor it would just mess my neck up following the shave with razor bumps and white heads and ingrown hairs and all that so i purchased this hoping that it would take all my troubles away with shaving. I was a bit disappointed, i thought this machine was going to be way stronger and more powerful and especially more precise but overall it does a decent job. i bought the package with the jet clean system and its not anything amazing, i would have rather spent my money on just the machine its self except the newer one.</li>
    <li> This razor is very easy to set up and use. I tried it both with shaving cream and dry; while I am still waiting on my face to adjust I am happy so far. I dont have anything else to compare it to other than a disposable but it gets pretty close.</li>
