      <li>Remember before you give up on a product, give it a fair chance and use consistently before you decide it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
      <li>Also great to put on cotton swab and clear ear canal.</li>
      <li>I loved it sooo much</li>
      <li>So love Miracell;) it&#x27;s a great great moisturizer for extreme dryness and soothing for sunburn or cracking skin.</li>
      <li>all of the claims related to this product i am sure, can be verified; i have proven many of the uses in my own life and need to reorder soon.</li>
      <li>This is because my face ends up lightly flaking....</li>
      <li>This is a great price for this, our local herbal store sells this exact bottle for $10 more</li>
      <li>I purchased more of this as it is effective and pleasant to use for skins that are dry, sensitive to heat and sweat and easily irritable</li>
      <li>I purched our Miracell on line and it was easy and quick .We</li>
      <li>My family has been using miracell for years; when we stopped being able to find it in stores, I was pretty bummed.</li>
      <li>Clears up rashes and great for minor cuts and scrapes.</li>
      <li>Very light scent but nothing that bothers or is noticed much; I am sensitive to many scents but not this.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and I really like to use it on my face better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Not bad.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s all natural and made with special oils and that&#x27;s great stuff, but I don&#x27;t get any moisture with it when using it on my face; I&#x27;m 50 years old and looking for it to do all the things I read about in others&#x27; reviews</li>
      <li>Heals sores quickly</li>
      <li>Great product that seems to help most skin lesions heal fast and comfortably (not for cuts or abrasions).</li>
      <li>, I get less oily throughout the day and it works great as a primer before I apply my makeup.</li>
      <li>it works for everything from dry skin, to blemishes and is great for gently removing eye make up.  </li>
      <li>My wife uses this on her scars &amp; rough skin on elbows &amp; heels, she says it works great, no unpleasant smell and feels very soothing.</li>
      <li>really great for skin all year round</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>Liked it enough to buy it again and was stunned at the Amazon savings.</li>
      <li>Cleared it right up.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy or oily &amp; my face seems to soak it right up.</li>
      <li>It can be very pricy through many stores or professional offices.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 4 years and only need to use it occasionally as it works great.</li>
      <li>After cleansing, I always smooth this precious oil on first, both day and night before applying any other serums or creams.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has a nice subtle smell :)</li>
      <li>so I was really pleased to see it here for such a discounted price.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, first time I bought it it was $49 in a health food store.</li>
      <li>However, after consistently using it for a month, it cleared up my acne</li>
      <li>I try and keep an extra bottle on hand at all times :)</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product to try on my nose.</li>
      <li>This product is great for areas of excessive dryness - like the heels of my feet, knees and elbows too!</li>
      <li>receivd it in a few days and were very pleased.</li>
      <li>Thanks again Amazon</li>
      <li>This product works for me, a VERY small&lt;br /&gt;amount</li>
      <li>the scent is so light and has such a relaxing quality to it.</li>
      <li>This Miracell has helped me so much...</li>
      <li>I bought it to prevent scaly elbows, and itchy ear canals (I wear hearing aides and they cause some itchiness) and it works fast and very well.</li>
      <li>I gave a bottle to a person with &#x27;plaque psoriasis&#x27; and it really helps them.</li>
      <li>I only have to buy two of these per year - they last so long and there is great value in this product.  </li>
      <li>I use many other products in my line of work</li>
      <li>but Miracell is the one product I cannot live without, my deserted island staple!</li>
      <li>Very nice blend of expensive and effective oils, definitely helped my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, and I hope they never stop making it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product, too, and will buy again from Amazon as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you buy the little bottles of this product you pay a lot more.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this product because I have overly dry, oily skin and was looking for something to moisturize my face with but wouldn&#x27;t make me breakout in acne.</li>
      <li>little bit goes a long way and, with regular use you get great results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for my face for years and it keeps it soft!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife uses this on her scars &amp; rough skin on elbows &amp; heels, she says it works great, no unpleasant smell and feels very soothing.</li>
    <li> Will not live without. Good for lupus rashes, anything that bruises.  This oil reduces scars til they disappear price is a little steep but worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have Morgellons Disease &amp; though this isn&#x27;t a cure ....  This Miracell has helped me so much... I&#x27;d love to shake hands with the hero who invented this wonderful stuff....  I wish I could order it by the gallon....  I even put a little on my scalp.....</li>
    <li> I have always used Miracell since I discovered it at a natural food store in London. I was so happy to know it is made in the U.S.!!! My boyfriend who had sun damaged skin uses it daily on his face and body. He finds it helps keeps his skin moisturized and less flaky. The appearance of his skin has improved.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this product because I have overly dry, oily skin and was looking for something to moisturize my face with but wouldn&#x27;t make me breakout in acne. The 1st couple weeks of using it, some large, deep pimples did surface on my face 2 or 3 times. However, after consistently using it for a month, it cleared up my acne, I get less oily throughout the day and it works great as a primer before I apply my makeup. This product is great for areas of excessive dryness - like the heels of my feet, knees and elbows too! Remember before you give up on a product, give it a fair chance and use consistently before you decide it isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I&#x27;m an aesthetician and I will not be without this. Purely amazing and lovely for your skin, talk about a glow! Best of all it feeds, nourishes and heals your skin. Love love love! People compliment me all the time on my skin and ask me what I use .... Well this is my secret weapon! After cleansing, I always smooth this precious oil on first, both day and night before applying any other serums or creams. I use many other products in my line of work but Miracell is the one product I cannot live without, my deserted island staple!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 2 years and I love it! It lasts a long time so I&#x27;m not having to buy it often. It isn&#x27;t greasy and I really like to use it on my face better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Great product!</li>
    <li> My family has been using miracell for years; when we stopped being able to find it in stores, I was pretty bummed. Then I bought it on Amazon! It&#x27;s awesome, it is sort of like a miracle. It works on my psoriasis, and I use it as a facial moisturizer, sometimes I rub it on my split ends too. I use it to remove makeup... it&#x27;s just great</li>
    <li> Recommended by a friend.  This works to heal scrapes quicker.  Good on lips.  Little goes a long was so it is cost effective.</li>
    <li> So love Miracell;) it&#x27;s a great great moisturizer for extreme dryness and soothing for sunburn or cracking skin. Also great to put on cotton swab and clear ear canal.</li>
    <li> Thank You, For This Great Product MiraCell Skin Relief &amp; Support, 2 oz. The Cost of this Item is Great.</li>
    <li> This goes with the other Miracell products.  They work together.&lt;br /&gt;These products also do not have the nasty substances that so many skin products have like paragons, glycols etc.&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way and, with regular use you get great results.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for my face for years and it keeps it soft!  I&#x27;m prone to dry skin so using this daily after washing my face is a must.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t take long to absorb into the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts either which I am prone too so no worries there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice subtle smell :)</li>
    <li> Great product that seems to help most skin lesions heal fast and comfortably (not for cuts or abrasions). Very easy to dispense and apply. I bought it to prevent scaly elbows, and itchy ear canals (I wear hearing aides and they cause some itchiness) and it works fast and very well. I have been using this product for about 4 years and only need to use it occasionally as it works great. Not greasy or oily once rubbed in and not sticky. It does not make my skin glossy or mark my sheets. Very light scent but nothing that bothers or is noticed much; I am sensitive to many scents but not this. Clear but straw colored. For ears I use one drop per Q-Tip end, elbows about 2 drops per elbow. One bottle (recommend 2 oz.) will last a very long time. You can apply it as often as desired. I gave a bottle to a person with &#x27;plaque psoriasis&#x27; and it really helps them. Hemp oil helps them, also. Great price here on Amazon! It can be very pricy through many stores or professional offices. This was recommended by my audiologist. I highly recommend this product, too, and will buy again from Amazon as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone.</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years now. It is my regular facial moisturizer, my itchy rash and bug bite soother, and my occasional bath oil when I need a relaxing soak. Highly recommended, and I hope they never stop making it. Costs a lot, but it goes a long way. Only a few drops are used at a time, and it absorbs in.</li>
    <li> Use this everywhere.  Face, body, ears, elbows.  It is truly a miracle oil.  My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I wear it daily under my makeup and use it for any skin problems like dark spots or if I need anything to help heal my skin.  I love the product.</li>
    <li> It feels great on my skin</li>
    <li> I USE IT FOR ANY SKIN CONDITION</li>
    <li> Not bad.  It&#x27;s okay.  I wouldn;t order it again.  Will try something else at another time down the open road.</li>
    <li> ﻿I was confused about the names of these products and contacted the manufacturer.  I was told&lt;br /&gt;that all three products are the same, with the exception that the ear products have two&lt;br /&gt;preservatives added.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; product is sold for less money, so there you go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my hearing aids.  The itching was horrible.  This product works for me, a VERY small&lt;br /&gt;amount around the tip of the ear piece works great.</li>
    <li> I used this oil during my cancer radiation treatments.  I now keep it on hand for any itchy skin issues.</li>
    <li> Not the same as the pic, doesn&#x27;t say +37. Did they change the packaging?</li>
    <li> This is a marvelous product and I&#x27;m so glad to have found here to find it.  I never want to be without it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite oil for my face and i love it and will buy again and again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> She also uses it on her face and all over her body.  It is botanical and wouldn&#x27;t harm anything. Great!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Very nice blend of expensive and effective oils, definitely helped my dry skin. Goes a lot further than you might expect too.Can&#x27;t beat the price, first time I bought it it was $49 in a health food store. Liked it enough to buy it again and was stunned at the Amazon savings.</li>
    <li> This is a product I have used for several years</li>
    <li> This does a wonderful job of fading scars and making skin tone more even. When I used it regularly I would constantly get compliments on my skin. Now I&#x27;m about to buy more to try on stretch marks. It seems expensive but the good thing is that a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> really great for skin all year round</li>
    <li> We have been using this product for over 5 years and it truly is a miracle worker. It heals cuts rapidly, helps with insect bites and burns, and my husband is now using it for a rash he received while recuperating from knee surgery.  I have recommended this to the physical therapists at the rehab center he was at.</li>
    <li> This product does so much not only with your face, with cuts heals in no time. Buy this it cost  twice cost  in vitamin stores and the oz are .5 oz or 1.5 oz Nice product I keep it on stock because it works better than neosporin.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! My husband begins to panic our bottle gets low. I try and keep an extra bottle on hand at all times :)</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product to try on my nose. My nose skin was rough and red. I was realy surprised how it cleared my nose skin. My wife started useing it on her face and was tickled pink with the results. She uses it on bruises and rough areas on face and arms. She uses it where ever she thinks she needs it, it does a great job of smoothing her skin and clearing areas of bruises ect. Thank you for Miracell.I purched our Miracell on line and it was easy and quick .We receivd it in a few days and were very pleased. Thanks again Amazon</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all natural and made with special oils and that&#x27;s great stuff, but I don&#x27;t get any moisture with it when using it on my face; I&#x27;m 50 years old and looking for it to do all the things I read about in others&#x27; reviews but I&#x27;m having a hard time sticking with it long enough to see if I would get the results!...This is because my face ends up lightly flaking....like it&#x27;s dried out.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s doing good under the skin?...But I can&#x27;t deal with the flaking/dryness after it soaks in.  And if you use a larger dose of it you end up having to blot the excess oil.</li>
    <li> all of the claims related to this product i am sure, can be verified; i have proven many of the uses in my own life and need to reorder soon.</li>
    <li> It is a great product, works great on my skin. I recommend it to anyone in need of better skin.</li>
    <li> If you buy the little bottles of this product you pay a lot more.  I purchased a small one only once and have purchased a number of these.</li>
    <li> I gave up all the expensive, store bought, name brand moisturizers and night creams and now use Miracell exclusively.  I had a friend who used it and she had gorgeous skin, and now I do too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and even use it on my dogs.... now they get relief from their scratching.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used MiraCell for years and it is an excellent oil for any part of your skin.  Heals sores quickly and I feel like it nourishes your skin with what it needs so it can heal.</li>
    <li> I purchased more of this as it is effective and pleasant to use for skins that are dry, sensitive to heat and sweat and easily irritable</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for anything but my nails and it is pretty good...I like the fact that it is lightweight and not heavy as other oils like &amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34; is....</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this is one of the nicest moisturizers I have used for my face.  It is not greasy or oily &amp; my face seems to soak it right up.</li>
    <li> Was given a bottle of this by a doctor quite a few years ago.  I was amazed at how well it treated all types of skin conditions.  It is particularly good at preventing scars after cut, injury or incision from surgery.  It also helped after my husband underwent radiation for cancer and his skin was really dry.  Cleared it right up.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product!!  Product came on time and in great condition, thank you! This is a great price for this, our local herbal store sells this exact bottle for $10 more so I was really pleased to see it here for such a discounted price. I use a few drops on my face under my day cream and also on my hands before I apply lotion, very hydrating and the scent is so light and has such a relaxing quality to it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using this as a night cream for 10 years.</li>
    <li> This product was introduced to my family by a friend.  I loved it sooo much I jumped on AMAZON and purchased more.  Clears up rashes and great for minor cuts and scrapes. We use it all the time!</li>
    <li> Really love this product</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product...it works for everything from dry skin, to blemishes and is great for gently removing eye make up.  I even use it on my boyfriend.</li>
    <li> LOVE this item and have been using it to remove my eye make up for several years, in addition to applying it to little cuts or dry areas on my face or body.  I only have to buy two of these per year - they last so long and there is great value in this product.  It truly has so many uses.  When I use it to remove eye makeup, I gently rub it over my closed eyelids and eyelashes, and then wipe with a moistened (with water) cotton ball to remove.  I generally use about 3 damp cottonballs per eye until the make-up is fully removed.  This oil is not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; in that, after I remove my eyemake up there&#x27;s no oily, heavy residual feel left behind.  Works great for waterproof mascara removal as well.</li>
