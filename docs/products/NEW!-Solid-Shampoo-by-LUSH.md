      <li>Makes for a great traveler&#x27;s option!</li>
      <li>I gave this shampoo bar a try, after having read all the wonderful reviews.</li>
      <li>I rubbed it on my roots and as soon as I started working it into my hair it created an awesome lather</li>
      <li>It lathers up wonderfully, too.</li>

      <li>to follow-up with a good conditioner.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I keep touching it!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>The scent was spicy and warm.  </li>
      <li>--it made the whole room smell good, before I even used it, too!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone through phases where I&#x27;ll try the latest and greatest off the salon shelf, to sticking to strictly all natural hair products.</li>
      <li>this is awesome to me since, though I&#x27;m not currently loosing my hair, I have a strong family history of hair loss!  </li>
      <li>That one was still my favorite.</li>
      <li>The smell is refreshing - mostly cinnamon</li>
      <li>not today :) Overall: great buy!</li>
      <li>I just ordered two more bars</li>
      <li>love its cinnamony smell.</li>
      <li>I am a college student, and this is finals time in my most stressful year of college yet.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>The stimulating bars fell out awhile back, but it still makes me feel great!  </li>
      <li>I love the cinnamon, spicey, almost \\&quot;holiday\\&quot; type scent.</li>
      <li>And great-smelling :)</li>
      <li>It has two cinnamon sticks embedded into its surfrace, which makes it even more appealing.</li>
      <li>I love the way it leaves my hair smelling and feeling.</li>
      <li>I LOVE the smell..</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a really great shampoo to use in the morning, because the scent is really invigorating.</li>
      <li>It is very pleasant and refreshing at the same time.</li>
      <li>My hair is normally oily, and now, even at the end of the day, I have great looking hair.  </li>
      <li>It lathers quite nicely and my hair is amazingly clean, soft, and smells great after use.</li>
      <li>I loved it, but most of their items were costly, and I was trying to go all natural.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than those small jars of whatever in the hotel bath and smells really wonderful.</li>
      <li>Above and beyond that, it has an amazing spicy scent and warm tingly feeling on my scalp.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much lather it creates.</li>
      <li>My hair feels so smooth</li>
      <li>I also have VERY oily hair-the kind of hair that needs washed EVERY DAY</li>
      <li>There really are NO WORDS to describe how amazingly well</li>
      <li>It is so much longer lasting than my liquids, and it smells great!</li>
      <li>After picking up a bar of this soap at a Lush store and deciding to get it just based on its smell, I read the info about the product and saw that it was good for scalp and thinning hair.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t need to, it left my hair so soft and squeaky-clean, and smelling wonderful, but not too strongly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  </li>
      <li>I am now a Lush fan for life!!!!!!</li>
      <li>the price is worth it!</li>
      <li>I have used many Lush products and some I love, some</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this since all the other reviews were perfect but this really did nothing for my hair except make it more tangly and unmanageable (which never has happened to me before)</li>
      <li>Most of the time, there isn&#x27;t even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days.</li>
      <li>seriously, the smell is incredible!)</li>
      <li>the smell in honestly awesome and second, after only a week of use, I got all of these \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hairs cropping out over my head-</li>
      <li>I absolutely Love the NEW bar.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from Lush!</li>
      <li>actually can&#x27;t wait to use it again--and because it has made me so happy, my stress levels have fallen considerably.</li>
      <li>but the scent and lathering-action alone were well worth the price for me.</li>
      <li>Along with the Jungle conditioner bar soap my hair looked healthy, shiny, and felt sooooo soft.</li>
      <li>Okay, there&#x27;s no reason for me to be vengeful, so I&#x27;ll leave you with this concept: LUSH should be regarded as a bêete noire.</li>
      <li>an even more cool bonus - not only does this shampoo bar work splendidly - it lasts a long time, and does not waste packaging material by taking up a bulky bottle (environmental friendliness too!).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that&#x27;s not so good when you&#x27;re already having some hair loss.  </li>
      <li>99% of shampoos are liquid for a reason, right?  </li>
      <li>Yes...you read it right.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo bar really made my hair feel squeaky clean.  </li>
      <li>Really got my hair clean without being that sort of squeaky-clean</li>
      <li>shampoo lathers very well, better than I ever expected, and better, even, than bottled shampoo.  </li>
      <li>If you have dry hair, you should probably use this sparingly, as your hair will be &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean, or just make sure</li>
      <li>This made my fine hair come alive.</li>
      <li>Well, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re using LUSH&#x27;s NEW!</li>
      <li>This is the first time using this product.</li>
      <li>So I guess this shampoo would be better for people who actually have problems with their hair.</li>
      <li>This one definitely falls in the LOVE category.  </li>
      <li>Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  </li>
      <li>I am SO glad I finally tried it.</li>
      <li>It gave me a head ache when I first opened it.</li>
      <li>but after using this shampoo I can skip a day and-for the first time in my life</li>
      <li>and, wow-there&#x27;s so much I can say about it!  </li>
      <li>First</li>
      <li>I love the smell - its spicy and invigorating - and it cleans just enough, without over stripping the hair.</li>
      <li>And, lastly, LUSH sent me a tin to keep it in, which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Thanks Lush for making the shower and bath into a my own private spa!</li>
      <li>you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  </li>
      <li>My hair is rather fine and short, but gets frizzy, so I use a conditioner, too.  </li>
      <li>I always skipped right over this product, because I thought it was too strange and wouldn&#x27;t really get my hair clean.    </li>
      <li>Be sure to store it where it will not get wet -</li>
      <li>-so I can&#x27;t say that this softens very well)</li>
      <li>, it didn&#x27;t really fill my bathroom with the cinnamon scent and the smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is wonderful. I have extremely thick and unruly hair which always needs to be conditioned in order to get a brush through it. It&#x27;s also started falling out by the handfuls since the birth of my daughter (an iron deficiency may be the culprit). This solid shampoo bar leaves my hair soft and shiny, and I DON&#x27;T need a conditioner. It lathers up wonderfully, too. So far, I&#x27;ve also noticed that hairs don&#x27;t come away when I run my fingers through it, so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed that NEW! will help me to combat the hair loss. And, lastly, LUSH sent me a tin to keep it in, which I thought was pretty cool.</li>
    <li> This shampoo not only sold me on Lush products, but solid shampoo in general. It is so much longer lasting than my liquids, and it smells great! I love the way it leaves my hair smelling and feeling.</li>
    <li> I was totally skeptical about purchasing a solid shampoo. I was also completely NEW to LUSH products in general. WOW, was I surprised when I used this little bar! At first I was surprised at how small the bar itself is. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last a few washes...but it&#x27;s absolutly amazing! I am a male and all I need to do is rub this bar on my head twice and my head is full of rich, thick suds! The lathering is amazing!!! There really are NO WORDS to describe how amazingly well this lathers. The scent is DELICIOUS! I love the cinnamon, spicey, almost \\&quot;holiday\\&quot; type scent. It is very pleasant and refreshing at the same time. I don&#x27;t know how well this shampoo is for actually moisturizing (I have dry hair and my hair has pretty much stayed the same texture-so I can&#x27;t say that this softens very well) but the scent and lathering-action alone were well worth the price for me. I can&#x27;t wait to try more products from Lush!</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo after reading the reviews.  I have used it just a few days and can&#x27;t get over the body and bounce in my very fine, very thin hair.  I am anxious to see if it actually will help with the thinning of my hair, but have no reason to believe it won&#x27;t!  I just ordered two more bars so I don&#x27;t run out!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely Love the NEW bar.  My hair is normally oily, and now, even at the end of the day, I have great looking hair.  The smell is delicious, and the lathering is unreal.  I am a LUSH fan from now on!</li>
    <li> This stuff lathers really nicely and smells great.  I have fine hair and I don&#x27;t need a conditioner after using this.  My hair feels so smooth I keep touching it!  You must keep the bar in a dry place between shampoos.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bar of this stuff now and, wow-there&#x27;s so much I can say about it!  First the smell in honestly awesome and second, after only a week of use, I got all of these \\&quot;baby\\&quot; hairs cropping out over my head-this is awesome to me since, though I&#x27;m not currently loosing my hair, I have a strong family history of hair loss!  I also have VERY oily hair-the kind of hair that needs washed EVERY DAY or I look like I&#x27;m homeless but after using this shampoo I can skip a day and-for the first time in my life-you can&#x27;t tell it my the condition of my hair!!  My only issue with this is that even though my scalp is oily, my ends are dry and I have to use just a tiny bit of cream conditioner along with it-also this item dissolves SUPER quick if you leave it in the shower and makes everything in your shower pink...but other than that I strongly recommend this item to anyone curious.</li>
    <li> okay, I was a little skeptical of the concept of solid shampoo.  Who wouldn&#x27;t be?  99% of shampoos are liquid for a reason, right?  Well, one shampoo with Lush&#x27;s New (hair) solid and I was a believer.  It&#x27;s amazing how much lather it creates. I wet the bar, rubbed it in my hands, applied my hands to my head and whoa, lather city.  Above and beyond that, it has an amazing spicy scent and warm tingly feeling on my scalp.  Our whole family is using it now. &lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased other products in the Lush arsenal and so far, I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Yes...you read it right.  Solid Shampoo!   Who would think such a crazy concept would be so wonderful!??!   I&#x27;m not very interested in washing my hair with something that looks like a bar soap.  Besides, didn&#x27;t our mothers tell us never to wash our hair with a bar of soap?   (and Lush makes bars of conditioner as well...what blasphemy is this?)  But..I&#x27;m SOLD.  NEW! worked wonderfully on my long, wavy hair.  It smells fantastic, suds like a dream, and after following up with fuel solid conditioner my hair was sweetly scented all day long!  I give it 5 stars because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used a shampoo that gave me so much lather before.  4 Swipes of the bar and my hair was blowing bubbles by itself!   Thanks Lush for making the shower and bath into a my own private spa!</li>
    <li> I have used many Lush products and some I love, some I HATE!  This one definitely falls in the LOVE category.  I have thick, medium texture, color-treated, slightly wavy hair.  This stuff works!!  I use it every other wash to remove all the residue from salon shampoos, conditioners, and products.  It makes my hair so shiny.  It lasts forever, about 3 months using it every other day.  Be sure to store it where it will not get wet - I use disposable gladware.  And, I haven&#x27;t even gotten to the best part.  The smell is refreshing - mostly cinnamon and it makes your scalp tingle just a bit.  Can&#x27;t say enough about this one!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this stuff has such a strong smell. It gave me a head ache when I first opened it. I had high hopes for this since all the other reviews were perfect but this really did nothing for my hair except make it more tangly and unmanageable (which never has happened to me before) I have long normal hair, So I guess this shampoo would be better for people who actually have problems with their hair. Also the bar is a lot smaller than I thought from the picture. I hope other lush products work for me in future.</li>
    <li> Like others, I was skeptical about a shampoo bar. I really,really like this bar. It has a great scent. The first time I used it, the smell stayed in my hair most of the day, and now it lasts a few hours. Its a pretty deep cleanse, so I really only use it when I&#x27;ve been at bars or when my hair is full of product. I use it about twice a week or so. It has a really great lather. My boyfriend even uses it, since the smell isn&#x27;t floral, but rather spicy in nature. The little cinnamon sticks fall out after a while, but the bar itself has held. I will definitely buy again. If you have dry hair, you should probably use this sparingly, as your hair will be &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean, or just make sure to follow-up with a good conditioner.</li>
    <li> Long time Lush fan, first time shampoo bar user. I always skipped right over this product, because I thought it was too strange and wouldn&#x27;t really get my hair clean.    I am SO glad I finally tried it. It&#x27;s amazing. It lathers quite nicely and my hair is amazingly clean, soft, and smells great after use.</li>
    <li> My sister actually asked me whether I had changed shampoos, because she noticed my hair was shinier and softer than before. This shampoo is amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It make my hair so soft and shiny. I cut the shampoo in four, and use it every other day. Then I keep it at dry place. This shampoo last long too. The smell is great too. Love it! I&#x27;m going to buy it for my mom.</li>
    <li> For the first time using a solid shampoo this experience was bliss...It lathers so well. I have very thick hair, and use loads of shampoo, but with this bar I only use a little and its lasted me for ages now.  &lt;br /&gt;I love its cinnamony smell. The stimulating bars fell out awhile back, but it still makes me feel great!  &lt;br /&gt;I would definately recomend this shampoo!</li>
    <li> After picking up a bar of this soap at a Lush store and deciding to get it just based on its smell, I read the info about the product and saw that it was good for scalp and thinning hair. I don&#x27;t have a problem with that, but if you do, you might consider using it! I just love the tingly sensation on my scalp when I use it, and the great smell - cinnamon, clove, and peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really great shampoo to use in the morning, because the scent is really invigorating. Really got my hair clean without being that sort of squeaky-clean that makes you afraid your hair has been stripped of protective oils and will be brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it must be the oils in the shampoo bar ensure that you&#x27;re left with a bit of conditioning/moisturizing oils that will make your hair silky and shiny. And great-smelling :)</li>
    <li> i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove. but that&#x27;s just me. i&#x27;m not a huge clove fan. BUT it worked great, made my hair &amp; scalp feel awesome. will definitely buy this again. and i can&#x27;t wait to try other LUSH products!</li>
    <li> This made my fine hair come alive. Along with the Jungle conditioner bar soap my hair looked healthy, shiny, and felt sooooo soft. The smell reminds me of Christmas. It smells sooooo good! You have got to try this one!</li>
    <li> If you are a cautious type and like to keep cosmetics in your hand luggage, and if you don&#x27;t admire hotel shampoo, you can bring Lush&#x27;s solid hair shampoo with you now that there are restrictions on liquids in airplane cabins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bar is spicy in scent, tingles on the scalp and leaves hair soft. It&#x27;s better than those small jars of whatever in the hotel bath and smells really wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a bit of a hair product junky over the past 9 or so years. I&#x27;ve gone through phases where I&#x27;ll try the latest and greatest off the salon shelf, to sticking to strictly all natural hair products. I first tried Lush when I was stationed in Japan - I loved it, but most of their items were costly, and I was trying to go all natural. Lush is fabulous, but they are not all natural. So, I gave it up and drifted elsewhere in the universe of endless hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I have come back to them though. I gave this shampoo bar a try, after having read all the wonderful reviews. I had tried again to like traditional shampoo bars, but they were awful on my hair. This bar does have sulfates in it - but I&#x27;ve found them to not be harsh at all on my hair. I love the smell - its spicy and invigorating - and it cleans just enough, without over stripping the hair. I do follow up with a regular conditioner though - some folks don&#x27;t need to, but I&#x27;ve always preferred the conditioner follow up.&lt;br /&gt;As an even more cool bonus - not only does this shampoo bar work splendidly - it lasts a long time, and does not waste packaging material by taking up a bulky bottle (environmental friendliness too!). Makes for a great traveler&#x27;s option! Less worry about bottles exploding in the luggage when going on trips.&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be a product I continue to buy. I&#x27;m just sad Lush&#x27;s reincarnate shampoo bar is getting discontinued. That one was still my favorite.</li>
    <li> My hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein, so NEW! (Hair) is a lifesaver.  As others have said, it lathers like you wouldn&#x27;t believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent.  (Sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!)  I&#x27;ve found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom, away from the moisture of the bathroom, is the best way to preserve it for a while.  (Also, it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously, the smell is incredible!) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair, since it doesn&#x27;t really stick, even right after showering, unless I use a lot of lather, and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn&#x27;t last as long.  Most of the time, there isn&#x27;t even much of a hint, whereas other Lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful, even a bit overpowering, for days. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, unlike some of the other Lush products, it leaves my hair fairly flat.  It&#x27;s true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny, but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume, and that&#x27;s not so good when you&#x27;re already having some hair loss.  Using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary, at least in my experience. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think NEW! (Hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability, but at the same time, it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities.  Buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it.  And if you do have hair loss, trust me -- the price is worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time using this product. It&#x27;s wonderful! Smells great and creates lots of suds. I can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower just to smell the cinnamon smell. My hair looks so much fuller than before and so much body. Ooh-la-la!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m using a solid bar to shampoo my hair.  I was suprised at how well this stuff lathered up!  The scent was spicy and warm.  This shampoo bar really made my hair feel squeaky clean.  I am now a Lush fan for life!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I finally got this in the mail today and hopped in the shower soon after. I LOVE the smell..I&#x27;m a big fan of cinnamon. I rubbed it on my roots and as soon as I started working it into my hair it created an awesome lather, it didn&#x27;t really fill my bathroom with the cinnamon scent and the smell didn&#x27;t linger in my hair (hence the four stars) but it did leave my hair soft and shiny and it dried incredibly quick..I usually have to blow dry it..not today :) Overall: great buy!</li>
    <li> It is worth noting at the outset that LUSH is locked into its present course of destruction. It does not have the interest or the will to change its fundamentally meddlesome whinges. We are observing the change in our society&#x27;s philosophy and values from freedom and justice to corruption, decay, cynicism, and injustice. All of these \\&quot;values\\&quot; are artistically incorporated in one company: LUSH. LUSH is the picture of the insane person on the street, babbling to a tree, a wall, a cloud, or  a bar of solid shampoo which cannot and does not respond to its ebullitions. I plan to discuss the advantages of two-parent families, the essential role of individual and family responsibility, the need for uniform standards of civil behavior, and the primacy of the work ethic. Are you with me -- or against me? Whatever you decide, LUSH has -- not once, but several times -- been able to endorse a complete system of leadership by mobocracy without anyone stopping it. How long can that go on? As long as its postmodernist, blasphemous campaigns are kept on life support. That&#x27;s why we have to pull the plug on them and deal stiffly with conceited loan sharks who force us to tailor our fulminations just to suit its directionless whims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If LUSH isn&#x27;t predaceous, I don&#x27;t know who is. I want you to know that this screams of the old belief that merciless adolescents (also known as LUSH&#x27;s fans) are merely unpleasant vexatious-types. Knowing, as they say, is half the battle. What remains is to break the mold and stray from the path of conventional wisdom. Okay, there&#x27;s no reason for me to be vengeful, so I&#x27;ll leave you with this concept: LUSH should be regarded as a bêete noire.</li>
    <li> I am a college student, and this is finals time in my most stressful year of college yet. I stumbled across LUSH products a little while ago, but--like many others--was VERY skeptical about using a solid shampoo, especially one that seemed so expensive for such a small bar (see net weight of product).  So, in the craze surrounding final exams, I decided to go ahead and buy NEW!, just to see if it was worth the hype... &lt;br /&gt;I received the package yesterday afternoon--and could smell it through the box. The smell is intense, but not overpowering: think--spicy candle from one of those expensive candle shops, except with more zest.  I took it out, and actually had it sitting on my desk for a while--it made the whole room smell good, before I even used it, too!  It has two cinnamon sticks embedded into its surfrace, which makes it even more appealing. By this point, I&#x27;m thinking: I don&#x27;t care if it is a horrible shampoo, I just like the way it smells. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get into the shower this morning--and with NEW! it was one of the best shower experiences ever! You know those commercials where women are lathering their hair and moaning? Well, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re using LUSH&#x27;s NEW! and not some other bottled stuff.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The shampoo lathers very well, better than I ever expected, and better, even, than bottled shampoo.  It will probably last me longer than a bottled shampoo, too.  My hair is rather fine and short, but gets frizzy, so I use a conditioner, too.  With NEW! I didn&#x27;t need to, it left my hair so soft and squeaky-clean, and smelling wonderful, but not too strongly.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I actually can&#x27;t wait to use it again--and because it has made me so happy, my stress levels have fallen considerably. It is great, and well-worth the money. (Trust me, I&#x27;m a college student, and often broke: yet I will repeat that the price of NEW!, AND the shipping costs were well-worth this little shampoo bar.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that it&#x27;s so small and cute, and much easier to transport: so no packing of leaking shampoo bottles once the semester is over, or for any other trips!</li>
