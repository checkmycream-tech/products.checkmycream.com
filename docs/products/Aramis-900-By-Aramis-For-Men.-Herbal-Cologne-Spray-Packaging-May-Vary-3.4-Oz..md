    <li> This fragrance has changed over the past, oh, 30 years. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but my most recent impression was: &#x27;This stuff stinks, it reminds me of Lava soap&#x27;.  I used to love it and it is similar but not the same!   I have also tried Aramis Devin which is still good. I&#x27;m going to try Aramis&#x27; original fragrance next, I hope it hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
    <li> I am aware that this product can only be purchased on line.  After living abroad found that this was my husbands favorite Cologne and is not found in any store that I know of in the Mid-west.  The product is great and the availability on Amazon is wonderful.</li>
    <li> Very BAD...The smell is not like a original cologne</li>
    <li> they did not send the same cologne as pictured.  they sent the new version of Aramis 900 (which smells slightly different and watered down)</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and everyone seems to notice and like its gentle fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is not what i ordered The bottle is differant i ordered the after shave which comes in the [[ASIN:B000C20ZB0 Aramis 900 By Aramis For Men. Herbal Cologne Spray 3.4 Oz.]][[ASIN:B002P5Z904 Aramis 900 by Aramis for Men - 3.4 Ounce EDC Spray]]bottle you advertise they are not the same smell&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an answer to your mistake</li>
    <li> A subtle fragrance that is long-lasting.</li>
    <li> My husband used to wear this all the time, but for a long while he couldn&#x27;t find it. Very happy to have it--he smells great!</li>
    <li> Not as good as aa 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> Best fragrance ever. Mild natural sent . I have used this for 20 years</li>
    <li> thank you the best cologne I ever had</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne and I really like it, and get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Must use sparingly...but is not a lingering aroma and will dissipate after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This was the original aramis 900 i got a generic bottle. i  do not know why the bottle changed i needed the original for my collection</li>
    <li> It did not appear to be the same smell as the green bottle, and the spray was better in the green bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cologne for twenty years already and just to find it in the market is practically impossible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that for now on, I&#x27;m sure I found the right place to buy it.</li>
    <li> wrong item was sent, doesnot match what was in ad. ad was for old version but product is the new version which is absolutly different</li>
    <li> Lasts about 2 to 3 hours. Is this the real thing or a knock-off  (I am aware that it is listed as new and in a sealed box but anyone can purchase a sealing machine). I&#x27;m not inferring that it&#x27;s a bogus product. It&#x27;s just not the product I remember from years ago.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance as the vintage herbal 900, and I actually like the old style bottle, its ok smelling</li>
    <li> This has been my fave for thirty five years and I have three bottles just in case a bean counter decides to quit making it-the best aroma, not too strong or too sticky. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I bought in Dec at Christmas a Bottle of Aramis 900 at Macy&#x27;s for almost twice This price BUT the scent stayed with me the Whole day!  This one I just received it barely lasts an hour!  This &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; version must really be watered down even though it is in the same bottle and box as the one I bought at Macy&#x27;s.  I will not buy this one again it may be a lot cheaper but its truly not the same you buy in stores -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ZD</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite colognes. It has a clean, refreshing smell</li>
    <li> I am not sure that I received the real thing.  the box and bottle looked nothing like what is in their ad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy something based on the ad, I expect it to be packaged as it advertised.  I suspect what I actually recevied is a one-off...</li>
