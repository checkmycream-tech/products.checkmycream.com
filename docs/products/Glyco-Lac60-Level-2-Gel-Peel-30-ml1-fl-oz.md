      <li>I will wait 10 days before applying another treatment and hopefully, will continue to see good results.</li>
      <li>I started researching and read that peels do a good job resurfacing skin and diminishing any hyperpigmentation or acre scarring</li>
      <li>I loved this product and would recomend it for anybody with skin problems.</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This product greatly improved my sun spots and fine wrinkles on my face.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cannot live without this stuff!  It does cause very, very minor hardly visible peeling!  It does tighten skin and clear small acne pustules and black heads.  YES!</li>
    <li> I think that this a great starter product for those new to home peeling. I&#x27;ve been using Glycolic peels for years in a stronger concentration so this was a step backwards for me. I got this product mainly for removing some sun damage. I have not used Lactic acid before and wanted to use a lighter concentration to start with. I have fair skin so any tiny bit of sun damage shows up fast. Always remember your sun screen!  :)    I&#x27;ve noticed some difference after 4 applications but not the improvement I was looking for. For myself in the future I will probably go back to using Glycolic separately from the Lactic unless I can find a product that has a stronger percentage of Lactic &amp; Glycolic in it.    I do have one recommendation for those new to these type of products. Definitely try it out on the back of your hand to see how your skin will react and so you can get a good idea of what you have to do to neutralize the peel and completely rinse it off. Another poster gave a better description &amp; instructions on mixing baking soda with water to neutralize. I also recommend you use baking soda. &amp; don&#x27;t be cheap when rinsing. You don&#x27;t want to leave these types of products on your skin for longer than necessary.    Good Luck  :)</li>
    <li> I am a brown complexion african american female. I purchased this product with the intent that it would lighten the dark marks on my legs. I only used it in my face once and it burned like hell. Ultimately, I did a series of four treatments over four weeks. There is absolutely no difference in my dark marks except that they are a little lighter...just by maybe one shade. If I were to purchase another peel, I would definitely get a higher strength. This one doesn&#x27;t peel at all. It was my first time, and now I know what to expect. Two stars because I was fooled by the reviews on this product, They are extremely overrated and I&#x27;m just here to be real and tell the TRUTH.</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it in the hopes of getting rid of breakouts in my cheeks and to fade hyperpigmentation from old zits. I have fair skin which is not oily at all. Every time I get a pimple it will leave behind a red mark whether I pick the pimple or not. If I don&#x27;t pop my pimples they seem to take forever to resolve, although I am trying very hard not to touch them. The morning after my first use (1 minute) my skin looked great; marks looked lighter, pores looked tighter. However, in the following day my skin felt like it was flushing oil out and then I underwent a bad breakout. However, it resolved itself and it seems like when I do get a pimple it resolves more quickly and the marks fade more quickly as well. I followed the regimen of beginning slow and working up, but once I made it to five minutes I decided to try something new. I could feel a zit forming under my skin, so I dabbed on some of the product with a Q-Tip and left it on overnight. The next morning the zit had completely surfaced with a giant white head; gross! But I was able to squeeze it very gently and get all the junk out, and then I dabbed the spot again with a Q-tip dipped in product. By the end of the day I had a tiny red mark that looked like it had been healing at least a week. So now when I feel zits forming I do my Q-tip process and it helps a lot, plus I&#x27;ll dab some on old marks to help fade them in-between full peels. I decided to purchase the saliyclic acid as well because I think the glyco/lac may not be enough to kill my zits, although perhaps it hasn&#x27;t been long enough.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m 29 and just started having a noticeable crease on my face. When I stay up on this stuff, it is MUCH less noticeable. It also keeps my face smooth. I rotate it with the 20% salicylic peel. I will never have to buy an acne cream of any kind again. My pores are so clean that the blackheads I do get now show up and clear out fast.     Cleaner (peeled) skin also means that I only ever feel like putting Cetaphil on my face now. I don&#x27;t feel like I need harsher cleaner to have a truly clean face. That&#x27;s nice and certainly better for my skin.</li>
    <li> This product came in the mail very quickly, I have been suffering with moderate adult acne after having children. I bought this and the salycilic acid peel, which I have not applied yet.I have tried everything and ordered this as a last resort before the holidays to help with acne, mild scarring, uneven skin tissue. I just applied my first home peel ever and have to say it could not have been easier. The gel is easily applied and you can feel a tingle after 45 seconds, I left it on for a min. and a half the first time and probably should have done the minute only, I just wanted to see quick results. It has been an hour since I applied the peel and my skin already has a much healthier glow and looks more plump, I can&#x27;t imagine how it will look after a few more applications. You can&#x27;t beat the price, I have spent much, much, more on an array of products and none of them have made my skin look this glowing. This product is a must have!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product for the first few weeks. It didn&#x27;t clear up my acne as much as I had hoped, but my face felt a lot clearer and smoother. After a few weeks though, it seemed as though my face was already used to it and I no longer had those good results I had before.</li>
    <li> I have mostly oily skin, so really no wrinkles as I&#x27;ve had a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; moisturizer my whole life.  I&#x27;m 35 and while my skin isn&#x27;t wrinkled, I&#x27;ve noticed some age spot/discoloration to my forehead and nose in the past 2 years.  It&#x27;s not super dark but pretty bothersome for me.  I&#x27;ve also noticed my cheeks seeming a bit reddish in the past year so wanted something mainly to even out my skin tone.  I also read that this product could help with some blackheads that I&#x27;ve always had on my nose.  I tried this product out, first on the back of my hand and a small patch on my arm and right away noticed I didn&#x27;t feel any sting.  Which I figured was good but also made me question whether or not it would work for me.  After a few days, I saw no reaction, adverse or otherwise, so I did a whole face application.  This time, I did feel some slight stinging but nothing unbearable.  I should note that I don&#x27;t consider my skin to be sensitive and so wasn&#x27;t really surprised by this.  Because of the lack of stinging, I kept it on for about 5 mins.  I saw no results after this 1st app, so I went ahead and a few days later did a 2nd app - it felt about the same but this time I kept it on longer - maybe 7 mins.  Still no real results.  I did see a tiny bit of peeling around the crease of my nose, but that&#x27;s it.  My 3rd app I decided to keep on for the max of 10 mins and even did my chest area, as it&#x27;s seen some sun over the years too.  Again, same feeling but no real results, EXCEPT that I seemed to be getting acne, AKA, whiteheads, on my chin and lower cheeks.  NOT what I was hoping for, as far as results!  In the end, I believe this product will possibly work for someone with skin not as \\&quot;tough\\&quot; as mine, if that makes sense.  I didn&#x27;t love the pimples I got after using this but they weren&#x27;t terrible.  That was the worst side effect so I can&#x27;t really say too many bad things about this product.  In the end, I think I may need a stronger peel to see results.    Just to note, I found the product to feel good going on, as in, it&#x27;s consistency is smooth and easy to apply and noticed no real scent.  This bottle would last me a long time if I continue to use it.  For now, I think I might try the HQ or some other level 3 peel from this company.</li>
    <li> I have this peel.  I had never used a peel before.  However, being a scientist I decided that I could study up on application and recovery and do it myself at home.  I purchased a cleanser, a prep solution, the peel and a healing balm for the procedure.  The first application had a little sting.  I was disappointed that I did not see much in the way of results.  I decided to wait a couple days and do the peel again.  I followed all of the steps.  I put the peel on a little thicker than the first time.  My skin stung more and it turned pink all over.  I thought;  \\&quot;YES!  This is going to finally peel!\\&quot;.  No.  It did not happen.  This \\&quot;peel\\&quot; seems to make the skin more shiny and softer.  However, it does not make my skin peel.  I tend to have dry and sensitive skin, which is why I started with this peel.  I was hoping to get some of the skin discoloration from my pregnancy last year off my skin.  I will move on to a slightly different formulation with the next peel I order.  This one is more superficial than what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have had such bad skin since starting new meds and this stuff is really working. I have been using it once a week for about a montha dn am seeing results. Great stuff and not too harsh for my sensitive skin, but wokrs far better than any other acne meds.</li>
    <li> First of all my order arrived very quickly and in perfect condition so I was pleased about that. I have only used one time so far because you have to wait every 5-7 days to use again. It was my first time using any kind of acid peel so I was a little nervous. I left it on for 1 minute and there was a slight tingling sensation, but nothing too bad. Immediately after rinsing off product, I noticed how smooth and soft my face was. I&#x27;m very excited to use next week to see more results.</li>
    <li> Love this peel use this regularly but dont expect miracles, helps smooth the skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the product as directed over a month now and find little results.</li>
    <li> It took a few days for my skin stop peeling, but the results were great.  I especially liked the change is tone and texture.  The dry patchiness of my skin gave way to smoother skin and clearer skin tone.  I think it&#x27;s best to wait at least two weeks between peels and use plenty of moisturizer in the meantime.</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and have moderate acne (cystic, and pastules) and hyperpigmentation from the breakouts.  I have tried multiple topical products (including Retin-A, acne cleansers, serums, creams, and a Jessner&#x27;s peel that was administered by a medical spa and cost $300, and IPL treatments) as well as natural supplements (zinc, herbs, brewers yeast, etc) and dietary changes (eliminating dairy, gluten, and sugar) all with little effect.    The Jessner&#x27;s peel was the most effective treatment I had tried, but I hated the fact that my skin turns thick and looks like you have 2nd degree burns.  This lasts about 6 days and is embarrassing.  Besides, $300 a visit adds up quickly! So I found this peel.  It has glycolic and Lactic acids so it would address the active acne as well as the hyperpigmentation that old outbreaks left behind.  I have now used it 3 times with really good results.  It has significantly improved the tone and texture of my skin (my family has been commenting on how smooth my skin looks now) and has reduced the visibility of the old acne marks (they were not scars).  It has reduced the number of pimples I get significantly, but has not eliminated outbreaks altogether.  I would say it was JUST as effective as the much more expensive peel, but with many other benefits:  I can do it at home, my face does not peel/flake at all so I look normal, and I get multiple treatments out of a bottle.    As a note, I left the peel on for 3 minutes each time I have done the treatment (my skin is pretty tough after all the other procedures) and I had absolutely no visible signs of peeling.  It is very convenient!  I wish it would have stopped the outbreaks altogether, but overall I am very pleased.  I will certainly buy more of this company&#x27;s products, but will try a stronger peel next time.  This peel has made me comfortable in my own skin again, and for that I am so grateful! Thank-you!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 4 times so far. I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s helping in any way. It does tingle when I put it on, and feels like it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ll use it one more time and then stop for a while, as some other reviewer had mentioned that it shouldn&#x27;t be used in the summer months.</li>
    <li> I bought this chemical peel to fade my sun spots.  It didn&#x27;t quite happen all the way, but I still like the product.  It makes my skin look younger and my pores smaller.  Just be really careful!!!  I burned my face a couple of times for leaving it on too long. The burns weren&#x27;t noticeable and scabbed away quickly, but it&#x27;s still better to use precaution.  I don&#x27;t recommend doing your entire face on the first try because if you are too sensitive to it you&#x27;ll be really screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it.  Once the bottle runs out I will buy a higher concentration.</li>
    <li> I used this the night I got it.  Delivery was fast and well packaged.  I&#x27;ve had a couple stubborn blemishes left over from some pimples a couple weeks ago.  I applied the peel to these as directed.  One of the blemishes was apparently still a pimple, which almost immediately erupted after the treatment.  It has since diminished significantly.  The other blemish has also diminished significantly.  I will continue to report my experience with this product, but so far I am impressed.    Update [1/12/10]: I developed a pimple on my nose yesterday.  I applied the peel as a spot treatment this morning.  By tonight, the whitehead flaked off my nose and left behind only a small red area, whereas normally I have to pop my pimples.  To add more background... I have been plagued for years with tenacious pimples that wouldn&#x27;t go away unless I squeezed them.  Lately I have been religiously using salicylic acid wipes/washes and hyaluronic acid moisturizer--which significantly reduced my breakouts--and I think this glycolac peel was the missing ingredient.  I continue to be impressed!  I do want to try applying a full face treatment of the peel, though...</li>
    <li> I read each Amazon review on this product before I made my purchase and so I had full confidence in using this product the night before Valentine&#x27;s. BIG MISTAKE! I left it on for only 50 seconds and the next day I&#x27;m left with a line through my upper lip....I was embarrassed to walk outside with a red looking mustache!    I put pure aloe vera on it in hopes for it to soothe the burning, but that was a challenge in itself as well. My face felt so tight, it hurt to open my mouth wide enough to eat anything.    Today is day two and I see light peeling and my red mustache is now a dark brownish color. I hope this chemical didn&#x27;t burn my skin and left a scar! :(</li>
    <li> Nice lite peel.  I&#x27;m 37 and have had acne since age 9 and still do.  I have been a smoker for 18 years (quit 3 months ago-wish me luck), so obviously this has taken a toll on my skin.  I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old. I have dark marks where previous acne has been.  I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly.  I also developed \\&quot;melasma\\&quot; 3 years ago...SUDDENLY when I was on a Caribbean cruise (obviously in the sun).  Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...it still appeared and never went away.  It is less noticeable when I haven&#x27;t been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn&#x27;t go away at all during summer months.  I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion.  I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years.  7 years ago a derm told me that the red stuff was also sun damage (I was expecting a rosacia diagnosis). I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...but they all look big to me. I also still have an oily T-zone.    Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford but I never found anything.  My wrinkles and acne I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature.  After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures.  So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...(ARE YOU KIDDING?).  I have not been able to do this so THANK GOD I RAN INTO THE REVIEWS OF THESE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON!!!  I&#x27;m SOOOOO EXCITED!!!    I purchased this peel, the 20% Salicylic Acid peel, the HQ+ (to use in the future - once I have a tolerance to peels), and the pH balancer.  The balancer is worth the 10 bucks!!!  I did buy all but the ph balancer [...] because it was a tiny bit cheaper and I like the applicator gauze that they sell which I couldn&#x27;t find on Amazon.  It is only 6 bucks for 200 and they are perfect for this use! More sanitary than using a brush over and over also.  They are not very absorbent so you don&#x27;t feel like the gauze is sucking up/wasting the product.     5 days ago I got the purchase in the mail. I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time, if needed. The Salicylic was stronger. Today is Sunday (a week later) and I just used THIS peel.  I was able to leave this one on for about 5 minutes. From my experience last week, the creases around my nostrils ARE VERY SENSITIVE so I applied to that area after doing the rest of my face. On that area I was only able to leave on for about 1.5 minutes.  On my face I felt like I could have left it on longer but didn&#x27;t since it was my first time using it.  Both masks make pores smaller IMMEDIATELY!  Especially the biggest ones so THAT IS AWESOME!!!  My skin feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using.  I can&#x27;t wait to work my way up to the HQ+ since that is the one that is for \\&quot;dark marks\\&quot;.  Both this peel and the Salicylic made my darker areas of my face look a tiny bit brighter (including the redness, scaring, under eye circles and the melasma).  This shocked me in a wonderful way, because neither of these peels are supposed to improve these things specifically. I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after the first peel in areas I always have acne (about 3 days after using the peel) therefore I&#x27;m assuming that it was acne already underlying my skin that the peel \\&quot;brought out\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m used to this when ever I restart Retin-A so I&#x27;m not worried about it continuing.     I&#x27;ll post an update in a month or so.  Happy peeling!!!!  Read the directions and don&#x27;t worry!!!</li>
    <li> I love being able to give myself a peel at home.  I bought two different peels and use about 2 x a week. I can&#x27;t believe the results.  I have gotten so many compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am 27 and I do not sunburn easily...not at all really - so I certainly don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. Still, I had never done any sort of peel before so I was cautious - I left the peel on for 2 minutes the first time, 3.5 the second and 5 full minutes the third time - all spaced 1 week apart. I felt tingling, nothing major. The third time I did get some red peeling on my nose (I had a cold, so it may have been more sensitive bc of repeated tissue action), but otherwise minimal flaking.  I just used my olay brush in the shower and cetaphil moisturizer with spf 50.  Quite a few people have said that my skin looks great :) so it def worked - skin looks smooth and clear.  This is gross, but the peel removed the top layer of dead skin, so my black heads all came out super easily.   The lactic acid is supposed to be good for undereye circles, so I tried applying it there (VERY carefully). I made sure to do this portion of my face last since I was a bit nervous to use something on such a delicate area. Surprisingly, it didn&#x27;t burn or peel horrible at all. I can&#x27;t really tell yet if it is working there though, since my undereye circles are so dark...  One more thing, I used alcohol to remove my skin&#x27;s natural oils, applied the peel, waited the prescriped time, and jumped in the shower, rinsing my face for a few minutes. I tried the baking soda thing and really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I have, for the past several years, bought anything that said \\&quot;wrinkle\\&quot; or \\&quot;sun spot\\&quot; remover. I have also been using an alpha hydroxy cream for the past several months (over the counter strength). I used this new peel for the first time, leaving it on my face for approximately 3 minutes. I primed my face by cleaning it with a cotton ball and alcohol to strip all the oil before applying the peel...the gel burned/tingled but not uncomfortably so and immediately stepped into the shower when the 3 minutes were up. My face was slightly red, no irritation and it was not tender at all...I followed the recommendation of no makeup for 24 hours as well. Within 48 hours, my skin seemed clearer and is also looking a bit tighter with what seems to be, a noticable improvement around my eyes and pore size. I will wait 10 days before applying another treatment and hopefully, will continue to see good results.</li>
    <li> I purchased this peel because I wanted something that might help to fade any small freckles/sun spots developing on my face, as well as fade small wrinkles near my eyes. I am Asian, with a medium-light complexion that is already fairly wrinkle and acne-free; but I was starting to see more melanin spots on my face developing, as I didn&#x27;t start using sunscreen on my face daily until age 30 (I am now 35). However, my skin does tend to be oily in the T-zone, and I would still get an occasional pimple on my forehead or under my cheekbones on a regular basis.     After using this product, I noticed that my already scarce breakouts became practically non-existent, and though some of the small freckles on my upper cheeks haven&#x27;t faded much, my skin does feel and look smoother and clearer. I don&#x27;t use concealer, powder, or foundation (I can&#x27;t stand the look and feel of it on my skin), and only use Shiseido SPF 55 for the face on a daily basis, but this seems to be all I need to still look pretty flawless, which I attribute to some of the peel&#x27;s effects. I originally only used the 35% glycolic acid peel sold by the same company, but decided to try this lactic acid/glycolic acid combination to see if it would have a different or stronger effect (it does sting/tingle more than the 35% glycolic acid peel alone). I usually use this product every 7 days, and leave the solution on for a full 10 minutes (it stings and tingles, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me much; leaving it on this long doesn&#x27;t cause any \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; on my skin, either, but my skin is pretty resistant to a lot of environmental insults). I also notice that small blackheads and sebaceous plugs in my forehead and nose will loosen easily and can be pushed or exfoliated out more easily after using this peel.     Overall, I think this is a good maintenance peel for those who want to slow (or possibly even reverse) the subtle signs of aging, i.e. development of melanin pigmentation from sun exposure, smoothing the surface of the epidermis, possibly neutralizing fine lines, and decreasing acne. I will likely continue using this product, until I become adventurous enough to perhaps try something different and stronger (i.e. a 70% Lactic Acid peel). The price is right, too, and won&#x27;t cost you the overhead you might pay for having the same type of peel done at a medi-spa.</li>
    <li> Graduated up to this product from the 35% which I used for three months prior.  I am trying to get a handle on skin cancer and find this product has done more for my skin than anything I have tried in years.  I like to think my Big angels put it in front of me.   I reccomend it to anyone that is wanting to help peel away sun damage and find healthy skin that lies under.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on various peels and decided to try this one. I have large pores and recently started getting light (very light) discolorations on my forehead. I have used this 3 times now - once a week - and there is a huge difference in the size of my pores! They are much smaller and some you can barely even see. The discolored spots are almost gone as well. I am very impressed and look forward to each application to see the improvements. It did sting a little at first just along my cheek bones so I only left it on for about 1 1/2 minutes. I am up to 5 minutes now with very little sting. I haven&#x27;t had any actual \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; and I do use a moisturizer after treatment so my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.   I will try to follow-up in a couple more weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help lighten some dark patches on my face..have tried OTC and green cream and nothing helped.  Each time I use this, my skin is brightened and I notice it looks \\&quot;better\\&quot; overall. The spots are still there, but are lightening...</li>
    <li> I used to break out a lot when I was a teenager and I have so many deep acne scars from it. I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times already (once every 5 days), and I&#x27;m already starting to see a difference. My scars appear to be fading and my skin feels a lot smoother! I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin is not as oily anymore (I&#x27;ve always had very oily skin, hence having lots of acne). My skin did peel a little the day after, but applying moisturizer really helped. No harsh chemical smell to the product. It did make my face sting slightly after applying it (I can only leave it on about 6-7 minutes), but beauty is pain right? Anyways, I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from horrible acne scars - definitely give it a try! :) I&#x27;ll update again after a couple more applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/26/12:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is still amazing! In the ~2 yrs I&#x27;ve used this I&#x27;ve still not broken out, my face is way smoother (deep pitted scars are barely visible now), and my skin isn&#x27;t oily ever. I use the product once every 2-3 weeks nowadays and I still continue to see great results. This is a product I will definitely continue using, absolutely wonderful long-term changes! :) I hadn&#x27;t thought of updating this review until recently running into a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in years. She thought that I had some sort of expensive laser treatment from a dermatologist and really commented on how fantastic my skin looked. what a complement! I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, this product has had such a positive impact on my life! Thank you Skin Laboratory!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the Glyco-Lac/60,Level 2 Gel Peel. Being a woman of color in my early 40&#x27;s with very sensitive, blemished skin, I have always had to be very careful with what I choose to put on my face. This product is working very well but you have to follow the directions carefully. I have noticed my skin is clearer  &amp;  the wrinkles are less noticeable. I have used the same bottle 3 times already and I can see the change which is nice. And the price is Much less than if I went to a doctor for this same peel. I saved around $300.00  My advice to anyone thinking of using this is be patient. It works. I am a very satisfied consumer.</li>
    <li> Good product, not too harsh. I use weekly and my makeup goes on much better after use and my skin is definitely brighter over the long term. I just ordered my third bottle. I haven&#x27;t seen any long term effects as far as diminished wrinkles, etc. but it&#x27;s an excellent way to renew skin cells.</li>
    <li> I started out with the Skinlaboratory Glycolic 35% and found good results first applying Salicylic 20% for a couple minutes to clear surface debris, then Glycolic 35% for 10-12 minutes before bed. This product (Glycolac 60%) is even better. The lactic acid seems to moisturize my skin. The very morning after using this my skin has such a healthy even glow. I am only applying it for about 3 minutes but increasing the time with each application. I am doing a peel once per week, sometimes skipping a week. It has not burned me in the least so far. My acne scars have become more shallow. I think with enough time and use the scars will be gone completely. Definitely remember to use a SPF moisturizer and\or makeup in the following days.</li>
    <li> This product is so so....not as strong as I have been used to in the past.</li>
    <li> I used to go to a doctor&#x27;s skin care for $ 200 of Glycolic peel. It really helped to control my adult acne. But I was getting bored of this same peel(my skin is combi and too oily for other more nourishing treatments) so I chose to get a laser for a change. Too bad. a couple of dollars for nothing. The laser made my skin so dry and took the natural glow away. Then I found this glycolac peel which sounds so good to my acne and aging problem. The price was so affordable and I didn&#x27;t expect this kind of effect at all. IT WORKED!!!! I HAVE A BLACK AFFECTED AREA, ECZEMA LEFT, ON THE FOREHEAD AND ENLARGED PORES AND ACNE AND BROWN SPOTS UNDER EYES AND SO ON. IT IS THE BEST PEEL EVER I HAD. EASY TO USE AND POWERFUL. YOU CAN SEE THE RESULT RIGHT AWAY. BUT FIRST TIME USERS OF THIS KIND OF CHEMICAL PEELS SHOULD BE CAREFUL. PLEASE GO AND CHECK FIRST WHETHER YOUR SKIN IS NOT TOO SENSITIVE FOR THIS PEEL BEFORE YOU BUY IT.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying (and using!) an at-home peel, and I have to admit that I was a bit scared when I used it for the first time two days ago.  I purchased this one since it said that it is good for evening out skin tone and getting rid of wrinkles, which are my main concerns.  The strength of this one is also supposed to be good for starting out.  I use Retin-A on a nightly basis so my skin is used to exfoliation, but I didn&#x27;t want to aggravate anything since I&#x27;m prone to redness and sensitivity.  I&#x27;m hoping to build up to using a TCA peel in a few months, but everything I&#x27;ve read has said to build up to using a TCA peel by using gentler peels first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions that come with this peel are excellent, and alleviated most of my nerves since they are so detailed and covered all of my questions.  They call for using gauze pads to apply the peel in a light, circular manner, and that seemed to work well.  Since this was my first time doing this, I only left it on for a minute and used a timer to time it.  It didn&#x27;t sting too badly, but I could definitely feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is considered a lighter, \\&quot;lunchtime\\&quot; peel, it didn&#x27;t cause any actual peeling or flaking.  Instead, it got rid of some flakiness and dryness, and has left my skin really soft and hydrated-feeling, especially on my neck.  There was no irritation afterwards. It&#x27;s too soon to notice any difference in my wrinkles, but supposedly that takes a few more peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made sure to use some emu oil on my face and neck three times a day for two days to heal the skin. Also, be warned that you aren&#x27;t supposed to use any foundation on your skin for 24 hours after peeling so that it can heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on doing this once a week for the next six weeks since supposedly that is the schedule that will yield the best results.  I will be sure to update my review as I go, but so far this is working great and has left a nice glow to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 3/27/10:  I&#x27;ve used this peel three times now, and it is really making a huge difference in the clarity and brightness of my skin!  At the same time that I started using this, I also started using the Pretika cleansing brush, and the two together are making my skin brighter and my pores smaller.  I&#x27;ve also been using the peel on my neck and hands, and the skin there is also becoming softer, too.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any peeling after using this, but am making sure to really moisturize well for a few days afterwards.ATE ON 3/27/10:  I&#x27;ve used this peel three times now, and it is really making a huge difference in the clarity and brightness of my skin!

    <li> After coming across this on Amazon in Nov 2009 I wanted to give it a try. My skin had a good amount of dark spots and scarring that became quickly noticable since this year is the first year I havn&#x27;t gone tanning throughout the winter. I started tanning when i was 16 and will never go again and I am now 22.     Anyways, I break out occaisionally and had more of a problem with the tiny little break out guys that made my skin bumpy and just wouldnt go away. I had started getting microdermabrasion but i had found that it was making my skin feel smoother but not really having a effect on any scarring spots like i had wanted.     I started researching and read that peels do a good job resurfacing skin and diminishing any hyperpigmentation or acre scarring so I bought the Walgreens brand of a glycolic acid cream that is 12% strength and i love that for daily use but it is now discontinued :(    The cream was making me breakout much less but still not having much of an effect on the scarring and dark spots - and by this time i was the palest i&#x27;ve seen myself in years from not tanning anymore so it just was noticable to me    So i finally bought this peel, and for the first round of uses I used it 4 times, a week a part. I actually would experience some peeling, along my mouth and around my nose, plus it was winter so my skin was dry. It made my face look kind of beat up and red for a couple days, expecially around my mouth where i have the most darkening, but this is also the area that was peeling the most so it was good :).    I would leave it on for as long as i could stand it, probably at most 3-4 minutes, it stung my face kind of bad its like an annoying pain.    Im at the end of the second round of uses. I probably waited around 5 weeks before starting up again because i wasnt sure if I would go on spring break or anything and be in the sun, but i decided not to and keep staying out of the sun and go for another round.    This time I have been using for about 6 weeks,a week apart, and this time around it is really doing justice on my face. The texture of my skin is much much smoother, and the spots keep on lightening. It helps with my breakouts also, the small little guys never come and I will get a few here and there around my period or whatever.     I also wash my face with Olay&#x27;s regenerist daily peel that has glycol in it also, and when it is on my face i have been rubbing in some cleanser with saclyric acid also, mine is Clinque&#x27;s Emergency Mask, but I just use it to supplement my regular cleaser.     For moisturizer I have been using lately the past couple weeks, Ambi Fade Cream, that has sunblock and I think that has been really helping the spots along with the peel, the peel probably helps it sink in good.     Its getting close to summer now so I have to transition away from this peel and to things that arn&#x27;t going to make my face sensitive. I will continue using the Ambi Fade Cream, Washing with the Clinique Mask, and start bringing in Walgreen&#x27;s new cream, its a day cream that has all the right ingredients, some glycols but its a day cream so itll be ok to use as long as I wear sunblock all the time. For Sunblock i am using Aveeno Ageless Vitallity Spf 50, this is also supposed to work well with anti-aging, spots, ect.     I will however use this peel for the rest of my life every winter. My skin hasnt look so good since i was in highschool with its tone, color, and texture. It looks great! definatly use this product but only in the winter! If you use this product and at the same time go outside and tan you will probably do more damage then what could have been fixed.</li>
    <li> Ok, so Im 37, and started to get the large pores and fine lines... I used it four times, once every five days. My friend said my skin looked like it had been raised in a petre dish with no stress. My skin is super soft, pores are smaller, lines are diminishing. First time I used it, my skin was soft, that was about it. I didn&#x27;t start seeing results intil the fourth time, real results, that other people see. So hang in there, and keep up with the once every five day treatment. It burns a lot if you do some microdermabrasion before putting on the peel, and will also itch a burn, but this only seems to last about 5 seconds, then chills out. My husband started using it on his tattoo and it is lighting up his tattoo as well.</li>
    <li> I just got this and even after one time my skin looks amazing.  It made my skin so soft and cleared up all of my blemishes.  I was really nervous about using an at-home peel, but this one is very mild.  I left it on for about 4-5 minutes and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all, just slightly itchy while it was on.  My face didn&#x27;t peel or anything, just looks great :)</li>
    <li> I have some skin pigmentation, olive complexion and no skin sensitivities/conditions other than mixed oily/dry. This is a fantastic product I now use regularly for peeling, every week or so. It has restored my skin back to its luminous state. At first I used too much product on the sides of my nose, which caused some excessive peeling, but now I&#x27;ve found a balance. The exfoliation is a great way to get rid of milia, btw. I use this in conjunction with Miracle Skin&#x27;s Hyaluronic Serum as part of my facial care routine. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and acne scarring. I am a black woman and it has worked WONDERS on a problem I have battled my whole teen and adult life!!!! I&#x27;m 4 weeks in and my skin is sooooo amazing and CLEAR! OMG! I now use it on my 15 year old son who was curred with my skin!</li>
    <li> For years I have been battling a difficult complexion. It seemed as though every pore on my face was clogged. I had blackheads all over my chin, nose, and forehead but they were not easily seen on the surface; they were deep. I&#x27;ve tried creams, scrubs, masks and gizmos but nothing provided effective treatment. Per the recommendation of my best friend (who is an aesthetician but lives far away from me) I decided to give this a try. She mentioned that the combination of glycolic acid and lactic acid was particularly effective since the glycolic works on the surface and the lactic acid goes deeper. I did not see results right away, but the enclosed leaflet recommended weekly peels for 6 weeks, so that&#x27;s what I did. Other reviewers noted that they did not experience peeling and neither did I; it was more of a flakiness after a day or two. Therefore, I used a gentle enzyme scrub (try [[ASIN:B000MASTNI MyChelle Fruit Enzyme Scrub, 2.3-Ounce Tube]]) about 3 days after the peel to help with the flakiness. It&#x27;s been 6 weeks since my first peel and all I can say is WOW!!!! The first couple of weeks were a bit rough: my skin seemed to break out a bit but I believe it was just all of the gunk coming to the surface. About 3 to 4 weeks in my skin started really looking good!  NOTE: I also had some melasma on my upper lip and a few age/sun/melasma spots on my cheeks and I have seen a significant reduction (the melasma on my upper lip is gone!!! YAY!!!).   This is serious stuff! It is not comfortable for the few minutes you have it on, but you will get serious results if you stick with it and are diligent with your skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> This stuff has quite a strong chemical odor, and it does burn a bit when it&#x27;s on, but from my experiences it&#x27;s totally worth trying. I started with 1 minute and while I was afraid that I would get peeling and redness I didn&#x27;t get any in the least bit. I think around the 3rd treatment I started to see a real difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and tried every product I could find to help my skin and I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t know about this stuff! I haven&#x27;t gotten any new blemishes at all since I started using this. My husband noticed the difference and actually tried it...never expected that. But it&#x27;s hilarious, now he&#x27;s like, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s go do a peel!\\&quot; He&#x27;s on his 4th or 5th and he has been washing it off after 1 minute because he keeps thinking that he&#x27;s going to get peeling and redness, but he&#x27;s never had a bad reaction. Regardless of him only leaving it on for 1 minute each time, there have still been improvements to his skin texture and tone.   I will definitely order the peel again, I kind of want to try the HQ one but I worry that it sounds much stronger than this one, at least by the reviews.</li>
    <li> I have had professional chemical peels and have done some at home peel/exfoliate products in the past.  This product is dangerous to use and I am still suffering the results 6 days after I used it.  It burned my skin (left it on the 4 minutes suggested)....not discomfort while doing it.  I did not go near my eyes with the product.  Hours later, both eyes were puffy, one was actually quite swollen underneath and bruised with reds and light purples.  The redness and puffiness has finally begun to subside (6 days later)  The worst part is that the swelling accentuates the creases and lines around my eyes and the skin around my left eye looks about 20 years older than I am (I am 47).  I highly recommend NOT buying this product.</li>
    <li> Just a tiny bit of a dab on a pimple with a Q-tip and that zaps it into submission. Most times one application at night is all you need to take care of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this in February and used it the day I received it. I swabbed some on with cotton gauze, left it on for about 5 minutes and rinsed my skin for a few minutes with cold water before splashing a mixture of cold water and baking soda (prepared beforehand) on my face. I left this on for a minute and then rinsed. I felt very minimal stinging while using the peel and almost none after the baking soda and rinse. I did the full 6 treatments spaced 4 to 7 days apart. I had no visible peeling or flakiness, but my skin became clearer, softer and more even-toned every time I did the treatment. It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since my last treatment and to my surprise my skin has stayed almost completely clear. Even my usual hormonal and stress breakouts only produced a couple tiny blemishes that disappeared quickly on their own. I have spent twice as much on glycolic acid products that irritated my skin and didn&#x27;t produce a quarter of the benefits of this product. This stuff is amazing!!! I highly recommend it for anyone with acne-prone/combination/sensitive skin like mine</li>
    <li> This Gel Peel and other products from Skin Laboratory helped me being able to face myself in the mirror without makeup and think that my scars aren&#x27;t that bad for the first time, and I&#x27;ve had acne scars since my early 20s and this is some 20yrs later. Ty!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done professional peels (with a 7 day down time), light peels with my monthly facials and then for years, did Salycilic 20% on my own as needed. Salycilic 20% by Skin Lab used to make me flake a little around my chin and stung pretty good. This peel is more of a cellular level peel. I kept it for 8 minutes without having to fan at all and there was no redness or peeling afterwards. Repeated every week for 3 weeks and have definitely noticed that skin is smoother and tighter. No down time, no stinging, no redness - what&#x27;s not to like? However, if you have an occasional pimple, it won&#x27;t nip them in the bud like Salycilic does, so I will still keep it on hand. Right now, beginning of December, before the holiday parties, I am getting my glow on and stepping it up with a peel once a week, then 2-3 days later adding microdermabrasion crystals to my face and of course, using Clarisonic. You CAN glow on a budget no worse than anyone who spends $500 on it a month, drives back and forth and sits waiting for appointments listening to yappy receptionists. Give it 3 weeks before your event, get this peel, find a 8oz jar of microdermabrasion crystals right here for $13 and stock up on generic Clarisonic brush heads on Groupon (yes, they are excellent, I can&#x27;t tell the difference except for the extra cash in my wallet) and give your face, neck and decolletage some much needed attention.</li>
    <li> This product helped me a lot, but the only down side is I started to get a dark match on my cheek and I stop using it and it went away, but other than that it work great.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few weeks ago, and since then I have used the product 3 times. The first time I was a little bit scared that I was going to burn my skin, so I only left it on for two minutes. I&#x27;ll be upping my time to about 4 minutes next time around. I am in my late twenties, and I have acne scars, as well as current acne to battle. I also have very large pores around my nose and cheeks. I am seeing a difference in the clarity and notice my skin getting softer. My pores also seem to be cleaner, and less prominent. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with the same skin issues. You will definitely feel the tingling, but nothing unbearable. But you will more than likely start seeing a difference in your skin pretty immediately. I also cleanse with a mixture of water and baking soda to balance the pH after washing with plenty of water. I am currently using this product every 5 days.     I hope that this product continues to work, as it has for my sister who is 3 years older with the same problem skin. Her skin looks great!!! And she&#x27;s been using this product for several months now.</li>
    <li> This is a nice at-home peel. Some tingling but does not burn the skin. Removes a light layer of skin but very superficial. Nothing to worry about, just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> I have HUGE pores. They&#x27;re an embarassment to me. No matter how clean I keep my face, by the end of the day they&#x27;ve filled with dirt and my face looks speckled. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to no avail to close them down. Two uses with this and my skin looks better than it has since before I was a teenager. I&#x27;m in awe.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist, am fairly well trained in skin care, and have used several different peels in the past. This peel was gentle on my skin, though it definitely \\&quot;tingled\\&quot; while it was on my face. At first I actually thought it didn&#x27;t work because my face wasn&#x27;t red after, and I only experienced a mild flaking after a few days, but after 3 applications, my pores are noticably smaller, my skin looks brighter and fresher (which is saying something since it&#x27;s winter and my skin generally looks very dull with all the dry air) and the majority of my black heads and blemishes are gone!&lt;br /&gt;I originally decided to use the peel because as a 26 year old with moderate acne I have used virtually every skin care regimen and found them all to be very harsh and drying on my already dry skin. However, because this peel contains lactic acid as well as glycolic acid, it addresses not only my immediate problems with spots and blemishes, but also the underlying causes like enlarged pores, and overly dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product, but I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because this is very gentle for a stage 2 peel. I was expecting it to have a bit more \\&quot;muscle\\&quot; behind it to help facilitate the speedy fading of some older blemish scars.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared to neutralize (I used the neutralizing pads from the Boots No. 7 glycolic peel system, baking soda + water works well but will be gritty so apply gently, or copious amounts of plain water- and I do mean copious)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturize- have a gentle, non comodogenic moisturizer on hand (this means it wont clog those pores you just worked so hard on!)and make sure it isnt oily or greasy. The name for the oil that your skin produces is called sebum, and that&#x27;s what gets blocked up to create pimples and black heads. Oil found in moisturizers can do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunblock- Your skin will be more sensitive to sunlight. Even use it on overcast days because uv rays can reach through clouds even though light rays can&#x27;t. You should be doing this already though to avoid skin cancer, wrinkles and age spots!&lt;br /&gt;I know all these have been mentioned in other reviews, but they can&#x27;t be stressed enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people, this is an acid peel. It&#x27;s not a toy. Use some common sense and don&#x27;t use just before a big event or a special occasion. It&#x27;s called a \\&quot;peel\\&quot; because it causes the top layer of your skin (the epidermis, made up of dead skin cells) to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off and reveals the underlying layer (dermis, fresh, new skin cells) which is sensitive to begin with and has now been treated with a fairly harsh acid. You may (read: probably will) have red skin for a day or so and it may (read: probably will) be a bit tender.this already though to avoid skin cancer, wrinkles and age spots!

    <li> Since my last pregnancy, this \\&quot;matured\\&quot; mama developed melasma on the face, mainly on the cheeks and on the upper lip.  I could live with the pigmentation on my cheeks, but the \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; was entirely unacceptable.  After 2 summers of embarrassment (the pigmentation is triggered during the warmer months) and failed remedies which included an OTC fade cream with 2% Hydroquinone, I started using the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel this spring.  I started with 1 min, then 3, then 5, then 6.  I spaced plenty of time between each peel, like 3 weeks, to allow my skin to recover.  My face got slightly red but my skin always came out smooth and beautiful after each peel.  About 3 months after I started the treatments, I did one peel for 8 minutes.  Oh boy, my face burned, got really red, and the skin literally peeled.  I took a long break before using the peel again.  During this summer, I could tell the mustache was trying to rear its ugly head again.  I went back to peeling every 3 weeks or so.  But this time I added an exfoliating scrub between the peels.  Summer is almost over and my mustache hardly made an appearance this year.  Of course, I made sure to wear sunscreen EVERYDAY before I left the house.  The sunscreen was homemade and it contained &gt;15% zinc oxide.  If I knew I was going to be outdoors for awhile, I wore a hat.  This product really helped me to keep my mustache at bay this summer.  I should mention that the peels mainly worked on the melasma on my upper lip, not so much on the cheeks.  The peels have reduced some of the pigmentation on the cheeks, but they are definitely still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I accidentally left the peel on for 10 minutes and my face didn&#x27;t burn nor peeled.  Go figure. :/</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t make reviews (this is my first one) but i had to make an exception for this peel    I&#x27;m an African American male and I have had problem skin throughout most of my adolescence (I&#x27;m 24)    I tried all your over the counter washes and they were only a temporary fix...2 applications of this peel has done more than anything else has    A regimen of Cetaphil cleaner and 2 1000MG B5 Vitamins daily along with this peel every 5 days has cleared my skin completely and my skin tone is becoming more and more even by the day    Wish I woulda found this in high school but better late than never :-)</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Glyco-Lactic combo peel. I used the Lactic Acid Peel before and really liked so I thought I would give this one a try. I have fair sensitive skin and this is amazing! It really decongests the skin and makes it nice and smooth and clear. Be careful and read the directions so you do not get burned! Especially around the nose area can be very sensitive to these peels. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was my first adventure in chemical peels, after years and years of acne treatments.  I&#x27;ve been around the block in terms of acne treatment!  My skin was dull, flaky, and wrinkly.  I was very nervous to try this peel, and left it on for a few minutes.  There was no peeling or redness the next day, though my skin was slightly sensitive at first.  My skin texture improved immediately, and my pores look better.  There was no real improvement in number/frequency of breakouts, but my overall texture has improved.  I&#x27;ve since used it many times, once every five days or so.  The results get better after each use.  I also use oil free acne wash, a benzoil peroxide mask and moisturizers with sunscreen.  This is a great peel, don&#x27;t be afraid!  I just used a cotton ball to put it on, no need for a fancy brush.</li>
    <li> But this stuff works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. Literally a stretch mark miracle! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and the marks have faded from pink to white and the dents in my skin are not nearly as noticeable! Amazing! I use it under my eyes too once a week, my circles are finally fading!</li>
    <li> Based on the product description it&#x27;s a light chemical peel. What is a definition of light?  I didn&#x27;t feel or see any peeling at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed. Will not buy any product from this company again.</li>
    <li> I want to add to the reviews that I studied esthetics and carried a license as an esthetician for a period of time and I used peels and various glycolic and lactic acids on clients and for personal use.  I can attest to the quality of these.  I was weary at first because I have ordered on line in the past and ended up with something that just burnt the skin and did more damage than good.  There is a wide range of quality associated with these peels, and this product is one of the best.  There was a slight burn/tingling when I applied it, but it left the skin just \\&quot;sunkissed\\&quot; looking.  No peeling or down time involved...and it really did the job to remove the superficial layer of skin and create a healthy glow.  I would highly recommend this.  One last note...it is not recommended to apply peels in the summer months because removing layers of dead skin cells makes you much more vulnerable to damage from the sun.  Although I know better than to use it in mid-July as I have been...I am super careful to be sure to apply a minimum of 20 spf for every day and 40 spf and a hat on sunny days spent outdoors.</li>
    <li> I just came on to Amazon to buy my 2nd shipment. I have also recommended this company/product to two other friends + my 62 yo mom who are converts.    I&#x27;m a fair-skinned, freckle faced 36 yo originally from Arizona. I spent my fair share in the sun and now am beginning to see the effects of this. On a regular basis, I would have chin breakouts and along my hairline. I also started developing sun spots (wider, browner freckles) on my forehead and cheekbone and fine lines around my eyes (I was anti-sunglasses in the past).  I&#x27;m going on 3 months of using this product weekly for 3-4 mins each time. I never peel, but my skin gets tight. I did work my way up... beginning at 30 secs the first time and so on... (I have \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; skin so I was leery...)    My skin is smoother, some of my freckles have faded (especially the very prominent ones, my skin feels dewier and some of the crepe-like fine lines are less noticeable.  I also know it&#x27;s working because I still get breakouts on my neck occasionally...so now I&#x27;m using the product on my neck to combat this.    My one downside:  It doesn&#x27;t fade the freckles as much as I would like, but the other benefits outweigh this \\&quot;con\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a light glycolic acid peel for years with great results. For the last 6 months I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Aqua Glycolic\\&quot; skin care line, which includes a face wash, toner, face cream, body wash and body cream. I used to have really bad cystic acne along my jawline, but Aqua Glycolic products changed my life. I don&#x27;t use all of their products every day anymore, but I use at least the face cream once every 3 days to keep up my smooth clear skin.  My skin has been really great, but since I&#x27;m getting married late October, I thought it would be great to try a stronger peel. I want to look my best for my wedding day and since I&#x27;ve had great results with glycolic acid in general, Glyco-Lac/60 seemed to be the next logical step.   WRONG! I kept it on for about 1 minute and rinsed it off with tons of water in the shower. My face felt a little sensitive, but no big deal. Within 5 hours, I could feel a whole crop of pimples developing along my jawline. Since I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts for over 6 months, this was quite surprising. By the next morning, my entire jawline was covered with huge cystic swollen acne.   It&#x27;s been 4 days and I&#x27;m getting even more acne. I don&#x27;t know what to do because my wedding is 21 days away! I need this to go away quick. I&#x27;m so surprised because I&#x27;m no stranger to glycolic acid and I only left it on for 1 minute. Also, since I&#x27;ve had such good experience with glycolic acid in the past, I couldn&#x27;t imagine this happening. Could it be purging my skin of any leftover stuff in my pores? That would be ok, but I hope it finishes the process sooner than later. I guess I&#x27;m wearing my hair down for the wedding!  I read and followed all the instructions, but everyone is different. I even did a patch test on the inside of my arm. I nearly covered from wrist to bicep and left it on for 1-2 minutes. My arm is just fine and nothing happened whatsoever, so I proceeded to apply it to my face.   I&#x27;m glad to hear that most everyone else had a great experience. I just wanted to share a different type of experience with those who may be sensitive to this product. I should have left well enough alone! I just though there was enough downtime to deal with any after effects of the peel,</li>
    <li> This is a very very light peel. I left it on for 3 min my 1st application and there was little to no discomfort and the results was very very small. I think this is a good product for those who are only trying to refresh the skin not reduce acne marks. I purchased this with a stronger product and my intention is to use it inconjunction with that product.</li>
    <li> I love trying masks and peels. Some of my favorites are the L&#x27;Oreal salicylic acid peel and the DDF sulfur mask. This product was well priced and definitely worth a try. Something under 20 dollars makes it easier to experiment to see what works best for you and not feel terrible for wasting $ if its not what you expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have fair,freckled skin and have started to notice broken capillaries in my cheeks from sun damage. No one else notices, but, you know, when its your face, you see everything. I figured now in my late 20&#x27;s, its time to start taking good care of my skin and treating it the best I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel is thin liquid gel and goes on nicely with a fan brush. I personally found the smell unpleasant, but nothing completely overpowering. I thought I had sensitive skin, but I can leave this peel on for 5 minutes or so with no discomfort. Just a little tingling. But, do make sure you read the directions and follow them well, because you don&#x27;t know how your skin will react, some can only stand the peel for seconds at a time. When the time is up, I rinse off with cool water and then use a neutralizer cream that came with the L&#x27;Oreal kit as a finisher to re-moisturize a bit. It actually pairs nicely with the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already used this one month on, one month off, and just started my 2nd month using the peel. I found that I kind of missed it and was happy to start using it again. It leaves my skin really soft with a more even tone. I don&#x27;t peel necessarily, but if I rub my skin gently, the top layer seem to roll off and its grey and gross so I&#x27;m glad to be rid of it. No down time, you wouldn&#x27;t even know I&#x27;d done the peel minutes before unless I mentioned it. I look forward to trying some of the other ones from this same company!</li>
    <li> Started using this four weeks ago.  Apply with a brush, and I use it once a week.  It tingles/stings a bit.  I was afraid to leave it on too long, but this last week I removed my \\&quot;peach fuzz\\&quot; - then used the product.  It really stung quite a bit, and my face turned red like a mild sunburn.  I was a bit concerned, but in fact this was the best week yet - very mild flaking and now my skin looks MUCH improved - smoother, and fading of a sun/age spot is noticed.  I&#x27;m 50, and have oily skin with large pores and some mild scarring.  I really see a difference!</li>
    <li> Maybe I was expecting to much I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can see maybe 10% impr in my face, my scars are still there no peeling with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this peel because I have a problem with blackheads and large pores.This helps both. I love this peel.Its gentle enough to use twice weekly but still gets the job done.I own a microdermabrasion machine which I also purchased from Amazon and I use this peel after I use my machine. I leave the peel on for about 5 minutes (my skin can tolerate it)then wash my face and apply sunscreen. Blackheads on my nose are gone, pores are almost non existent.Doesnt irritate and you dont have to hide out after so your skin can peel like you do when you use a TCA peel.Great deal. Excellent product. You will see a difference in your skin after two uses.</li>
    <li> I have had 4 peels, and the hyperpigmentation in my face has been broken and faded.  I scrub it very gently, and only once for 4 minutes.  I am going to complete the 6 peels, and rest for a couple of months before re-starting.  Also, the bottle is still 3/4 full.   I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to give this a month or so before I commented on what I thought, I got it around the 1st week of Nov and I have been using it once a week, I dont really see a difference at all in my face? I did have a zit on my lower cheek and I spot treated there, I dont know hopefully it looks okay but it didnt today...also around that area it looks like I fell and scabbed my face, I noticed that happened in another area last time, and the 1st time this patch by my eye got dry and started peeling then I got another patch by my nose, I dont know I dont really see an improvement yet?</li>
    <li> Great product as it just works! Be sure to not go past 5 -7 minutes with this.</li>
    <li> While I bought this to help the wrinkles developing under my eyes (grad school) and it hasn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m still giving it five stars because the quality of my skin has improved dramatically. I have always had problem skin, haven&#x27;t been out of the house without makeup on in a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week for about six weeks now, and last week I noticed my skin is incredibly clear and smooth. I really recommend it for that reason alone. It&#x27;s also MUCH more mild than some other peels and doesn&#x27;t cause your face to peel excessively. I&#x27;ve used the strong salicylic acid peel and it just isn&#x27;t practical to use if you have a job and don&#x27;t want people to see your face peeling off in sheets. This peel produces better results without the pain and hassle of a prolonged peel. Great!</li>
    <li> Cost effective, and just as good as any salon can deliver.  It doesnt hurt for me but i did start with a LVL1 product first.  I highly recommend this- it leaves my face very smooth and was worth every penny. I use it less than once a month.  It makes a HUGE difference in the quality of my skin. I did over use at first as i was over zelous. Now that i use it less often it helps to keep my skin fresh and smooth, if i use weekly i get red and blotchy and gross. Find what works for you and do not overexfoliate. Highly rec!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had peels at the dermatologist&#x27;s office before so maybe that was the problem.  The strengths of these peels definitely do not compare.  No tingling, no nothing.  I have to step up the strength or maybe use an unbuffered version I guess.</li>
    <li> This worked fabulously on my sceen. All my acne is gone. It did sting a little but nothing that isnt bearable.</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema on my limbs and torso and severe dryness on my face.  All my skin problems are fairly new, and I have been searching for a product or regime that will ease the uncomfortable and sometimes painful dryness I experience on my face.  Initially, I stopped cleansing my face with my normal face wash and decreased my cleansings to once at night.  I began using Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil cleanser which did not seem to help.  Then I tried the oil cleansing method- a mixture of caster oil and apricot kernal oil- to clean my facial skin.  This method relieved some of the irritation,  but my skin was still extremely dry even after applying a generous amount of moisturizer (Dr. Grandel PhytoCare AZULENE CREME).  My next try was [[ASIN:B000PNTQW0 Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl oz]] which did not seem to help but actually make my skin worse.  After my second use of the chemical peel, I started using this Emu Oil.  The emu oil has no scent and absorbs into the skin better than other oils I have tried. It has been the only moisturizer that has kept my face from having that tight feeling for nearly the entire day.  After the second application of the chemical peel and the daily use of the emu oil for less than a week, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin.  The peel helped remove the patchy, red dry skin and the emu oil has made my skin feel fabulous for the first time in months.  My skin is so soft and smooth, it&#x27;s incredible.  I would recommend the use of both [[ASIN:B000PNTQW0 Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl oz]] and [[ASIN:B001MWV40U Emu Oil Pure Premium Australian - Powerful Skin and Hair Moisturizer]] to anyone suffering from extremly dry skin.</li>
    <li> IF YOU HAVE EVER UTTERED THOSE WORDS WELL THAT IS NO EXCUSE NOT TO LOOK AS GOOD AS ALL OF THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE THAT ARE MUCH MORE FINANCIALLY ENDOWED THAN YOURSELF. DO IT YOURSELF, THEN GO AHEAD AND TIP YOURSELF.......YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING GOOD NOW!</li>
    <li> So I started with the 20% Salicylic acid because it&#x27;s a Level 1 peel and the awesome reviews, but it didn&#x27;t really help clear up my skin so much.  What&#x27;s the point of all that flaky and scaly skin if the acne doesn&#x27;t at least subside?    So I went with something a little stronger and although it&#x27;s only been 1 week, my skin has cleared up dramatically and with less scaling/flakiness.  WTH?  Whenever I feel a deep adult hormonal acneic cyst coming on, I dab on a  little bit of product after washing, leave on for 3-5 minutes, neutralize with water, repeating everyday before bed.  The thing usually dries up in 1-2 days and disappears.  YAY~  So I&#x27;ll update after a month ...</li>
    <li> Great product a must buy for youthful skin</li>
    <li> This product worked well for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;But make sure it is a product for you.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff when my acne flares up and I get a huge breakout despite my daily acne facial cleansing routine. Just 1 peel and the acne goes down. Love it.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail 2 days ago and have completed my first \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. I have tried sal/glyc peels in the past, but decided to go with the glyc/lac peel this time. The sting/tingling is completely bearable compared to others that I&#x27;ve tried. I only left it on for a minute just to be safe, and I tend to have sensitive skin. Better safe than sorry, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and medium-dark spots from sun damage and pimple scars. I have a few problem pimples here and there, Caucasian, mid twenties, female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel is light enough to not freak out when you put it on your face, mild, mild, mild tingling. The next day I had no redness (only left it on for a minute!) but I felt my skin was smooth and more &#x27;comfy&#x27; feeling. No peeling yet, and the directions say that you may not peel at all, but to exfoliate a week or so after the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good! I will update when I do my next peel in a week.</li>
    <li> This product really does what it is intended to do. It&#x27;s a bit stronger than the Level 1 Glycolic 35, so I would only leave it on for 5 minutes or less unless you can tolerate it.</li>
    <li> Came with good instructions. Not too strong. I apply with a good quality \\&quot;fan brush\\&quot; from the art store. I lasted about 20 seconds with the first one. The second one was probably about 50 seconds (after steaming). Third one was a little over a minute. Helps release clogged pores, but not as well as I would like. I am using this one to work up to a stronger peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite peel. I use it once a week for 5 minutes each time. People have asked me if I have changed my makeup. But it&#x27;s actually my skin that&#x27;s glowing. I have recommended this to three friends and all three friends love this product!</li>
    <li> Thank you works great on my hands!!</li>
    <li> Definetly stings going on but has not made me peel like using Retina-a which is nice. I&#x27;ve used this peel 5 weeks so far and the little bumps around my hairline have disappeared and my skin looks generally better but not a super dramatic change, just improved. Also a bit of improvement around some lines around my eyes... Don&#x27;t want to get it too close though.  Would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth as olive oil, tingles instead of stings, and does it&#x27;s job effectively without damage, burning, par boiled lobster face, huge patches of dark dead skin, or heavy duty peeling. In short, it is simply a product of amazing quality. Glyco-Lac/60 gives you all of the benefits of improved skin clarity and a quality healthy glow, without any of the downtime associated with peels.  Afterwards, my face felt so tight, I simply love this stuff! As for post peel moisturizing try: a 100% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and/or emu oil {If you are prone to breakouts like me, try mixing a tiny drop of either or both into your moisturizer and adjust the size of the drop to suit you skin. i.e., a full drop breaks me out, but half a drop mixed into enough moisturizer for my whole face and neck, leaves my skin is so moist, dewy and unbelievably supple}. Wishing all a peaceful soul, a kind heart, a happy disposition, and true beauty, both inside and out.</li>
    <li> This is close to what the professionals use. This actually works better on my dry skin. It gives it just enough to have the top layer peel and begin to regenerate. I use a good moisturizer after rinsing and drying.</li>
    <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this, as you never know what exactly it is you&#x27;re going to get.    I recieved the product in a very timely matter, and after reading the detailed instructions and warnings, was a bit reluctant to use.(the instructions are very complete and leave nothing to question)    However I went ahead and tried it.    After the first application I was surprised to see how well it did work.  I used it only one minute the first several times, and have gradually worked up to only 3 minutes on my face.    Even these short lengths of time have made a remarkable difference to my face. I have a problem with aging skin and lots of recurrent milia. Which nothing has touched. These were immediatly reduced in size and after several \\&quot;peels\\&quot; have disappeared.   My derma doc was surprised that we could, as lay people buy such a high concentration and quality on line.   I will continue to buy and use this product on my face forever!  The results are nothing short of amazing!  scat</li>
    <li> I bought this, and tried to get my mom and sisters to do it with me, but they saw \\&quot;acid gel peel\\&quot; and wouldn&#x27;t go near it. Well, they missed out because I used it about a week ago, and my skin is incredibly soft, and looks much better than when it did to begin with. I will let my skin have a break for a little while, and I&#x27;m definitely going to do it again!</li>
    <li> This product came with a small bottle of the salicylic acid peel, which i used beforehand. It was much stronger than this to me, but i dealt with it, plus it was nice that they included it in the package. I had yet to find something that would lighten the noticable dark places on my face but this has done it. i am in my early 40s and although my skin was not really bad, it has made a noticable difference, especially in the tone. it does tingle upon application but doesn&#x27;t burn, and I had no peeling effect, but i am overall happy with it and will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> As stated in other reviews, yes the product arrived in excellent condition. Yes, the product included full easy to understand directions included, and worked as detailed when applied per directions. I am not the best person to comment on this actual product right now, because I was scared upon applying and did not let the product run its full course. I believe I left the product on my face for about 30 seconds. However, after removing the product, my face was extremely soft. Wish I would have left the product on for a little while longer. What can I say, I was scccuuurrreeedddd!</li>
    <li> Hi All. I only gave this four stars because I have only used it one time. I like how easy it was to use. I like that the tingly sensation did not escalate to any scary burning. I like that all I needed was a piece of gauze to apply it. The directions were really clear and explained any questions I could think of. Also told me what to do as well as not to do before and after to avoid negative issues and negative results. I am African American with dark skin. I was told tha the TCA peels could darken already dark hues and that this was a safe alternative. Actually,I found this easier then the weekly clay mask that I use. I am so glad that there are multiple uses in just one bottle. I mean sixty dollars for one facial and you are encouraged to have several!Who can keep up at those prices? My skin is in fairly good condition. My issue of great concern is the marks on my nose from wearing glasses. I wear contacts for the most part but still have to use readers throughout the day. As a result I have hideous dark marks. I try to cover them with concealer but I do not want to wear foundation everyday just for these two marks. I&#x27;m hoping this peel will resolve this issue as well as improving the overall appearance of my skin. If I get the results in the reviews I will most certainly be happy. I have not noticed must of a difference yet but I have had some flaking that must be minor peeling. I&#x27;m so excited to do do my own weekly peels now. I plan to do one every 7 days. The directions say to wait at least 5 days. I will adjust according to the reaction of my skin. I will update these post too. Peace and Blessings.</li>
    <li> Love it, easy to use.</li>
    <li> This has worked great for my 14 year old teenager! Her spots have cleared up. She have a great complextion. Perfer purshasing from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I recently returned from Ireland, where my skin broke out like crazy!  A series of peels and the Exposed system have gotten my skin back to normal.  I follow the directions, and perform six peels in 4 weeks twice a year.  This bottle will last me 18 months.  I started with the gentler, Glycolic Acid 35, but switched after I finished the bottle, because my skin could handle it.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, and have oily skin with a little acne.  It seems to cause a little bit of a breakout, but, afterward, my oil is under control for months, so I do feel like it helps my acne overall.  Will it keep wrinkles at bay?  I guess time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns right away, but doesn&#x27;t leave me red or anything.  However, be careful!  I was easily handling 4 min peels, and thought I could bump up to six.  At 5 min 20 sec, my face was on fire, so I bailed, and was very red, and developed some scabby streaks.  Now, I keep it to 5 min.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old with Rosacea and sun damage.  I felt a difference the very first time I used this peel! I left it on 1 minute.  The second time I used it I left it on 3 minutes and can see a difference!</li>
    <li> This product greatly improved my sun spots and fine wrinkles on my face.  On first use I left it on for 1 minute, but found the next morning that I didn&#x27;t see much affect.  Two nights later I reapplied and left on for five.  It definately tingles, but is bareable.  I rinsed off with a water and baking soda mix to neutralize it and followed up with clinique spot corrector.  The next morning there was definate fading.  I hope it continues.  I did find it also brought out a few pimples that were under the surface but they dried up and were gone in a day.  Great product.</li>
    <li> listing says it is glyco-lac/60 which would indicate that it is 60%, but when you read the small print on back of bottle, it is only 35% of each...feel ripped off...did not get what the front label or listing says...Didn&#x27;t realize this until i had used it and could not figure out why there was no burn at all even after 5 minutes...</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle.  After just one application I noticed softer, smoother skin and tighter pores.  I&#x27;ve been using it weekly for 4 weeks and the improvement continues.  My skin glows, fine lines are diminished, deep lines are softer, red spots are almost gone and don&#x27;t get me started on turkey neck.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much as a 57 year old former smoker who lived in the sun.  Wow, what a difference!  Do follow the instructions,  use a fan brush for efficient application and minimal waste, prep with alcohol and don&#x27;t panic when it stings because it does.  I should say that with 4 minutes I have never had any down time.</li>
    <li> ...i have leather skin and it&#x27;s just not going to work.  i have hyper-pigmentation and scarring from sun damage, acne and ezcema.  i wanted to get rid of or lighten the scarring.  i&#x27;ve spent a good two months doing weekly treatments.  i felt the tingly burning sensation but i have yet to see results.  sigh...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used such products before, but they were a lot stronger. This one seems to be really mild and doesn&#x27;t burn at all, however doesn&#x27;t effect much.&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s just fine for my sensitive skin, not perfect but works</li>
    <li> I ordered this after reading about the benefits of glycolic and lactic acid peels. Ever since I turned 24 (I&#x27;m 25 now) my face just EXPLODED! I haven&#x27;t had a clear, unzitty day so far! (And recently it&#x27;s been getting worse)....    I read about how these acids help to \\&quot;Unglue\\&quot; the dead skin cells from your face so that the fresh skin cells can regenerate better and also the dead cells won&#x27;t be able to clog up into pores (Which is one reason for acne)..... The minute I read this I had to try a peel and see if it would help me skin!    I put it on last night, only kept it on for 2 minutes and then rinsed it off thoroughly. I also bought the pH balancer to use as an after treatment. SO far my skin FEELS so soft and LOOKS a LOT smoother. I&#x27;m waiting for the remaining spots I have on my face to heal up and then in the next week or so I will let you know if this helps keep new breakouts at bay by keeping my face regenerating........ I HOPE THIS WORKS!    EDIT: It is now 01/14/09 and WOW! What a difference! At first I used this peel once a week for about a month and MAN! It makes your skin so smooth and soft. After about two weeks I noticed I had not had ONE cystic zit! NONE! (I was still getting littler ones here and there but they were NOTHING compared to the big painful cystic zits I would normally get!) And now, two months later and my face is almost completely clear. I get about one zit a week, and it goes away FAST! I am so happy I found something that helped my acne prone skin!</li>
    <li> I really want to like this - I think it does a good job exfoliating.  However, it is a bit too strong, I think, because I tend to get excema after I use it.  I have to be very careful with what i use, and this was just not good judgement on my part.</li>
    <li> I have tried two other acid peels before this one. This one is by far my favorite! I didn&#x27;t feel as much burning with this one as I did the other two. I left this on for 8 minutes. My face was not as red afterwards and I thought that maybe something was wrong with the product.&lt;br /&gt;The next day I noticed a big difference! Even my family did! It brought out things that I didn&#x27;t know I had! Like blackheads on my forehead! I had never had blackheads before! It is slowly bringing out stuff that has been under my skin for years that I didn&#x27;t even know I had! I have suffered from acne for many years. I believe with this product that I will have clear smooth skin in time. They say that it gets bad before it gets better! At least  I feel like I have hope now!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a peel but not salon prices. If you follow the instructions.. I noticed a slight difference . I would recommend using this during the winter months. During the summer, you need to be diligent about using sunscreen ... Also don&#x27;t leave it on longer than recommended.. You can burn your skin .</li>
    <li> I use it every 10 days and get compliments on my smooth 56-year-old skin daily - will use this for life</li>
    <li> Love it! Left it on for 5 minutes. My clogged pores were immediately clearing after removing the peel. I haven&#x27;t peeled but my skin looks so smooth and some scarring is lighter from a recent breakout. Great light peel.</li>
    <li> A good general peel for experienced users and professionals.  I use this product on myself and in my spa.  Neutralize well and apply heavy moisturizer after use</li>
    <li> I  use the 60% once a week and and prefer this regime to my prior routine using a 10% cream nightly.  The mild stinging that omes in those first few minutes after application lets me know it&#x27;s working, and all those dead skin cells are sloughing off.  It leaves my skin with a clean, radiant look.</li>
    <li> This product arrived the next day , I was shocked how quick to came. I have mild sun damage, enlarged pores and have always had acne issues-blackheads on the nose, mild sebaceous cyst like, congested skin so my skin has mild scarring-texture and acne marks and oily skin, mostly t-zone area.   I have only used it twice, every 5 days, but have noticed an improvement in skin condition, texture is improving, my skin feels better, acne is alot better, minor wrinkles seem to be improving, acne scars look to be less, moisturizer seems to soak into my skin better not just \\&quot;sit \\&quot; on top anymore -skin seems more \\&quot;plump\\&quot;,  haven&#x27;t noticed much with the age spots/sun damage yet, but will see after a few more applications. I feel comfortable now going out without having putting on alot of makeup to cover those issues, just a little concealer &amp; power and I&#x27;m good, no more heavy makeup base.  I was able to leave this on my skin starting at 3 minutes I am now up to 5, it does have a mild sting to it, didn&#x27;t have much redness and what was there was better by morning. I did used a mix of about a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of water for a neutralizer which did help, I splashed it on my skin after rinsing product off, left it sit for a minute or two then rinsed that off. My skin is sensitive to alot of products, but wasn&#x27;t overly irritated by this, what I would say would be acceptable.  My skin didn&#x27;t flake, appear overly dry or \\&quot;peel\\&quot; and I used the Dandelion moisturizer from Better Botanicals afterwards.  My skin is improving and hope the age spots start to fade a bit more. I would recommend this product, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and do a test patch to figure out the tolerance for your skin.   Also I am a VERY picky on products I use for my skin, this so far is making a difference in the right direction and I will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This is a awesome amd effective product. The peel is great for beginners not too harsh or aggressive. However proceed with caution and allow your skin to become accustom to the acid... Also make sure you rinse well with tepid water and follow up with neutralizer. I prefer to use my own moisturizer blend afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m of mixed/multi-racial heritage (mainly black/white), hence I have a medium brown complexion, nevertheless, it works rather well.&lt;br /&gt;Helps to fade dark spots to a certain degree, i.e. they&#x27;re a lot lighter than they were, and perhaps not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also makes for a good, overall light facial peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum :&lt;br /&gt;I have since tried the Lactic Acid 70% Gel Peel, 100ml (re: http://www.amazon.com/Lactic-Acid-Peel-100ml-Professional/dp/B001THX07S/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top )  - And find this works much better, even if over a longer period!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy w/this product. I started getting acne as an adult, I &#x27;ve picked at some pimples on my face which left me with darks spots. I bought this to hopefully stop my acne and lighten my dark spots. I can say after using this product only once (just arrived) I can notice a difference. I applied this at night, when I woke up my skin wasn&#x27;t as oily as it normally is. I only powdered my face once today vs several times  while im at work. My face seems smoother, and brighter. I will recommend this to friends and when I run out I will reorder. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Great for staters! The peeling action is soft and discrete, keep my skin clean and even. I am Dominican, caramel like complexion.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years.  I do it once a week for 4 weeks during the winter.  I like the out come and notice it keeps my skin looking younger and clearer throughout the year.</li>
    <li> It really didn&#x27;t work, I didn&#x27;t see any changes and I used it multiply times as suggested yet the spot on my leg looked the same.</li>
    <li> I moved up to this level 2 peel after about a year of doing less intense home peels with products from the same company.  As always, the quality of product is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the peel twice a week during fall, winter and spring months.  In the summer, I avoid these peels, unless I know I will be out of the sun for 2 weeks at a time.  First, I clean my face thoroughly with my Clarisonic, which I have found gets my skin cleaner than anything.  I dry my face thoroughly, and apply a thin layer of the gel peel, which I let sit for between 5 and 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Yes, it stings.  Not unbearably, and it diminishes as the peel begins to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the time is up, I rinse my face (usually I&#x27;ve been in the bathtub, shaving legs or whatnot) in the shower with lukewarm water.  I do a quick pat dry with a towel, leaving my face damp, and then immediately apply moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve found that Cetaphil cream and a drop of matrixyl oil, which contains glycerin, make the perfect ultra-rich and irritant-free moisturizer, which soaks right in to the skin after a peel.  It&#x27;s soothing and those peptides get right where they need to go this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 years old, and I&#x27;ve been doing this routine, with variations, for a few years.  I have minimal crows feet and no other fine lines or wrinkles.  My skin is clear, glowing, and healthy-looking.  I had adult acne well into my  forties, but between Bare Minerals makeup and the peels, that&#x27;s a thing of the past.  Even the little whiteheads and tiny bumps I used to get around my jaw or hairline are gone.</li>
    <li> I was worried about buying a combo peel but I love this one! It works, no downtime and it leaves my skin feeling smooth, visibly more vibrant, more evened tone and with less fine lines. I&#x27;m a 31 year old Caucasian female with no prior skin problems, just looking to combat the aging process and with this peel I am winning! woo hoo!</li>
    <li> I use this and the salicylic peel from this company for exfoliation because I cannot use any manual exfoliation due to skin sensitivity.  Both peels are wonderful and worked better than I expected.  I cannot be sure which peel is the cause, but the areas with eczema problems are less sensitive and my skin is so much calmer overall.</li>
    <li> Very good results, fast.</li>
    <li> I had never used a peel before so I purchased this one to start off! After just one use you see definite results. I use this every five days for ten minutes, the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; is VERY tolerable. I was an indoor, every other day tanner so I had a lot of discoloration in my face. After two uses, I am comfortable enough to go out with out make on! My skin tone has definitely evened out, my pores have shrunk and i think i have gotten TWO pimples since i began using this two months ago! Over all I am very pleased with my purchase but I am ready for the real stuff! I have tried this on several friends and after just one use, they have ALL purchased this as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of times, but it seems like the Salicylic Acid 20% from the same company works better on my skin.  Wasn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be and couldn&#x27;t notice any results to speak of.</li>
    <li> I had started my peel process with the Glycolic level 1. Since this is &#x27;first time use&#x27;, I was cautious on doing this very lightly..after all, it is your face. After a use of about (6) treatments I did notice a small amount of change. Note that the bottle is for a (6) treatment application. I went very light on each use, and still have 1/2 the bottle left. Never really felt but a slight &#x27;tingle&#x27; and only left on for about 3-5 minutes. Did not notice much redness or peeling, just a bit of &#x27;flaking&#x27;.  Followed directions to the letter.    Since this was slow process, (on a well-used sun-baby geezer), I decided to try the Glyco-Lac/60. Recommended for heavier blemishes and sun damage.  Did the same as above, slow start until comfortable. Started seeing a bigger-faster result. Moved up to a full 8-10 minute application period. I now am noticing much faster results. More redness and heavier peeling. On applying it is more of a tingling-warm effect,(nothing painful).  I have not had any &#x27;blistering or heavy scabbing&#x27;. It does take longer for the redness to diminish. But it positively is working. Since my face  has seen a lot of years in the sun, many of the spots are deep, so it is a matter of time before they are much lighter or gone, and that is fine, as long as I achieve end result.    I will use up the &#x27;Lac 60&#x27; and save the &#x27;level 1&#x27; for follow-up and touch-up.    As other &#x27;reviewers&#x27; have said: Pay attention to the application process and do not expect overnight results. My skin tone is more on the olive-side. As a kid always got a heavy tan without redness or burning, rarely ever peeled. So take your complexion in consideration.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a year and it is my favorite.  Always be sure to go by the directions and use correctly.  It is important to work up to the higher percentage.  The results are great.</li>
    <li> you must be consistent. Use this only after using a 10 % , then a 30 % . Good product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have been using it for about 2 months. My acne has disappeared! As a bonus my skin is softer, more even, and healthy looking. I still get tiny hormonal single pimples once a month but even that is getting better over time. Because I have sensitive skin I use the peel twice a week for about a minute. I follow with a very light jojoba oil. That&#x27;s it.  After 25 years of dealing with acne, this is the absolute best product I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This peel has made such a difference in my skin.  My skin was dull, uneven, and blotchy.  Plus, I was breaking out terribly due to being pregnant. You would not believe the before and after pictures. After just four weeks, my skin is dewy, even, and fresh-looking.  AND no more breakouts.</li>
    <li> Saves you $$ and Expedited quickly, too!</li>
    <li> Works Great. Best at Home Therapy. Have been using this for over 3 years and results are amazing.  Highly Recommend Skin Laboratory Products.</li>
    <li> great product .  I have seen acne scars fade and wrinkles diminished in such a short amount of  time! I use this product once a week only since I have sensitive skin.  Amazing difference.</li>
    <li> Good product and performs as suggested. I followed the instructions and had nothing but positive results. Makes my skin look so much better a fresher. I alternate with the salicylic acid and have had fine results. I have aging skin and in my 70&#x27;s. Nice to see such well performing product on the web. Prevents me from having to visit salons to get the same outcome with horrible prices.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have noticed a huge improvement with my &#x27;adult acne&#x27;. I hate those words, lol.  I primarily bought if for fine lines but I am amazed at how it has reduced not only the number of breakouts by like 90 percent. But also the duration...they are gone within a day! It also works pretty well at lightening the dark circles under my eyes and I see some increased toning in my face and neck after applying...this doesn&#x27;t last that long though. We&#x27;ll see how the fine lines and dark marks go with further use.  But just the fact that this has reduced my breakout so dramatically will help the dark marks caused by acne tremendously.  I have used it 3 times so far, 5 days a part. 1st time for 1 minute, the next time for 2 or 3mins and the last time for 4 min.  My skin is sensitive so I was def feeling it after 4 minutes!! I rinse with water, then with baking soda &amp; with water(mixed well so it is not gritty)and with water again.</li>
    <li> I had great results with this product.  I am 27, and am starting to see my first lines around my mouth.  This really improves my skin tone &amp; texture and makes the lines less visible.  It also makes my face radiant and fresh looking.  My pores look better, I have less blackheads &amp; less breakouts.  I&#x27;m hooked, but also thinking about trying something a little stronger next time now that my face has adjusted to this peel.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am a 31 year old female with acne on my chin; I wake up pretty much every morning with a new pimple and if I don&#x27;t have one in the morning then I can certainly count on having one by the end of the day. I also have scarring from having acne on my chin since I was 14 and scarring on the sides of my face. My skin is very oily and sensitive at the same time. I have tried absolutely every kind of foundation and every single one breaks me out. Hence, I&#x27;m not left with much to cover the mess on my face. Proactiv keeps it under control, but doesn&#x27;t solve the problem completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use some Glycolic peels in the past, with decent results...but this one really delivered. Tried it for the first time last night and my skin is glowing today...less oily and my pores look smaller too. I also had one of those huge, painful pimples forming under my skin and when I got up this morning, it was as if it was already clearing/drying out. I usually need to blot the oil off of my face at least 3 times per day and only had to once today and that&#x27;s because I was outside in the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find the stinging to be bothersome; to me it felt as if my pores were being cleansed from the inside out. My face felt so clean afterwards. I was able to tolerate the full 8 minutes the first time, as was my skin...but I am also someone who has done chemical peels before and I&#x27;m very into skincare and makeup products, so I&#x27;ve just tried many products on my face overall. Of all those products, this is the second one I&#x27;ve written a great review of.</li>
    <li> Two stars for not causing any damage but not doing anything useful, either.  I saw no difference in my sun and age-related spots, and no increased glow or anything.  Whatever it did at a cellular level didn&#x27;t show up anywhere I could see it.  This was my opinion of a few products I tried over the last year or so.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter (20, combination skin, occasional flare-up) and decided to test it on myself (50, on HRT, with extremely oily skin and occasional acne) first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have incredibly thick, oily skin--good, which keeps my skin well-moisturized and looking very young. Bad, though, because I have all the problems associated with young skin, plus a couple of age spots and many large pores.  As a frame of reference, I have used AHA/BHA/Salicylic products in the past, like the Alpha-Hydrox 12% souffle, a 15% Glycolic mask, as well as a home microdermabrasion buffer (Olay) and a microdermabrasion cloth, the kind used in plastic surgeon&#x27;s offices. All have given good results, but some better than others (see later in review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had all my treatment tools ready--a clock with a \\&quot;second\\&quot; hand to count the seconds, the baking soda and cool water mix, the gauze pads, a sink full of cool, running water, a shower, and witch hazel astringent.  The witch hazel is suggested as a pre-treatment to remove surface oil from the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled back my hair and pre-treated with witch hazel.  I poured the solution into a flat dish, dabbed the pad in, and started at forehead as suggested, went to one cheek, then onto the other, finishing with the chin and jawline.  All this time I kept a sharp watch on the clock and monitored my tingling tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one minute, my forehead felt nothing, but my cheeks and chin, as well as nose, were really feeling the pain.  So I began rinsing those quickly, and at 1 min 30 secs the forehead was hurting a lot so I rinsed that, and continued thorough rinsing, then went to the water/baking soda mix, splashed that on for about 10 seconds, then I  popped into the lukewarm shower.  My facial skin felt really dry in the shower (do not use any cleansers!)  After that was done I moisturized.  It is now 30 minutes later and my skin definitely looks better, smoother, more even-toned. It does still sting a bit, like that sunburn feeling, though, and shows a light pink tinge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of intensity, it is slightly stronger to the results I had with the microdermabrasion cloth and 15% mask, and even more intense than the 12% souffle, and much more intense than the Olay microdermabrasion puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised that it took only 1 minute to start to feel such strong tingling, considering I do not have sensitive skin.  This product does work, so I suggest monitoring intensity closely, especially the first time.  Also, if you pre-treat with witch hazel or alcohol (even stronger), both of which strip surface oils from your skin, then it will definitely affect (shorten) the time it takes for the product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, 45 minutes later, as it took time to write and proof this review, and the stinging has pretty much gone away, as has the pink tinge, although my face still feels dry and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine increasing the strength of this product; I would rather leave it on longer and monitor the time.  My friend has had acid peels in a surgeon&#x27;s office twice, and although the peels have gone deep and been quite effective in dealing with wrinkles, boot have left her with white splotches (uneven pigmented areas) that I, personally, would prefer to not have, at the cost of doing a lighter peel such as this, and tolerate a few more wrinkles.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a licensed esthetician with 7 years experience and i can&#x27;t believe this is available to non professionals.  this is a very strong acid peel and, in the wrong hands, could potentially damage the skin.&lt;br /&gt;if you really know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s a great peel and gives great results.  but it&#x27;s not for use by the general public and there are no instructions on how to neutralize this or regarding aftercare.</li>
    <li> not much of a peeler person but this worked out well,. I have sensitive skin so was surprised its so light.</li>
    <li> I always order different types of peels from them and have for a few years now I keep coming back.</li>
    <li> I was really excited when i found a dermatologist strenght product for my skin. I have had acne for a long time and it hasn&#x27;t been bad for a while, but recently i have had some breakouts and i wanted something that was going to control my acne. This product works very well. I am very reluctant to buy acne products because so many in that past have failed. I loved this product and would recomend it for anybody with skin problems.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  Follow the directions exactly and you should not have any problems.  This is week 6 of my treatment and my acne spots are almost gone.</li>
    <li> Careful~ I have been using this product for 4 months now. I still find that this is a strong product, not to be taken lightly! Do not use this product if you are using a retanoid creme, or under any other topical treatment for acne. Read the instructions very carefully and follow to the T, before you use this. And rinse it off completely. I used this once every 7-10 days for the first month, now I use it about once every 2-3 weeks. I get busy, and I&#x27;m not so good with weekly routines. When I first used it, I left it on only one minute-- with noticable difference~ Wow. My skin felt so smooth afterwards, no redness. Each time I use this, I can tell immediately after rinsing, the dead surface of my skin is gone. The second time (one week later) I left it on for 2 minutes....with some redness afterwards. So I went with 2 minutes about 10 days later, did better. The 4th time, I left it on 3 1/2 minutes~ had some redness for @ 4 hours, and the next day, some mild tiny sunburn like stripes on my upper cheeks. Lesson learned. So now....I just max out at 2 minutes. I feel safer. I don&#x27;t want to hurt my skin. Please watch out with this product! It is strong. I know a few ladies have posted \\&quot;no redness or burning,\\&quot; but everyone is different. This is quite strong for me. I put Avalon organics Vitamin C face serum on afterwards. My skin looks bright and fresh after use, feels super clean, and a few lines I had have softened, although I don&#x27;t have deep lines. It has helped lighten up some freckles/pigment on my lower cheeks that I did not like. I would never use this on my neck, its way too strong, keep it well away from the delicate eye area! It is not meant to be put on thin skin areas. This product is a professional strength product.</li>
    <li> I do like the fact that I can leave it on little bit longer than my other peels and I does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to do. Just give it time.</li>
    <li> This product is good. I have combo skin and this product relieves the oiliness w/o drying. It does have some stinging, but I didn&#x27;t experience any real discomfort or redness afterwards. I used another type of peel before and this one is better</li>
    <li> good product for sensitive skin types or people who don&#x27;t need heavy exfoliation.  Most of the clients I use it on say it very barely tingles.  It is not a &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; peel.  So it&#x27;s good if you want something, but want to be safe...</li>
    <li> This peel has a bit of a bite to it;but if it didn&#x27;t it would do the job. Took a few days to peel but really gave a good plumping to the surface of my skin.I did not leave it on long the first time.</li>
    <li> used it a few times , don&#x27;t think I use it right tho , I just sometimes do a facial with it . not daily or weekly , might do more that way , it tightens and lifts the skin , for a day or 2 , tho ,. with one app . stings , but not like clorisedic acid.</li>
    <li> It good but the money for the Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel -30 ml/1 fl have to go down it is good</li>
    <li> Pretty mind blowing stuff! my scars disappeared significantly. the glyco works better with my skin. Used over a course of 8 months.</li>
    <li> The only drawback is the burning. It really does sting upon application, though it doesn&#x27;t cause a rash or irritate the skin after rinsing (copious, copious rinsing). I keep the timer next to me and count down the seconds until I can splash it off. I do find it does provide a good light peel, but I dread the sting so much I do not perform it as regularly as I should. I used to use an alcohol and glycolic acid liquid on my face at night, with a much lower acid content, but I worried the alcohol was hurting my skin. This stuff could hurt you if you don&#x27;t prepare and handle it with respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy a dropper to measure the liquid with--you won&#x27;t need very much each time. Buy a fan brush for application, and pour the liquid into a clean container that you can get the brush into easily for application and using all the product. HAVE A TIMER, and start at the shortest time of exposure and build up to longer times. Use sunscreen after or it&#x27;s an entire waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great thing to be able to do at home rather than have to pay expensive spa fees for.</li>
    <li> Loved the way it peeled the skin and gave a good clean complexion when the peeling was over.&lt;br /&gt;I hated the peeling process however,cos it was so noticeable,no makeup cover I used could do a good masking effect,the peeling was brutal,but the after effect was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
    <li> I use this one and the salicylic acid peel by the same company. My skin is so soft after I use this, my acne is *significantly* better, and the acne scarring is fading. I will never be without this again!</li>
    <li> Liked this companies 50% lactic acid peel, so I tried this when I was finished with the bottle of L.A.&lt;br /&gt;pleased with this glycol lactic peel also. I feel confidant ordering this brand</li>
    <li> I have been using this product pretty consistently for the past 3 months. This was my first at home peel, so I did a lot of research on what solutions and % would work best with my skin issues. I am mid 30s, medium skin tone, dry and sensitive skin, with a lot of areas of sun damage and hyper pigmentation.  I went with the latic acid combo because reviews and recommendations said it was best for dry skin and dark spots.  I have used it about every 5-7 days.  My skin feels absolutely amazing after I finish the peel. Very smooth and radiant. Started with leaving it one for only a minute, then have increased to 4 minutes. A little itching, not much stinging, even directly after a microderm abrasion. No frosting at all, very little redness on face, no peeling. (My neck and chest however, which is super sensitive, turned very red, but disappeared quickly.)  Dark spots are only a little lighter.  I think this is a great peel to start with, to prep skin for something a little more intense.  Overall, great product, makes skin very smooth... I do love using this on my hands! Will be ordering a level 3 or 4 next round.</li>
    <li> For the past year my skin has been extremely dry and not absorbing moisture. I am a 40 yr old Asian American who has had great skin for years, then it suddenly changed. I started to get extremely dry under the eyes and started looking older than I should. I went to an aesthetician that prescribed me skinceutical products. They helped a little bit but a week ago my eyes puffed up and under my eyes were like prunes. They would not absorb any moisturizer. I drink a ton of water and have a humidifier on (live in Michigan). I looked like a scary monster. I planned on getting a peel done at a dermatologist in a couple of weeks but this could not wait. I came across this product that talked about exfoliating and drawing moisture into the cell. I came in a day and I applied it immediately for 1 minute as the direction said to start slow and build up. In one application my eyes became more taunt and hydrated! My husband noticed immediately. I could also tell when I went to put on moisturizer that my skin felt soft. I would HIGHLY recommend this product. There was no down time and it only tingled a little bit. I am so glad I found it. I will update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Hello, I have brought this a few days before it arrived pretty fast..!! the very next day..!! its actually my very first chemical peel i have some scaring on my face due to acne which i have been getting since i was a teen ager (now 24) i have a fair complextion but very uneven n dull as well as dark under eye circles..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this peel accouding to the directions and left it on for 2 min.. then rinsed very well for a long time..!! my face has tingling n burning effect which lasted a few hrs and was left with red spots on my face ..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really dont see any diffrence in my face exept for those ugly red spots on my left cheek n chin i hope thses spots go away soon and i hope this thing disnt burn my face..!!! WILL Continue to edit this if i see any healing</li>
    <li> I decided to forego the $65 treatments (with tip on top of this...uggh) at the spa that I was getting every-other week in order to try the same treatment at home.  I knew that Glyco-Lactic acid peels worked with my skin before buying this, as I&#x27;d seen dramatic improvements in scar removal, tightening, pore size, and tone from the spa.  What I didn&#x27;t know was how easy it was to apply and remove the peel at home.  It was just as easy or easier than applying clay masks.  The money I am saving by buying this product is truly incredible, and another perk is that I have the ability to spot-treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that wasn&#x27;t clear before buying was how much of the bottle is used for a single application.  Suggested amount is 3 ml.  I used even less, so I&#x27;m looking at a good 12 treatments from this single bottle.</li>
    <li> This is actually the first Glycolic peel I have purchased that gave any results. After just 6 days of use I am starting to see a significant difference on my old acne scars, which have almost vanished.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since october 2012 it is now march 2013.  I did take a break after using the product for 3 months straight because I did two 25% tca peels at the beginning of Jan and the middle of feb.  More about that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions by washing my face and then using alcohol to further take off any dirt.  I applied a couple of layers with a bush and let it stay on maybe 2 minutes at the most to start.  I did this every 5 days and quickly moved up to about 3.5 minutes.  I would on occasion notice that area of more damage namely two unusual freckles, probably solar lentigos, and the left side of my neck would react to the peel more.  I also would occasionally get little tiny scabs around my upper lip and and to the side of my mouth where my skin is most sensitive.  After about 2 months i was able to move up to 6-7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally I am fair complected with a few freckles and fine lines.  I have dry skin and hormonal acne with some scaring on the side of my neck with discoloration due to sun damage on top of the scaring.  It is worse on my left side due to driving.  Very quickly I felt my skin was smoother and absorbed moisturizer better.  I noticed my acne was not coming out as frequently which is great.  I doubt 3 months was long enough but the discoloration on the sides of my neck, where there was scaring and the skin seemed rougher wasn&#x27;t really changing much.  This may be the most difficult part of my skin, so I did the tca 25% peel.  I feel the glycolac was an excellent primer for this.  I also use  REVIVA, 10% Glycolic Acid Night Cream, and Atopalm intensive moisturizing cream.  I am about to be 44 and am noticing a bit of looseness to my skin near the jaw line from certain angles.  I am hoping that this product and the TCA will help firm that over the ensuing months.  It is my understanding stimulating new collagen from the breakdown takes longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TCA peel did more to remove the scaring onthe side of my neck with the hyperpigmentation.  After two TCA peels it seems to be about 50% better.  I plan on doing 2-4 more hopefully over the next year.  However I do notice that the glycolac seems easier on my skin now that it is healthier with fewer areas of sun damage.  But I believe it is still useful in my skin regimen weekly for now.  This has been a great product for me.  I wish I had it 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I used to have acne, and had to discontinue use while on Accutane, but have since resumed using on a weekly basis.  I&#x27;m 36, and my skin looks better now than when I was in my 20&#x27;s. This does not dry you out, but will make your skin sensitive for a day or two after.  Just be sure to ease into it.  Start out w. 1 minute then advance up in time - over time.  Instructions are included, if you follow them, you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use an applicator to apply, I just pour a little out on my two fingers and apply in sections (its about the consistency of baby oil).  I found that applying w/ a cotton ball or other applicator was just a waste of product.  More stayed in the applicator than got on your skin, then just went into the trash can.  I think one $20 bottle lasts me a year!</li>
    <li> I have  used lots of products but Skin Laboratory produces the best for the price. Some can be harsh although they look the same. Skin Laboratory products are not hard on the skin and work much better.  I use the regular Glyco peel but found the Glyco-Lac is wonderful and keeps my skin feeling new. I highly recommend these products to keep your skin free of environmental pollutants and keep it rejuvenating.</li>
    <li> I used the Glycolic 35%, I love this product, the results were amazing. When I finished the bottle of Glycolic 35%, I wanted to go up a level, I ordered the Glyco-lac/60. I found the Glycolic 35% to have much better results. I am now going to try a higher Glycolic only peel. If I don&#x27;t like the results, I will stick with the 35%</li>
    <li> As with any of the gel peels I have used from Skin Laboratories I love this one as well. I get a glycolic acid and lactic acid in one treatment. I find using this along with the Salicylic peel once a week helps keep my face clear of adult acne. It also makes my skin feel and look fairly smooth and soft. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without these peels.</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff..makes my skin soft.. Very gentle exfoliating!</li>
    <li> Arrived in excellent condition. Full easy to understand directions included. Product works as detailed when applied per directions.</li>
    <li> Shipping was incredibly fast and it comes with detailed instructions, precautions, etc., everything you need to know to get the most out of this product.  I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 3 weeks now and have noticed an improvement in the appearance and elasticity of my skin.  Directly after completing a peel (and I leave it on for no longer than 5 minutes, and apply it with a clean brush) my skin is very smooth and soft.  I then apply a disposable mask, a box of which I keep in the refrigerator, that cools my skin and quickly reduces any redness.  I find that the combination of glycolic acid and lactic acid to be especially good because I&#x27;m not left with tight, dry, ichy skin afterwards.  I have yet to experience a \\&quot;peel\\&quot; per se in the days following my application of the gel peel but nevertheless I have seen a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles around my eyes, my pores have become tighter as has my skin in general.  I am completely satisfied with this product and appreciate that the quantity is enough for extended use over a few months.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this product. I used to use Coates Aloe Glycolic acid but I can no longer get it. So I bought this stuff after reading many positive reviews. Weirdly I now have red dots all over my right cheek, I think burn marks and started getting acne, which I&#x27;ve never had.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping over time red marks will go away. I think I must have had some kind of reaction--which  I hope is not permanent</li>
    <li> I have used Avon&#x27;s Anew Clinical Retexturizing Pads, Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System and Peter Thomas Roth Un-Wrinkle Peel Pads in the past and wasn&#x27;t sure what strength to choose in the Skin Laboratory line.  I am glad I chose this one.  The combnation of glycolic (small molecule, deep penetration) and lactic (larger molecule, more surface work) acids make this very effective without being harsh, stripping or burning my skin.  I experience some tingling after I&#x27;ve brushed it on but have experienced no actual &amp;#34;peeling&amp;#34; of skin. It leaves my skin softer and glowing and I have noticed some lightening of dark spots. I am not sure if I will buy this product again or move up to the line&#x27;s Level 3 products.</li>
    <li> This stuff worked the first couple times I used it but I made the mistake of leaving it on 7 minutes (it says up to 8) and it burnt my face really badly. It is excellent for spot treatment but it is extremely harsh for my sensitive combination skin and I would definitely recommend starting off with a less abrasive peel.</li>
    <li> Having tried TCA in the past and been burned pretty bad, I decided to try several steps lower. This product is overall way better for someone newer to chemical peels. I am bi-racial with medium brown, moderately oily skin. I have some minor scarring from acne that ended around 7 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with some users on some complaint. For my first use, I ensure the areas it would be applied to had not been tweezed/shaved/exfoliated 3 days prior (I believe the instructions recommends 24 hr). My skin got red in some areas of my skin that had negligible irritation until the acid was applied. My first application and some of my subsequent applications caused me to have minor break outs, made up of 4-5 small, rash-like pimples. The worst I have had is 2-3 areas of localized outbreak. It is almost always on my lower cheek/jawline and/or chin. It is really unpredictable whether I will see an outbreak or not, as I&#x27;ve done it with no outbreak several time. This is an acid... I would not put it on my face right before picture day\\&quot;. I also find that when I have accidently scratched an area that was in the pre-peeling stage, it would be slightly hyperpigmented compared to the rest of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores are far more refined, and the acne scars cannot be seen unless looking closely and carefully if I&#x27;m wearing a concealer. Other than the discoloration from scratching, which I was able to get rid of in 4 peels, this is a fairly good product. Wear sunscreen, try not to scratch or pick, especially if you have the small rash breakout.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it. I think it&#x27;s doing good things for my skin. I don&#x27;t really have problem skin so there wasn&#x27;t anything to clear up. My skin gets dull so I was hoping this would help and it doesn&#x27;t. Doesn&#x27;t burn much at all. My face gets a little itchy. I don&#x27;t leave it on for too long. I don&#x27;t see any startling differences after I use it but that might just be my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a product like this. I really enjoy the fact that after the fact, my skin looks youthful and plump. I work in the cosmetics industry, though, and I have to wear makeup every day, so I only allow myself to use this when I can afford to let my face breathe free for a consecutive 24 hour period. That being said, even with doing the peel about twice a month, I do really enjoy the effects. My face just seems smoother and softer. I haven&#x27;t noticed any pore reduction or scar lifting, but I assume that it&#x27;d take a more heavy-duty product to do that, since I have old acne scars and huge pores on my nose. Aside from that, great starter Glycolic, I&#x27;ve recommended this to many people. Would give five stars if I saw a bit more result. Also, this small bottle seems like it would last about six months, if used weekly. Really not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to help with my melasma, I use it with a hydroquinone product from my dermatologist.  The peel is amazing at cleaning the pores out-- blackheads are virtually non-existent with this product.  It does make the sensitive areas a little red and irritated.  Follow the directions and the time allowed to leave on your face-- trust me.  :)  Overall great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is kind of weird but this peel wasn&#x27;t as intense as I expected it to be. I originally started out with Skin Laboratory&#x27;s Salicylic Acid 20% peel and that burned my face the first time and then settled down and peeled a lot. Over the span of about 3 months, I did the Salicylic Acid peel about 6 times, each time increasing the amount of time for the product to stay on my skin. Now I upgraded to this Level 2 Glyco/Lac peel and it doesn&#x27;t give me an intense burning sensation at all.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe my skin has become more resistant after the salicylic acid peel. I thought this glyco/lac peel was going to be more intense being that it is at a higher level than salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this glyco/lac peel will show results. I just applied it for the first time. I will update this review in about 2 months after I am done with the whole process and then upgrade to a level 3 peel. It&#x27;s amazing how I moving through the levels like this, I used to have extremely sensitive irritated skin. These peels have definitely helped slow the growth of my acne and faded much of my scarring. But don&#x27;t think the scarring will go away over night b/c it won&#x27;t. These peels should be done on a schedule, I do it every 10 days. You should always follow the exact instructions with these peels, don&#x27;t stretch the rules at all. I did the first time with salicylic by reapplying a peel 3 days after the first application and I had horrible scarring from the peel for months. It finally went away after about 6 months of using every scar cream and natural solution in the book! It was a horrible time for me, I didn&#x27;t even want to look in the mirror. So make sure you follow the directions, if you do then it will work fine for you but if you don&#x27;t you can cause serious damage to your face, REMEMBER THESE ARE ACIDS YOU ARE PUTTING ON YOUR SKIN. BE CAREFUL.</li>
    <li> I graduated from a low % Lactic acid peel to this, thinking if my skin could handle the Lactic just fine, this might be the ticket to that youthful glow... Nah. Having used this off &amp; on for 6 months, I&#x27;m sorry to say that it&#x27;s done NOTHING for my skin. I went from 2 min to 6 min (I&#x27;m simply unwilling to go longer for safety reasons), no burn, no sting, no nada.  I&#x27;m glad some folk have experienced great results, and with my uber sensitive skin I thought I would as well, but guess this isn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;m going to go back to a higher concentration Lactic peel since I liked that one better. Remember - each person is different - so what works for one person won&#x27;t always work for another, and this is clearly one of those things. Oh well!</li>
    <li> This peel has a slight sting, not as much as when you get a peel at the med spa.  I&#x27;ve had Jessner peels done before and this peel packed about a 3rd of the sting and zero peeeling.  I got it with the intention of exfoliating a fairly new dark acne scar on my neck along with HQ 4% cream.  I have medium olive toned skin.  It didn&#x27;t make it any better or worse but I have only used it 3 times so far.  It hasn&#x27;t made any overall improvements in the rest of my skin either.  Going to try a stronger peel and/or back to the med spa!</li>
    <li> Ordered again from this maker. Great product with visible results (it really improves the skin texture). Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this peel once a week for 4 weeks now.  I don&#x27;t see any big differences but I didn&#x27;t expect to as this isn&#x27;t supposed to be a peel that makes you flake off.  I use an alpha hydroxy acid 10% daily as a lotion so my skin is somewhat used to some acid.  This peel starts to tingle after a few seconds but nothing bad if you&#x27;re used to it.  The first time I did the peel, I had a timer and left it on for one minute then rinsed.  My skin never got red but I could tell that it had been working.  The next times I left it on a little longer.  I only had one spot flake and peel but I think I just got too close so my sensitive under eye area.  I&#x27;m careful about that are now.  I can tell that it has been working on my dark spots.  I went in to this knowing that I wouldn&#x27;t see miracle results over night.  My skin feels nice and soft and using this and a compound cream that my dermatologist prescribed for me for the dark spots has definitely lightened them up.  They are still there, and I worry that with warm weather coming and my spending more time outdoors they will get darker but I&#x27;m happy to know that this product along with the cream can do some good to help and affordably at that.  I would love to do laser treatment for the spots but that&#x27;s just not in my budget so I will stick with this.</li>
    <li> I purchased Glycolic Acid (30%?) from another seller, about a year ago, used it infrequently and ran out. I wanted to try something new.  I am 51, have a photo shoot next week and want to reduce some lines, exfoliate and plump up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like this Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel very much!  First off it&#x27;s gel, so its easier to use without running or waste. I didn&#x27;t find it too intense for my skin and I&#x27;m very pale.  I applied it on my face, neck and back of my hands (with prepping my skin with alcohol or witch hazel) for about 4-5 minutes, started feeling tingling, and removed it with a solution of water and baking soda on a paper towel.  That sizzled pretty intensely, but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;It works great at plumping, my skin is healthier/younger looking after 1 application.  I did it again the next day, same amt of time or maybe a minute or two less. No problem. However, I won&#x27;t use it again for another 4 or 5 days. I feel that would be pushing it as my skin feels a little sensitive. Moisturizing is very important, it feels as though I have a slight sunburn, but not much in the way of redness, no peeling.  Just plumper, slightly sun kissed, and more tightness, less visible wrinkles.  I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the 1st peel I&#x27;ve ever done, professionally or at home.  I was pleased with the results.  It did take a good 3 treatments before I saw any results.  And I am all about instant gratification so that was a bummer.  BUT.. I&#x27;d rather be safe than screw my face up.  It does stink horribly bad, but as I&#x27;ve always heard and said &amp;#34;being beautiful isn&#x27;t without some pain and suffering&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Delivery was right on time. Dark bottle as described. I have spot treated and have already seen results on my acne spot scarring. I&#x27;m a sensitive skin and the 35% lactic and 25% glycolic def is a fit for my skin. The skin labatory, I think I&#x27;ll be ordering more after my skin adjust to the level of peel. Also, when ordering off line especially acid peel; I was a lil apprehensive but now after I&#x27;ve seen the results just in a day with one swipe of the mixture ill be placing another order to the higher grade. This mixture of lactic and glycolic is a safe way to start peels.</li>
    <li> It will remove dead skin very well but water doesn&#x27;t neutralize acid (as the directions seems to say).  You MUST use a skin neutralizer (a base--go back to basic chemistry).  Buy something like \\&quot;Acid Neutralizer Skin pH Balance\\&quot; on amazon WITH this product.</li>
    <li> Was suppose to be 60 % lactic acid only. 35% doesn&#x27;t really do anything</li>
    <li> Actually, a great product when considering the price. My skin is looking much better overall after only 2 uses. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am a 28 year old male and I also use Retin-A in combination with this product.  I love this product, it is relatively mild and does a great job at refreshing my skin, keeping it looking youthful, helping to clear acne and reduce my pores.  It has even helped to fade a few freckles I had.  It is also great for sensitive skin, very non-irritating, I would just recommend that after you do the test for a reaction on your arm, you start with an application of 1-2 minutes, wait a week, then do 2-3 wait a week, do 3-4 and so on until you get to the 8 minute maximum exposure.  It is VERY important you do not apply for longer than 8 minutes, that you gradually increase exposure time and wait at least 5 days between applications, though I would recommend 7 or however long your skin takes to return to normal.  You will not do your skin any good by burning it or damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple final recommendation, the peel can be modulated based on how strong a toner you use before hand, alcohol strips all the oil off your skin and results in a deeper peel for example, this may be something you want to do after reaching the 8 minute maximum exposure.  You also want to ensure that you use a mild moisturizer, something like cetaphil, or ponds sensitive skin moisturizer after application.  You also should avoid Retin-A/Retinol products for 24 hours before and after the peel, longer if your skin is more sensitive.  You also must use a sunscreen while your skin is recovering, though you should always, or you will defeat the purpose of the peel.  A vaseline mask the night of the peel can be a great way to help your skin recover.  You should not wear make up for 24 hours after a peel though if you must, apply it as light as possible, your skin needs to breath.  Basically while your skin is recovering avoid all irritating substances, vitamin C oil, exfoliants, the sun, make up, Retin-A, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are just my opinions and experiences with the product and you should always follow the directions provided exactly and consult with the company and/or a dermatologist if you have any questions or concerns about using the product safely.  I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this company&#x27;s level one product and was very impressed with the results; its Level Two product is even better.  However, use caution when first applying the solution.  Start with the least amount of time recommended, then build your way up to the maximum time recommended. My skin is very sensitive and I have no problem using the glyco-lac/60 at all.</li>
    <li> Not that effective at least in my case. This peel has the consistency of water. I&#x27;ve used several times and no change.</li>
    <li> This works although it doesn&#x27;t make my skin peel, I may use too much moisturizer ahead of time. I never used lactose but have used glyco peel. You can feel it working!!!</li>
    <li> This is my third bottle.. wish I were more dedicated and I could commit to using this once a week… the times that I did commit to that regimen, I noticed a huge difference on my skin… tighter, brighter, more even skin tone... this peel is simply amazing!!</li>
    <li> This works as it says.  I have had acid peels in the past at a dermatologist office, and this gave the same results.</li>
    <li> I got this product bcoz I have acne since I was teen n til now I&#x27;m 29 now,I had lots of acne marks red and brown spots ,I have been using this product once in week I started from 1 min n I did til 5 mins ,every week I saw changes happening ,my acne reduced, not completely gone ,n my marks have also faded 70% product is not harsh it doesn&#x27;t peel any skin,I use sunscreen spf50+ after the peel everyday.so far I like it hope it clears my skin totally.I gave four stars bcoz its not made my acne vanish completely .overall good and safe peel to use at home every week.</li>
    <li> Not very strong but its ok</li>
    <li> I founded that this product did not peel my skin as I expected and the dark spots is steel the same.</li>
    <li> This is truly a professional strength peel.  Be careful using this at home...it is very effective, perhaps too strong and effective!</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and it does work; stinged a little; the breakouts went away and also pores were reduced.</li>
    <li> Awesome peel. Gentle yet effective option. It didn&#x27;t burn my skin and it did bring out the black and white heads to the surface. It is not harsh on my skin and after using it my skin felt so soft. It is part of my bi-weekly routine.</li>
    <li> Even toned face. It fades age spots and evens the skin. Tingles a little. I leave it on for about 8 minutes but I have done this many times before.</li>
    <li> I guess I don&#x27;t know what I expected with this product. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for 2 months now and at first it works great by shedding the dead cells and giving me a refreshed look. The last 2 times I&#x27;ve used it it has burned a little more, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in skin appearance. Maybe it has done its job as far as it can go for me, and my results have plateaued.  I will still use it because it is a great addition to my skin care routine. And I hope to see more results over time on some darker scar spots and skin pigmentation. My tone has evened out more since using it. I think it might need more time to really do its job as perfection doesn&#x27;t happen over night. I think it is a good price, and a good product. But not 5 star worthy *yet* as I seem to have hit a plateau phase after only a few uses.</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old with what I would consider to be average to above average skin, sometimes a little dry in places but with very few blemishes, no visible wrinkles- I&#x27;m often mistaken for being 10 years younger. I am allergic to almost all sunscreens, but have (thankfully) recently found sunscreen that contains titanium oxide doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Unfortunately I have some freckling and sun damage from childhood summers spent in the sun (without sunscreen) and have been looking for an economical way to get rid of that damage.  After reading reviews on this product I decided to buy a bottle of Glyco-Lac 60 and give it a try. I have previously used glycolic skin pads so skipped right to the level 2.  On my first application of the gel I was able to leave it on for about 90 seconds, after reading reviews I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on too long.  I followed the instructions not to peel or pick or do anything to my face for 4 days... nothing. My skin still looked the same normal dull that it looks when it really needs to be exfoliated. Finally on the fourth day I decided to exfoliate with some baking soda since it is gentle and the least abrasive thing I could use.  I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference afterward other than my face being normal looking after an exfoliation, no amazing stunning results to be found.  10 days after my initial peel I decided to give it another try- I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles and realize that things don&#x27;t always happen overnight.  Second application I applied and left on for 3 minutes, and again waited with the same results as before. No visible skin improvement at all, which is a little bit disappointing.  On the 5th day I decided to use a new product that a friend told me about which is [[ASIN:B0029XKY70 BeautiControl BC Spa Resurface Multi-Acid Resurfacing Peel]]  I used the Beauticontrol peel pad to wipe my face in a circular pattern, which I could \\&quot;feel\\&quot; scrubbing (more so than just a normal face pad). I left the product on my skin for 20 minutes which is the maximum recommended time and when I rinsed my face I could immediately tell that my face was softer and smoother. I was absolutely amazed.  Is it possible that the previous 2 weeks of glycolic acid peel had \\&quot;prepared\\&quot; my face for the other peel? Maybe, and I will definitely continue to use the glyco-lac peel gel that I bought until it is gone but the Beauticontrol will be my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; for peeling and refreshing and fingers crossed, reducing discoloration.or 20 minutes which is the maximum recommended time and when I rinsed my face I could immediately tell that my face was softer and smoother.

    <li> I have been using this peel for a few months now and can notice a difference with the quality of my skin. I would reommend this product to any woman...as it was recommended to me.</li>
    <li> I think this is good product. I have noticed a decrease in fine lines. I wish it would work better on my sun/age spots. But I have not been as consistent as before. This is my second purchase of this peel. It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third bottle over the years. I think it really does make a difference in my skin, fine lines, brown spots, etc. As others have already mentioned it is very important to wear sunscreen daily outside. I spend this past summer once again, not using sunscreen and the brown spots are back on the side of my face and I have not been consistently treating with this product. Also this product makes your skin more tender, like baby skin so screen is very necessary. I am starting once again with the peels but the peels. It really is a nice product if used properly.</li>
    <li> I bought this after I used the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml peel.  The Salicylic nor this product have gotten rid of my black heads yet (I&#x27;ve been using for months) but they do give my skin an overall smooth feel and reduce the amount of pimples I get.  I do still get some but not like I used to.  I hope in time this product will eventually get rid of my black heads.</li>
    <li> I would not advise the product for the non professional.  It does what it says.  It is very strong.  And you can easily burn your skin if you are not very very careful.  I you are brave enough to try it heed the time warnings.  I would say don&#x27;t leave it on as long as recommended.  This stuff is strong.</li>
