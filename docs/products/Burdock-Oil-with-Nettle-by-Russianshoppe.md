<li> Very rich, thick smoothe oil.</li>
<li> made my hair pretty dry.</li>
<li> did absolutely nothing for my hair fall and on top of it has an absolutely disgusting smell so much so that I am ashamed to go out in public with this stuff on.</li>
<li> It is not super fast like active chemical products.</li>
<li> It came earlier than expected and also has instructions on the front in english</li>
<li> Now that I know how to make this, we have this weeds where I live, I&#x27;ll just make some myself with a different oil base and more nettles and arctium lappa solution added.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very old Russian hair treatment we wouldn&#x27;t be doing it for so many years if it was worthless .</li>
<li> Does not leave a dry settleness.</li>
<li> I use it mixed 50/50 with Jamaican black castor oil.</li>
<li> In fact I apply a little everyday to my natural hair</li>
<li> so I really do not have any other to compare it to.  </li>
<li> I saw the result to my hair after 2 months of continuous application of the oil every other night.</li>
<li> I gave this a 3 b/c it arrived in a foreign language.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll wait a little longer before I mix it with another oil to completey</li>
<li> Use it everyday</li>
<li> My hair was dry, thin and falling out and this changed all of that.  </li>
<li> (use plastic cap if desired).After about 15 or 20 minutes.rinse hair well.and proceed as usual.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know why people need to spend hundreds of dollars on some ridiculous products and doctors.</li>
<li> Not sure if it was a bad product they send or it just smells like that - I will stick to my rosemary oil macademia hair oil spray for now</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the oil I was sent had an expiration date that was expired.</li>
<li> Unfortunately my hair does not seem to like it.</li>
<li> my hair was very thin and didn&#x27;t want to grow.</li>
<li> About exparation date disappointment - looks like this bottle was made in Russia.</li>
<li> No itchiness or bad smells either.</li>
<li> but the smell was so bad that I could not stand it.</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t be in hurry to say it&#x27;s bad after couple times of trying.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine putting something that smells so bad in my hair.  </li>
<li> Ugh, it&#x27;s oil base is olive oil but used sparingly while the hair is damp</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not heavy, light scent.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. I ordered another bottle so I won&#x27;t run out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil in my hair and my hair is growing</li>
    <li> for the price. Burdock oil is supposed to help with skin conditions, and to help heal the scalp, and encourage hair growth. I use this oil as a scalp oil to keep away any flakes. But, only once in a while. The one thing about this product is all the lettering is in Cyrillic (and in Russian)... there&#x27;s English directions with it. Unfortunately, the oil I was sent had an expiration date that was expired. So, buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Nature does work. In a gentle way, gradually restoring your hair. I agree with Elena. It is not super fast like active chemical products. Chemicals can make a miracle to your hair immediately, but it also adds additional toxins to your body. I saw the result to my hair after 2 months of continuous application of the oil every other night. But the result was amazing. ...Beauty can go together with health, but it takes time and patience.</li>
    <li> did absolutely nothing for my hair fall and on top of it has an absolutely disgusting smell so much so that I am ashamed to go out in public with this stuff on.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 3 b/c it arrived in a foreign language. I think it&#x27;s Russian or something. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should use it or not since I could not read the info noted.</li>
    <li> Ugh, it&#x27;s oil base is olive oil but used sparingly while the hair is damp it&#x27;s OK. Now that I know how to make this, we have this weeds where I live, I&#x27;ll just make some myself with a different oil base and more nettles and arctium lappa solution added. Look up how to make witch hazel if such interests you.</li>
    <li> Very good for Afro/Indian Americans hair. Does not leave a dry settleness.</li>
    <li> I ordered this oil with high hopes. Unfortunately my hair does not seem to like it. Instead of moisturizing my scalp, after using the oil my scalp felt itchy. Thus, I am not a fan.</li>
    <li> Awesome for hair and scalp massage! actually my hair is growing faster :)!  and direct from Russia!</li>
    <li> I already see hair growth in my temple area, where I lost hair from my recent pregnancy... I will keep this on hand! I love hoe it makes my hair feel stronger!</li>
    <li> Smells good, leaves my hair shinny and soft! Love it! It is a really good product and the price is good as well.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes yet but it got a good sheen. I&#x27;ll wait a little longer before I mix it with another oil to completey see it&#x27;s effects.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Russian and I want to correct the  last review. About exparation date disappointment - looks like this bottle was made in Russia. In Russia we used to put not an exparation date but date when the product was made. I know it&#x27;s pretty unusual but it&#x27;s true. But even if it&#x27;s expired- it&#x27;s the extract of burdock root in oil. If it wasn&#x27;t kept in full sun and has a smell of rotten oil- it&#x27;s ok to use. Just don&#x27;t drink it, it&#x27;s for your hair. When I was just a toddler my hair was very thin and didn&#x27;t want to grow. My mother used to massage bur oil into my hair roots 1 hour before bath time. Then she would put plastic and wrap a towel around my head to keep it warm. She did it lots and lots of times before it worked but it did. It&#x27;s very old Russian hair treatment we wouldn&#x27;t be doing it for so many years if it was worthless . Now it&#x27;s my turn and I put bur oil on my daughters hair. So don&#x27;t be in hurry to say it&#x27;s bad after couple times of trying. Just do it right and do it for a long time.</li>
    <li> Had high hopes for this oil and it severely damaged my hair after one use. Left my hair super oil and burnt my ends. Had to cut my hair and was still left oily and smelled like the oil after washing.  I expected more.</li>
    <li> Bottle is in russian, great amount for price. Use it everyday</li>
    <li> I had to return this. I don&#x27;t know if it does anything for your hair or not but the smell was so bad that I could not stand it. It smelled like rotten vegetable. I can&#x27;t imagine putting something that smells so bad in my hair.  Not sure if it was a bad product they send or it just smells like that - I will stick to my rosemary oil macademia hair oil spray for now</li>
    <li> This oil works wonders for my hair. Leaves my hair soft and shiny. It came earlier than expected and also has instructions on the front in english and it’s a good sized bottle. No itchiness or bad smells either. In fact I apply a little everyday to my natural hair and I’m already seeing improvements, even though it says to apply it and leave it for 1 hour and then wash it out. I love this and will definitely purchase some more!!</li>
    <li> Great oil for hair and lashes.</li>
    <li> made my hair pretty dry. i have 4c hair. it smelled awesome though</li>
    <li> Great price hope to write a further review after I have used the product for a while</li>
    <li> This oil was working very well on my her. If you want to see good result you have to use it often. Burdock and nettle are miraculous for her.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good for dandruff .mix one table spoon  burdock oil with one table spoon apple cider vinegar.masage into scalp. (use plastic cap if desired).After about 15 or 20 minutes.rinse hair well.and proceed as usual.For my itchy scalp, I always leave the  mixture on longer.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet if it will make it grow any faster, but it is a nice oil that makes my scalp feel good.  Putting it on my scalp everynight makes my 3C hair feel nice.  I use it mixed 50/50 with Jamaican black castor oil.</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin, and many other reasons. It&#x27;s a great product I have reordered it.</li>
    <li> Just as advertised... it does what it says it&#x27;ll do... Shipping was appropriate, packaging was good... i have No complaints</li>
    <li> This product does work.  I have a severe widow&#x27;;s peak which I have had since my early years.  Hair is actually starting to grow in the bald areas.</li>
    <li> This helped my hair feel so much better - I have tried everything and nothing has worked like this.  My hair was dry, thin and falling out and this changed all of that.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> Being originally from Russia, I know this product very well and there is nothing better than this oil if you want to save your hair from hair loss. I make applications of the oil for two or more hours and then wash through and my hair looks absolutely gorgeous. It shines and gets volume and  is very very soft and silky. I love this product! Don&#x27;t know why people need to spend hundreds of dollars on some ridiculous products and doctors. Just try what mother nature has prepared for you.</li>
    <li> Very rich, thick smoothe oil. Love the quality &amp; the earthy smell. Looking forward to positive results with this. Shipping was fast and item was very well packaged.</li>
    <li> Next day my hair looks beautiful. I like it!</li>
    <li> I have never purchased burdock oil with nettle before so I really do not have any other to compare it to.  It seems to be a light oil. From doing my research this is wonderful for your hair; which is the one reason why I ordered it in the first place.</li>
