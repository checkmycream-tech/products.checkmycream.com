      <li>Thank you for making this product available~.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
      <li>and i am jelous of that lucky person who&#x27;s acne cleared after using this.</li>
      <li>maybe you will be one of the lucky ones.</li>
      <li>I am sure it helps keep my skin looking young and nourished</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
      <li>It has buffing beads that are just the right size.</li>
      <li>like yeah right maybe on my a</li>
      <li>I have not yet come across a miracle product, but with realistic expectations, this one is a decent addtion to my shelf of skin care things. :)</li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, and fair skin shows redness worse than any other skin tone.</li>
      <li>oh and also, i seem to have ran out quickly, perhaps i used to much and as for the marks on the face i have not noticed anything that would make me want to break dance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;That being said, yes, it does smell funny.</li>
      <li>It does exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>Will definitely get some more.</li>
      <li>However, I use it more as a moisturizer before putting on my sun screen and it adds enough moisture to avoid dryness from sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Skin Brightener is a more recent offering.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The spots have not completely disappeared yet, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m on that</li>
      <li>Remarkably strong smell like a cheap soap such as Irish Spring.</li>
      <li>i used up the whole bottle and could not tell if anything happened..</li>
      <li>I really like the consistency of this product.</li>
      <li>This product evens out skin tone, I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I am not sure the product is really brigning my skin, BUT my oily skin can get pimples and with this product my skin feels just right super soft, moist but very light.</li>
      <li>Started to use skin care the use item right away, too early to see any results, but I like it.</li>
      <li>ill ask for beautiful skin</li>
      <li>I am starting to see improvement in my skin,and the price is not bad.</li>
      <li>It goes on very smooth, and I notice an instant brighten up of my facial skin.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;(You have to use this(and almost any other product) consistently for a couple/few weeks before you will see significant results.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use a food facial sunblock daily as retinol will make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
      <li>you have normal skin like me, but have some spots you&#x27;d like to take care of</li>
      <li>In all honesty, I love pale skin, it&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of</li>
      <li>I love it, noticed my skin clear and firm in just one week.</li>
      <li>Brightens, lessens dark spots fantasticly, clears breakouts.</li>
      <li>i rarely even put moisturizer on even though my skin is dry.</li>
      <li>This product works but the amount in the bottle is just not economical, in that it will not last for over two weeks, so you will have to order more than one bottle.  </li>
      <li>was not expecting this product to work overnight, or completely change the darkness</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 60 year young wonen.</li>
      <li>I like it so far .</li>
      <li>I look very forward to seeing a long term reduction in skin pigment issues and depletion of wrinkles.  </li>
      <li>That mixed with the smell of an old, musty attic.</li>
      <li>It gets rid of black spots fast.</li>
      <li>I was a little skeptical at first but after 4 days of using this product i fell in love.  </li>

<li> In addition, why put such a small amount in such a large bottle?</li>
<li> I am only on day 2 of using this product and I can only imagine the benefits I will have after long term use.  </li>
<li> It helps with red spots, brown spots, acne scars, uneven tone, and leaves your skin soft as well.</li>
<li> Its very different than any other facial product I got.  </li>
<li> I have only had this product for a few weeks but from what I&#x27;m noticing...</li>
<li> It provides a really nice base to apply make-up.</li>
<li> I use it under any other makeup.</li>
<li> My only problem with it is that I wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so small.</li>
<li> I have used this item and the other during the am and pm for over 3 months.  </li>
<li> advertised, it took about four weeks of regular use to notice a difference in spots left behind by ingrown hairs after waxing.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have such a hard time covering up.</li>
<li> I paid $12.09 cents and i have to say a very little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I just had IPL treatment at dermatologist to get rid of my dark spots</li>
<li> and i have already noticed my sunspots lighten and my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
<li> Let&#x27;s see if it takes care of my dark spots after a while...</li>
<li> I currently have some sun damaged skin from living in Hawaii and was hoping that I could find a product to at least lighten the darkness around my shoulders.&lt;br</li>
<li> and i figured if i used this product it would keep the dark spots away</li>
<li> This product works, though I was using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot</li>
<li> I am guilty of getting sun on my face, and this really helps correct the damage that I know I am doing.  </li>
<li> i look the same and it sucks.</li>

    <li> Good moisturizer at best.</li>
    <li> It works okay, and doesn&#x27;t irritate. My only problem with it is that I wish the bottle wasn&#x27;t so small. It only lasts about 2 weeks. :c</li>
    <li> It brightened my skin, stay away from the sun while using it.</li>
    <li> I do not see any change, it all looks the same to me. this is a lot of money for nothing.</li>
    <li> I cannot vouch at all for the effectiveness of this product, because I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. Remarkably strong smell like a cheap soap such as Irish Spring. That mixed with the smell of an old, musty attic. Didn&#x27;t use, and will return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this company&#x27;s retinol cosmetics for several years.  They do help some with wrinkling complexions.  Skin Brightener is a more recent offering.  I use it when I&#x27;m going out and put on more make-up than when I stay home.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first but after 4 days of using this product i fell in love.  It is gentle on my skin and smells good and i have already noticed my sunspots lighten and my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Well i got this about a month ago along with the day and night cream and i can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything. i got it so that my face wouldn&#x27;t be so dull and get some radiance in my skin. i do not know if this is a coincidence but people seem to be pointing out my pale-ness even more. they keep saying i have no skin tone. i mean wtf like go shut up. anyways i have notice the texture to be a bit better, silky like. i do not know if this is because of the retinol day and night cream especially considering i rarely even put moisturizer on even though my skin is dry. maybe i got paler because of the day cream it is basically sun screen and pale people need sun for skin tone. oh and also, i seem to have ran out quickly, perhaps i used to much and as for the marks on the face i have not noticed anything that would make me want to break dance. i look the same and it sucks. i have acne and acne scars and pale skin that exaggerates them so as for diminishing my marks it fails. and i am jelous of that lucky person who&#x27;s acne cleared after using this. I&#x27;m just not feeling the love. i do not know if i would recommend this. different people, different skin. if you get it i hope u fall in love with it and not have it break your heart. i guess it is off to see the wizard for me. ill ask for beautiful skin oh wait he is just gonna tell me i had it all along. like yeah right maybe on my a**. xp good luck maybe you will be one of the lucky ones.</li>
    <li> A very good product, in three days I saw de effect in my skin</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It cleared up my acne and lightened my scars literally overnight!  I am only on day 2 of using this product and I can only imagine the benefits I will have after long term use.  I am wanting to order more to fade scars all over my body.  Keep up the good work LdeL!</li>
    <li> Very smooth and not greasy . I like it so far . I have been using this one for over month .  I can notice some improvement on the expressions wrinkles in my forehead and around my lips.</li>
    <li> This product works but the amount in the bottle is just not economical, in that it will not last for over two weeks, so you will have to order more than one bottle.  In addition, why put such a small amount in such a large bottle? Please read the amount stated before purchasing otherwise you will be contacting the seller like I did, I initially swore they sent me a sample but it was not so.</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  I use it both at night time, and under make-up.  It goes on very smooth, and I notice an instant brighten up of my facial skin.  I look very forward to seeing a long term reduction in skin pigment issues and depletion of wrinkles.  I have faith!  I am guilty of getting sun on my face, and this really helps correct the damage that I know I am doing.  I use a sun screen.  I have found that a little bit of sun hides a multitude of flaws.  Thank you for making this product available~.</li>
    <li> This product evens out skin tone, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Started to use skin care the use item right away, too early to see any results, but I like it.</li>
    <li> This product works, though I was using it in conjunction with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Youth Code Dark Spot Correcting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, it took about four weeks of regular use to notice a difference in spots left behind by ingrown hairs after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spots have not completely disappeared yet, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m on that path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive though, especially considering one bottle will not get you to your desired end-state.</li>
    <li> ssI liked another Retinol product, so assumed that Skin Brightener  would be just as effective. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the consistency of this product. I don&#x27;t know if has brighten my skin alone because I also use a vitamin C serum that has an effect on my skin. However, I use it more as a moisturizer before putting on my sun screen and it adds enough moisture to avoid dryness from sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I paid $12.09 cents and i have to say a very little bit goes a long way.  I am not sure the product is really brigning my skin, BUT my oily skin can get pimples and with this product my skin feels just right super soft, moist but very light. I cant quiet explain it. I say try this product please. Its very different than any other facial product I got.  It almost compares to the Ponds that i can get OUTSIDE of the US vs the Ponds that are sold in the US (They are different btw).</li>
    <li> It did work in my skin</li>
    <li> good moisturerizer but i don&#x27;t know about brightening i used up the whole bottle and could not tell if anything happened.. maybe it will work better on someone else</li>
    <li> I have tried this product before it&#x27;s great. It gets rid of black spots fast. I even wear it under my make up</li>
    <li> Use it together with my day and night cream. Good quality cream. Feels good and now in my 50&#x27;s I am sure it helps keep my skin looking young and nourished</li>
    <li> I love it, noticed my skin clear and firm in just one week. I recommend it and will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I used this a couple of months ago and I just love it. I am starting to see improvement in my skin,and the price is not bad. Will definitely get some more.</li>
    <li> It makes my skin feel very bright and sunny. I look so much better when I use it on my face.</li>
    <li> For 9 bucks, I am not regretting purchasing this. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for a while and decided to test it out. I have been using it for two days, and while I have not noticed a visual difference, my skin does feel softer after using it. Let&#x27;s see if it takes care of my dark spots after a while...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, yes, it does smell funny. I was hoping for a nice smelling, creamy lotion, but this is runny and smells like something medicinal. It makes my skin feel a little rubbery as its soaking in, but that goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have normal skin like me, but have some spots you&#x27;d like to take care of, I think it&#x27;s worth a shot. But I am still looking for my go-to brightener.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product. I&#x27;m 60 year young wonen. I sure don&#x27;t see as many wrinkles on my face as I do my friends. Ha</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks but from what I&#x27;m noticing...it is working well. I also use the night cream which is even more concentrated and together the results are so good. Initially you may have multiple breakouts as the deeper layers of your skin are purging oil, sebum, dirt..etc. be patient and use a exfoliant face wash or buff w your cleanser as your skin cells are going to start to rapidly turn over so newere layers of skin appear. I use this amazing face wash by Peter Thomas Roth..found it here on Amazon. It has buffing beads that are just the right size. Don&#x27;t forget to use a food facial sunblock daily as retinol will make your skin more sensitive to the sun. So far&lt;br /&gt;..so good</li>
    <li> i have acne prone skin and this cleared up my skin in 5 days! almost unbelievable. to add to that, it also makes my skin look smoother and a little brighter. love it!</li>
    <li> It does exactly as advertised. Brightens, lessens dark spots fantasticly, clears breakouts. My husband could not believe how much better my face looks.</li>
    <li> When the first thing my husband notices when he sees me on Skype while stationed over seas is how good my skin looks the product is working</li>
    <li> It  gave my skin a beautiful glow. I would purchase this item again and again. I also would tell all my friends.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product as well as the anti-wrinkle serum and the day and night cream and have seen no difference. I just had IPL treatment at dermatologist to get rid of my dark spots and i figured if i used this product it would keep the dark spots away but it has not. they are starting to reappear.  I have been using this product for over a month , applying it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, and fair skin shows redness worse than any other skin tone. In all honesty, I love pale skin, it&#x27;s nothing to be ashamed of if you don&#x27;t have that orange/brown/bronze color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product initially faded the redness I have such a hard time covering up. After a couple weeks, my skin is softer, slightly more even, and clearer. It helps with red spots, brown spots, acne scars, uneven tone, and leaves your skin soft as well. I have not yet come across a miracle product, but with realistic expectations, this one is a decent addtion to my shelf of skin care things. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(You have to use this(and almost any other product) consistently for a couple/few weeks before you will see significant results. Your skin gets better through healing. It can&#x27;t heal over night.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as well as the SPF Retinol cream but it has not made any improvements on my skin.  I have used this item and the other during the am and pm for over 3 months.  I currently have some sun damaged skin from living in Hawaii and was hoping that I could find a product to at least lighten the darkness around my shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting this product to work overnight, or completely change the darkness but it has not made a difference at all.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many time before, it&#x27;s a great skin brightener that I use every day under my foundation.  It provides a really nice base to apply make-up.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have been using this for ckose to a year now and I do see a difference in my skin. I use it under any other makeup. Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and goes on smoothly. Love this product</li>
</ol>
