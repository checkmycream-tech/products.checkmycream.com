      <li>It is a beautiful light red to coral, just gorgeous, lots of compliments.</li>
      <li>There should be a better photo and/or more accurate description.</li>
      <li>I have the LED light and did the appropriate curing time.</li>
      <li>takes time to apply and dry but the durability is incredible</li>
      <li>Love the color and quick delivery.</li>
      <li>Cajun shrimp is a beautiful color, easy application, and long wear.</li>
      <li>Great color - it&#x27;s like Cajun Shrimp - and the gel color lasts longer than the regular nail polish ever did!  </li>
      <li>product worked great with the Gelish gel nail products - color is an orange red.  </li>
      <li>Its a great red, orange color and</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see this color in the gel polish.</li>
      <li>love being able to do my own nails with gel,takes a little practice but no chipping nails stay shinny and cool :</li>
      <li>A bright red with a touch of Orange, close to coral colour.</li>
      <li>Love the color and works really well.</li>
      <li>Love this color, have it in the regular nail polish, good summer color, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I find the best way to see how it actually looks is to Google a color&#x27;s name + the word swatch to see pictures of it actually applied on someone&#x27;s nails.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color</li>
      <li>This pops a bit more in the bright pink range, I had thought it was a Soft coral, but I like it fine anyway.  </li>
      <li>; the polish slid right off.</li>
      <li>This product contributed to my nails becoming even weaker and soft.</li>
      <li>The color is more red than what the picture shows (as usual, the pictures aren&#x27;t a great representation).</li>
      <li>first they had sent me the wrong color, they were wonderful to work with and sent me the right one.</li>
      <li>I much prefer the Gelish line of products!</li>
      <li>Much more red than as  appears  in picture.</li>
      <li>no streaks, even coverage and very glossy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in business w/ hot nails  </li>
      <li>(which would have only been able to wear in October).</li>
      <li>This was the first OPI gel product I bought.</li>
      <li>Pretty, but not as muted as the photo.  </li>
      <li>I love the OPI gelcolor system and own several other colors.</li>
      <li>It took me a couple of tries to get the technique down but the product is the best so far for gel polishes.</li>
      <li>This is very disappointing because I love the color and out of all the ones I own probably my favorite.</li>
      <li>While shipped promptly, I believe that when displaying a color of nail polish online, its important that the picture be as true-to-life as possible.  </li>
      <li>but I expected it to be more of a salmon.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend to order this one</li>
      <li>My favorite year round.  </li>
      <li>It looks as a normal nail lacquer.</li>
      <li>Very flattering, subtle enough, good for any occasion.</li>
      <li>I thought the color was okay, not vibrant like the regular OPI color.</li>
      <li>I found this new 2013 summer Essie color</li>
      <li>I ordered this expecting a frosted coral color, as that&#x27;s what it looks like on both my laptop and phone screen, and was disappointed to receive what&#x27;s best described as a neon-red.</li>
      <li>and I realized it was the exact same as Cajun Shrimp (which this one is.  </li>
      <li>It is still a pretty red.</li>
      <li>-)if trying yourself keep it thin and clean away the edges by cuticle before curing under light</li>
      <li>It is much thicker than the other OPI colors that I have, and it did not set up under the lights.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the Opi gel color collection nail gel lacquer, cancun shrimp. I found the color to be as advertised.</li>
    <li> I got this color because, I decided to start doing my own gel nails. I usually wear clear, but just had to try this color, the name got me. It is a beautiful light red to coral, just gorgeous, lots of compliments. Great for summer and Christmas it is going to be great.</li>
    <li> Cajun Shrimp is my must have nail color.  I am so pleased that it is now in a gel polish.  This is the color that my friends ask what is on my nails and they want to know where I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Nice orange/ coral color. Needs uv light, base coat, and top coat. Inexpensive way to have at-home gel nails.</li>
    <li> This is the ORANGE.. so if you want orange it is the correct one</li>
    <li> Love the color however it peels off almost immediately ... I applied it just like I did the other colors I bought by gelish.  Gelish stays for 2-3 weeks at least ... Opi I one day.</li>
    <li> Love the color.!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first they had sent me the wrong color, they were wonderful to work with and sent me the right one.</li>
    <li> Love doing Gel nails at home. This is a great color and I love the OPI gel color system. Love!</li>
    <li> OPI has made a great name for itself for a reason.  It&#x27;s quality polish in brilliant shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would consider this a redish orange.  The gel is easy to apply, gives great coverage, cures as it should and has a wonderful shiny finish.  This is my most used color from my polish collection.</li>
    <li> Love this color, have it in the regular nail polish, good summer color, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see this color in the gel polish. I have been looking and looking around for it. So glad to have it. Excellent color</li>
    <li> Perfect color for the spring/summer!!  Works well with my UV light at home for in between nail appointments!!  Must have!</li>
    <li> This color couldn&#x27;t be any more gorgeous. It&#x27;s a vibrant red with a tint of orange, and although I thought it would look awful with my skintone (fair with freckles) but it looked amazing! Application was a dream. The color is more red than what the picture shows (as usual, the pictures aren&#x27;t a great representation). I find the best way to see how it actually looks is to Google a color&#x27;s name + the word swatch to see pictures of it actually applied on someone&#x27;s nails. It&#x27;s a much better way to see if you&#x27;re going to like a color. So glad I did!</li>
    <li> There is something wrong with this product. It is much thicker than the other OPI colors that I have, and it did not set up under the lights. It even rubbed off on my clothing. I have had to remove it from my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Your packaging said no returns.</li>
    <li> While shipped promptly, I believe that when displaying a color of nail polish online, its important that the picture be as true-to-life as possible.  I ordered this expecting a frosted coral color, as that&#x27;s what it looks like on both my laptop and phone screen, and was disappointed to receive what&#x27;s best described as a neon-red. There should be a better photo and/or more accurate description.</li>
    <li> Love the color and the brand, great quality</li>
    <li> Great color - it&#x27;s like Cajun Shrimp - and the gel color lasts longer than the regular nail polish ever did!  No touch upsn</li>
    <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
    <li> love being able to do my own nails with gel,takes a little practice but no chipping nails stay shinny and cool :-)if trying yourself keep it thin and clean away the edges by cuticle before curing under light</li>
    <li> Really loved the color! Opi is a really great product! Would buy again for sure!!!!! Way better then Cnd products!</li>
    <li> Just as described in product description.</li>
    <li> did not stay on my nails, i have bought over 6 Opi gel color lacquer and none has worked so I am not going to set back and pay $17.  for items that do not work  DO NOT BUY YOU WILL NOT BE SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> Worst nail polish I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I usually like OPI products, but this gel product still wasn&#x27;t dry after an hour; the polish slid right off. It ruined both my shorts and my shirt because I figured it would have been dry after an hour. I DO NOT recommend this nail polish.</li>
    <li> It took me a couple of tries to get the technique down but the product is the best so far for gel polishes. no streaks, even coverage and very glossy! love this so much, wish there were more nice colors!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own gel manicure at home with great success. This was the first OPI gel product I bought. I found the polish to be extremely thin, more than any other gel polish. I have the LED light and did the appropriate curing time. However, I found the polish &amp;#34;wrinkled&amp;#34; with 2 coats. Perhaps applying the polish with even thinner coats would help that. I thought the color was okay, not vibrant like the regular OPI color. I much prefer the Gelish line of products!</li>
    <li> Much more red than as  appears  in picture. Nothing  wrong  with  product  or  company, I  was just looking for more of an orange &amp;  this is definitely a  red  just with an orange-ish  tone.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the color. Too dark. It&#x27;s not even close to the color of shrimp. Thought it would be more of a peachy orange color.</li>
    <li> Cajun shrimp is a beautiful color, easy application, and long wear. It was a great buy and I will buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> true to color depicted, good price when purchased</li>
    <li> This product contributed to my nails becoming even weaker and soft. Although the ease of use and looks were great while the product was on my nails, when I removed the product, my nails were very damaged.</li>
    <li> I prefer this gel rather tan shellac because it&#x27;s thinner, and The bottle is bigger. It looks as a normal nail lacquer. The colour is so nice... A bright red with a touch of Orange, close to coral colour. Perfect for summer time</li>
    <li> Beautiful shade goes w/ everything which is surprising. The OPI base &amp; topcoat made color chip &amp; peel in one day but when used w/ Gelish base &amp; topcoat I&#x27;m in business w/ hot nails  Gelish topcoat WAY more shiny than this brand&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I love this color!! It&#x27;s the perfect red with a hint of orange, perfect for wearing all the time. I love the OPI gelcolor system and own several other colors. For some reason, the bottle I received tends to wrinkle when cured. Even when I apply super thin coats, it is difficult and near impossible to get a decent application. This is very disappointing because I love the color and out of all the ones I own probably my favorite. None of my other colors do this, not sure why this happens but I wish I could get a replacement.</li>
    <li> It was not the item I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;What I retrieved wAs regular polish&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed with this whole thing</li>
    <li> Pretty, but not as muted as the photo.  This pops a bit more in the bright pink range, I had thought it was a Soft coral, but I like it fine anyway.  Have not used it enough yet to speak to staying-power.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a orange to wear with black for halloween.. It&#x27;s not the orange I wanted. (which would have only been able to wear in October). It did the job.. Very pretty color you can wear all year round.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  I used to go to a salon to have my gel nails done.  I now have a uv light and do my own.  I always got Cajun Shrimp color on my nails in the summer.  It is a beautiful color.  OPI gel is my favorite brand of gel polish. It never chips on my nails.  I only have to change my OPI polish every 4 weeks just because my nails grow out.</li>
    <li> Great color.  Long wearing.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! Love the color and quick delivery. Very happy :)</li>
    <li> I love this color but I expected it to be more of a salmon.  On my feet it just looks like a fire engine red.  I still like it though and the OPI gels stay on so long!</li>
    <li> takes time to apply and dry but the durability is incredible</li>
    <li> Love the color and works really well. Have no problems with it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I had used another gel nail system for a while and decided to add OPI to my set.  This stays on soooo good! The other colors I&#x27;ve tried would start to chip and peel at 7 days, the 2 OPI colors I have stay put through 12 days!!! Love it!</li>
    <li> Its a great red, orange color and I get compliments all the time&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend to order this one</li>
    <li> product worked great with the Gelish gel nail products - color is an orange red.  I was hoping more for orange.  It is still a pretty red.</li>
    <li> My favorite year round.  Very flattering, subtle enough, good for any occasion.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> For those who are looking for the awesome color CAJUN shrimp, not \\&quot;Cancun\\&quot; shrimp, this is it! It&#x27;s a staple summer color</li>
    <li> I found this new 2013 summer Essie color and I realized it was the exact same as Cajun Shrimp (which this one is.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s listed as Cancun Shrimp and amazon hasn&#x27;t changed it.) I was a little nervous to Ortiz, but have no fear! It is Cajun Shrimp....says so on the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a beautiful on and the I&#x27;m now obsessed with the LED gel nails. Don&#x27;t put it on too thick because it will peel off, but it takes about 20-30 minutes from start to finish and looks so professional!&lt;br /&gt;I say go for it.....</li>
