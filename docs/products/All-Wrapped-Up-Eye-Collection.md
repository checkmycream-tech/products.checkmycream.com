      <li>IM 100% SATISFIED</li>
      <li>AND I LOVE THE PACKAGING ...</li>
      <li>and I still LOVE, love it.  </li>
      <li>I loved it at first then began having problems with runny, irritated eyes.</li>
      <li>They go on silky smooth, and in my experience do no crease on your eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I initially bought this because it seemed like a great deal</li>
      <li>love how pretty the colors are.</li>
      <li>I was also pleasantly surprised at the nice box</li>

      <li>Thanks for offering such a great product at a price that is affordable.</li>
      <li>The color is impressive and so bold and lasts a really long time especially if you use a primer.</li>
      <li>so far, I love all of their make-up I have used.</li>
      <li>She is new to bare minerals and loved the colors.</li>
      <li>The best part is that you control how much you use by tapping what you need into the empty cover of the color your using and then putting back what you dont want, If you use the foundation its not click go technology but its just as useful.</li>
      <li>EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>BUT...WERE SPEEDY AND VERY HELPFUL IN RETRIEVING THE ITEM!</li>

      <li>In general I love Bare Minerals make up.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Even though they are not full size thanks to the wonderful formula they will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>Vibrant and in true Bare Escentuals fashion.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more eye shadows from Bare Essentials...</li>
      <li>The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t last all day, and isn&#x27;t as bold as I would think..not enough for the price.</li>
      <li>I was told by a professional that the foundation causes respiratory problems and eye irritation.</li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Good colors for the eyes and with Bare Escentuals, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
      <li>I have the Bare Minerals makeup and naturally had to try the eye collection.  </li>
      <li>thank you for providing bare minerals makeup</li>
      <li>After examining my eyes, my Dr asked if I wear Bare Minerals makeup.</li>
      <li>I used the full line for the past 3-4 yrs.</li>
      <li>Lots of small and fun goodies for stocking stuffers.  </li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS!!! ITS EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE...AND I LOVE THE PACKAGING ...EVERYTHING! PERFECT GIFT!! I HAD SOME TROBLE WITH THE DELIVERY AS THEY DELIVERE DIT TO THE WRONG HOUSE! BUT...WERE SPEEDY AND VERY HELPFUL IN RETRIEVING THE ITEM! IM 100% SATISFIED</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with this purchase. The shades are beautiful, and plentiful. I was also pleasantly surprised at the nice box the make up came in. Would highly recommend it! I&#x27;d give it five stars!</li>
    <li> I have the Bare Minerals makeup and naturally had to try the eye collection.  It is a nice, smooth shadow for the eyes and seems to blend better than any other eye makeup I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m totally sold.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to have this set for the holidays , but when ever I put the eyeshadow on my eyes they were so irritated. What a HUGE Disappointment.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The colors are beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to give it to my daughter for Christmas! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love these eye shadows.  They go on silky smooth, and in my experience do no crease on your eyelid.  I will definitely buy more eye shadows from Bare Essentials...so far, I love all of their make-up I have used.</li>
    <li> In general I love Bare Minerals make up. This set of eye shadows is no differnent. Great for holiday looks and silky feel makes them feel great when you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as a birthday gift. She is new to bare minerals and loved the colors. The price was good and delivery was quick and cute packaging.</li>
    <li> These are great. Love how they blend.</li>
    <li> These eyeshadows were everything I expected. Even though they are not full size thanks to the wonderful formula they will last a very long time. Great pigmentation and easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Love these colors.  Vibrant and in true Bare Escentuals fashion.</li>
    <li> I used the full line for the past 3-4 yrs. I loved it at first then began having problems with runny, irritated eyes. I was told by a professional that the foundation causes respiratory problems and eye irritation. I stopped using the foundation 2 months ago but continued to use the eye shadows. My eye symptoms were reduced but did not go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;Last weak I had a routine eye exam and reported a decline in my vision. After examining my eyes, my Dr asked if I wear Bare Minerals makeup. I was shocked that she knew my make up brand by an eye exam. The Dr went on to inform me that the lining of my eyes and tear ducts were coated with the makeup which is not only unhealthy but was causing some vision problems as well, this is common with Bare Minerals. I spoke with my esthitician who said she is no longer recommending or selling Bare Minerals due to these known issues. I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> IF YOU LOVE BAREMINERALS MAKEUP .....this is for you. I initially bought this because it seemed like a great deal I KNOW THAT ONE CONTAINER (reg sized) is around 5-8 dollars in the bareminerals store (i believe) and I did try some samples in the actual store (gorgeous but pricey, As for this collection it hit all the color points (PINK/NAVY/GREEN) I was looking for. The color is impressive and so bold and lasts a really long time especially if you use a primer. your eyes always look stunning for a great night out and the best part is that most of these colors are blendable. I thought my MAC (i call it my evening eye) kit was great but this blew me away if you have the right applicator brushes you will be even more than finE. The best part is that you control how much you use by tapping what you need into the empty cover of the color your using and then putting back what you dont want, If you use the foundation its not click go technology but its just as useful. I see this lasting a while. TWO THUMBS UP for this bargain kit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the description mentioned that these colors are not matte, they are shiny and glittery. I am not going to return them because I will use them, I would have appreciated a better description.</li>
    <li> and I still LOVE, love it.  Great price, fabulous product and it will last me for years!  Thanks for offering such a great product at a price that is affordable.</li>
    <li> Good colors for the eyes and with Bare Escentuals, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Wonderful makeup and it lasts several hours. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> Nothing like they show it on commercials. The eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t last all day, and isn&#x27;t as bold as I would think..not enough for the price.</li>
    <li> Lots of small and fun goodies for stocking stuffers.  I would definetly buy this again but would like to be able to mix and match different colors.</li>
    <li> beautiful, complimentary colors. exactly as described. long lasting. love how pretty the colors are. thank you for providing bare minerals makeup</li>
    <li> I have had so many compliments on my eyes since using this set! Thank you for such a wonderful product. I am a customer for life!</li>
