      <li>More and more I can&#x27;t find this in the store.</li>
      <li>She didn&#x27;t love that.</li>
      <li>my favorite stives product ...clears skin in minutes ....</li>
      <li>This is the best facial cleanser on the market.  </li>
      <li>It did not reduce break outs, or cause more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin smooth and &amp;#34;look ma no wrinkles&amp;#34;!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>The top tube easily slips over the bottom.</li>
      <li>I love how clean the face wash leaves my skin</li>
      <li>But I do like it, my face feels fresh, not dry, and it smells good!</li>
      <li>creamy smooth, never break out from it.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my skin smooth and blemish free.</li>
      <li>I have used many facial scrubs &amp; this one is, by far, the best!!</li>
      <li>and I know alpha hydroxy causes skin sensitivity to light</li>
      <li>but it does the trick for cheap.</li>
      <li>and my face is smooth and hydrated.</li>
      <li>The St Ives apricot scrub is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>The scrub is gentle but effective.</li>
      <li>It smells good and leaves the skin soft and refreshed.</li>
      <li>but so far so good.  </li>
      <li>Lighghtly scented good for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it also makes it firmer, since I am older that is amazing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used St. Ives since I was a teen (I&#x27;m 36 now) and this stuff is just as amazing as their products have always been!  </li>
      <li>I love this product the first time I use it.</li>
      <li>I have used this product and while using this product my face is looking better and better at my old age.</li>
      <li>It leaves skin clean and refreshed.</li>
      <li>but yet deeply cleans your skin and leaves nice and smooth and even toned skin!  </li>
      <li>Ive&#x27;s skin products as they don&#x27;t dry out my skin and they smell and feel great.  </li>
      <li>the way i use it is by exfoliating with the regular apricot scrub first, rinse, then massage this on my face and leave it on the duration of my shower to let it really absorb into the skin and its awesome.</li>
      <li>I have always loved this facial cleanser.</li>
      <li>Nonetheless, this is not bad at all.</li>
      <li>My skin feels amazing, not tight and over scrubbed.  </li>
      <li>I have dry skin, this has not caused a difference, which is good by me because I use moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know that it makes me look any younger, but it sure isn&#x27;t hurting!</li>
      <li>I recommend to anyone who loves the fresh feeling after cleansing.</li>
      <li>soft skin and better</li>
      <li>I love that they contain natural ingredients and are non-irritating.</li>
      <li>It has a nice soft abrasion and really cleans well without irritation.  </li>
      <li>I use the original in the evening to really exfoliate, and this version in the morning.</li>
      <li>This, combined with using sunscreen, eating (fairly) healthy and drinking enough fluids has really helped my skin to look good and to make me feel younger.  </li>
      <li>I personally prefer the &#x27;Fresh Skin&#x27; variant, since that one has more scrub powder.</li>
      <li>I bought this one instead of my usual St. Ives that is a bit more coarse and found this one worked great for my skin.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Price very reasonable.</li>
      <li>with &amp;#34;Fresh Skin&amp;#34; if you want real exfoliation!</li>
      <li>I used it in the shower at first and had flaky eyelids that freaked me out until I figured out what was happening.</li>
      <li>and I personally like it better because it has more of the scrub beads and its only like $1.99 or something at walmart.</li>
      <li>This always leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth afterwords.</li>
      <li>Makes skin feel soft and refreshed!!!!</li>
      <li>I usually use natural masks ,but for years I used the &amp;#34; St. Ives Timeless Skin Visibily Tones and Firms Skin Apricot Scrub &amp;#34; as a quick mask before going outside and I would always feel the freshness in minutes and be impressed ....</li>
      <li>Leaves our skin clean, clear and glowing.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I&#x27;ve purchased in the store.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for many years a long while ago.</li>
      <li>This product would be great for someone whose skin is easily irritated by the standard St. Ives scrub, but I find it too weak.</li>
      <li>and it cleared it up so fast</li>
      <li>This product make my face feel soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>This product really does work.  </li>

    <li> Wish I could find it on the retail shelves; glad to get it here.  Leaves skin smooth and &amp;#34;look ma no wrinkles&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> For the price, good. Not much exfoliating - I have to add some baking soda to it.  Has an odd smell.  Not what I am used to with St. Ives.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating product!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. I love how clean the face wash leaves my skin but it also makes it firmer, since I am older that is amazing.  Thanks again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, I can use this daily without my skin drying out. I have combination skin and my skin is very sensitive. The Timeless Skin does wonders for my face, I&#x27;ve tried other scrubs that left my skin dry or itchy. This scrub doesn&#x27;t do either. And the alpha hydroxy in it has helped with wrinkles I had, especially around the eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and my face is smooth and hydrated. I&#x27;m very pleased with this scrub and have no desire to try something else.</li>
    <li> This product really does work.  Just be careful around your eyes.  I like to put it on and leave it for a few minutes and then scrub it off with a washcloth.  It seems give it time to work.  It also helps keep it off your eyelids this way.  I used it in the shower at first and had flaky eyelids that freaked me out until I figured out what was happening.</li>
    <li> Love, Love , love it !!!! Makes skin feel soft and refreshed!!!!</li>
    <li> Works good but I bought it for acne too and I didn&#x27;t realize that its just basically a skin scrub. But they do have the black head scrub available too now. Ive been using the equate brand now it says to compare it to st. ives on the bottle and I personally like it better because it has more of the scrub beads and its only like $1.99 or something at walmart.</li>
    <li> Got this for my brother and it seems to work on his face. I don&#x27;t use it myself as I have Sheshiedo products.</li>
    <li> This stuff is gentle enough to not irritate your skin but strong enough to remove makeup.  It visibly tones your skin and it smells great.  No complaints!</li>
    <li> I use this almost daily and have for years. It keeps me from breaking out and my skin literally glows. While I do give my skin a break a couple of times a week from the scrubbing, I don&#x27;t believe this is damaging in any way. It&#x27;s actually my skin secret. People routinely think I&#x27;m 15 years younger!</li>
    <li> works identically to the stuff I bought from the dollar store. has  virtually zero exfoliating ability, and leaves skin feeling waxy.&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of the regular apricot scrub but this product is useless.</li>
    <li> I used this product for many years a long while ago. I truly am not sure why i discontinued its use, but I am very glad that I returned to it.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this facial cleanser. It keeps my skin smooth and blemish free. It&#x27;s not real grainy like most other scrubs. I used to use the regular apricot scrub, but it was very grainy and caused my drain to stop up a lot. It didn&#x27;t dissolve well. The only reason I ordered it on line is because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I used to get it at walmart...but they have not had it in stock for a while. I wish they would because getting it on line was just to expensive.</li>
    <li> i am so glad i found this scrub years ago, ever since I have been a convert.&lt;br /&gt;i like the AHA that helps cleans my face!!</li>
    <li> This product speaks for itself. Men exfoliate their faces everyday when they shave, why shouldn&#x27;t we? Ever notice how a man who is the same age as a woman looks younger? Think about it.</li>
    <li> Loved how quick I recieved the product and also love the face wash. This is the best one they have in my opinion.</li>
    <li> My husband and I use it.  We see the effects immediately.  Leaves our skin clean, clear and glowing.  We look younger too!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I&#x27;ve purchased in the store.  I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for a few years and really like the results with it.  It&#x27;s gentle and will not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Not a miracle cure but when you do use it in the bath and then soak for 20-30 min, it definitely does make a different in tone and smoothness .  Noticable after one use.  Smells really nice too.  Price very reasonable.</li>
    <li> This always leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth afterwords.</li>
    <li> soft skin and better but my face get more oilly after few hours&lt;br /&gt;i think im gonna buy clean and clear next time.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, cleans your face... or others&#x27; faces... or other body parts from willing participants (please don&#x27;t try to wash unwilling people&#x27;s faces, it could get in their eyes)</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this scrub!  Gentle but yet deeply cleans your skin and leaves nice and smooth and even toned skin!  I will stop buying those expensive facial scrub that drys and irritates my skin.</li>
    <li> this has become a part of my everyday routine,  i&#x27;m a guy and this has made my skin tight toned, greatly reduced any crows feet i had, the way i use it is by exfoliating with the regular apricot scrub first, rinse, then massage this on my face and leave it on the duration of my shower to let it really absorb into the skin and its awesome. creamy smooth, never break out from it.  highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!!  It works great....but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore!  I never rec&#x27;d this product because it was out of stock pretty much the same day I ordered it!  Still waiting to hear back from Ocean Discount when some comes in or becomes available....</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
    <li> Never use anything else. I&#x27;m 59 friends, family say I look 45!</li>
    <li> This product would be great for someone whose skin is easily irritated by the standard St. Ives scrub, but I find it too weak.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  The scrub is gentle but effective. It smells good and leaves the skin soft and refreshed.</li>
    <li> This particular product has become harder to find at our local stores so I had to resort to buying on Amazon.  Great product, at a great price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with St. Ives products.  They are priced for every budget and deliver high quality products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used St. Ives since I was a teen (I&#x27;m 36 now) and this stuff is just as amazing as their products have always been!  It&#x27;s not drying or too harsh and it seems to help keep breakouts low and speed the healing of discolorations from a breakout and such.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good exfoliate. My skin felt clean after use, but a little dry and tight. I didn&#x27;t notice any type of \\&quot;renewing\\&quot; or \\&quot;firming\\&quot; results. I don&#x27;t really have a yes or no opinion on recommending this. If you want to try it, then try it.</li>
    <li> I like St. Ive&#x27;s skin products as they don&#x27;t dry out my skin and they smell and feel great.  This product is not as &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; to me as the apricot scrub for blemish control but my skin has undergone visible (positive) changes since I started using this product a little over a month ago.</li>
    <li> I personally prefer the &#x27;Fresh Skin&#x27; variant, since that one has more scrub powder. Nonetheless, this is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! It smells lovely, and does the trick! Not sure if it is really toning and firming.. but it is exfoliating! :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this face scrub for years and have been very happy.  It is great to see it in Subscribe and Save.</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT,GOOD PRICE AND IT DOES THE JOB.THE TEXTURE IS NICE,BUT I DON&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE SMELL...SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING YOU CAN EAT...BUT I THINK IS A GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I am a faithful user of St. Ives products. I love that they contain natural ingredients and are non-irritating. This scrub does a great job of giving your skin that deep-down clean feeling. I don&#x27;t know that it makes me look any younger, but it sure isn&#x27;t hurting!</li>
    <li> The directions on the tube say to only use this 3-4 times per week but I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day - morning and night.  I love the stuff!  I was afraid it would make me break out but so far so good.  It has a nice soft abrasion and really cleans well without irritation.  I had a pimple from the products I was using just previously and it cleared it up so fast it was unbelievable.  I am a fan for life!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser on the market.  It is not too harsh for sensitive skin.  It leaves skin clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, and they even gave me a little one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again !</li>
    <li> I have used many facial scrubs &amp; this one is, by far, the best!! It left my skin feeling soft with a healthy glow. I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have combination skin. I would recommend this product to any woman in my age group.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this stuff. They stopped making it. She didn&#x27;t love that.</li>
    <li> Product very difficult to find. I have tried several schrubs but this one is the best by far. It makes your face feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this along with the facial scrub and I&#x27;m really noticing some results after just a few days. My skin looks more dewy and I&#x27;m having less pore issues with my new regiment. :D It has a decent smell and the exfoliating particals really get in there and scrub the dead skin off pretty well even though they are a pain to get out of your hair line and sometimes I miss some on my neck that is why I always use this before I take a shower to make sure they get washed off. I am fair complected and I know alpha hydroxy causes skin sensitivity to light so be sure to wear some sunblock. I will be purchasing again! :D</li>
    <li> If you want a thick, very dense, exfoliating scrub, DO NOT buy the &amp;#34;Visibly Tones&amp;#34; type. It&#x27;s mostly cream with a few meager grains of scrub. Complete waste of money. Also beware the reviews section is averaging together all the &amp;#34;types&amp;#34; of scrub. If you look carefully, the title shows which type is actually being reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with &amp;#34;Fresh Skin&amp;#34; if you want real exfoliation!</li>
    <li> When i bought this the price was quite low and I bought 4.  I keep one by the sink to wash my face at night, or morning if I&#x27;m not going to bother shower that day.  One in the shower for morning.  I have dry skin, this has not caused a difference, which is good by me because I use moisturizer.  Does just as it says..clean and toning.</li>
    <li> my favorite stives product ...clears skin in minutes ....I usually use natural masks ,but for years I used the &amp;#34; St. Ives Timeless Skin Visibily Tones and Firms Skin Apricot Scrub &amp;#34; as a quick mask before going outside and I would always feel the freshness in minutes and be impressed ....</li>
    <li> Love it! Favourite face scrub.</li>
    <li> i have used their products for years and have never been disappointed. i use this daily.. always get compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this one instead of my usual St. Ives that is a bit more coarse and found this one worked great for my skin.  Though I like both I found this is perfect for both me and my hubby who has more sensitive skin.  I use this once a week and moisturize afterwards with a neutragena moisturizer with sunscreen.  I feel like when I use it is makes my skin glow and it feels great.  This, combined with using sunscreen, eating (fairly) healthy and drinking enough fluids has really helped my skin to look good and to make me feel younger.  I would highly recommend.  I would say my skin is not necessarily sensitive but hubby&#x27;s is and he had no issues.  His skin tends to be dry/normal and mine more normal/oily and did a great job for both of us!</li>
    <li> Love it. When you think you can&#x27;t get any more out, cut the tube 2/3rds down and you will see 20-25% remaining. The top tube easily slips over the bottom.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and has scrubbing action. I love this product. Lighghtly scented good for sensitive skin. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I think it was expired or a fake</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mild face scrub not sure if it&#x27;s &#x27;firming&#x27; anything - but then again at age 59 everything I use has &#x27;firm&#x27; on it :( in reality short of a Quick Lift proclamations of firm go only so far ha ha!. But I do like it, my face feels fresh, not dry, and it smells good! I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Timeless Skin Visibly Tones is a product that you may not ever need in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for 3 months so that I can truly say that it did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visibly, I could not see a difference.  It did not reduce break outs, or cause more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a neutral product, therefore, I rate it 2 stars.</li>
    <li> The St Ives apricot scrub is fantastic.  It smells wonderful, isn&#x27;t too harsh and the creamy base rinses right off.  My skin feels amazing, not tight and over scrubbed.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> More and more I can&#x27;t find this in the store. My skin quality is very nice when I use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product and while using this product my face is looking better and better at my old age.</li>
    <li> I love this product the first time I use it. This product make my face feel soft and fresh. I recommend to anyone who loves the fresh feeling after cleansing.</li>
    <li> It definitely does not have as much exfoliating power as the original, but this is a different version so I don&#x27;t see that as a negative thing. After several uses I do feel a firmer tone to my cheeks - obviously this is not a face-lift in a bottle but it does the trick for cheap. I use the original in the evening to really exfoliate, and this version in the morning. Thank you amazon, very happy!</li>
    <li> After using Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Brightening Daily Scrub for a few years I decided to try this.  Aveeno always left me with a few dry spots and I needed to follow with moisturizer immediately. Not so with this St. Ives product, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I saw one review that it left skin dry...not in my case and I use it everyday in the shower. At HALF THE PRICE OF AVEENO, this St. Ives product is as effective as Aveeno, in my opinion, and at the very least worth a try.</li>
    <li> I use this and my other daily moisturizer as well. I love the way it cleans the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Has some granulation pieces in it. Just keep your eyes closed and rinse well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find any of this brand of face wash at my local store for the past few years.  I used to use St. Ives years ago but when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally I changed to something else.  It worked OK until the manufacturer went out of business and I had to switch to something else.  After trying out 5 or 6 other brands, I finally came to Amazon and bought some St. Ives face scrubs.  I love how they make my skin feel.  The only down side for some people is that there is a warning telling about this product containing an alpha hydroxyl acid which can increase the chances of getting a sunburn.  This isn&#x27;t too big of a concern for me, but it might be a concern to people that are in the sun a lot.</li>
