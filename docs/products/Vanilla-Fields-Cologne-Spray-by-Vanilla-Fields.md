      <li>-just this strong woody, plant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, on me all I could smell was a strong scent of what I guess is supposed to be greenery and wood.  </li>
      <li>Warm vanilla scent, (smells strong at first but fades).</li>
      <li>Such a beautiful, soothing aroma...</li>
      <li>but when I first spray it; it is very strong.  </li>
      <li>But I can&#x27;t even say that much-I can&#x27;t smell much vanilla of any kind.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>I bought this because my husband can&#x27;t handle most perfumes and this perfume was always so sweet and mild.</li>
      <li>Clean and light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Coty has remained one of the top producers of these items for so long &amp; is still consistently good with all of their products.</li>
      <li>The scent is truly unique and lasts all day</li>
      <li>My first girlfriend used to wear this perfume so there are literally 1000 reasons why I love this scent.  </li>
      <li>and it seems to be the original scent (or as close to it)</li>
      <li>just got my Vanilla Fields today and tried it out right away!</li>
      <li>She missed this smelll,l how sweet.</li>
      <li>It is light and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Love it, well worth the price I paid, scent lasts all day, have received lots of compliments, highly recommend to anyone</li>
      <li>I love the way she smells when she wears it), so when her old bottle was running out and she couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores, I bought this as a surprise gift for her.</li>
      <li>It seems a touch stronger and more perfume-y than I remember, but I also don&#x27;t want to say that&#x27;s a certainty because I haven&#x27;t smelled it for nearly twenty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>For an inexpensive perfume, this is such a nice one.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores, but I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon.</li>
      <li>This bottle will last a long time, and the warm vanilla scent is really nice.</li>
      <li>It combines sweet, comforting, sexy, classy, and musky without being too much of any one thing.  </li>
      <li>But after reading many positive reviews and remembering the old bottle, I wanted to try it.  </li>
      <li>But because of the strong, old perfume smell,  he can&#x27;t breathe when I first put it on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vanilla Fields was my favorite when I was in high school in the early 90s and somehow over the years I forgot about it.</li>
      <li>One of only two perfumes I can wear that I love that doesn&#x27;t affect my allergies.  </li>
      <li>It smells better than I thought it would - with a definite vanilla scent.  </li>
      <li>The first time I tried it was out of desperation when my Gloria Vanderbilt was no longer being made.</li>
      <li>I love tHis fragrance and it is not sold in regular stores except during some holiday seasons</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s a man I hope to keep interested in me</li>
      <li>it wears well, and smells rich and classy.</li>
      <li>was really hoping to love this one, to use as a daily fragrance, but I can&#x27;t wear it.  </li>
      <li>I barely detect any vanilla which is a huge let-down.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s harder to find now, so I was happy to find the .75 oz size at such a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a soft, fragrance that is gentle and clean.</li>
      <li>smells good - long lasting</li>
      <li>It has a light vanilla aroma that lingers throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The price was extremely reasonable and I will be making future orders with this company.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
      <li>or if she used it much.  </li>
      <li>My wife really likes this perfume</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really distinguish that, but maybe it&#x27;s part of what I&#x27;m not liking.  </li>
      <li>Not so much now</li>
      <li>Everybody has different tastes, but I enjoy this fragrance on my wife.</li>
      <li>When I was in Walgreen&#x27;s recently, they had little gift packs of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft perfume, another favorite from my childhood, which triggered a memory of Vanilla Fields.</li>
      <li>when I first spray it; it has that old, been sitting on Grandma&#x27;s dresser, smell to it.  </li>
      <li>Accept no immitations by other mfg&#x27;s, get the original Vanilla fields.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle or something.  </li>
      <li>I remember my mom having a bottle of this in the early 90s.  </li>
      <li>which I&#x27;m sometimes sensitive to.  </li>
      <li>as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>Takes me back to high school.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume, but its hard to find in local stores.</li>
      <li>It is pretty much what I remember it being, especially after it dried a bit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I remember my mom having a bottle of this in the early 90s.  I don&#x27;t remember what it smelled like or if she used it much.  But after reading many positive reviews and remembering the old bottle, I wanted to try it.  I love vanilla scents, so it sounded good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, on me all I could smell was a strong scent of what I guess is supposed to be greenery and wood.  I think there is patchouli in this, which I&#x27;m sometimes sensitive to.  I don&#x27;t really distinguish that, but maybe it&#x27;s part of what I&#x27;m not liking.  I barely detect any vanilla which is a huge let-down.  If anything, it&#x27;s a woody vanilla not sweet vanilla.  But I can&#x27;t even say that much-I can&#x27;t smell much vanilla of any kind.  There also isn&#x27;t any typical florals that I usually notice in perfumes-just this strong woody, plant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping to love this one, to use as a daily fragrance, but I can&#x27;t wear it.  It seems to work for a lot of other people.  Maybe I got a bad bottle or something.</li>
    <li> Used this cologne for a lot of years. Ran out a few months back.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores around my area.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got an old bottle or something.  but when I first spray it; it is very strong.  Not he scent I remember from the late 90&#x27;s.  when I first spray it; it has that old, been sitting on Grandma&#x27;s dresser, smell to it.  After it is on for awhile it taper of.  But it is not sweet smelling the way I remember.  I bought this because my husband can&#x27;t handle most perfumes and this perfume was always so sweet and mild. I told him he would like it.  But because of the strong, old perfume smell,  he can&#x27;t breathe when I first put it on.</li>
    <li> Smells like my childhood! I had a hard time finding this in stores so I was really happy to find it online and for a good price. It doesn&#x27;t seem watered down at all like some online sites that sell perfume do. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for years and I never get tired of it!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I am allergic to most flowery or musky scents....love vanilla!</li>
    <li> Usually get a compliment when wearing this.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this perfume and I can handle it when trapped in a car with her for a few hours.  Good stuff at a good price.</li>
    <li> if you like a vanilla scent&lt;br /&gt;this is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;right size - no need to keep spriting&lt;br /&gt;thru out the day.</li>
    <li> I was able to purchase the item I was searching for --thank you</li>
    <li> This is one of the few fragrances I will use.  It is light and fresh.  I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne I could not be happier ! I will never wear anything else I get migraines but this never gives me one .</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.  It has a light vanilla aroma that lingers throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;The price was extremely reasonable and I will be making future orders with this company.</li>
    <li> This is my wifes preferred perfume. Amazon prime makes me look like a hero. When the wife is happy, she makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Ugh I remembered this smelling better years ago.. Not so much now</li>
    <li> Vanilla Fields is one of the best scents on the market.  It combines sweet, comforting, sexy, classy, and musky without being too much of any one thing.  It is perfect for all occasions.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. I use to wear it years ago but stopped ,my daughter remembers this smell and asked me for a bottle. She missed this smelll,l how sweet. A oldie but goodie.</li>
    <li> Smells great! the same as I remember from years ago!</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve used this for over 25 years. It&#x27;s a soft, fragrance that is gentle and clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t help it--I love Vanilla Fields. I always have. It&#x27;s harder to find now, so I was happy to find the .75 oz size at such a reasonable price. This bottle will last a long time, and the warm vanilla scent is really nice. The smell is long lasting, and I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This item remains the same after many,many years,excellent. A bit pricey but compared to some of the others on the market, this is a pretty fair deal.&lt;br /&gt;Coty has remained one of the top producers of these items for so long &amp; is still consistently good with all of their products.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes. I am only writing this to get rid of the reminder on my page. Thankes</li>
    <li> I love all things vanilla it is soft enough to wear all day and soft enough for my two younger girls</li>
    <li> I love this perfume!  It&#x27;s not easy to find in stores, but I&#x27;m so happy that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon. Vanilla is the perfect scent I think, I am always getting compliments on my perfume. Pair with vanilla body wash and lotion, you&#x27;ll be getting all the compliments too. I&#x27;ll never change my scent.</li>

    <li> Accept no immitations by other mfg&#x27;s, get the original Vanilla fields. My wife...and I love this perfume. The scent is truly unique and lasts all day</li>
    <li> szybka przesylka  wczoraj zamuwilem dzis dostalem ,produkt pewny ,nie mam zadnych zastrzezen :) mozna kupowac smialo daje 5 gwiazdek .pozdrawiam ekipe</li>
    <li> Since this is a perfume and that seems to be a dicey thing to buy on places like Amazon because of all the fake scents with fake packaging, I feel the need to review this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla Fields was my favorite when I was in high school in the early 90s and somehow over the years I forgot about it. When I was in Walgreen&#x27;s recently, they had little gift packs of Love&#x27;s Baby Soft perfume, another favorite from my childhood, which triggered a memory of Vanilla Fields. When I asked the beauty person about it, she said that they had a gift pack of Vanilla Fields for the holidays, but they sold out of them (I am going to look for them next year!). I checked a few other Walgreen&#x27;s and even some CVSs in my neighborhood, and not only were there no gift packs of Vanilla Fields, it was nowhere to be found at all. Even online, it seems difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, Amazon had some. So, I tried to research on here quite a lot before making a purchase since perfumes, though shippable, are not returnable due to their \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got my Vanilla Fields today and tried it out right away! It is pretty much what I remember it being, especially after it dried a bit. It seems a touch stronger and more perfume-y than I remember, but I also don&#x27;t want to say that&#x27;s a certainty because I haven&#x27;t smelled it for nearly twenty years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I can&#x27;t stay with absolute certainty that it is, without a doubt, the same scent I wore twenty years ago, sold and made and packaged by the same people as back then. But, I think this is a safe purchase to make and it seems to be the original scent (or as close to it) as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> I love tHis fragrance and it is not sold in regular stores except during some holiday seasons (Mother&#x27;s Day comes to mind). Thank you for the good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not someone who typically like Vanilla, but this one, Vanilla Fields is different. Not only to me, but to people around me that feel the same way about Vanilla scents. Problem I have now is that I can no longer find it locally. Glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried to switch to something else and I still come back to wanting this one. The first time I tried it was out of desperation when my Gloria Vanderbilt was no longer being made. These have been my favorite for years. So, I guess you can draw your conclusion from that if Vanilla Fields will work for you!</li>
    <li> Have been using this cologne for a number of years and I still get compliments on how good I smell when using it.  Guess it&#x27;s  keeper!</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive perfume, this is such a nice one. Warm vanilla scent, (smells strong at first but fades). Everyone that smells it, loves it. Great for a drugstore perfume.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume when I was about 25 years younger so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  A little heavier than I remember but still has that nice grassy / vanilla scent that I was so fond of.  I am not mistaken, the bottle is the same as well.</li>
    <li> smells good - long lasting</li>
    <li> I have perfumes from 10$ to 300$…this is still one of the most versatile. I love it. it wears well, and smells rich and classy.I love itin summer, and winter.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume!  When you find a product you like, you just keep using it year after year and don&#x27;t change!</li>
    <li> It smells better than I thought it would - with a definite vanilla scent.  There&#x27;s a man I hope to keep interested in me and they say men love the smell of vanilla so it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful, soothing aroma...absolutely love this fragrance and glad to be able to easily find it!</li>
