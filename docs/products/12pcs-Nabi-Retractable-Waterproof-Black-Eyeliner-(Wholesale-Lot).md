<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for me and perfect for gifting.</li>
    <li> I have Asian eyes and my eye lids fold, the crease of my eye lid always gets eyeliner smeared on it.&lt;br /&gt;Putting this eyeliner on my lower eyes (water line) gets all on my under eyes. Doesn&#x27;t stay on well AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;NO ME GUSTA. don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Pencils are not waterproof</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with these. We are all being ripped off. Buy these instead, and maybe thwart the big corporations a little bit.</li>
    <li> Great quality, very creamy and glides on smooth.</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you pay for...says its waterproff but I have to apply it too often to be waterproff...i have to go over and over my eye to get it to go on completely...just not for me</li>
    <li> Not working for me. The crayon is not soft and supple. I have to press quite harshly on my eyelid for the crayon to begin leaving it&#x27;s mark. Not pleased at all with the quality of the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Great great great product from Nabi</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner! Grab this deal while you can!</li>
    <li> these really are a great deal! its the same crap you would buy at a drug store for 1/12th the price!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Smudges really bad and not waterproof at all.</li>
    <li> Love these eyeliners. They work great for me. I kept some and shared some with friends.</li>
    <li> Compared these to the Loreal eyeliner, almost identical.  Pricing is the difference.  These go on  smooth and last longer than other brands.  I will repurchase these!  My teen daughter also really likes them.</li>
    <li> great for the price, but may have to be re-applied during the day/</li>
    <li> Love these! What a great deal - 12 pieces, and for such a great price! Hard to make a sharp cateye with these, but they&#x27;re great for a regular lining, a small accent in the corner and the waterline. Stays on well, even through a shower. Glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always running out of eyeliner and then I found this one day and thought I would try it. I&#x27;m in love. I love that it comes with 12 so I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon. They don&#x27;t run down fast, the quality is dark and amazing. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> will order again great product</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this product when I did. I tend to only buy eyeliner one piece at a time. Thanks to Nabi and this 12 piece product I WILL NOT have to buy eyeliner for at least a year. I had never heard of the brand before, so I knew going into this purchase that I was taking a risk. I am so glad I took that risk because it actually works better to me than all of the other brands of eyeliner I have used such as Avon and Maybelline to name a few. I love that it goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;m hoping that with me getting contacts again soon that the two don&#x27;t counteract each other. We shall see. I hope once I run out of this product that I am able to find this amazing deal on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Not waterproof like the description stated, but good enough for the price.</li>
    <li> 12 eyeliners for the price of 1 or 2.</li>
    <li> These are not great.. at all. I regret buying. I gave most of them to my buddy who wears black lipstick often and needed a good lip liner. They aren&#x27;t stable at all on the eye-- the pigmentation is grayish and not deep cosmic black like I was hoping, and after TWO HOURS it was completely gone off my eye, although I had been wearing primer + Ben Nye set spray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product if you&#x27;re a person who likes wearing a lot of rich black eyeliner. Invest your money in a Kohl Kajal by Physicians Formula, Rimmel London, etc. Scandal eyes is the best.</li>
    <li> these are horrible, the eyeliner does not stay on long, you have to reapply several times a day.</li>
    <li> This came in on time and all 12 were there. I just find that it wears off easily. But overall, I like the eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner! good if you&#x27;re looking for an eyeliner that stays all day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice but not waterproof as stated here.</li>
    <li> It does smear under the eye when applied under the top eye lash. This is disappointing as I thought water proof meant it would not do that.</li>
    <li> Love them! Such a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> So far...they look wonderful, but I cannot give an honest critique because we had not opened them.</li>
    <li> I want to buy more but is out of stock so I am sad hope to get it back. I love this product.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy these . not water poof and it gets on your eye lids throughout the day ........ seriously take that ten dollars and use it twords better quality eyeliner</li>
    <li> I was pleased, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product!! Smooth application, though don&#x27;t leave in a hot place (like your car on a hot day) because if you go to apply it, it&#x27;s too soft and breaks off in clumps. Otherwise at room temp, smooth glide on. Twist extension. and Can&#x27;t beat the price. I only need to apply more than once if I happen to rub my eyes (allergies or contact irritation). GREAT  INVESTMENT</li>
    <li> NOT SO WATERPROOF...:(</li>
    <li> It goes on smooth. But it isnt water proof.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is awesome !! It got delivered in two days and its very good material definitely buy this</li>
    <li> My girlfriend love&#x27;s this and they where such a good deal.</li>
    <li> This product I wouldn&#x27;t buy again for the simple fact it takes forever to get a dark line on your waterline unless you put it over the top of some other liner. This product is more like a touch up eyeliner vs. an eyeliner you would initially apply first.</li>
    <li> 0 stars,  Made in china.  Eyes watered, hurt, was not sure why at first. Then after 3-7 days use my eyes burning, red. Blurred vision.  I realized it started when i started wearing this eye liner.  I stopped and after a week my eyes felt better. Not sure if permanent damage due to use of this product. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING FROM CHINA NEAR YOUR EYES, FACE, SKIN, ETC.  Amazon good to give me refund but still sells product.  Boooooo</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; the price is amazing!!</li>
    <li> Great product--really good price</li>
    <li> I just got them today and I was very pleased when I did in fact receive 12 pencils. They are exactly as pictured and are an amazing quality. I use them for my eyebrows, so they must be able to go on quickly and easily, without hurting, and this is exactly what they did. I would suggest these to anyone who wants retractable eyeliner pencils.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shipped early great quality and great price will buy again!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this product because of some reviews but I decided to do so based on the quantity and price.&lt;br /&gt;I am posting on my brief experience as I got these today and immediately tried them out and after about maybe 3 or so hours I still have not had to reapply the eyeliner. They are a deep black and went on smooth as well.&lt;br /&gt; For a little bit more for one eyeliner in stores I got 12 eyeliner pencils for the same quality, Usually I buy Revlon brand eyeliner. these are also retractable and were packaged nicely. They arrived a day earlier than expected.</li>
    <li> i am very excited to try this i haven&#x27;t tired it yet but i will keep you guys posted when i do which will be this weekend. i just had to write a little review on how fast and early my package came thank you guys and i will keep you posted as i mentioned already lol</li>
    <li> Not waterproof or smudge proof. Just take the money and invest it into Anastasia Beverly hill cream eyeliner. No smudging and water proof. Lasts all day too.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality in my opinion! They are all shipped and nicely protected and they don&#x27;t smear! Love it!! I recommend this for eyeliner lovers like myself !</li>
    <li> These go on really smooth.  I was very happy with them and they are a great price.  Nice black color.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and easy..will last thru a shower even when washing your eyes and mascara off..i was pleased, and use them daily</li>
    <li> great price for 12 liners ....they are black (love the color) easy and smooth to apply, it says that they are waterproof but liners are not waterproof and  would have to reapply  occasionally trough out the day they are a better liners for the same price</li>
    <li> Bought 48 pieces to put in a group of middle school aged girls&#x27; Christmas stockings.  The liners were very popular.</li>
    <li> I gave it 5 stars because you get TWELVE pieces for a GREAT price and it goes on nicely and I only have to reapply once during the day.</li>
    <li> step daughter loves it - felt that this was a good value</li>
    <li> JUST OPENED IT NOW. IT SEEMS TO BE OKAY. DELIVERED ON TIME.</li>
    <li> not waterproof im fine with that i figured as much after reading reviews. i always use plain black eyeliner twist up pencils. so really you cant beat this price only opened a few to check and used maybe 2 so far but amazing deal. must have if your like me and spend 6-9 dollars on just one from the store GL</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I rarely review anything but I was incredibly pleased with the quality and pricing of this eyeliner. I have tried many different brands of retractable, waterproof eyeliners (sephora brand, urban decay, Christian Dior, and many others) and this one is just as good if not better. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this eyeliner.  It is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; your eye when applying.  Also, you do not have to worry about sharpening the pencil itself.</li>
    <li> Great buy...I really love this product I used to buy expensive products like Lancôme.I bought this for my niece but got curious and tried it!I ended up using it and loving it! No need to sharpen very convenient and it stays in your eyes. I am highly recommending this! I bought the 24 pieces again for my nieces because I really love this..</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy eyeliner again - I thought these were going to be really cheap and wear off easily, but I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!  Perfect and inexpensive solution to eyeliner - love these!</li>
    <li> You advertise your eye pencil as being waterproof and it is not it rubs right off. Very dissatisfied with your product</li>
    <li> This product is easily smudged, so it&#x27;s not worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Super cheap, but I keep them around just in case I forget to put liner on</li>
    <li> not so black as I expected, but it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> For the price, the product is good quality. It does smudge a little but a good primer base definitely works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love these...colors soft to draw and they are stay almost all day long.</li>
    <li> Great value, would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not so good. Doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> When you consider the price of these, the quality is actually fantastic. They do smudge a little at the corners of the eyes, but it&#x27;s generally expected with cheaper eyeliner. It goes on smoothly and dark, and lasts a long time. Definitely comparable to more expensive eyeliners.</li>
    <li> last long, flexible and so so easy to use. the fact that you get so many makes this that much more fun and worth the price</li>
    <li> Love love love!!!  I am a huge eyeliner person and for someone who wears it alot sure spends alot of money on good eyeliner. Thought i would try a cheaper way to save me from spending $12+ on one single eyeliner every time and ordered this 12 piece set. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. I save so much and it works amazing.  ♡</li>
    <li> very soft to apply on my face, and leaves the black eyes really ...</li>
    <li> The eyeliner is a good dark black and easy to apply (creamy).  The only bad thing - it is NOT smear-proof or water-proof.  After an 8 hour day of work, the liner will smear.  If you touch/wipe your eyes, the liner will come off.</li>
    <li> Definitely not water proof. But a good buy if u run out or lose them constantly</li>
    <li> Stays on for a long time I can wear it for two days and great price love it will buy more when I run out will be about a year</li>
    <li> Awesome for the price. It kind of smears a bit, but it&#x27;s manageable. I wish they had built in sharpeners cause the stubs the tips become make it a little more difficult to do winged eyeliner.</li>
    <li> CHEAP AND NOT WATERPROOF-WILL GO BACK TO MAC</li>
    <li> What an awesome deal for a daily eyeliner user.  Goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeliner. Goes on very smooth and lasts a good amount of time. It is a good, dark black liner and does not clump very much. I don&#x27;t feel that it is really waterproof, but that is fine with me. I like to be able to wash it off at the end of the day. I highly recommend for anyone who uses a lot of eyeliner on the upper eyelids</li>
    <li> SO SMOOTH!!! Works sooo good! Worth every penny.. Doesnt really dull fast, either.. stays on decent, also. would recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly, stays on pretty well, and an unbelievable price.</li>
    <li> The liners go on smooth and are very long lasting! For the price, a very nice eye pencil!</li>
    <li> The pigment is not that black and it&#x27;s suppose to be waterproof and eyeliner comes off</li>
    <li> Great deal. Great eye liner. Hard to remove tho even with coconut oil</li>
    <li> No good it gets all over your face it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
    <li> I was a nervous after reading reviews however I tried anyway because I go through black eyeliner and when I wear black eye liner I like it to go on smooth and be very dark and these are perfect for that! Ladies you can&#x27;t beat this price an lets be real you could just buythis one and not spend a dollar on another eyeliner for a year if not longer lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok i guess, but it&#x27;s not waterproof and it&#x27;s definately not smudge proof.</li>
    <li> Great products works great</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about you guys but I&#x27;m an opportunist, I see a pack of 12 eyeliners for that price and I just go crazy. These came yesterday, it isn&#x27;t the best you&#x27;ll have , but it is the best you will have for that price. They are all I wanted, honestly. The only thing is I dont know if they&#x27;re waterproof or not, I think I&#x27;mma have to put this one to test.</li>
    <li> AMAZING DEAL! YOU MUST BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> These are fabulous, even for my sensitive eyes!  Color really stays. Great price!!</li>
    <li> good smooth eyeliner that does last all day and can be smudged to create that smokey eye look.</li>
    <li> I really had nothing to lose buying these; as I have prime with free returns and these were basically 12 for the price of 1. and I am always interested in new brands of black eyeliner. I&#x27;ve only worn it for one day, but it goes on extremely smooth, stays well, but of course.. As eyeliner always does.. It&#x27;s somewhat smudges  and goes into the corner of my eye. Could be worse. That&#x27;s to be expected and basically unavoidable when you wear eyeliner! so yeah, I am extremely happy with this purchase. This 12 pack will last over a year I&#x27;m sure. I may buy another just because it&#x27;s such an unbelievable bargain. thank you so very much. Awesome buy. 👍 I would recommend to anyone. I am not a fan of liquid eyeliner for many reasons.. one reason being that I live in Florida and it is extremely hot and humid, so the constant humidity makes applying and maintaining liquid eyeliner a joke. You look like a raccoon within seconds. And traditional pencils tend to be quite harsh on that delicate skin. So this is a very happy medium. This is my favorite form of eyeliner. again, THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> These work fantastically.....just as good as my previous (much more expensive) Sephora eyeliner. Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought these cause I absolutely loved the regular pencil liners. These retractable ones don&#x27;t glide as easily and the pigmentation isn&#x27;t as dark as I&#x27;d prefer. Didn&#x27;t particularly like this product but have been pretty satisfied with other Nabi purchases.</li>
    <li> Bought these for stocking stuffers it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
    <li> I liked the product very much, it&#x27;s a good quality and the price is amazing.</li>
    <li> Came on time and you get alot for a nice price. They work great, I won&#x27;t have to keep going out to buy new eyeliners.</li>
    <li> Recieved in the mail fast and on time! Also works amazing! Its really dark ! :)</li>
    <li> I was very impress didnt&#x27; blur my eyes, stay and glide on gently my sisters and friends love it , I would like any  other colours you may have and any other makeup in inventory, I will also be interested in wholesale pricing thank you great product.</li>
    <li> It smudges if you have oily skin. Make sure to check your eyes hourly if you want to look clean.</li>
    <li> They worked great thanks!</li>
    <li> I have not received my Item yet it was supposed to come last Friday and has failed to do so... But I&#x27;m sure the product works well</li>
    <li> Awesome value and product! This eyeliner is well worth the price . I bought it for my 2 teenage daughters . They both said it goes on smooth and stays on .</li>
    <li> Wow - so these are great.  I bought thinking they would work for a back up or just to throw in the gym bag for extra, but actually using these everyday.  Very comparable to my Maybelline Unstoppable eyeliner.  cant beleive I got 12 eyeliners for the price!</li>
    <li> This are undoubtedly the best eye pencils I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve tried them all!</li>
    <li> These are okay. They don&#x27;t go on as black as some eyeliners but all in all they are fine.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product. Im really happy with this eyeliner. It goes on easy, the price is great and its really dark in color. The only thing thats a negative is its not waterproof.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my eyes tear. Excellent bargain. Some smudging noticed while wearing it but I will buy again as long as they keep this deal going on.</li>
    <li> i do not like it. it smear all over my eyes.</li>
    <li> A superb value for the money.  Doesn&#x27;t run, and is easy to apply</li>
    <li> good color but not easy to draw straight line.</li>
    <li> Received wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this eyeliner pack&lt;br /&gt;I received 6 bottles of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;:| although the nail polish is AWESOME I&#x27;m so mad I didn&#x27;t get my EYE LINER.</li>
    <li> I love it love it love it! I got it really fast also.</li>
    <li> For a while I was reluctant to believe that I could get this many eye liners for such a nice price. I thought there had to be a catch. But after receiving them and using them now for a while, I am pleasantly surprised. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great value and applies on well!</li>
    <li> I took a chance buying a line I&#x27;ve never heard of because the price was just so good...even if they weren&#x27;t good, it was so cheap I wouldn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so surprised! These are great! They glide on, are long wearing, don&#x27;t transfer and are a vivid black. I feel like I discovered this hidden gem. I ordered another 12 and have been giving them away as presents.</li>
    <li> Love this eyeliner! it glides on super easy and i can retract the liner so that it doesnt break or smoosh. and you cant beat a 12 pack for that price!</li>
    <li> I DO NOT like pencil eyeliner because when I sharpen it sometimes the lose residual shavings get into my eye and irritate it. The retractable pencil does away with that! it is less messy, WAY more convenient (no need to carry a sharpener around), and the color is bold. I don&#x27;t like soft black. I really like the strong &amp;#34;blackest black&amp;#34;, as some other makeup brands call it. This item definitely delivers awesome color. It does smudge over time, but when applied over primer it usually stays in place.</li>
    <li> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BAD PRODUCT. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  WARNING: False advertisement. This product is NOT WATERPROOF in any means. This eye liner smears as soon as I apply it and blink a few times. I use an eye shadow base cream and apply my eye shadow even before applying the eye liner, but because this is such a poor product, it DOES NOT STAY ON at ALL! I would give a negative star rating if I could.    I even reached out to the seller to remedy this concern I had, but all they said was to return the product. While this would be a feasible option if the shipping charge will not cost me about the same amount as I had paid for the product...regardless, I would not trust this seller to appropriately acknowledge receipt of this product even if I had decided to ship it back for a refund.    I know that in general, you really get what you pay for, but I have received several fantastic products from other vendors at discounted rates. This is definitely not one of them.</li>
    <li> Love my Nabi eyeliners they dont smudge or run at the corner of my eye like my other eyeliner does and it stays on and doesnt fade!!!</li>
    <li> Product is great. Arrived on time</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy more!! this is the greatest deal especially for the quality! fast shipping and cant wait to by some more!!:)</li>
    <li> I order this product and i was told i was gonna get it in July well i got it sooner then July. I got this product a few days after i ordered it. I love this product i will always keep buying it.</li>
    <li> So beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And thank you for the gift&lt;br /&gt;And cooperation</li>
    <li> Nice eyeliner and a good price.  Although I did not find it to be waterproof.</li>
    <li> i put make up on everyday and these eyeliners are amazing.</li>
    <li> The product wasn&#x27;t waterproof and it smudged right away. It was not worth it. I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price.  Doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge.</li>
    <li> Product glides on smoothly. However, it smudges.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found these sooner! They are excellent. They work just as good as the ones that cost $8 each.  Huge savings!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Im very pleased with my purchase. It goes on so smooth and im amazed that it doesnt dull quickly like other liners do. I&#x27;ve bought many things from lipliners to lipsticks from Nabi Cosmetics and will continue purchasing from them. Great price! Great product!</li>
    <li> Awesome!  This is like a 2 year supply for me lol I have given half of them away and still have 5 left....5 months later!</li>
    <li> I like this eyeliner, surprisingly. My only problem with it is that it is not self sharpening. Other than that, it works well. I just gave one to my coworker because she asked what eyeliner I was using. She said it always looked nice so I do appreciate that!</li>
    <li> I like the product but it is not waterproof</li>
    <li> Stays on.  Glides smoothly.  Good product.</li>
    <li> Great price! Works well and stays on all day. Easy to apply and good bang for the buck!  Delivery was quick and on time!</li>
    <li> Decent delivery time, reasonable price, great product.</li>
    <li> My name is Nabi. So duh I love this set. I bought the pack and distributed for my friends so they would remember me when doing their eye makeup lol. So far they all have good things to say. I&#x27;ve tried it myself of course but I don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as my Urban Decay eyeliner. This is however infinitely cheaper than Urban Decay and it does glide on really well when you initially put it on.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I use eye liner a lot these work great and go on smooth. They last a long time also. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It has some color &amp; does not stay on the water line even though it is waterproof</li>
    <li> Received wrong item had to get a refund.</li>
    <li> Excellent condition, and an excellent product!</li>
    <li> This was good for the price.  As far as quality goes the pencil goes on real smooth however it does tend to smudge by middle of the day.</li>
    <li> It lies pretty smoothly on your eye. You can wash it with soap and water (if you do it few times), and unfortunately, it smudges during the day, but not too much. Overall, good for the money you pay!</li>
    <li> It says retractable but its not. They&#x27;re the kind you have to sharpen. Not really happy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I would even set them with a black eye shadow but by the time I got to my car, it was already smudging. There are so many better products at similar price points that I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Might work for others, but very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I was actually super amazed at how well these worked! They&#x27;re a deep black and very smooth. I absolutely love that I could stock up on them, as my black eyeliner is an essential part of my everyday makeup. One of those things, that if you&#x27;re like me, you can&#x27;t have enough of.</li>
