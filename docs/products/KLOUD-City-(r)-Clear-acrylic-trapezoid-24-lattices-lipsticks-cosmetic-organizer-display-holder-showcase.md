      <li>Nice piece.</li>
      <li>I made sure that out of my collection  of about 200 lip products (glosses, lipsticks, lip balms) that it has the ability to fit any size of them!!</li>
      <li>Good concept, cheaply made.  </li>
      <li>The seller refunded me right away, which was great.  </li>

      <li>Its very cheap, anyway.</li>
      <li>Its very cheaply made, the glue that was used did not hold.</li>
      <li>Like others report, this is a PERFECT fit for the classic MAC lippies--it holds them label up, unpackaged, OR even in their original boxes!</li>
      <li>Love the steps of it.</li>
      <li>the 24 case wasn&#x27;t enough but it fits perfect on top of my Muji acrylic makeup drawers.</li>

      <li>I love this lipstick organizer.</li>
      <li>I love the way my lipstick collection looks now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lipstick stay in place and the clear acrylic is beautiful...</li>
      <li>I also brought a second one to display my mascara, they fit perfect also.</li>
      <li>the return process, but if scratched or cloudy acrylic bothers ya, do know that mine was packaged quite securely; the issue appears more as a result from the manufacturing process, not shipping or handling.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fine but bummed that it broke.</li>
      <li>My MAC black bullet lipsticks as well as my Chanel lipsticks, fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>listed dimensions are accurate; I pulled out the ole tape measure to verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>The package was secure but the container  did break during shipment.</li>
      <li>It is a cheaply made product.  </li>
      <li>Very nice lipstick organizer, my only problem is the space itself.  </li>
      <li>wall mount option would have been awesome since I have a small vanity and prefer to utilize wall space.</li>
      <li>(The remainder  of my collection from Covergirl to Shu Uemura and beyond was a no-go.)all mount option would have been awesome since I have a small vanity and prefer to utilize wall space.</li>
      <li>First off, I love Amazon Prime..</li>
      <li>I mainly bought this to store my MAC lipsticks (upside down to see the labels), and they fit perfectly in this!  </li>
      <li>The item is a cool idea</li>
      <li>Well, i mean it was a great product that really did its job in order to qualify what I think good to be</li>
      <li>I super glued it together</li>
      <li>Inside, the item was SUPER DUPER wrapped in plastic and saran wrap-like material, along with tape.</li>
      <li>Thank you for getting this resolved so quickly.</li>
      <li>Inside, the item was SUPER DUPER wrapped in plastic and saran wrap-like material, along with tape.</li>
      <li>It would have been cool if they&#x27;d raised the lip higher for each tier so as to prevent wobbling of taller tubes.</li>
      <li>if you have mainly one of the types that don&#x27;t fit, might want to continue looking.</li>
      <li>But the graduated tiers make selecting the shade of the day an absolute breeze; any organization junkie--should they own a collection that actually fits in the slots--</li>
      <li>was my Dior lipsticks which does not fit in the whole, other than that they all fit perfect.</li>
      <li>Thanks makers!</li>
      <li>I take 1 star away because the bottoms fell out pretty soon after I got it.</li>
      <li>I decided that I needed to order a second one :).</li>
      <li>/&gt;In mine, some of the compartments are a tiny bit bigger(you can&#x27;t really see it), so I was able to jam in my Buxom lip creams too!&lt;br /&gt;Great sturdy product, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This item allows me to display my lipsticks in a very organized manner.</li>
      <li>and it holds lipsticks really well, when it is together.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t have that much lipstick like my wife&lt;</li>
      <li>, it is so easy to see all my items, the only thing is mine came a bit lopsided but not bad enough to return it.</li>
      <li>But I am abel to use it, I have other lippes that fit right on in.</li>
      <li>I called Amazon and they told me to send it back for a full refund.  </li>

      <li>Rimmel, the classic tube; NARS, both their rectangle packaging and the slim tube sheers &amp; mattes; Tarte Lipsurgence.</li>
      <li>The slots need to be bigger or adjustable for this to be useful.</li>
      <li>, I got a 60 and a 18 ones and they are thicker and better quality, I wouldnt recommend to waste your money in this one...</li>
      <li>Most of my lipsticks will not fit in these slots.  </li>
      <li>The seller of this was good, the item poor.</li>
      <li>the compartments needed to be high enough so I would be able to place my MAC lipsticks upside down to see the name- and still have it stand straight and</li>

      <li>* other brands that DO fit:</li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re willing to literally measure each lipstick prior to ordering, you may be disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And the slots seem to small for many of my lipsticks.</li>
      <li>the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was cause I hot glue gunned  it so it can stay in one piece but never again will I buy from this seller</li>
      <li>And the slots seem to small for many of my lipsticks.</li>
      <li>I am thinking of buying 2 more actually to store my other lipsticks and lip</li>
      <li>I use frequently!  </li>
      <li>If buying as a gift, note this arrives UNBOXED; the cleaning cloth &amp; holder are bubbled wrapped together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this primarily to house my collection of MAC black bullets.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, it was for my black bullets</li>
      <li>Instead of sending it back I tried to super glue it like a puzzle and now it is a HOT MESS.</li>
      <li>This clear acrylic trapezoid is what I needed for my lipsticks and lip glosses, however it is not made well.  </li>
      <li>I love the idea of a product to put all my lipsticks in and be able to view them all at the same time, BUT unfortunately, all lipstick cases are not the same size.  </li>
      <li>I super glued them back on, but this thing is clearly not well made.</li>
      <li>One of my MAC lipsticks won&#x27;t fit and its the new mineral lipstick, the tube is too wide so be careful.</li>
      <li>It looks really sleek on my counter, and the acrylic feels very sturdy and like it will last a very long while.  </li>
      <li>etc fit in this perfectly, it is deep enough where the products don&#x27;t fall all over each other and the way it it tiered</li>
      <li>but it turned out to be a mess and no longer pretty clear acrylic with my glue all over it.  </li>
      <li>However, an overwhelming percentage of my other lipsticks do NOT fit.</li>
      <li>I received this item in pieces because apparently the glue disintegrated and the pieces were not held together any longer.  </li>
      <li>I recently ordered a different item and it is really thick acrylic and made 150% better than this.  </li>

    <li> The item is a cool idea but when I received it, the right side was broken off.  Seems like a hassle to return it.  It is a cheaply made product.  Will never order from this company again.</li>
    <li> The same day I got it started to falling apart and I didnt even get the chance to even put my lipsticks, I got a 60 and a 18 ones and they are thicker and better quality, I wouldnt recommend to waste your money in this one... Sorry</li>
    <li> Horrible! Do  not buy it. Most of my lipstick are Covergirl Lip Perfection Lipstick and it does not fit any of them, I wasted money!! I&#x27;m so disappointed!! My NYX lipstick also does not fit. My Avon lipstick also does not fit! hate it! Too small cube!</li>
    <li> I can find my lipstick now. Love the steps of it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this container to store my lipstick products. The package was secure but the container  did break during shipment. I would recommend if you can to purchase items like this as an in store purchase.</li>
    <li> bought this for my wife so she can stop losing her lipsticks. I will buy another one! Thanks makers! dd</li>
    <li> It looks like this is one solid unit but it is not.  Three of the bottom plastic pieces which hold the lipsticks in place fell off inexplicably after light use.  I super glued them back on, but this thing is clearly not well made.</li>
    <li> Hello my fellow lipstick lovers! If you have as many lipsticks as I do. This is great just as great as the muji boards are.&lt;br /&gt;I have 2,and will need a third soon. The bottom though,sadly came off but since its sitting on my vanity that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> I take 1 star away because the bottoms fell out pretty soon after I got it. I super glued it together and it&#x27;s fine but bummed that it broke.</li>
    <li> Well, i mean it was a great product that really did its job in order to qualify what I think good to be</li>
    <li> I like it! I like being able to see ALL of my options when I&#x27;m putting my makeup on! Awesome buy</li>
    <li> I was looking for something like this to store my lipsticks in- the compartments needed to be high enough so I would be able to place my MAC lipsticks upside down to see the name- and still have it stand straight and not tilted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In mine, some of the compartments are a tiny bit bigger(you can&#x27;t really see it), so I was able to jam in my Buxom lip creams too!&lt;br /&gt;Great sturdy product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My wife like this. If you don&#x27;t have that much lipstick like my wife&lt;br /&gt;then this will be a nice one for you girls out there</li>
    <li> Very nice lipstick organizer, my only problem is the space itself.  Some of my lipstick have no room at all inside this container so I ended up putting whatever lipstick fitted in.</li>
    <li> First off, I love Amazon Prime.. Ordered 2 days ago and received it already!!!  The lipstick holder came packaged very securely with loads of bubble wrap.  There was absolutely no way this would have broken even if the box was thrown and tossed around harshly.  I mainly bought this to store my MAC lipsticks (upside down to see the labels), and they fit perfectly in this!  I won&#x27;t have to go searching in an overfilled drawer now to find that perfect lipstick to match my outfit!  I am thinking of buying 2 more actually to store my other lipsticks and lip glosses I use frequently!  It looks really sleek on my counter, and the acrylic feels very sturdy and like it will last a very long while.  Overall, a very good product for a great price!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this.. I made sure that out of my collection  of about 200 lip products (glosses, lipsticks, lip balms) that it has the ability to fit any size of them!!</li>
    <li> I love it, it displays well, shows off my collection perfect. It fits both the round and square tubes of lipstick. I also brought a second one to display my mascara, they fit perfect also.</li>
    <li> I love the way my lipstick collection looks now. This item allows me to display my lipsticks in a very organized manner.</li>
    <li> When I received the item it was shrieked wrapped so tight thAt it was broken into pieces.  Not at all what I expected.</li>
    <li> This clear acrylic trapezoid is what I needed for my lipsticks and lip glosses, however it is not made well.  When I opened the box it was packaged tight and taped, but when I unwrapped it was in six different pieces.  I called Amazon and they told me to send it back for a full refund.  Instead of sending it back I tried to super glue it like a puzzle and now it is a HOT MESS.</li>
    <li> Unlike a previous reviewer, my holder didn&#x27;t arrive broken but it did arrived flawed. This is an inexpensive piece of clear acrylic, yet pricey enough that I was bummed when discovering it was marred in multiple spots. I didn&#x27;t want to mess w/the return process, but if scratched or cloudy acrylic bothers ya, do know that mine was packaged quite securely; the issue appears more as a result from the manufacturing process, not shipping or handling. If buying as a gift, note this arrives UNBOXED; the cleaning cloth &amp; holder are bubbled wrapped together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this primarily to house my collection of MAC black bullets. Like others report, this is a PERFECT fit for the classic MAC lippies--it holds them label up, unpackaged, OR even in their original boxes! However, an overwhelming percentage of my other lipsticks do NOT fit. Not even close. So when the description states to doublecheck the dimensions before purchase, they aren&#x27;t kidding. Unless you&#x27;re willing to literally measure each lipstick prior to ordering, you may be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The listed dimensions are accurate; I pulled out the ole tape measure to verify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s not much to look at, for convenience and space saving, this ultimately can&#x27;t be beat. I had previously been storing my lippies in various sandwich baggies, so yeah, anything would have been an improvement! But the graduated tiers make selecting the shade of the day an absolute breeze; any organization junkie--should they own a collection that actually fits in the slots--should be pleased as punch. The back tiers can be used for taller slim glosses and tubes. It would have been cool if they&#x27;d raised the lip higher for each tier so as to prevent wobbling of taller tubes. But each slot is identically sized, regardless of its level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this also might be a practical piece to store or separate little bitty items for craft projects; it could also work for body gems, lashes, glue, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A wall mount option would have been awesome since I have a small vanity and prefer to utilize wall space. But unless MAC decides to market their own display holders for lippie addicts, this shall work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* other brands that DO fit: Rimmel, the classic tube; NARS, both their rectangle packaging and the slim tube sheers &amp; mattes; Tarte Lipsurgence.

    <li> It arrived in a box. Inside, the item was SUPER DUPER wrapped in plastic and saran wrap-like material, along with tape. After cutting through it, you realize the person has packaged it so tight that the item arrives into 4 pieces. Its very cheap, anyway. And the slots seem to small for many of my lipsticks. Not worth the hassle at all....</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick organizer. I brought it for my Revlon Lip Butters, MAC Lipsticks and NYX lipgloss. It is also great to store my mascara and lip balms. I decided that I needed to order a second one :). One of my MAC lipsticks won&#x27;t fit and its the new mineral lipstick, the tube is too wide so be careful. I think that is the only negative I can think of with this organizer, but 1 out of 30 isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend ordering from this seller my item came broken :-/  the only reason I didn&#x27;t return it was cause I hot glue gunned  it so it can stay in one piece but never again will I buy from this seller</li>
    <li> I like it, nice and to the point. But I have lippies from Cover Girl Queen collection and Black Radiance that are some what bigger than the average size lipsticks. But I am abel to use it, I have other lippes that fit right on in.</li>
    <li> Purchased from this seller for the Prime shipping, but should have gotten it for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had it for 7 months and the bottom from each of the rows has come unglued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it knowing you will have to get another within a year.</li>
    <li> As soon as I unwrapped it, the front plastic piece fell off.  Good concept, cheaply made.  I did glue it together and use it afterwards and its been alright.</li>
    <li> Some of the sections seem to be a little different in size but it worked out great for what I wanted it for.</li>
    <li> I ordered one of these to see how it was and I am just amazed at how almost all my lipsticks/glosses/creams, etc fit in this perfectly, it is deep enough where the products don&#x27;t fall all over each other and the way it it tiered, it is so easy to see all my items, the only thing is mine came a bit lopsided but not bad enough to return it. I have all my m.a.c. lipglasses, lip sticks in there and some other names like Loreal, Chanel, Lorac,clinique,  maybelline, motives, NYX, revelon, Khroma, all of them fit in, the only one that did not fit was my Dior lipsticks which does not fit in the whole, other than that they all fit perfect. you can even put them upside down to tell what color it is.  I am definitely purchasing another one due to the fact that I have so much prodcut the 24 case wasn&#x27;t enough but it fits perfect on top of my Muji acrylic makeup drawers. so everything looks all perfect, uniformed and organized and it all matches, a must buy especially for the price. Plus it came with a cloth especially to clean the acrylic! I absolutely LOVE this product and it got here in like 2 days!</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly in my area. I have almost filled it up. I love how it goes up so I can see all of my lipsticks.</li>
    <li> I received this item in pieces because apparently the glue disintegrated and the pieces were not held together any longer.  I was highly disappointed because I looked forward to the product.  The seller refunded me right away, which was great.  I glued the pieces back together but it turned out to be a mess and no longer pretty clear acrylic with my glue all over it.  However, I do like the architecture of the piece and it holds lipsticks really well, when it is together.  The acrylic is extremely thin, however.  I recently ordered a different item and it is really thick acrylic and made 150% better than this.  The seller of this was good, the item poor.</li>
    <li> This is a nicely made, acrylic lipstick holders.  My MAC black bullet lipsticks as well as my Chanel lipsticks, fit perfectly.  However, the slots are too small for the MAC mineralized lipsticks in the magnetic packaging as well as YSL Lipsticks.  Fortunately, it was for my black bullets I needed it most, so ok for now . . .but if you have mainly one of the types that don&#x27;t fit, might want to continue looking.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of a product to put all my lipsticks in and be able to view them all at the same time, BUT unfortunately, all lipstick cases are not the same size.  Most of my lipsticks will not fit in these slots.  Dior, YSL, Givenchy will not fit.  The slots need to be bigger or adjustable for this to be useful.</li>
    <li> This product is crap. From the pic it looks great but that is not how I recieved the product. The shipping is very fast, the package was wrapped very tight. After cutting thru all the tape I finally get to the product. The person who packaged it wrapped the item very tight. It arrived in 4 pieces. Its very cheaply made, the glue that was used did not hold. The slots for the lipstick departments were very small and uneven. I just purchased some glue and glued the remaining 4 peices... Thank god for amazon fullfillment. The customer service was great and prompt. Due to the fact the seller&#x27;s inventory is constantly changing, a replacement product  could not be mailed out by Kloud, which I would not want a replacement item. They refunded my money and apologize for the inconvience. Thank you for getting this resolved so quickly.I will continue to purchase from amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in a box. Inside, the item was SUPER DUPER wrapped in plastic and saran wrap-like material, along with tape. After cutting through it, you realize the person has packaged it so tight that the item arrives into 4 pieces. Its very cheap, anyway. And the slots seem to small for many of my lipsticks. Not worth the hassle at all....</li>
    <li> Nice piece. Love it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick stay in place and the clear acrylic is beautiful...I think to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and in a good shape.&lt;br /&gt;:-D</li>
