      <li>The gel is okay</li>
      <li>I love all his products</li>
      <li>but this kit...seems nothing special.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a good kit</li>
      <li>the scrub is not bad ~</li>
      <li>As an aside, my facialist is a huge proponent of PTR products, which is why I started using them in the first place.</li>

      <li>worth every penny</li>
      <li>but might not be worth the cost, it&#x27;s up to you.  </li>
      <li>Not sure that I notice a huge difference, but its a good change of pace.</li>
      <li>My skin is so smooth and soft, it helps with all the problems of aging skin.  </li>
      <li>Love the serum but all together it leaves my skin too dry</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I do like Peter Thomas Roth products on the whole.</li>

      <li>I Love this stuff - wish the large sizes weren&#x27;t so expensive, but I&#x27;ll keep buying it - very good for skin that is getting dryer due to aging.</li>
      <li>The post describes the gel-cream as being 1 oz., but as delivered to me yesterday it is only 1/2 oz., which makes this less than the good deal it claims to be.</li>
      <li>but I am very sensitive.</li>
      <li>again, I noticed a clear difference in the look of my skin.  </li>
      <li>For the price point, this is spot on - also, I didn&#x27;t notice irritation, but I know that it does irritate some people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>As an avid wrinkle product user I have decided nothing works on wrinkles from the outside, but I definitely recommend this kit or these products if you are just looking for a healthier, brighter face.</li>
      <li>Deal, but the general effect</li>
      <li>my skin feels so soft after only one or two uses.</li>
      <li>I am combination skin, it caused a lit bit break out at the first few weeks to use.</li>
      <li>Have seen some fading in my dark spots, possibly from the serum but no dramatic difference noticed from it or the eye cream.</li>

<li> Have seen some fading in my dark spots, possibly from the serum but no dramatic difference noticed from it or the eye cream.</li>
<li> Is a little harsh for my skin in the dry winter, but other than that, I love it.</li>
<li> but not sure it moisturizes as much as I would like.</li>
<li> I use the eye serum religiously, day and night before eye cream and the other products for when I&#x27;m wearing full make-up because they double as a primer and having too many layers on the face can become not only uncomfortable but can look bad.</li>
<li> May be because I have really several chemical burn problem; I have white patches on my face, but the rest of my face &amp; neck is dark brown, so I was hoping the product would even it out for me, nothing happened!</li>
<li> It only took a few days to notice a difference.</li>
<li> Ended up having a laser facial away (a few lesions)</li>
<li> I bought this kit earlier in the year and noticed an immediate difference within a few weeks.  </li>
<li> but this product is making my skin softer, less lined and evening out the texture/color</li>
<li> My face has not felt this tight in years.</li>
<li> Be advised that the product description posted by Amazon is NOT accurate.  </li>
<li> Not sure I would buy this if I didn&#x27;t want a brightening set of products.</li>
<li> I literally will walk in the bathrooms at work with those horrible fluorescent lights and can see a huge difference.  </li>
<li> Within a few weeks of using the unwrinkle products my face looked worse!  </li>
<li> Sorry, it did not work for me at all.  </li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
<li> Disappointing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff really helps with my brown spots from the sun on my face. I especially like the under eye formula. The gel is okay but not sure it moisturizes as much as I would like. The mask is awesome! I will keep ordering these items for sure.</li>
    <li> Been using this set for a couple of months and am very pleased with the results. Ended up having a laser facial away (a few lesions) but this product is making my skin softer, less lined and evening out the texture/color even more-Love it!</li>
    <li> My face has not felt this tight in years. It really does make your skin feel refreshed.</li>
    <li> Peter Roth Thomas products are exceptional. Use several of his products. I would recommend this set to a friend. Like the unwrinkled products also.</li>
    <li> This is a great kit for skin that has a bit of damage. I would recommend it for people who may have had some sun damage. It doesn&#x27;t reverse it, but I noticed a brightening after using the products. Not sure I would buy this if I didn&#x27;t want a brightening set of products. PTR makes pretty great  products, and I would recommend this kit! As an aside, my facialist is a huge proponent of PTR products, which is why I started using them in the first place. For the price point, this is spot on - also, I didn&#x27;t notice irritation, but I know that it does irritate some people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love and use all four products in this kit great  Peter Roth Thomas products is very good for me</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of PTR....I have tried almost every product ....but this kit...seems nothing special. I am combination skin, it caused a lit bit break out at the first few weeks to use. If you are looking for some simply moisturizing ...this is a good choice...but if you are looking for something different....NOT THIS ONE.btw..the scrub is not bad ~</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Peter Thomas Roth products and thought this was a good deal--but the kit was described as including 1 oz of the gel cream and the kit I received included a 1/2 oz size.  Disappointing.  I would have purchased the items separately if I had known.</li>
    <li> All the products have a reddish tint.  After using at night I found my pillow stained.</li>
    <li> Be advised that the product description posted by Amazon is NOT accurate.  The post describes the gel-cream as being 1 oz., but as delivered to me yesterday it is only 1/2 oz., which makes this less than the good deal it claims to be.</li>
    <li> great product-good pricing. worth every penny</li>
    <li> I have to say.. I bought this kit earlier in the year and noticed an immediate difference within a few weeks.  So, I thought if this works, then I would give the unwrinkle line for Peter Thomas Roth a try.  Within a few weeks of using the unwrinkle products my face looked worse!  I switched back to this Laser Free Skin Resurfacing line and within 3 weeks, again, I noticed a clear difference in the look of my skin.  I literally will walk in the bathrooms at work with those horrible fluorescent lights and can see a huge difference.  No, no change in wrinkles, but just the brightness and healthiness looks great.  As an avid wrinkle product user I have decided nothing works on wrinkles from the outside, but I definitely recommend this kit or these products if you are just looking for a healthier, brighter face.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast. Product is excellent. my skin feels so soft after only one or two uses.</li>
    <li> So happy with the clarity of my skin! I did have a series of lazer treatments done. I turned to this to maintain the results. Not only does it maintain it, this kit surpasses it! PTR products have my loyalty</li>
    <li> My skin is so smooth and soft, it helps with all the problems of aging skin.  You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>

    <li> great stuff, possibly slightly allergic to it but I am very sensitive.</li>
    <li> The product came just as advertised.  I have just started using it so I cannot comment on the efficacy of the products. I do like Peter Thomas Roth products on the whole.</li>

    <li> Great product with poor packaging .&lt;br /&gt;In order to use the product has to break the container because the patent issuing cream does not work .&lt;br /&gt;Bad product .&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money !</li>
