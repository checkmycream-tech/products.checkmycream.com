    <li> Love this soap.  Will definitely order again.  Clean refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap!  It is a very good product.....a little pricey for hand soap.</li>
    <li> I love the fresh clean scent of the lavendar/pine. My favorite product is the wood furniture cream in this scent - actually motivated me to dust!  Unfortunately, they discontinued the creams. (I did write asking the company to bring it back.)  I keep the liquid hand soap at my kitchen sink - it briefly has a stronger scent than the cream does, so would not recommend it for someone who is highly sensitive to scents.  I do use and recommend the Caldrea products.</li>
    <li> I like the Caldrea liquid hand soaps - this is my third scent that I have and I love them all.  I even got the hand cream and air freshener with some of the scents.</li>
    <li> We ave been using this soap for probably at least 5 years.  I am usually very sensitive to scents snd perfumes but this one works well for me.  Love the smell.</li>
    <li> The product is the best ever without a doubt but $11.75 for shipping is insane!  I don&#x27;t recall seeing a choice for shipping.</li>
    <li> Super smelling soap. I use it in the kitchen and bathrooms at home at all times. Everyone compliments me for the clean  smell</li>
    <li> I have used Caldrea soaps for years. Love the smell of the lavender pine. I also use the dish soap</li>
    <li> I am crazy about the combination of these two scents.  I want my whole house to smell clean and lovely like this!</li>
    <li> A great hand soup  .. &amp; a great odor ..</li>
    <li> I own several products from Caldrea and I have tried a few different scents. I absolutely adore these products and I use them in any room that. needs hand soap. I have it in my kitchen for making sure that my hands not only get clean but that they don&#x27;t get to be \\&quot;dishpan hands.\\&quot;  I can easily recommend this product for any who may be hesitant.</li>
    <li> Love this product and hard to find in our area.</li>
    <li> Its great, but it should not be so expensive... It&#x27;s soap...  I beat more people would buy it, if it was slightly less expensive.</li>
    <li> Fast service.great product..smells clean..a little costly though! Saving it for when I have company. I also purchased the counter top cleaner (excellent!)</li>
    <li> Love the smell.  Not too piney or too much of a lavender smell.  Have used it for years and will continue.  Good soap for all dispensers.</li>
    <li> Smells a lot like pine-sol.</li>
    <li> Amaaaazing! I&#x27;m in love with the scent and texture of the soap. If you want an aromatic lift with an authentic forest smell each time you wash your hands, get this....also the dish wash is great too.</li>
    <li> Caldrea Products&lt;br /&gt;I have used many of these products and have never been disappointed with any one of them.  I always get the Lavender Pine&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  It smells so pleasant not over powering. People have asked me what kind of perfume I am wearing. The lotions make your skin so soft, you would have to try it to believe it.  I hope they never do away with my fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;L Reasy&lt;br /&gt;Seattle WA.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for years and love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Gentle and smells great. I recommend this product and the service was excellent as well .I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap.  Is what it is. My personal opinion.  My wife likes a different scent by the same brand.  Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> The hand soap has a pleasant scent but not overwhelming. You don&#x27;t need much each time you use it. Lasts a long time. Does not leave your hands dried out. I thought the price was a little high, but get what you pay for ...right. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
