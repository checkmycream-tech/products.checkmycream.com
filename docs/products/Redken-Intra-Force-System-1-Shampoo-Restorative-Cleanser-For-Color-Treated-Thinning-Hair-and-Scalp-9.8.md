      <li>Nice shampoo!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any promises made for \\&quot;Minoxidil\\&quot; type of regrowth from this product, but rather it gives your existing hair, scalp and roots a good fighting chance to become healthier and stronger while your hair appears thicker after styling.</li>

      <li>and I gave it an honest two weeks</li>

      <li>, after I shampoo this time i will know for sure that whether it strips the color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

      <li>This has been very helpful in order to maintain a good looking hairdo.</li>
      <li>first impression is that it does a very good job cleaning the scalp and leaving the heir soft and shinny</li>
      <li>fly away hair possible.</li>

      <li>, it helped my hair appear thicker while I recovered from that damage and my hair regrew very nicely where it was damaged (lots of obvious 4 month&#x27;s worth of regrowth now), and I believe it did stop further damage from color treatments since the initial incident.&lt;br</li>
      <li>it thank you so much</li>
      <li>But I am not losing as much hair as I was before.....</li>

      <li>I was lucky enough to have found it on Amazon for her.  </li>
      <li>to continue to protect my hair from fallout/breakage, but I also look forward to trying their new replacement line to the Intra Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo and the treatment system was recommended by my new stylist 4 months ago</li>
      <li>Not only did my hair loss drastically reduce, but lots of new hair is coming in.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out as much as the one I was using.</li>
      <li>Am now on my second bottle and still not sure if it is working as I use so many different products to stop the hair loss.....</li>
      <li>save me totally, my hair appears fuller and natural</li>

<li> What I like is that I only need to use a quarter size of each which is a lot less than other shampoos.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure how much the hair-regrowth has to do with the shampoo and what&#x27;s due to my body adjusting to the changes, but I recommend at least trying it if you have hair loss.  </li>

<li> Not sure if it helps, but no harm done, unless you don&#x27;t like the menthol feeling.  </li>
<li> Shampoo dried my hair out, even toner didn&#x27;t help!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m trying for long, thick tresses, but maybe that ship has sailed!!</li>
<li> However, hair is difficult to style and texture feels dry unless you also use the toner.</li>
<li> even though her hair is thick, she wanted to try it too.  </li>
<li> had a \\&quot;coloring disaster\\&quot; that caused a lot hair loss where clumps of my hair had broken off at the roots.</li>

    <li> I like the shampoo. Doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair out as much as the one I was using.</li>
    <li> great stuff.. for those who don&#x27;t want to play the rat race of traffic then order online and get it fast.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for colored thinning hair.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair definitely looks fuller and has more volume.  I will definitely continue to use this shampoo, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Shampoo dried my hair out, even toner didn&#x27;t help!</li>
    <li> Great seller and the product really works.  I don&#x27;t know about making my hair thicker but it has held my color in way passed the other shampoos...so now I get to go the salon only once during the Holiday season!</li>
    <li> Product arrived alittle late but the product itself has a great smell.I just started to use it so we will see if it does what it states.</li>
    <li> Am now on my second bottle and still not sure if it is working as I use so many different products to stop the hair loss.....But I am not losing as much hair as I was before.....Is not stripping color....</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my sister.  She swears by it.  Unfortunately, it has been discontinued by all local stores.  I was lucky enough to have found it on Amazon for her.  She said it makes her hair thicker, and she also likes the way it makes her hair feel.</li>
    <li> I had surgery about 10 months ago.  One of the side effects can be hair loss (temporary).  I tried many products, with no promising results until I tried this.  Not only did my hair loss drastically reduce, but lots of new hair is coming in.  I do agree with one of the reviewers that it causes &amp;#34;flyaway hair&amp;#34; but hey-at least I have hair that CAN fly away!  I&#x27;m not sure how much the hair-regrowth has to do with the shampoo and what&#x27;s due to my body adjusting to the changes, but I recommend at least trying it if you have hair loss.  It worked for me!</li>
    <li> The shampoo has a menthol ingredient that is supposed to stimulate the hair follicles.  Not sure if it helps, but no harm done, unless you don&#x27;t like the menthol feeling.  I keep my eyes closed tightly, as I would imagine the menthol could burn the eyes.  I will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> I guess I&#x27;m in the minority here but I do not like this shampoo at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every shampoo felt like my hair was left with some type of coating. Not only that but it gave me the worst fly away hair possible. My hair felt thinner when I used it. It looked thinner too. I really wanted to like this shampoo and I gave it an honest two weeks but it is what it is. I even tried mixing it with a  another shampoo that I like (ISO Colour Protect) in hopes of somehow still benefiting from the Intra Force&#x27;s ingredients (Zinc, Arginine etc) and I thought it would help to get rid of the fly away hair that the Intra Force always gave me but it didn&#x27;t help to mix it with anything either...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, it might work for some but for me, this shampoo is a DUD...</li>
    <li> Great product, arrived within a couple of days.</li>
    <li> first impression is that it does a very good job cleaning the scalp and leaving the heir soft and shinny</li>
    <li> Since using this product my hair feels healthier and fuller. However, hair is difficult to style and texture feels dry unless you also use the toner. What I like is that I only need to use a quarter size of each which is a lot less than other shampoos. I am very happy and will continue using.</li>
    <li> Works well and keeps color in and hair fuller</li>
    <li> Update 06.19.14:  My Redken salon let me know this week that the Intra Force line has indeed been discontinued and that Redken is shipping out a replacement product, likely on shelves by the end of the summer (my salon&#x27;s owner already has her samples but she&#x27;s not sharing with me LOL).  In the meantime I&#x27;m using Redken&#x27;s Magnetics line (very nice product btw!) to continue to protect my hair from fallout/breakage, but I also look forward to trying their new replacement line to the Intra Force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st Review:&lt;br /&gt;I had a \\&quot;coloring disaster\\&quot; that caused a lot hair loss where clumps of my hair had broken off at the roots. This shampoo and the treatment system was recommended by my new stylist 4 months ago and I have had very little further breakage/loss since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp feels great, it helped my hair appear thicker while I recovered from that damage and my hair regrew very nicely where it was damaged (lots of obvious 4 month&#x27;s worth of regrowth now), and I believe it did stop further damage from color treatments since the initial incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done a great job protecting my hair that survived while promoting stronger hair in the regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any promises made for \\&quot;Minoxidil\\&quot; type of regrowth from this product, but rather it gives your existing hair, scalp and roots a good fighting chance to become healthier and stronger while your hair appears thicker after styling.</li>
    <li> Guadalupe Waddell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It save me totally, my hair appears fuller and natural I love it thank you so much</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo along with the toner that Redkiins has for thinning hair. I works well for me and hair hair feels clean and soft and shines as well. Does help I think for the issues I have with the thyroid imbalance. I have ask my beautician to add it to her supplies. I was introduced to this product while on vacation by a beautician.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful in order to maintain a good looking hairdo.</li>
    <li> Product appears to have a lot of promise. I have only used four or five times but my hair already seems a little thicker hopefully this will continue.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  It does not seem to fad color-treated hair.  It has a nice, refreshing feel to it when shampooing.  It has a nice fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before but could only get thru a hair salon.  Nice to know I can get it thru Amazon plus its cheaper than thru a salon.</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo! This is supposed to help thinning hair, and perhaps it is. It works well, my color looks good, and hair is easy to style. Additionally, there seems to be less hair falling out in the shampoo. I have used Nioxin in the past with similar results. I&#x27;m trying for long, thick tresses, but maybe that ship has sailed!!</li>
    <li> My hair is thinning on top and you and see the scalp but with this shampoo it seemed to make it feel thicker on top and not separate. I do not use conditioner with it.  Just wish it was easier to find in a brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> Shampoo was shipped promptly and price was great.  This is a super product for persons with scalp issues.  I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Intra Force Shampoo for two years, it works well with the toner and treatment. I have the travel kit that I also take with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, oily hair.  I have been using this shampoo for about a month.  It really cleans my hair and it smells great, kind of minty.  It makes my hair feel fuller and my scalp feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I just came from visiting my hairdresser, she said that I didn&#x27;t have any split ends and my hair is fuller.  She said that she is going to start recommending this shampoo for her other customers that have my hair type.  She also said she is going to start using it too, even though her hair is thick, she wanted to try it too.  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo, along with the conditioner and toner, for about 3 months and I can really tell the difference in my hair and now after visiting my hairdresser, I know that it&#x27;s been working.</li>
    <li> i think that this and the cerafill are about the same.  Wish something worked permanently</li>
    <li> Well, I have used this shampoo seve&lt;br /&gt;ral times and my hair is shiny and appears so much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I just had my hair colored again soooooo, after I shampoo this time i will know for sure that whether it strips the color.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my son a bottle and he loves it.</li>
