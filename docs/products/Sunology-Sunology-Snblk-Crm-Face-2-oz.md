      <li>was concerned about the very best protection from the sun, and believe this one is it.</li>
      <li>I also love that there are no chemicals in the product!!!  </li>
      <li>Amazing!!</li>
      <li>The product is great but the expiration date was in 4 months of my purchase.</li>
      <li>The price was great, the shipping was fast and de the customer service was awesome.  </li>
      <li>Sunology is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
      <li>I really love it!</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s been 3 hours, and my arms are still kind of sticky and gummy feeling.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Sunolgy for faces and for the body with great success!  </li>
      <li>but then diss spears to give you a healthy glow</li>
      <li>This review is more about Amazon and the seller LA Closeout Warehouse than the product.</li>
      <li>-- the bottle is okay -- the manufacturer could work on that insignificant wrap but as for me it is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I checked the EWG ratings in its website looking for safe sunscreens, I bought Sunology</li>
      <li>make sure you distribute evenly on your face and neck.</li>
      <li>and I love it...</li>
      <li>Love this sunblock.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the results and have since ordered Sunology twice and look forward to it being offered in local stores.  </li>
      <li>He tried rubbing it in better to no avail.  </li>
      <li>I also liked that since I purchased them through amazon.com, my shipping was free.  </li>
      <li>However, I was also told by LA Closeout Warehouse that I could still use the product, but should make sure to shake the bottle well since this is a product free of chemical emulsifiers.</li>
      <li>I am happy to have to rub this sunscreen in a bit  more and even have a bit of a white hue when I am at the beach to avoid skin cancer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I will be a loyal user of this for years to come!</li>
      <li>I have huge problems with scented products.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is cheap.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is moisturizing and makeup goes on smoothly over it.</li>
      <li>I would, this product is chemical free and works on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Their sunblock for body has also been similarly reformulated and is also great -- haven&#x27;t yet used in pool.</li>
      <li>I too checked the EWG site as another poster had to search for a chemical free sunscreen.</li>
      <li>It is greasy at first, but as you rub it in, it becomes very smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>With Sunology, I have actually been able to obtain a nice, healthy tan for the first time.  </li>
      <li>And I had to wash my hands three times after applying Sunology, and they still didn&#x27;t get clean.  </li>
      <li>After much time checking the EWG ratings of safe sunscreens, I decided to try Sunology SPF50 for face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thankfully I was issued a full refund from FingerTip Shopper without having to go out of my way to return the product to sender.</li>
      <li>I did find with this product I do not have to apply it as often as other sunscreens and it gives me great protection.  </li>
      <li>Although I love the sun, it doesn&#x27;t always love me back...</li>
      <li>I am in the hot sun every day and have been lloking for a chemical free sunscreen that will not clog my pores and cause break-outs.  </li>
      <li>So now I am wondering what exactly was in that unsealed bottle!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind goes on light blue at first cause</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all which is amazing because it actually moisturizes my skin!!  </li>
      <li>great for a healthier sunblock, I use sunblock everyday</li>
      <li>product has recently been reformulated and works even better; no slight whiteness which eventually did disappear; stays put even better; even more moisturizing and softening but not greasy,sticky or powdery; non-irritating and no odor; no nasty chemicals listed; spreads easily and disappears quickly; packaging improved -- now in a sealed tube requiring no pre-shaking whereas before in a flat bottle (pictured above -- can&#x27;t say which formulation is actually being offered here now); blocks out sun even better; no added water to pay for -- concentrated -- can use as much as you want for really superior protection; as for mature, dry, sensitive skin -- GREAT!  </li>
      <li>I noticed this right away but decided to try the product anyway.</li>
      <li>Thank you so very much,</li>
      <li>but then it sinks in and feels amazing</li>
      <li>I have tried many products on my face only to break out in hives or blemishes.  </li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin as I do this is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>This is very greasy sunscreen, it sits on the skin like oil, the face is white (ok for physical sunscreens), the smell is very chemical and strong!</li>
      <li>Then a day later a huge area of rash.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to put to much but</li>
      <li>so you don&#x27;t have to use much and it does absorb into the skin much better than other products I have tried with zinc oxide.  </li>
      <li>I promise it isn&#x27;t worth looking pretty beneath your makeup with a chemical sunscreen only to die of skin cancer.</li>
      <li>stuff might be healthy and good for the environment, but it&#x27;s bad for me.  </li>
      <li>I purchased Sunology because it was highly recognized by the EWG as it contains &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; ingredients.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal texture.  </li>
      <li>on kind of thick</li>
      <li>I emailed Amazon and got my money back (at least the customer service was good).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks white at first</li>
      <li>I was asked what I used on my face by a complete stranger,  and It was Sunology!</li>
      <li>Now two weeks later it has spread to cover my full back , stomach, thighs.  </li>
      <li>Please make one large enough to use the body.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Even in being in my swimming pool for up to four hours, with just one application, I was protected, and my skin was soft afterwards.  </li>
      <li>Naturally, I had to work with the product to get it to the consistency it should be.</li>
      <li>I ordered Sunology after reviewing its&#x27; web-site and researching the internet for a natural product.</li>
      <li>it is natural</li>
      <li>Works well and is all natural.</li>
      <li>I hear really good reviews about it, but unfortunately, my skin did not tolerated.  </li>
      <li>My first purchase was for the body and found it was not for facial use, so I made a second purchase for the face cream.  </li>
      <li>This FACE cream is a fantastic product for the face, the best I have found; spf 50 without the nasty chemicals; very moisturizing -- great for dry and/or mature skin; leaves face feeling like silk; no odor and non-irritating unlike some formulas which claim to be non-irritating but are not; a great under-makeup moisturizer -- allows makeup to be spread over it easily; not sticky; also spreads on face easily; contents should be shaken at least before first use; since recently purchased have yet to see how it holds up in hot, sweaty weather; the green \\&quot;wrap\\&quot; on the white plastic bottle may appear torn or split</li>
      <li>He likes the way it goes on, however it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and once dry, his face has a whitish/bluish cast.  </li>
      <li>Finally, a natural sunscreen that does what is says it does, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized even after being in the sun for several hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this product on my shoulders, chest, neck, back, arms, and back of my legs.  I must have used it for about a week before I noticed a small patch of itchy spots. Then a day later a huge area of rash.  A few days later the rash was red, bumpy, and itchy on each area where I had put the sunscreen.  Now two weeks later it has spread to cover my full back , stomach, thighs.  It&#x27;s unbearable itchy and I&#x27;m up several times a night.  It&#x27;s also unsightly so I have to wear a long skirt and long sleeves, which is tough in 90+ degree weather.  So instead I&#x27;ve opted to stay inside for a week where at least I can walk around a short tube-top dress and air out this horrible rash in private.  I am so uncomfortable and miserable.  This product is AWFUL!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!  DO NOT PUT IT ON YOUR SKIN!!!! I saw another reviewer on Drugstore.com said she got a rash and other reviewers here got dermatitis.  I expect this product will be recalled soon!</li>
    <li> Too thick, thick, and greasy to use on your face. It says use sparingly, but it&#x27;s sunscreen; you can&#x27;t use it sparingly if you want protection from sunburn.</li>
    <li> This FACE cream is a fantastic product for the face, the best I have found; spf 50 without the nasty chemicals; very moisturizing -- great for dry and/or mature skin; leaves face feeling like silk; no odor and non-irritating unlike some formulas which claim to be non-irritating but are not; a great under-makeup moisturizer -- allows makeup to be spread over it easily; not sticky; also spreads on face easily; contents should be shaken at least before first use; since recently purchased have yet to see how it holds up in hot, sweaty weather; the green \\&quot;wrap\\&quot; on the white plastic bottle may appear torn or split but this is not an indication that it has been used -- the bottle is okay -- the manufacturer could work on that insignificant wrap but as for me it is a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/2012:  product has recently been reformulated and works even better; no slight whiteness which eventually did disappear; stays put even better; even more moisturizing and softening but not greasy,sticky or powdery; non-irritating and no odor; no nasty chemicals listed; spreads easily and disappears quickly; packaging improved -- now in a sealed tube requiring no pre-shaking whereas before in a flat bottle (pictured above -- can&#x27;t say which formulation is actually being offered here now); blocks out sun even better; no added water to pay for -- concentrated -- can use as much as you want for really superior protection; as for mature, dry, sensitive skin -- GREAT!  Their sunblock for body has also been similarly reformulated and is also great -- haven&#x27;t yet used in pool.</li>
    <li> This review is more about Amazon and the seller LA Closeout Warehouse than the product. I read on EWG about this sunscreen and thought I give it a try. However, the expiration date for the product I received was 5/2013, and my order was placed in June 2013. To me, sending out an expired product shows poor inventory and quality control. I emailed Amazon and got my money back (at least the customer service was good). However, I was also told by LA Closeout Warehouse that I could still use the product, but should make sure to shake the bottle well since this is a product free of chemical emulsifiers. I shook the bottle a couple of times but the consistency of the liquid was so weird, I did want to apply it to my face.</li>
    <li> If I can give it 0 star, I would. Usually I use NIA24 SPF 30 but decided to try this one. This is very greasy sunscreen, it sits on the skin like oil, the face is white (ok for physical sunscreens), the smell is very chemical and strong! I am sorry I bought it. I still recommend nia24 spf 30, for me it is winner for a face! The packaging is cheap. Not impressed at all</li>
    <li> After much time checking the EWG ratings of safe sunscreens, I decided to try Sunology SPF50 for face.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing and makeup goes on smoothly over it. Having had MOHS surgery on my nose for Basal Cell Carcinoma,&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about the very best protection from the sun, and believe this one is it.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin. This product is suppose to be for the face but I broke out in bumps within a couple of days.  It took about a 5 days for my skin to get back to it&#x27;s normal texture.  Maybe it will work for others but not for my combination skin.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this product since it has no expiration date, and the consistency is very odd. It was almost like white water.</li>
    <li> it is natural so I would not worry about it apply to my face. but I feel think on my face</li>
    <li> great for a healthier sunblock, I use sunblock everyday so I want to stay away from microminerals. I&#x27;m 41 look 30 tops, everyone always asks my what I do, Sunblock people sunblock.</li>
    <li> I had to send this sunblock back to Amazon twice because the bar code that was stuck on the box was for the face Snblk but the actual product that was sent was sunblock for kids. This just didn&#x27;t happen once, but it happened twice. This place that supplies to Amazon is GARBAGE!</li>
    <li> I ordered Sunology after reviewing its&#x27; web-site and researching the internet for a natural product. Although I love the sun, it doesn&#x27;t always love me back...typically, I burn, have sunburn pain for a few days, then go through a couple days of peeling just to go back to being my natural color again.  With Sunology, I have actually been able to obtain a nice, healthy tan for the first time.  Even in being in my swimming pool for up to four hours, with just one application, I was protected, and my skin was soft afterwards.  I am very happy with the results and have since ordered Sunology twice and look forward to it being offered in local stores.  I also liked that since I purchased them through amazon.com, my shipping was free.  I have been raving about Sunology to my friends and family ever since.  Finally, a natural sunscreen that does what is says it does, and leaves my skin feeling moisturized even after being in the sun for several hours.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin as I do this is fabulous.  I have tried many products on my face only to break out in hives or blemishes.  Sunology if I could give you 10 stars I would, this product is chemical free and works on my skin.  Thank you so very much,</li>
    <li> Lasts all day. Once it sets it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy residue, like other sunblocks. I really love it! I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Barrier sunscreens naturally do not work like chemical sunscreens. It is a bit of a tradeoff. I am happy to have to rub this sunscreen in a bit  more and even have a bit of a white hue when I am at the beach to avoid skin cancer. I had a family member pass away from skin cancer. I promise it isn&#x27;t worth looking pretty beneath your makeup with a chemical sunscreen only to die of skin cancer.</li>
    <li> Love this sunblock. Works well and is all natural. Will definitely purchase again.  Please make one large enough to use the body.</li>
    <li> I have huge problems with scented products.  I use unscented everything: lotion, bath soap, deodorant, laundry detergent, etc.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup or nail polish or hairstyling products.  Even a \\&quot;nice\\&quot; smelling thing will begin to bother me after a little while.  And when I say \\&quot;bother me\\&quot;, I mean anything from being annoyed by the smell to nausea to raging, blinding, debilitating headaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw \\&quot;fragrance free\\&quot; on this little tube, I did a little dance.  See, I was already using the relatively-natural Yes to Cucumbers/Carrots/Etc products. But even though their smell is \\&quot;nice\\&quot;, I get sick from it after a very little while on my skin.  When I saw Sunology, I thought my problems were over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They weren&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff might be \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; free, but it still STINKS.  I put just a tiny little bit on my forearms before I went out today. Then I wondered why my entire car smelled like nail polish remover.  It wasn&#x27;t my car, of course.  It was my arms!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s been 3 hours, and my arms are still kind of sticky and gummy feeling.  And I had to wash my hands three times after applying Sunology, and they still didn&#x27;t get clean.  I ended up wiping them off on a towel to try to get them un-slime-ified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff might be healthy and good for the environment, but it&#x27;s bad for me.  That&#x27;s another fifteen bucks gone for something I can&#x27;t use.  Ugh.</li>
    <li> Sunology is the most effective sunscreen I&#x27;ve used!  I&#x27;m a golfer so I spend long days in the sun.  I used to get a red nose even though I would re-apply the other sunscreens.  Sunology has 50 SPF and zinc to keep the burning sun rays away!  I also love that there are no chemicals in the product!!!  It&#x27;s not greasy at all which is amazing because it actually moisturizes my skin!!  Amazing!!</li>
    <li> I purchased Sunology because it was highly recognized by the EWG as it contains &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; ingredients.  My first purchase was for the body and found it was not for facial use, so I made a second purchase for the face cream.  It will give you a glow.  I was asked what I used on my face by a complete stranger,  and It was Sunology!</li>
    <li> I purchased this face lotion at Rite Aid on clearance.. I bought the face, body and kids sunscreen since it was on clearance.. I have used the face lotion for almost a yr and I love it... I have tried expensive products in the past and they didn&#x27;t work as good as this product ... This product is thick but not greasy.. You don&#x27;t have to put to much but make sure you distribute evenly on your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen. I use it on my face everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Goes on kind of thick but then it sinks in and feels amazing&lt;br /&gt;Looks white at first but then diss spears to give you a healthy glow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a loyal user of this for years to come!</li>
    <li> I am in the hot sun every day and have been lloking for a chemical free sunscreen that will not clog my pores and cause break-outs.  I have been using Sunolgy for faces and for the body with great success!  It is thick so you don&#x27;t have to use much and it does absorb into the skin much better than other products I have tried with zinc oxide.  It is greasy at first, but as you rub it in, it becomes very smooth and creamy. I did find with this product I do not have to apply it as often as other sunscreens and it gives me great protection.  I like the fact that there are no checmicals in the product and you don&#x27;t sacrifice the sun protection level.</li>
    <li> I checked the EWG ratings in its website looking for safe sunscreens, I bought Sunology SPF50 (for face), because I prefer 50+SPF. It is very thick, oily, no way I can use under makeup and the smells is awful!! I guess I have to think that I am not being poisoned with those other products...</li>
    <li> This sunscreen smells terrible but what&#x27;s worst it linger on the skin for at least half an hour. I too checked the EWG site as another poster had to search for a chemical free sunscreen. Too bad this one does leave a white cast on my face and an unpleasant odor with it. My search continues :( Thankfully I was issued a full refund from FingerTip Shopper without having to go out of my way to return the product to sender.</li>
    <li> Neither the bottle nor the green product box it came in were sealed.  I noticed this right away but decided to try the product anyway. This lotion made me break out in a bad rash on neck, face, and chest, requiring a visit to the dermatologist.  My skin has never reacted this way.  So now I am wondering what exactly was in that unsealed bottle!  Now I am stuck with 3 bottles which Chambers Company will NOT take back. Take note of this before purchasing from Chambers!  I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my allergy prone skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the product I&#x27;m unhappy with, but amazon. The product is great but the expiration date was in 4 months of my purchase. Naturally, I had to work with the product to get it to the consistency it should be. I&#x27;m guessing it was sitting on the shelf for quite awhile. The expiration date should be told upon purchase. This would have led me down another path. I felt somewhat deceived.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use when he plays golf.  He likes the way it goes on, however it doesn&#x27;t rub in very well and once dry, his face has a whitish/bluish cast.  It looks horrible.  He tried rubbing it in better to no avail.  We&#x27;ve thrown away the product.</li>
    <li> I ended with a bad case of dermatitis with this product.  I hear really good reviews about it, but unfortunately, my skin did not tolerated.  The price was great, the shipping was fast and de the customer service was awesome.  It was just that the product was not good for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind goes on light blue at first cause I&#x27;m a shade of brown. You have to rub it in to absorb into the skin. It&#x27; not sticky or too oil. I&#x27;m a running so what the reck I&#x27;m not tryin&#x27; to get too dark but it&#x27;s smoothing enough to recommend.</li>
