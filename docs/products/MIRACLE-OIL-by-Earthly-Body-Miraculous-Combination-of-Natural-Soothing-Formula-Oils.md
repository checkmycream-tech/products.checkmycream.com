    <li> I love this product. I first found it through a friend who does nails at a salon. I wash my hands frequently and need the extra moisturizing. Miracle Oil is fast-acting, and heals chapped skin, and keeps cuticles soft.. It helps keep my manicure fresh-looking. It can be used on any area of the body. I have used it on my lips and feet, too.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve uded this before. It is really a miricle oil</li>
    <li> I bought this same product at a high end salon and paid 3x the price. So glad I didn&#x27;t go back to the salon to buy it. This oil works miracle&#x27;s on dry skin. It&#x27;s a must for every makeup bag</li>
    <li> I use this stuff everyday even on my face!!!</li>
    <li> I add this oil to my daily moisturizer and it really makes a definite difference!  Love this product !</li>

    <li> This oil is very soothing to the skin. I use it a lot. Delivery was fast and this is a great price.</li>
    <li> I love, love love this product! My sister initially gave this to me and I used it for dry skin on my feet. Over the winter my toes got severely irritated by the seams of my socks resulting in blisters and non-healing scabs. Neosporin and antifungal creams did little to improve the condition and so I started using this oil. Within a short amount of time I began to feel real healing, there was no more soreness or itching. At this point my toes are completely healed and ready for sandals. This is good for dry hands and I will then pull my fingers through my hair which helps frizz and leaves my hair with a nice shine. (My hair is very long and thick.)</li>
    <li> I used this oil on a curling iron burn and it healed very quickly with no scar.  I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d heard great things about Miracle Oil and found this great deal so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works -- but I had a small wart on my ring finger that was gone after just a couple of applications.  Since that worked I tried it on a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; (even the doctor wasn&#x27;t sure what it was) on my middle finder.  It is now less than half the size it was when I started putting the Miracle Oil on.  I also used it on a heat rash I got in Jamaica and it soothed it right away.  I will be buying more for sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both scalp and body and have seen a lot of difference</li>
    <li> Love it. It has my skin tremendously.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Buying another one.  Great for the price - and it really works!  I&#x27;m sharing this with my daughter ;)</li>
    <li> Love this stuff happy to find it on amazon.  Use it all the time and use it on my family too when needed</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!I use it for nails, cuts, acne you name it.  The only problem that I have had is that the rubber top leeks.  There is no smell so its great for the sensitive types. I cant be without!</li>
    <li> This leaves my face so dewy and flawless I love and swear by it. Every time I break out I just apply this to the problem areas and pimples are gone this next day.</li>
    <li> Great product,  sells for 15 dollars in the stores or salons in my area. Good for hairs skin and nails. Shipping was a lil pricey, but can&#x27;t beat the overall price of the product</li>
    <li> I like this product, but note it is advertised as healing formula, but you will receive the soothing formula instead.  Apparently, they are both the same formula, but the name was changed.  I have found this product to work well on nails, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for small cuts or scars.  A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I order the Healing oil with 9 essential oils, I got the soothing oil with 6 essential oils. Even though it&#x27;s the wrong oil I decided to try it Does not work as good as the healing oils. Ordering from a different distributor today, Hopefully I get the correct oil this time.</li>
    <li> Dry/flaky skin just seems to love this stuff.  Works well on insect bites.</li>
    <li> it gave my pizzelles a nice strong anise taste that my family likes</li>
    <li> Great product. Used on old burn. Made skin smooth. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome.  I bought mine at a local nail spa because i had broken nails on my toes and had splitting skin on the ends because i wear flip flops all year long.  I have only put it on once a day... most of the time out of the shower and few times at night with socks... my skin is now not splitting and my nails are growing back nicely.. also helped with some scars on my legs.  I was looking for a better price but i only paid $10 local.  Just wanted to give a review for anyone looking for an oil that really works!!! love it!</li>
    <li> This product has worked for everything i have tried it on</li>
