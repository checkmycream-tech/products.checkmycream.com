<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Turned my skin orange.</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting something that was fast acting and that&#x27;s exactly what it was. Using a glove or mit is necessary!</li>
    <li> Fake reviews?  Notice how man of the reviews don&#x27;t really say anything too specific about this product.  Kind of an odd generalization?  It&#x27;s make my poor black and smells odd, gives your skin an odd ting of color.</li>
    <li> This worked well, no stinky smell, didn&#x27;t smear, ball up, or streak.  It didn&#x27;t come off on my clothing or bed sheets.  It lasted well over a week after the initial 2 applications. I will continue using this product &amp; would highly recommend it to any body.</li>
    <li> I recently stopped using tanning beds but enjoy a nice bronze color all year long (I naturally have olive skin to begin with). This lotion has been a perfect alternative, is not streaky, and does not leave my fingers or skin orange. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have found! I love the ease of application and the color once it darkens. There are no orangy/oompa loompa undertones. A word of caution--the lotion is GREEN! I was worried I had a bad batch or something when I first opened it but it is supposed to be this way. I apply it with a black velor/velvet type mitt and I have never once had a streak. Here is the step-by-step foolproof way to get a nice, even and natural looking tan:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shower and exfoliate everywhere, especially elbows, ankles, knees. I use a facial exfoliator and then I just use those exfoliator gloves for my body because if you use something with oils in it like a body scrub the lotion won&#x27;t penetrate as well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry off completely. Pull hair up/away from face. Apply regular lotion generously to feet, knees and elbows. Then start applying the tanning lotion with the mitt. I start from the legs and work my way up. Calves--&amp;#62;thighs/butt--&amp;#62;stomach/sides/what you can reach of your back--&amp;#62;arms--&amp;#62;chest--&amp;#62;neck--&amp;#62;face.&lt;br /&gt;3. Run the mitt with leftover lotion on it over the tops of your feet and backs of hands.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use black latex-free gloves to rub in some regular lotion over your feet/ankles until absorbed. I also apply a little regular lotion to my wrists so there is not a line. You can use the black gloves to also apply sunscreen or other face lotion if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;5. Let dry completely before dressing. This lotion is awesome because it hardly rubs off on your clothes, and any that does get on clothes will wash out in the wash. Just make sure you rinse your body off (after it&#x27;s been on your body for several hours and tan is set) before exercising or you&#x27;ll sweat it off onto your clothes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a better tanning lotion, and the price point is amazing!</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion I have ever used. It absorbs really quickly wich makes for a really easy application. The smell is very light compared to other self tanners I have used.  Seriously is streak free and leaves a brown color not orange. Another great thing is that it didn&#x27;t make me sweat like other tanning lotions I have used in the past. This is really a great product and I  am so happy I purchased this!</li>
    <li> Works very well made me look like I had a great summer tan until I noticed that I had some pretty bad splotches. If you get this item be sure to apply it very carefully.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on the 2nd &amp; got it on the 8th so shipping was pretty fast. I&#x27;ve got a noticeably darker tan within the past few days of using. It looks natural &amp; doesn&#x27;t need to be applied every single day to keep the color. I love it!</li>
    <li> I tried it at first and i liked it a lot, it gave me a dark color and i like that you can build the color to without looking orange. i fell in love with it when i was about to go out wearing shorts and i look in the mirror and i&#x27;m like HOLY CRAP i have the whitest legs right now. I put this on my legs and arms really fast and it looked like I&#x27;ve been tanning for weeks. I canceled my tanning package and i&#x27;m good with just this! it&#x27;s easy, and it doesn&#x27;t stain your hands and if it is hard to get out i just put some Dawn on my hands rub it in and let it sit then wash it off and the product comes right off your hands. I&#x27;m very happy with it and i will keep using this product! (: plus is smells like almond extract to me which i really don&#x27;t hate haha.</li>
    <li> Got my bottle today right on time, love the smell already looking tan!! Thank you!!</li>
    <li> the colors good, not orangy. Thats why the products green, to contrast the orangish. Not too fond of the scent, but overall, good color.</li>
    <li> Ordered this Monday and got it today (Friday) in the mail, so very fast delivery. I wait to around bed time to apply it so I could sleep and have it soak do good over night. I did my entire body and BAM instant tan (no orange &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; color ) just a nice bronze tan and as the hours went by it got darker, will def buy again!!!!! I was huge on tanning beds but i decided to start taking better care of my skin and this will def give you a beautiful summer tan without the sun!</li>
    <li> No rash, no streaks, pleasant smell, and great golden color without being yellow or orange!</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve tried yet. It is a good color and lasts much longer and it does not rub off on my clothes after drying. I strongly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff! I applied it with a mitt and it worked fantastically. The bronzer does wash off but I barely had any streaks and I am prone to streaking. The smell also wasn&#x27;t as offensive as most sunless products. Really happy I found this item.</li>
    <li> This is nice tanning lotion! I am satisfied with its quality. Just have a few pointers. The lotion is spinach green, so prepare yourself. Also, ensure you are very careful when applying. You will need 30 minutes for dry time and you will not see the results until about 3 hours later. Any mistakes you make will last for DAYS!  Pros: Long lasting, easy to apply when being careful, nice tan. Cons: Won&#x27;t see results for several hours, a little orangy.. depends on the tan you prefer.</li>
    <li> For the price I&#x27;d rather have Jergens</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product the lotion is green!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I have used over 10 self tanners over the last year and none of them have given me tanned skin after just one use as this product. It looks like I was on the beach in the Caribbean for the last two weeks. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again tonight.</li>
    <li> This is very dark but I love it</li>
    <li> Note: this is not one of those I-got-this-for-free-and-am-writing-a-glowing-review reviews. I am really sick of those, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I self-tan after nearly every shower. I live in California and have to look the part, you know? But after two years with Fake Bake, I decided it was time to try to find something a little more low maintenance (Fake Bake is great, but the mitt is 100% necessary and the extra accessory to deal with is frustrating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on Amazon, quickly scanned reviews, and ordered this. Then, while waiting for its arrival, I read the reviews and was frustrated to find that nearly all were written by sponsored users, and are therefore untrustworthy (I don&#x27;t care if you say the review is &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34;, I just cannot give the benefit of the doubt to a trend more associated with scams than hot tips). Nevertheless, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This WAY exceeded my low expectations. It blends really easily (almost no streaks!), smells relatively good, isn&#x27;t sticky at all, DOESN&#x27;T RUB OFF MUCH ON SHEETS / CLOTHING (a little is to be expected from all skin dyes, but some are noticeably awful *cough*fakebake*cough*), and gives a  pretty realistic tan, assuming you&#x27;re not ghost white to start. Totally worth the adventure away from Fake Bake in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, if you use your hands to apply this, you better have a stack of sandpaper nearby because this will instantly dye your palms brown. I haven&#x27;t tried using plastic gloves, but I am a little disappointed that a mitt is once more necessary. At least in dire circumstances my hands are a possibility, unlike Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will probably buy again</li>
    <li> I was NOT paid or given product free to review.&lt;br /&gt;After realizing a lot of the reviewers received product in return for a good review, I became very leery. There are a few negative reviews on here and naturally, it makes you think the rest are bogus.&lt;br /&gt;This was one Tanner I tested along with St. Tropez and Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;This one, by far, yielded the best, most natural results.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted longer as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am cool toned and very fair, so building a natural tan is basically out of the question.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely buy this product again. It was the least expensive of the bunch and I was very pleased with how dark it got me in one application.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best self tanner you can buy!!! I&#x27;ve tried sooooo many, this by far is the best! The color develops into a very nice golden brown, looks completely natural. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on any other self tanner.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I have yellow under tones and I always end up orange when I use self tanners. This has a purple/red tint to it when you first put it on so you can see where it&#x27;s going. It gets darker for about 4 hours then the tone is set. It does stain the hands but I just use soap and a sugar scrub and it comes right off.</li>
    <li> This is by far the worst self tanning product I have ever purchased.  I received it this morning and couldn&#x27;t wait to apply it. The smell of it is that of what I consider to be burned motor oil.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to apply it alone. Streaks very badly and I took my time with applying it to arms and legs.. I just went to bathroom and gently scrubbed to get some of it off. Living at a Beach, I have purchased many tanning items over the years.This one wins hands down for being worst imaginable.</li>
    <li> This does leave a good shade...but it will streak if you&#x27;re not quick enough at rubbing it in. I haven&#x27;t had a problem going swimming afterwards...just have to make sure you rub it real good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always hated trying to get tanned and paying lots of money for it too.. But when I came along this lotion I knew it was just the thing for me. I&#x27;ts super easy to apply and you get a nice tan color if you apply it nicely!</li>
    <li> Favorite self tanner. Smells great and looks natural.</li>
    <li> I gave this product three stars, simply because you get a bang for your buck! This bottle has enough applications to use on your entire body at least 6-7 times. Great smell, reminds of a Jergens cherry almond lotion I used when I was younger. My only concerns were that it was a bit orangey with streaks that appeared within a day or two. I followed the basic self tanning instructions such as exfoliating, applying lotion to my creases, and used gloves. I was a bit disappointed by this and was paid a compliment that I looked like I &amp;#34;rolled around in a bag of Doritos!&amp;#34;  Ehh still okay for the price.</li>
    <li> It can definitely streak but the color is great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this a couple times now on different clean, exfoliated parts of my body including my face and I cannot see any tan at all. I have light skin and don&#x27;t even see any change unfortunately. I an not new to tan products and bought this as a spraytan alternative however was disappointed and will not re-order. I will clear up some misconceamd say although the product is green, it is translucent immediately upon application...but again does not work and not the most pleasant of smells to rub all over you for no reason. I tried applying it with and w/o gloves and it didn&#x27;t matter bec5it washed off my hands easily. .another indication it doesn&#x27;t really absorb into skin.</li>
    <li> Tremendous shine and also natural hunting brown colour possesses me marketed! Smells like fresh new citrus. Made smooth and also dried out speedily so my own skin colour in no way believed sticky or perhaps exhausted. This kind of method tanned and also moisturised in a single request. Really made a huge a difference during my themes overall look, colour and also entire smoothness. I love that home tanner plus it will probably swap almost all my own some other sunless tans! I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Like most women, I have tried countless tanning lotions and they always seem to have a fault. The Darksyde lotion applies very smoothly, does&#x27;t leave an odor and stays even and dark for almost a week. It doesn&#x27;t stain my hands or elbows like most other lotions which makes it a go to when I can&#x27;t get out in the sun. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in trying or changing tanning lotions.</li>
    <li> I have used many, and they failed, and researched many, and came across darksyde ultra bronze on amazon.  It truly does work well. Doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry, and still hasn&#x27;t stained my clothes, like so many others.  I highly recommend this product!! So nice to look tan without the boring time it takes to sunbathe, not to mention the skin damaging effects of the sun!!</li>
    <li> I have only used the product for  two days and its amazing. I have very light skin and I have great color the smell is great. and dries quickly, I definitely would  use gloves to apply it, much easier you can see where you have applied it and I do not look orange!! simply amazing will reorder again..</li>
    <li> Received this item in a very timely manner- used it twice so far- perfect natural looking golden (not orange) tan with no streaks. BEST yet- almost no smell! I have used quite a number of self tanners- sprays, towels, the lot... and this one is the best smelling for its no nasty chemical smell. Recommended item- I will purchase this one again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d really like to try this bronzer because I have fair skin and have a hard time getting tan, the reviews seem awesome to me so I think I&#x27;ll be purchasing it</li>
    <li> This is one of the best self tanners I have ever used. Dries quickly, non-oily, has a natural look with no streaking, results within a few hours. Will buy again and again. Make sure you scrub your hands good.</li>
    <li> This self tanner works really well, so much better than other self tanners that I have tried in the past. It looks really natural, all of my friends thought I had been going to the beach. The tan also lasts a long time and one bottle lasts a long time. It is so easy to apply and isn&#x27;t greasy at all, it feels really nice on the skin. Really good product.</li>
    <li> I have tried many self tanning lotions and usually found all lacking in one aspect or the other. However, this is not the case with Darksyde Ultra Bronze Tanning Lotion...I am beyond pleased with this product- It is easy to apply goes on evenly, a little goes a long way, color is very natural looking and not fake, has a pleasant citrus scent, is not greasy, leaves my skin feeling smooth and very moisturized, tans quickly, and the product lasts very well before you need to re-apply...on the average- for me- 3 days with taking showers twice a day. I could not ask for any better product. I highly recommend this self tanning lotion. Along with all the above positive attributes it is very cost effective compared to other products I have tried ( all the top of the line name brands)  I will re-order again, and again...</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  The color is even, it is realistic and there is no foul smell.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have been reading some fairly negative reviews on this product...and so was a bit nervous to try it out.  Some people wrote that it clumps up when you apply it, but I did not find this to be the case.  It applied quite nicely, and even has a nice cherry-type scent initially.  It&#x27;s greenish-black in color, but so is another self-tanner that I like to use.  The day I received it I tried out a little test patch on my upper leg.  The next morning the initial coloring washed off, and I was indeed left with a tan area underneath, it wasn&#x27;t very dark, but definitely noticeable.  I have since used it on my face and arms and I am quite pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloves should probably be worn while applying this product. Although I did manage to clean up my stained palms with just regular soap and water....and did not need to resort to using Comet like one other reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read in some of the negative reviews that they were offered a free bottle if they wrote a good review.  So far no one has approached me to do this.....I would love to get another bottle of this stuff!</li>
    <li> Does nothing except leave your hand an awful color. No tanning benefit at all</li>
    <li> I have tried many MANY different tanning lotions and fake bake was my favorite, now I have two favorites. The color looks nice and dark on me. Every lotion you get can be streaky if you don&#x27;t apply it evenly. that is not the lotions fault. So far i think for the price this is 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Ok, so I bought this based on the stellar reviews, but I&#x27;m not thrilled. I am REALLY pale and have a wedding coming up that I&#x27;m a bridesmaid for. I have some terrible tan lines on my chest and thought I could find something that would blend it all in.  Thankfully I tested this on a small part of my leg that only my husband can see before anywhere that can be seen by people. I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because I might attribute some of the color to my skin being so pale and I&#x27;m not sure if I did things right. There is minimal instruction on the bottle, of which I followed. I had showered earlier that morning and exfoliated as many people suggest.  When I put the cream on my leg, I possibly didn&#x27;t rub it in as much as I should have? I&#x27;m not sure. I thought I did. The cream is green, which everyone assured was a good thing. But there was a green tint for a while. It wasn&#x27;t until hours later until it went away and then I was left with a yellowish patch. If my husband didn&#x27;t know better he would have thought it was a giant bruise. I would absolutely NOT use this anywhere on my face. UGH.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m returning to get a refund. If you had success with this, kudos.</li>
    <li> I am reviewing th Darkside Ultra Bronze Self Tanning lotion.  I want to preface this with the fact that I have never written a review before.  The seller did offer a free bottle of this new product as a thank you for taking time to write a review (they did not ask for a positive review).  While this is a nice offer, it is not the only reason for this review.  I am a fair skinned, mostly Irish (freckles and auburn haired) female who likes having a natural looking tan for the summer.  It makes me feel so much better about myself to not look ghostly and pale:)  I have to obtain my sun color mostly artificially, because my skin cannot tan well.  I am a self tanner fiend!  I have tried many self tanners over the last how ever many years they have been available-I have tried expensive ones like Fake Bake, as well as cheap ones like Bannana Boat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 different applications, here are my positive findings for this product as compared to the many others I have tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Goes on smoothly-easy to blend (lighter in &#x27;bronzeness&amp;#34; of lotion so this helps with blending on fairer skin as well)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Dries/absorbs quickly&lt;br /&gt;3.  Light, non-offensive fragrance&lt;br /&gt;4.  Does not turn me orange&lt;br /&gt;4.  Wears longer (the effects last longer)  This is my favorite part-only applying twice a week to maintain shading I want&lt;br /&gt;5.  Not pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment is about the self tanner &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that develops, but I gave this product 5 stars because all self tanners produce this odor.  It is not as strong with this product as I have noticed with others.  Self tanners produce the odor due to the chemical reaction that has to happen to produce tanning effects.&lt;br /&gt;I am not the type of person that would lead anyone astray by writing a false review.  This is a great product for me, and I will be purchasing it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and I love this tanning lotion! I put it on before bed 2-3 times per week and wake up with natural-looking bronze color. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every sunless tanning product, most recently Fake Bake (spray) and St Tropez (foam) and I like this product better because it is not sticky, smells good and the tan lasts longer. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> This is the best option for getting a tan without actually getting one. Most Tanning products make me look orange and discolored like I just got photoshopped into the real world. But with this I actually look tan. For $15 this really is the absolute best thing out there!</li>
    <li> OMG, this stuff is awesome. I don&#x27;t tan, I burn. Other products leave me orange. This is the first time in my life I&#x27;ve have natural-looking tan. Where was this stuff when I was in my 20s? Some advice: dry off. Make sure you&#x27;re really dry. Then put lotion or baby oil on your knees, feet and elbows. Don&#x27;t wash your hands. Then use the tanning lotion everywhere. (The oil keeps it from &amp;#34;over absorbing&amp;#34; on your knees, feet, elbows and hands, and makes your tan even.) Now wash your hands. Several of my co-workers have already purchased after I tell them it&#x27;s from a bottle.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of self tanners over the years but I have to say the color you get with Darksyde is amazing. It looks completely natural and doesn&#x27;t streak at all! The only drawbacks I would say are the smell (you get used to it) and you MUST wash your hands thoroughly after applying. Defiantly worth purchasing though! Thank you Darksyde.</li>
    <li> This works better than many products I have tried. Provides a very non-streaky, non-orangey brown tone that really lasts. What I love about this product is that you can get the perfect tan skin without the dangerous UV rays from the sun.  The smell actually isn&#x27;t too bad either. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I decided to give Darksyde a try based on positive reviews by other buyers, and I have to say I am very impressed with the product. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now, and there is no streaking and the color looks like real, tropical, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been at the beach&amp;#34; tan. Because it is a lotion, I use latex gloves to put it on, and I find that works very well to keep color from developing on the palms of my hand. This lotion is also very economical, considering the large bottle you get for the price. My thanks to the Darksyde folks for an excellent sunless tanner!</li>
    <li> Orange and crappy looking.  Was so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Love it! Most natural colour I have found in a self-tanner. You must apply carefully though! However, it is tinted so you can see where it&#x27;s not even. Lasts longer than other brands I have used. Again I say, love it!</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion worked great on my skin tone and lasted for a good 3 days.  The lotion wasn&#x27;t messy and was easy to apply.  I received the product  in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I am not a pro of self tanning and this product made it easy for me.  I notice the results right away too! I&#x27;ve tried others and they take several applications to see results, not this one. I&#x27;ll be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> its green, gooey, and smelly, but it really works. Perfect bronze color on pale skin.</li>
    <li> Just got my bottle yesterday, I tried it today and not even 2 hours later, I&#x27;ve got a nice even bronze coming along. NO STREAKS!!! The lotion has a nice citrus scent! No weird smell like with other self tanners! I&#x27;m defiantly going to order again!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best tanning product ever!  We have used various spray&#x27;s, lotions &amp; gel&#x27;s over the years &amp; this is by far the most natural looking.  The application goes on even and smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product.  Do make sure you rub in until it is all absorbed into the skin to avoid any streaking.  Prior to aplication, I put a dab of lotion on my feet &amp; knees so they don&#x27;t look overly &amp;#34;tanned&amp;#34; - Would reccomend the use of gloves, though not necessary.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love the price, the beautiful tan it leaves, and the ease which it is to apply using the gloves i purchased to go with them.</li>
    <li> I have used Extended Vacation Moroccan Mineral tanning for a year.  I am fair skinned and have a hard time finding a natural looking, yet dark self-tanner.  I tried the Darksyde and loved it even more than Moroccan.  It smells better, has a darker brown color, less yellow as compared to morrocan, and doesn&#x27;t stain - even temporarily.  Morrocan has not permanently stained my clothes however, once I put it on my skin I could not wear anything white, it would slowly seep through a white shirt during the day.  Darksyde has not stained any clothing after letting it dry 30 minutes or less or seeped through my shirt hours later while I sweat.  Amazing!  Since I use it frequently I will say it gets coppery/redish looking on fair skin and like most tanners tends to dry out the top layer of skin but not nearly as bad as other self-tanners and I only notice this after using it 4-5 times in a week.  I highly recommend the Ultimitt to apply evenly.</li>
    <li> Really like the color &amp; lasts .I use about twice a week. Best applied with sponge mitt ( had a few streaks when using bare hands ) .</li>
    <li> What I love about this product is that you can get the perfect tan skin without the dangerous UV rays from the sun. Makes you look good, and it&#x27;s good for you! The smell actually isn&#x27;t too bad either. Bravo, Darksyde, this is something i&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this tanner! It gives even, natural looking tan, it has a subtle pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any orange residue like some self tanners do. I will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I have to say I was not sure this would really darken as it states. I was greatly surprised and love the product. After a few hours it darkened to a very nice bronze color. Nothing too dark or unnatural. I would recommend this for use in the winter when we poor people in the Midwest can&#x27;t sit out in the sun or those that burn. Thanks !</li>
    <li> So this is my first bottle of Darksyde and I am fairly pale skinned, reddish haired. I tried it this morning and think it worked pretty well. I only use it on my legs. I really dislike showing my blinding white legs right after winter! I thought it was easy to apply but you need to be careful rubbing it on so you dont get streaks. I think the color came out nice, believable and the smell doesnt bother me. A tip I found helpful is to wash your hands with comet after applying so you dont wind up with stained hands.</li>
    <li> This tanning lotion is horrible. I would give it ZERO starts if I could. I got sucked in to buying it cause it has so many good reviews. After I tried it and saw that it gives you blotchy ugly color that fades quickly (thank goodness since the color sucks) and it smells awful, I decided to read more reviews. I dug for a bad one and saw that its a total scam and when you buy their other tanning lotions, if you give this one a good rating, they give you the bottle for free. Don&#x27;t believe the good reviews, this company bought them basically. Pretty disgusted I wasted my money on this product. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE!</li>
    <li> The good news is that this is the most natural looking tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s the one that didn&#x27;t turn me orange.  The bad news isn&#x27;t so bad; in fact it&#x27;s worth it to me:  It&#x27;s a little greasy going on and it can lump together or give you an uneven look the first day, especially if you use too much. It can be messy if you&#x27;re going to do any sweating that day.  But so far I&#x27;ve been able to time it so that I use it on days when few people see me, and then the good news is what&#x27;s important:  It looks more natural, like a real tan, and it lasts a few days.  Using it twice a week works well.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I love this product!! Its goes on nice &amp; smooth &amp; will give you a beautiful brown tan with a quick dry time! I would recommened this product to all my friends &amp; family!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This works just as well as, if not better than, a lot of self-tanning stuff I&#x27;ve tried. Provides a very non-streaky, non-orangey brown tone that really lasts. Be sure to wash hands after applying!</li>
    <li> This was priced reasonably and I enjoy it! I think the color payoff is nice and I enjoy that it is a lotion that develops because I find my skin tends to get a bit dry with the tanning mousses. So far I have no complaints at all.</li>
    <li> What a great value for such a beautiful tan... I was a little concerned when I saw the color guide go on slightly green, but after about an hour a gorgeous shade of golden brown had developed on my skin. Most self tanners cause breakouts for me, but this one actually moisturizes the skin without causing blemishes. I usually use BareMinerals Faux tan, but I think this one has better color, lasts longer, as well as costs alot less.</li>
    <li> This actually smells kind of good! And it works, too. So, there you go.</li>
    <li> The makers of Darksyde Ultra Bronze Self Tanning Lotion promised me a free bottle if I reviewed their product. Sorry to say this isn&#x27;t a positive review. This stuff is messy to put on and streaks like crazy. Final results (in spots)is a nice color, but produces very inconsistent results.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised. Even though I have lots of age spots everywhere due to sun damage from the past, and they get darker in the sun preventing me from sunning anymore, this tanning added color and glow without darkening my spots like other products have. and reasonable price!</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the tanner I used when I was Bodybuilding. Goes on dark, but when you shower the next morning about half washes off. But the remainder still leaves a very moderate tan that looks good. Also easy to apply (use a mitt), and lasts for about a week, depending on haw hard you scrub in the shower. Good value.</li>
    <li> I had been using the Banana Boat self tanning lotion when I realized I was almost out.  I started looking to purchase more, when I came across this.  The price was great and it got good reviews so I decided to try it.  I used it and I&#x27;m delighted at the results.  I did compare the ingredients from both brands and although they are somewhat different, I like this better.  I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> I found this product very easy to use.  It does go on smoothly with no streaking.  I couldn&#x27;t really tell where I applied the lotion tho except that it felt wet. Didn&#x27;t matter since there was no streaking.  1 to 3 hours later, I had a tan!  Looks natural enough and not &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34;.  Will keep using this product and enjoy fun things instead of burning and sweating in the sun.</li>
    <li> Love this easy to apply and long lasting sunless tanner.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my sister, and she totally love it. You  can stay tan without being in the sun so long, because we all know it&#x60;s dangerous. This tanning lotion is also very cheap, considering the big bottle you get for the price. My sister is very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Too thick and was a brown versus bronze.</li>
    <li> I kinda like the smell actually. Wasnt sure at first about it actually leaving any color on my skin as I tried it in a small area and nothing happened. So today I applied it all over the skin and can see the change in color. This is my first experience with self tanners. I like the bronzy shine. The lotion is green but not to worry it does not turn your skin green, or orange! Im going to keep using it and see how the color develops over the next couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I am by no means an experienced tanner when it comes to tanning lotions. This is the first self tanner that I have ever used. And I love it. I have a nice even tan from it and my color darkened the day I put it on. After one day of using this, my friends noticed my tan right away. After a week, I had a nice bronze color that I really love. I will be using this in the future.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! Full effects of laying in the sun or going to a tanning bed, minus the expensive fees or harmful rays from the sun. I love this, and it looks like a natural tan. Already bought a second bottle of this.</li>
    <li> Worked better than most of the self tanning stuff you can buy. I was very impressed with the fact that it didnt streak at all. People ask me all the time what i am using and i show them this every time.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!! Buying another bottle!! Looks so natural &amp; have gotten compliments  on my tan lol The lotion is green but maybe  that&#x27;s why it turns out so natural looking. I will only be using this lotion from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Goes on well and stays for days! I won&#x27;t be buying any other kind now!</li>
    <li> Smell considering its a self tanning lotion not bad at all, However color has a green tone on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is my first tanning product I&#x27;ve ever bought and I&#x27;m happy that i got a nice and working product in the very first purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It gets absorbed quickly and is not like all that sticky stuff which could irritate one. The odor is not very great but not even bad though (well I would not have been bothered by that, so maybe you may find it something different.)&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> I recently stopped using tanning beds after 15 years, so I was doing a lot of research on Amazon and other beauty websites for the best self-tanner.&lt;br /&gt;After reading tons of reviews from about 75 self-tanners (of all price ranges) I purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by the DarkSyde  Ultra Bronze self-tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Pros**&lt;br /&gt;Price is great!&lt;br /&gt;---It was under $15 with Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasted longer than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;---I would say it lasted about 5-7 days. Many tend to last 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy application&lt;br /&gt;----Don&#x27;t freak out that it&#x27;s green in color for application.  It turns to a bronzed color on your skin as it develops over 1-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;----Be sure to use a tanning mitt (can purchase on Amazon, Ulta or Sally Beauty Supply stores for $5 to $8)&lt;br /&gt;---For your face, I would recommend a make-up sponge.&lt;br /&gt;---For additional precaution to not stain your fingers and palms, I wear the disposable gloves I use when I color my hair.  You can also purchase them in 10-12 packs at the store in the cleaning products section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Cons***&lt;br /&gt;I miss the tanning bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product that can be used to achieve a dark color, several applications per bottle and is very inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Good tanning lotion, Brought this to my beach and it worked well, no sunburn. I recommend this product since it is free of most harmful chemicals found in most tanning lotions today.</li>
    <li> I am very familiar with sunless tanning lotions. Thought I&#x27;d give this one a try. Pros are the smell is mild, and it has a nice feel to it, but in the end - it just hardly gives you any color. It says 1-3 hours the color develops so I kept thinking the color was on it&#x27;s way! lol.  Nope. It might be good for very fair skin, but it def is NOT a dark tanning lotion. I hardly noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, I feel at ease knowing it&#x27;s safer than other products and it dries extremely fast. It&#x27;s fast and the bottle seems to include quite a lot of product so you wont be using it up too quickly, depending on how much you use anyway, but it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good stuff, With the safety formula, I feel extremely satisfy when I put it on my skin. The bottle is in decent size, I dont quite use too much but a good amount is good. Depend how much you want to use it, it is perfect for anyone who has soft skin and easy damaged by the sun.</li>
    <li> The color didn&#x27;t turn out as dark as I was hoping, so I might try two coats next time to see if that deepens the tan. The smell is pretty awful when applying but goes away once it&#x27;s dry. Other than that, the color looks really natural and doesn&#x27;t streak at all. Overall it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
    <li> Huge Bottle, Great Price, Smells GREAT!! &#x3D;) Excited to try this tonight when I go tan!  All the reviews are so good I know I will be completely satisfied. Great Job Darksyde!</li>
    <li> I had never heard of this brand but i was very surprised by the results. Tan looked natural, not alot has to be used for application, and was gentle enough i could use on my face. Great product would buy again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using self tanners for over 20 years.  So far, this is undoubtedly my favorite!  It&#x27;s easy to apply, dries quickly and looks so natural the next day and beyond!  However, it&#x27;s not perfect in that it still has the self tanner smell, but that is only for the first day.  After that, there&#x27;s no smell at all!  Which is a HUGE plus!  All other tanners I&#x27;ve used continue to smell day after day.  This will not give you immediate color.  The color will appear the next day.  It gives a great natural color that lasts several days.  Right now, this is the only tanner I&#x27;ll spend my money on!  No need to keep searching, it&#x27;s pratically perfect!</li>
    <li> first time buying this and it seems to worked well so far and smells better then most self tanning lotions do</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, and I do not tan. I burn, then peel. I&#x27;ve been trying sunless tanners for years, and most give me an orange look. This self tanner does not. It gives me a nice, tan look, that is even and not blotchy or orange. It also smells nice, which most self tanners do not. Be sure to follow the directions on the bottle, and you will get great results.</li>
    <li> Works great. Haven&#x27;t had a single issue so far and now I&#x27;ve got a nice tan. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you&#x27;re uncertain about this, take my word for it and grab it.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 3 weeks now, it&#x27;s really good, its not sticky and the bottle is very large. So it&#x27;ll for sure last me at least another 3-4weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after reading the reviews on Amazon.  I am fair skinned and have tried many self tanners and Darksyde is one of the best.  It&#x27;s streak free and gives you a natural glow upon application.  After a few hours you will have a natural looking sun tan!  It does have a slight odor but minimal compared to other self tanners.  Be sure to wash hands thoroughly after applying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already contacted Amazon to red flag Green Web Inc. When people buy the Self Tanning Lotion or the indoor tanning lotions by Darksyde, Green Web sends out a note in the package to write a review telling their &amp;#34;success stories&amp;#34; with these products and they will receive a free bottle of this exact tanner. I bought both the self tanner and one of the indoor tanning lotions based on how great the reviews were, and now I know why they were so unusually positive. This tanner is a strange taupe color and washes off; it doesn&#x27;t last &amp;#34;days&amp;#34; like the label claims. Plus, Green Web Inc. is literally selling it for good reviews (which happens to be against Amazon policy). Don&#x27;t waste your money on Darksyde products. This is an unproven company soliciting falsified reviews through Green Web (which, if you take a look at the products they sell, is not the most reputable or respectable company selling on Amazon). Please take your money elsewhere, and don&#x27;t trust any reviews for Darksyde lotion sold by Green Web Inc.</li>
    <li> comes out green and smells weird to me.  It works but not better than most products in it&#x27;s category.  Comes with a card that says if you give it a good review they will send you another whole bottle for free...  Clever marketing but I don&#x27;t really want another bottle.  this one will sit on a shelf until it&#x27;s no good anymore.  It also clumps up and makes me feel dirty.</li>
    <li> First time buying this.  It seems to work better than some other brands that I have tried. I wish it would last just a little longer before reapplying .  Overall I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I thought by the reviews I would try this product. It turned my skin a greenish muddy color. Luckily, I only tried a small patch of skin. The product does have a greenish muddy color but until trying it, that could be the color and not what it does. Wrong!! I wouldn&#x27;t give it one star. The market brands worked better for me and gave a warm glow. This product I can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> I have light yellow toned skin. It takes a while, but I tan naturally over burning. This product works great in a pinch when I haven&#x27;t had time to get outside and am looking pasty white. I think it looks slightly orange in certain lights, but definately not all the time, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or yellow undertones of my skin. Wear gloves and/or make sure dry areas hydrated thoroghly during use. Worth the limited use for definate result. So far best at home tanner I&#x27;ve found yet. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product is great, I only used it a few times so far and I noticed that after the first use I did achieve some color and it wasn&#x27;t the orange color. It&#x27;s tinted a little so you can see where you apply it, I have had no problems with streaks. I always loofa, use regular lotion then tanning lotion, it&#x27;s a good method, be sure to wash your hands afterwards of course. This product has kinda a fruity smell and its not bad compared to other self tanning brands.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I tried tanning naturally but after hours in the sun I noticed little to no difference. I decided to buy Darksyde and take my chances. I am happy I did! I put it on and unlike other lotions Darksyde dried almost instantly and within moments I noticed the stunning difference. Darksyde did what the Sun couldn&#x27;t do in hours, in the matter of minutes! Must have for all tanners!!!</li>
    <li> My daughters always know when I use self tanners as I always turn orange. They won&#x27;t know now. I&#x27;m amazed and pleased.  Nice product, Thanks,</li>
    <li> I have only used drug store self tanners, after reading the reviews I gave this product a try. This is far better than any product I&#x27;ve used before. It is easy to apply and dries fairly quickly. I applied lotion then the product, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with streaking and the color looks like a tan coloring. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> The thing I love the most about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look orange like the other products. It also smells really good and I don&#x27;t have to worry about my body because the only thing it does is making my skin look good. Other products made me sweaty and stuff, but this is one is just perfect. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> did not as well as advertised....takes SEVERAL application to notice a color change.</li>
    <li> Easy application, unlike other messy  ones I have tried this one is also streak free as it promises!! (Most say that but don&#x27;t follow)  I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing again!!:)</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve found. In spite of the name it&#x27;s not really DARK, but a perfect brown. I love it... I just ordered another bottle! I noticed several comments about them offering a free bottle to anyone who posts a review. Some people don&#x27;t like that (it&#x27;s called marketing) I have a question for all you \\&quot;watchdogs\\&quot; does it seem reasonable to you that someone would write a positive review to get a free bottle of a product they really don&#x27;t like? Who does that?</li>
    <li> My skin usually dries from other tanning lotion, but this is very sensitive on my skin! It works like a charm, after using this - I noticed a straight difference on my skin and it was EVENLY distributed on my skin so it didn&#x27;t look odd. It left an even tone on my skin! Great product, will be buying more from darksyde!</li>
    <li> IT WORKS JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER SUNLESS TANNING PRODUCT ON ME, THEY ALL TURN A LITTLE ORANGE, IT MUST BE ME, BUT IT DOES COVER FAST</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this before I go into the tanning bed. The smell is absolutely wonderful..but the color you get with it is better than you are going to find trying to buy it at the shop. I personally recommend this for anyone trying to get more color!</li>
    <li> This product is actually perfect!, After one day of using this, my friends noticed my tan right away. After a week, I had a nice bronze color that I really love. this product arrived on time and has been a pleasure to use ever since!! last a long time too, gets my 5 stars all of the way!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about getting this stuff because I felt like the bottle was on the smaller side.  Now, after being told that I look tan after I put the product on 6 days ago... I understand that a little goes a long way for this product! I did not use a ton of this product by any means, but the tan has just STAYED so well!  I am really happy with the color, although I was a little freaked out by how green it looked!  It goes away when you rub it in, and I love the color and its lasting ability. :) I have totally been converted from the tanning towels because of the ease of this product, and the sheer fact that it doesn&#x27;t have propylene glycol in it! I break out in eczema when I am exposed to PG, so I was scared it was lurking in this product. Not the case! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommends this brand every time she applies tanning lotion an me being a man I thought nothing of it then I thought my mom might want to try it. So I figured why not so she did, and now she loves the stuff. She&#x27;s thinking of ordering another bottle or two for when she uses it next time, another happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great product!!  My tan is beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> i have been using this for about 2 weeks now. dries fast and minimal odor. the color is perfect for my skin tone. i will definatly purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! No streaking and I am always glowing and bronzed!</li>
    <li> Its a green color, mild smell, does not absorb onto skin, piles up into tiny clumps and rubs off (the ick forms quickly but is very sticky and hard to wipe off), MUST wash off or your gooey and flakey and no instant color. Tiny amount of color next day. GLOVES ARE A MUST! My hands were a funky greenish color and I had to use a pumice stone to remove. I want a refund. This stuff is terrible, I do not want the free bottle for writing a review.</li>
    <li> First off, let me say that the company offers you a free bottle once you have left positive feedback. Harrumph! This stuff is lousy. I feel it gives very little &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t appear to deepen with repeated applications. It also turns your hands black...no biggie really, as I just scrub my hands afterwards. The smell is somewhat off-putting as well. In short, I felt this was not a purchase I would make again,and could care less about getting a freebie of something I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been light skinned my whole life and HATED it! I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about tanning lotions/Bronzers. Plus there so expensive! But this one is cheaper than all the others and well worth the money, I&#x27;ve tons of woman checking me out more than normal and I love it.</li>
    <li> The green color at first seemed weird to me, but then it is the color of the tan that matters, and that color is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen from the self-tanning products I have purchased. Didn&#x27;t streak, didn&#x27;t look blotchy, lasts a long time without fading all blotchy either. It has a chemical smell that is a little bad, but seemed to go away after a couple of hours. I didn&#x27;t notice the transfer to bed sheets like other brands if left on over night.</li>
    <li> The tan color is great, I definitely recommend a tanner mit. I have an even tan (my arms are fairly tan and my belly is white as can be) and on first application I applied it on my entire body including my arms. It looks more orange on my arms and is a bit uneven (probably fault of my own) and on my next application I will only do my belly and areas that are not tanned. I recommend!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, no streaking washed off after an hour, two hours later the tan kicked in! Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is the greatest lotion EVER. I&#x27;ve laid twice and I&#x27;m super dark. I will never use another brand.</li>
    <li> Received my product yesterday and applied this morning.  It went on smoothly and this afternoon I have a great looking tan.  Hate to have white pasty legs and arms and this did it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> This was not a good purchase for me. Maybe it will work better for someone else. It comes out almost green looking and you can definately see where you are applying it, but there was no noticable skin color change on me. Hopefully I just got a bad bottle and this won&#x27;t be the experience for other people. It does have clear directions printed on the bottle.</li>
