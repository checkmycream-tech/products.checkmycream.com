      <li>Love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Nice size too</li>
      <li>Everything we tried would start out great, but by the end of the day her hair would absorb it so quickly, and it would become frizzy.  </li>

      <li>The product is 10x better than styling gel as it moisturizes my hair while also taming frizz.</li>

      <li>It keeps my hair soft and makes my curls beautiful.</li>
      <li>As for the product itself, it works great as a leave in conditioner for girls in the Natural Hair Movement.</li>

      <li>She has the most beautiful hair, but it is very curly and very dry.  </li>
      <li>This is used and loved by my curly haired teen daughters.</li>
      <li>I loved how it left myself and daughters hair.</li>
      <li>This product is great for women with tight curls.</li>
      <li>I am now looking for a more natural product.</li>
      <li>It definitely leaves the curls nice.</li>
      <li>The best part is it only takes about half a pump to use on all of my hair.</li>
      <li>but when I do I will most definitely be buying this again.</li>
      <li>You really do have to use loads of it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for the fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Im growing out my hair and this product really helps from letting my hair get all freeze...</li>
      <li>We love buying it in this big jug because it lasts so much longer than the tiny ones at Target.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
      <li>Works very well on curly hair, although doesn&#x27;t remove frizz completely.</li>
      <li>Of course this is such a large bottle</li>
      <li>So I only style my hair twice a week because I&#x27;m way too busy with too much hair to try and do it anymore than that.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and makes my curls pop without frizz.</li>
      <li>While I do not have to use an entire pump load, it defines and conditions my hair really well.</li>
      <li>If I use too much, I go around with &#x27;the wet look&#x27;, which I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear my hair down during the summer months, due to humidity, but I have been, and I love it!</li>
      <li>I have kinky curly hair that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;sit down&#x27; on my head very well.</li>

<li> I have kinky curly hair that doesn&#x27;t &#x27;sit down&#x27; on my head very well.</li>
<li> The only down side is that it leaves hair a little &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; (similar to if you were using a mild styling gel).</li>
<li> I recommend this product along with the deep conditioner to anyone who has dry, curly hair that tends to be frizzy.</li>
<li> I have four-year old African-American twin girls with long, curly hair down to their bottoms.  </li>
<li> I am a black female of mixed ancestry.</li>
<li> There is not one single day that I go out with them, that we don&#x27;t get stopped because someone is remarking upon their hair.  </li>
<li> I wash/condition my hair as usual, add a generous amount of this product, and I have my curls all day while keeping my hair shiny and not stiff (like mousse does).</li>
<li> The mixture feels a bit thinner than a smaller bottle, but other than that it still gets the job done!</li>
<li> I would definitely recommend to someone who has tight curls</li>
<li> One hand combed through my hair will take away the wet look.</li>
<li> One of my girls has tight curls and one has long loose curls, and it works for both.</li>
<li> This is one of the very few products that I have found that will allow them to wear their hair out (think Tia and Tamara from back in the day) without it getting fuzzy.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t do much better than some of the other less expensive products.</li>
<li> We order them a few times each year.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;ve heard anything negative about this product, don&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s also less expensive this way (and this is an expensive product).</li>
<li> 😕not too bad, but not great either.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> If you&#x27;ve heard anything negative about this product, don&#x27;t believe it.  It is AWESOME!  I have four-year old African-American twin girls with long, curly hair down to their bottoms.  This is one of the very few products that I have found that will allow them to wear their hair out (think Tia and Tamara from back in the day) without it getting fuzzy.  There is not one single day that I go out with them, that we don&#x27;t get stopped because someone is remarking upon their hair.  I so wish I&#x27;d had this when I was growing up; I would have never gotten a relaxer!!</li>
    <li> Works very well on curly hair, although doesn&#x27;t remove frizz completely. I am now looking for a more natural product.</li>
    <li> Product came, and it was packaged well with no leaks. The mixture feels a bit thinner than a smaller bottle, but other than that it still gets the job done! This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I loved how it left myself and daughters hair. Reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star rating is because the product has a silicon in it..... 😕not too bad, but not great either.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this product.It smells good and that&#x27;s about it. I am happy for those of you who do like it. I gave mine away.It&#x27;s not for all hair types. You really do have to use loads of it. It&#x27;s expensive and doesn&#x27;t do much better than some of the other less expensive products.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I tried many products for my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.  She has the most beautiful hair, but it is very curly and very dry.  Everything we tried would start out great, but by the end of the day her hair would absorb it so quickly, and it would become frizzy.  My daughter read about this product,and we tried it.  It is by far the BEST product we have ever used.  My granddaughter&#x27;s hair looks BEAUTIFUL all of the time.  People that see her comment on how gorgeous her hair is.  I recommend this product along with the deep conditioner to anyone who has dry, curly hair that tends to be frizzy. It is the greatest stuff.  My daughter does not shampoo my granddaughters&#x27;hair with shampoo (I have two now with the same hair).  She washes their hair with the deep conditioner (under the advice of a hairdresser) and then uses the leave in conditioner.  IT IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Great for curls!  One product that is all after a shampoo and conditioner so much better than the handful of products I use to have to put on my hair to style it - love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I am a black female of mixed ancestry. love this stuff. I hope they never stop making it. I wash/condition my hair as usual, add a generous amount of this product, and I have my curls all day while keeping my hair shiny and not stiff (like mousse does).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great detangler! The pump Makes It so easy to use. And my hair looks great after. Lobe it!</li>
    <li> Love it! We have been purchasing this for years. It&#x27;s the best product we&#x27;ve found for all our family&#x27;s hair types.</li>
    <li> This product is great for women with tight curls. The only down side is that it leaves hair a little &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; (similar to if you were using a mild styling gel). The product is 10x better than styling gel as it moisturizes my hair while also taming frizz.</li>

If I use too much, I go around with &#x27;the wet look&#x27;, which I don&#x27;t care for. One hand combed through my hair will take away the wet look. It&#x27;s also a great conditioner!</li>
    <li> Great product! It definitely leaves the curls nice. Frizz free. I would definitely recommend to someone who has tight curls</li>
    <li> Im growing out my hair and this product really helps from letting my hair get all freeze...</li>
    <li> My mother has curly hair and she swears by this product.... Its a must try for curly hair. i have even noticed the difference even the way my moms hair looks.</li>
    <li> Our teenage daughter and son use this religiously. They are both biracial and this product really makes their curls amazing. I wish it was a bit cheaper so I gave it a four but it is a great product.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Thank your for properly packaging the product. Thank you for the fast delivery. As for the product itself, it works great as a leave in conditioner for girls in the Natural Hair Movement. It keeps my hair soft and makes my curls beautiful.</li>
    <li> So I only style my hair twice a week because I&#x27;m way too busy with too much hair to try and do it anymore than that. And this leave in allows me to do that with no worries. My style stays all week and lasts until the next time I have to style my hair. The best part is it only takes about half a pump to use on all of my hair. Of course this is such a large bottle and I won&#x27;t run out anytime soon but when I do I will most definitely be buying this again.</li>
    <li> Life changing! I totally love it!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner! It makes my hair feel so soft and makes my curls pop without frizz.</li>
    <li> This is used and loved by my curly haired teen daughters. What a great product! We love buying it in this big jug because it lasts so much longer than the tiny ones at Target. It&#x27;s also less expensive this way (and this is an expensive product). We order them a few times each year. One of my girls has tight curls and one has long loose curls, and it works for both.</li>
    <li> Best leave in product ever... Many Compliments.... Nice size too</li>
