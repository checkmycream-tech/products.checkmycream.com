<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They are very sharp and do the job they are suppose to do.  Just don&#x27;t scrape too hard and try to have good lightening.  I cut my lip while removing some tartar because I was scraping too hard and my hand slipped. Other than that, easy to use and do the job nicely.</li>
    <li> I ordered these  because I have no time for physician visits, referrals, and all of that mess.  I was a dental assistant for 4 years, and went to dental hygiene school for a while.  I know how to use a scaler.  This set is very high quality, nicer than some I&#x27;ve worked with in the dental office.  The price is great.  Warning:  These are very sharp instruments.  One slip, and you could do some serious damage to your gums or lips.  Please, if you&#x27;re inexperienced, be very careful.</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These tools are super high quality stainless steel. They are actually a higher quality that you would find at your typicial dentist office. One word of advice... Please handle them with care. Do not pick up more than one tool at a time.. They are super sharp, and you will nick and cut yourself. I handleed two at a time to clean them.. I ended up poking myself..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Aside from that.. They are super sharp and work great with at home dental care.</li>
    <li> Great quality on these. At the time of this writing these were $34. That&#x27;s about $11 each, which is a great deal. I didn&#x27;t think I would use the other pieces, but the mirror comes in handy for sure.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping and have used the product. Would reccomend to others.</li>
    <li> Perfect shape and function.. so glad i bought them.</li>
    <li> Be careful they really are like being in a dentist chair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of product a while now. i am very happy to have found these on Amazon. They are strong,sturdy and, are of the same looking quality as in  the picture. A good buy!!!</li>
    <li> It came when it was supposed to.  Works as advertised. Very good product.  My wife and I find it useful.</li>
    <li> I used to use the cheap dental scrapper 3-pack you can get at most grocery stores but they were so cheap and dull it took forever just to get behind my lower bottom teeth; they would bend, weren&#x27;t sharp, and you couldn&#x27;t sanitize them cause of their rubber/plastic handles heck I even tried to but the metal tips but it just turned colors.  Like the majority of folks the most build up occur in the area mentioned above and there was no need to buy a 5-piece or more set for home use when all you need is one or two different scrappers.  Yes these are very sharp but they are legit professional tools and sanitized/packaged properly.  You need to be careful with these tools but thanks to their sharpness it takes very little effort to scrap off the crud so while they are more \\&quot;dangerous\\&quot; and costly than the grocery brand I save more time without having to struggle or accidentally poke my gums trying to get leverage.  Yes they are pricey but they&#x27;ll never bend or break like the cheap ones and since they are stainless steel you can boil these clean without damaging them.  You can&#x27;t do that with non SS brands so you&#x27;ll end up replacing them over and over spending more money when you could have these for life!  Only downside, if you are picky, is that their made in Korea but whatever.</li>
    <li> The best thing you can buy</li>
    <li> Difficult to use if your going to work on yourself... Ha..  Be careful.. They are sharp. Use them for anything really</li>
    <li> These really are quality picks that you&#x27;d find at a dentist&#x27;s office. Awesome stuff. I must warn people like me looking for just a nice quality pick for self cleaning. The scraper is *bold and underlined* INSANELY sharp. Be careful when scraping at your teeth with this. I would only use this for the really bad spots that you&#x27;re sure aren&#x27;t going to be scratching away bone any time soon.</li>
    <li> High Quality, exactly as described. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this set. I highly recommend it to any who want to do minor home care.</li>
    <li> High quality/professional level tools! I use them to perform touch ups in between cleanings and they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this high quality set of tools and a bottle of Plax Advanced Formula Pre-Brushing Dental Rinse to remove any specks of tarter that may form in between regular dental appointments. In my case, this may occur between my two lower front teeth. But, if you haven&#x27;t kept up with brushing and flossing, the plaque on your teeth has hardened into tartar, so do yourself a favor and see a dentist for a professional cleaning. It will be very tough to handle the tarter build-up by using these tools alone. In addition, you risk gouging tender gums with the two sharp pointy tools. Use the mirror for viewing the nooks and crannies in your mouth. There&#x27;s a lot going on in there!</li>
    <li> good quality. happy with my purchase. The hook tool is very sharp. be very careful.</li>
    <li> After flossing and brushing, my teeth are not totally clean. That is when I use my dental tartar scraper and finish the job. My teeth have never been cleaner.</li>
    <li> Save your money and buy the scraper, only. Mirror is for folks way more coordinated than I am will much larger mouths. The other tool does little to remove plaque.</li>
    <li> Went to the Dentist for a deep cleaning and got ripped a new *** 2 hours for the right side of the mouth. So I decided to order a Water pick and Periogen use it consistently for 3 months and my teeth feel cleaner but I haven&#x27;t been back for the left side of the mounth, I will let you know what happens.</li>
    <li> Great Product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great set for the price, will definitely last a long time.Very effective when used properly. I have been getting better results with removing plaque, than I did with just flossing alone.</li>
    <li> Perfect for getting those nasty areas between hygiene appointments.</li>
    <li> Wow, everybody should have a set.  My teeth have never been cleaner. I&#x27;m only sorry it took me this long to buy them.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Stopped obsessing about my next dental hygienist appointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because I didn&#x27;t want to pay a dentist for what I could do.  These instruments are the same that they use in the dental office; so, I was impressed. Great quality! However, I found them hard to use on myself, this is bacause tartar is difficult to scrape off. I googled and found some discussion on a product called Plax.  For $3 I bought a bottle, within one week of rinsing with it, the tartar (8 years worth) started to peal.  The scraper and mirror did the job of the removal.  My teeth are now cleaner than they have ever been. Saved a ton of $$$.  I would recommend these tools, but if you have 8 years of tartar, it will be hard to remove. So, I recommend a chemical attack in conjunction with the scraper set.  Hope this helps the next person.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of hard plaque buildup around my lower front teeth and I decided I&#x27;d try cleaning it myself rather than paying for a dentist. I bought this set and used it tonight...it works great and I was able to remove all the visible plaque in about 30 minutes. I only wish I&#x27;d saved some money by buying the scaler by itself, because I don&#x27;t need the pick or mirror.</li>
    <li> High quality just have to be careful picking around in your mouth.</li>
    <li> These tools are essential for my oral hygien. Brushing is not enough. So i count on these tools to scale what the toothbrush cant do. The tools are good quality and easy to sterilize.</li>
    <li> These are real professional grade dental tools.  Fine for dental work or use in modeling, jewelry making, etc.  Good buy.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with these tools</li>
    <li> Quality product.  The tools exceeded expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It is made out of surgical steel.  It is of the highest quality.  I would purchase from this maker again.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a request for my daughter for Christmas.  She worked as an orthodontist assistant and said that she could clean her own teeth!</li>
    <li> These surgical, stainless steel implements are exactly what my dentist carries.  I was pleased with the purchase which arrived promptly and were not overpriced.  Now I can keep my teeth tartar free in between dentist visits.</li>
    <li> It is okay. it takes some getting used to, and I learned one cannot or should not try to use these tools when in a hurry. It requires tme, patience and consistency to get noticable results.</li>
    <li> Serious Review; Puns Intended:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never did like the dentist so I did my best to keep my teeth and gums clean and healthy. But tartar still manages to build up; when you floss and there&#x27;s a snag, that&#x27;s tartar, or your tooth is chipped somewhere. These scrapers are pretty good and does the job in removing tartar.  If you studied a bit of dentistry, then you&#x27;ll know how to use these tools; Wikipedia and Youtube helps too if you&#x27;re not familiar. They are strong, sturdy, doesn&#x27;t require sharpening, and last for quite some time; had them since 2013. Definitely helps saving a trip (delays a trip) to the dentist.  But we should all still visit the dentist for professional cleaning, right?  You&#x27;d need to warm-up the mirror in water to prevent fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr Summary List:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stainless steel scraper removal tools; awesome mirror&lt;br /&gt;Removes tartar; requires skillful hand techniques&lt;br /&gt;Be your own dentist; save money&lt;br /&gt;Wikipedia and Youtube are your friends</li>
    <li> i never have to go to the dentist because i get very little plaque. i just use these little instruments to remove plaque. this set is better than the other cheaper one that i had that broke a while ago. my son is using one and i the other one and he is very satisfied,too. i will definitely buy from them again. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The reviews I read before I ordered these were accurate.  They are good quality.  They are very sharp.  They work really well.  Some people said leave it to the professionals.  I would also agree with this if you are not one for precision.  Don&#x27;t use these if you don&#x27;t have good eye sight or if you are in a hurry.  The first time I used these I was in the bathroom for 2 hrs.  I had a miner&#x27;s light on and magnifying eyeglasses.  When I was done with my teeth I felt like I had just seen the dentist. You have to be slow and methodical or you will hurt yourself!</li>
    <li> Very sharp. Not for everyday use. I have periodontal disease and have had the flap surgery twice in 15 years. These tools are scary. Use with caution. I thought i could use them to keep up on tartar removal. Sticking with floss and rinses.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. Just as pictured&lt;br /&gt;2. Appear sturdy and high quality&lt;br /&gt;3. Does remove tarter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - none that are attributed to these tools, however it is important to keep in mind that you won&#x27;t be able to effectively remove all tartar without the help of an assistant simply because you can&#x27;t simultaneously keep your mouth open, hold the mirror, flash light inside your mouth, and scrape firmly without tearing your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend it for inbetween dentist visits.</li>
    <li> These are excellent quality and exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an inferior set that is not anywhere near as sharp...and that turned out to be a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a chance to practice my technique with my inferior (duller/safer?) instruments and I feel much better prepared to be able to now use these far more efficient professional instruments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION:  These are SHARP.  Very VERY SHARP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patience is required.  Gentle action and Patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous informative videos on the net on how to use scalers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can remove tartar whenever it&#x27;s necessary and I don&#x27;t have to do every tooth in one setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use a Chlorhexidine Gluconate rinse that colors the tartar and makes it easy to see and thus remove.</li>
    <li> I drink too much tea and soda.  I know I need to cut back and my teeth tell me so.  When normal brushing, flossing, gargling isn&#x27;t enough to keep the stains at bay, this set is awesome.  They $4 kits from the local store aren&#x27;t good enough to get the tough stuff.  I would venture to say that this is professional quality.  Sturdy in construction and very sharp edges!!!  Tears through stains easily although it&#x27;s difficult to do it yourself.  Make sure to sanitize/clean between uses.  Only bad thing is that it doesn&#x27;t include any type of case.</li>
    <li> Great quality tools! Very useful for cleaning at-home in between dentist visits too. The mirror tool is better than expected and shows a very clear reflection.</li>
    <li> It was labeled Osung as shown in the picture.  Not sure what brand I got but it wasnt Osung.  I am returning it as soon as I can get the seller to give me the return address.</li>
    <li> They are made of metal not plastic. It is better for reliability because of the metal. Plastic breaks and doesn&#x27;t stand up.</li>
    <li> Needed for personal hygiene. Works as described. Fast delivery. Excellent product. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs it.</li>
    <li> These Work Really Well. I Thought that they would be a little Sharper. However The Get The Job Done. I Would Recommend Them</li>
    <li> They are a good set o f tools to keep your teeth clean. Also good for modeling small pieces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK</li>
    <li> Works well for gently cleaning between teeth. I purchased a cheaper version before but am more satisfied with these. Sharp, smooth professional grade.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of plaque and tartar and I use these tools to great effect in my effort for clean teeth.</li>
    <li> These tools came well packaged, and are of first-rate quality.  The picks are sturdy, easy to handle, and have a couple of different picks that help get areas you may have thought impossible outside a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> that it wasn&#x27;t that heard to do a little home care. One must be carful with this stuff as not to poke oneself or worse but she mentioned the choppers were look-en good for the care on the next visit.</li>
    <li> Works as described and arrived quickly. Its well constructed and very strong. You need to be careful with it cause its very sharp but it does the job very well.</li>
    <li> Good workmanship and stays sharp. Feels nice using them for teeth. A bonus option with these..... I have used them to get out three splinters. One was on an 11 month old baby and she didn&#x27;t even flinch. These are the go to tools for splinter removal.</li>
    <li> When using this dental tools I feel like a professional. They are of high quality and very easy to handle.</li>
    <li> EXACTLY what the dental technicians use, SO if you want to do a little &amp;#34;housecleaning&amp;#34; in-between your checkups, these do the job.  Of course, you MUST be very careful and know what you are doing.  IF you have no idea what or how to use these in your own mouth, then do NOT buy these.  You can do very major damage to your mouth and your health if you don&#x27;t know what to do and you hurt yourself.  BE CAREFUL.  PAY ATTENTION.  These are NOT for you to do your own dental work or dental work on others!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Was using the cheaper stuff from the drugstore, but this is 10x better, just like the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I had not been a real clean teeth kinda guy.  These have held up well and make cleaning my teeth easier and more enjoyable. The two different diameter picks are VERY handy - I hadn&#x27;t allowed for that.  Would certainly recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> This dental cleaning set was chosen because it is made of stainless steel,  not chrome plated steel.  The higher price and better material will pay off over time.  While the tools do an excellent job of getting into those hard to reach crannies that are difficult to clean with a brush,  it is also easy to injure gums and possibly to chip a tooth if not used very carefully.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s high quality and works great. It&#x27;s much better than the cheaper instruments. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use these a few times a day for picking my teeth. Far superior to toothpicks. The mirror isn&#x27;t that useful though.&lt;br /&gt;Beware the ultra cheap picks. They are unsuitable for anything but electronics or hobbies. These ones are well worth the price.</li>
    <li> These are the real deal and work well.  Price was good and product delivered fast. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in this type of product.</li>
    <li> Great at removing calcified deposits along teeth, particularly the bottom rears. Best when used within a good mirror, or a magnifying mirror, optimally.</li>
    <li> I am not a dental hygienist so I can&#x27;t attest to the professional quality but these tools are super powered for the lay person. I purchased these because I want that fresh from the dentist feel more often than every 6 months. If you&#x27;ve never used tools like these before, go slowly and respect the tools. They are super sharp and well worth the price. Once you&#x27;ve gotten your technique down, you can enjoy that fresh feeling in no time!</li>
    <li> These are profession tartar cleaners.  The metal is stainless and solid.  The tartar scraper works well.  I use weekly.  Came to my house fast.</li>
    <li> professional quality material!</li>
    <li> These things really work!!</li>
    <li> One of them was opened, disgusting</li>
    <li> Been using these and they have not gotten rusted and the material seems of good quality and would recommend it, just be careful as these are really sharp and pointy.</li>
    <li> These dental scrapers are of an excellent quality.  I would have preferred to order just the scrapers, without the mirror...however, since I started using the scraper, my teeth feel as if I just came from my dentist&#x27;s office.  I am sure that my hygienist will be impressed with my next visit.  And, it will take less time for a professional cleaning.  My mouth has never felt so clean.</li>
    <li> Looks great.  Purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I really like these things; the only downside is that I&#x27;m afraid of scratching off enamel, which means that the title isn&#x27;t meant to be taken literally. These things simply enable me to somewhat control the tartar buildup, which get especially gruesome behind my front bottom teeth, between cleanings. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re capable of more. Problem is, I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> Tools are sharp and can definitely do the job. I just wish there was another mirror? Its a bit hard to reach the upper teeth with just the small mirror.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a professional grade dental tools and this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Love even more that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and it&#x27;s made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;The German made is best but 2nd best is not bad.  Quality of this set is wonderful. BE WARNED... THEY ARE REALLY SHARP... just like the set in your dental office.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m scrapping plaque off places my dentist &amp;#34;assistant&amp;#34; usually misses or aren&#x27;t even aware of.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item primarily for the scaler as there isn&#x27;t much difference to me in mirrors and picks - but then I&#x27;m not a dental hygienist either.  However, I&#x27;m speaking about the scaler not the other instruments as they are fine.  The scaler is very thick - so thick that I can&#x27;t maneuver it between my teeth in order for it to be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I was gifted a scaler by a dental hygienist and it&#x27;s much thinner and works MUCH better.  Unfortunately I broke one of the tips off using it for something other than my teeth!  I&#x27;ve since found the numbers on it and I&#x27;ll be ordering a new one of those.  This one just isn&#x27;t all that great sorry to say.</li>
    <li> not a pro, just use it to do a lil clean up work between dentist visits. Still cavity free. :)</li>
    <li> The quality of the items are quite high. I have been using these for a few months now and they work very well. I almost always make an excuse to use them.</li>
    <li> Great set of dental tools, stays sharp and great feel. Well worth the money. Just be careful, don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
    <li> OK well prepared for theeth</li>
    <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.  This is very helpful.  Just be careful, they are the real deal.</li>
    <li> Love it, mainly use only the smaller one, but still a nice package</li>
    <li> Whilst I&#x27;m not a dentist, I do like to take good care of my teeth and I found these instruments to be of high quality and they feel like they are preforming the same as when I visit the dentist.  I paid extra for delivery and it was fast - from the US to Australia</li>
    <li> Do you ever want that feeling you get after going to the dentist and the tartar is gone from between those annoying teeth. Well, this does the job! Be careful! There are sharp points but that IS the point!!! Used gently and not too often, these dental tools really help keep the plaque from building up in areas that are more difficult to brush. A must for good dental hygiene.</li>
    <li> Very high quality tools for the what it is.  I really like having these around whenever I have to clean or check my teeth more carefully.</li>
    <li> As advertised.. love this.. be careful they can be dangerous. Not a bad thing.. just a precaution.</li>
    <li> I get good results at home. Be careful, these instruments are very sharp.</li>
    <li> This is a quality set.  I&#x27;m a fanatic about cleaning teeth and these instruments are perfect.  Good buy, will recommend.</li>
    <li> These are solid and of great quality for home use. I was quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them for anyone who&#x27;s a clean teeth &amp;#34;freak&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Expensive because of the quality. Good professional level instruments.</li>
    <li> I love the dentist and go every 6 months. I still thought these would be a great way to maintain perfectly healthy teeth. I highly recommend them. Get some spray to prevent fogging of the mirror in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I had a bunch of plaque and have been using this every couple of weeks to supplement my normal brushing.  It works; I&#x27;ve gotten rid of a lot of plaque!</li>
    <li> Love these tools. Gets the job done. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is the real deal. High quality.</li>
    <li> Worth the higher price, because these are pro dental quality, my dentist has these very ones in her office. Sharp..but stays sharp un like the set for eight dollars.</li>
    <li> Be v-e-r-y careful with these;  use light pressure and don&#x27;t nick your gum line - they&#x27;re sharp.  Excellent quality.  I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use the tiny mirror (creds to hygienists!), so I use the wall mirror for the back side of the lower front teeth and gently feel my way through the rest. I&#x27;ve used pics and de-scalers for years so I&#x27;m used to doing it that way. They really keep the plaque down between visits.</li>
    <li> I have wanted a set of dental cleaning tools to remove small amounts of tartar between visits to the dentist and these fit the bill. I am very happy with the purchase. They are a great set for the price.</li>
    <li> Works great for getting stuck particles etc. I hate the feeling of plaque build up on my teeth, so I&#x27;ll try and clean them off a bit once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I throw them in the dishwasher to sanitize them after using them. Seem very sturdy, happy with them so far.</li>
    <li> These are a good quality set of tools.  I&#x27;ve used them several times at this point and they have exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> The item was as described. It arrived in very good condition. Very professional dental tools just like the dentist. Use with caution. Very sharp. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  As with any sharp tool you must exercise care while using.  I would recommend to any adult who can use with care.</li>
    <li> These are good tools, nicely made and quite professional in appearance! If an instruction page on what to use each tool for came with it, I&#x27;d have given it five stars. As it is, I&#x27;m going to have to research, which would not be necessary with more info for beginners on how to use each implement to keep teeth clean between dental visits.</li>
    <li> High quality. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase !!</li>
    <li> great! strong metal just like the dentist uses</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I was looking to upgrade my supermarket quality scraper with a more professional tool to remove some tartar between my professional dental cleanings. These tools work very well, and I think the price is very reasonable for what I&#x27;m getting. One piece of advice: Take care when you use them. These are professional grade tools and I could see that it could be easy to hurt yourself using them.</li>
    <li> Good set. We really like them.</li>
    <li> High quality pro type stainless steel material to prevent rusting , very sharp . useful for in between dentist visits .</li>
    <li> I love this amazing tool picks set. easy to clean my teeth and help my teeth staying healthy. Caution! The edge very sharp.</li>
    <li> I am beyond impressed on how well these tools work. I will be purchasing more dental tools from this company soon.</li>
    <li> These dental tools may be a bit expensive (that&#x27;s I gave it four stars instead of five), but they are fantastic! They work really well to remove tartar build-up between dental visits! Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I was impressed with the quality of these tools for the price.I would recommend these cleaning tools if you like cleaning your teeth daily.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy stainless steel. I like it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care what other say about leave this up to the dentist...  I hate to admit it, but sometimes after a week long business trip, being able to really dig in and clean is just what you need.  Very good quality.</li>
    <li> Really like the feel of them.  Feels like they should last for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t gone to the dentist for a really long time then chances are that you have built up a lot of plaque.  If you are trying to DYI then one suggestion to soften up the plaque is to buy one of those Crest whitening strips but place it on the inside of your teeth.  Hopefully you have a steady hand because a slip up with these tools will injure your gums.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a Fantastic Product,of Exceptional Quality.It seems to be Very Professional and Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I Highly Recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Different designs and shapes on the handle. The mirror handle is very slippery.&lt;br /&gt;The pictures made for marketing are different from the real products.</li>
    <li> Great tools for scraping off the plaque that flossing mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The back sides of the bottom front teeth are always \\&quot;plaquey\\&quot; spots for me and I build up accumulation despite twice daily brushing and flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used cheap dental picks that break, or sturdy sharp tipped needle nose tweezers for a job they weren&#x27;t designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who doesn&#x27;t like to always wait for semi annual cleanings to remove dental plaque, I love these Osun&#x27;s !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plick off that annoying  buildup on Saturdays and my dental hygienist compliments my tartar free teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I bought a second set when I discovered how useful they can be for the oddest tasks such as picking out the tiniest wires inaccessible to tweezers but visible to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with annoying and recalcitrant internal WiFi antenna cables just got easier and I can maneuver the semi stiff and stubborn snake cables around bends while practicing good metal tool protocol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a great usage is when I have a loose tiny screw that can&#x27;t be \\&quot;shaken out\\&quot; either because it is inside a 4U server and impractical to turn upside down.  Keeping it and a strong magnet away from any conventional hard drive, I can clip the magnet to the handle and conduct the force to the tip and nearly levitate the screw out with  C curved hook.</li>
    <li> Work great.  Sturdy instruments. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Dentist caliber tools:  great for maintaining teeth and cleaning tartar in between professional cleanings.</li>
    <li> when I have idle time, its great to do a little maintenence on the old chompers.  My dentist also noticed the good results.  It cant make up for regular cleanings but it does help a lot.</li>
    <li> Really well made. The tips are strong and very sharp. The handles are made with gripper groves circling both ends. The mirror has octagon shaped handle for better grip.  I am very happy with the quality and price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some dental tools to take my dental hygiene to a whole other level, and decided to purchase a set online. I love using these to help get tarter out from the tiny crevices that my toothbrush misses. Definitely a worthwhile purchase for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my own use.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Received items very fast!&lt;br /&gt;Use all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this company.&lt;br /&gt;Anne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne</li>
    <li> This set really helps to improve my dental hygiene- reaching spots that brushes &amp; floss don&#x27;t touch. Just be careful not to hurt yourself!</li>
    <li> Well they come heat sealed in vinyl which is to be expected. Top quality, professional dental tools. The picks are all stainless without any seams, so you can keep them germ free. Since I don&#x27;t have sterilization equiptment, it would not be wise at all to share them. Super sharp and squared to remove plaque. These remove plaque from between the tight lower front teeth with ease. I take my time and go very gently. You can feel the removed plaque when you rinse. Great set, nothing like the rounded junk that you find for sale in the corner drug stores.</li>
    <li> These instruments are high quality precision tools, exactly like those you would expect to find in a dentist&#x27;s office. Although I ordered the entire set, I probably could have done fine just ordering the heavier tartar scraper alone, as I believe the lighter weight dental explorer is more for diagnostic purposes, and all I really wanted to do was get down to business and remove some heavy coffee stains, which the tarter scraper does with shocking ease. As others have said, be very careful, as these things are extremely sharp. Most of my problem was on my two lower incisors (the teeth right up front), so I found that I can see what I&#x27;m doing using a regular fixed mirror, while using the tool with two hands for greater control and precision. Because of this, the handheld mirror is only used to do follow-up inspection, and I find that it fogs up rather quickly, without the aid of the water spray that a dental hygienist would employ. Still, it is nice having the small mirror to see areas that I can&#x27;t see with a fixed mirror alone. Minor issue, but the packaging the tools came in was partially split open (the scraper and explorer were in packages similar to a toothbrush with perforated backing, and the mirror was just in a zip loc bag). Not a problem since these things can be washed or boiled to sterilize. Great tools, but use them with care!</li>
    <li> I love these! I use to clean my teeth and my kids teeth between checkups. My husband also lets me use them on him. However, my husband has taken my tools and now uses them to clean his guns.</li>
    <li> Good quality at this price, not bad.</li>
    <li> Loved it, if you are careful using it takes out the tartar out of those hard to reach places. They are very sharp so you have to be gentle when scrapping and taking stuff off you teeth.</li>
    <li> Let me start this off by saying these are not for the faint of heart.  You get 1 scaler type tool sharpened to an edge with two different shaped hooks.  You also get a thinner pick style tool, also with two different hook shapes.  There is also a small normal mirror in the kit (it will fog).  All are Osung brand and seem to be very high quality vs the grocery store versions of this kit you can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are WICKED sharp.  Be VERY careful when using these.  I bought them so that I could periodically touch up my teeth and maybe make my dental chair time with the hygienist less of a pain.  I am not the best of flossers.  I do OK, but not good enough to keep all the tartar at bay, so I usually spend some time under the pick during my 6 month cleaning visits that I don&#x27;t enjoy.  I started using one of those cheap grocery store sets to take some of the crud off between visits, and the hygienist noticed that I had been doing &amp;#34;something good&amp;#34; to keep the tartar down.  Well, that inspired me to upgrade the tools to something nicer.  These definitely fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned mine with soap and water, then rinsed with isopropyl alcohol.  I will be the only ones using them, so I figured that was sufficient for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do not come with a bag, I just keep mine in a ziplock under the sink.  Then I rinse and alcohol wipe them before and after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give them 4 stars instead of 5 just because they are so scary sharp.  Don&#x27;t skip the dental visits people - I can&#x27;t really reach behind my upper teeth with these, so I am just using them for the front lower teeth where the worst crud buildup occurs.  These are no substitute for regular cleanings.</li>
    <li> This set is what the doctor ordered.  I recieved this set yesterday &amp; used it last night.  My teeth were left clean like when the dentist did the cleaning.  Awesome product.  I highly recommend this item, with the use of Plax.  Plax loosens &amp; rmoved plaque, and the plaque that&#x27;s not removed, this set comes in and finishes the job.  Great combo, this set &amp; Plax, and your teeth will feel like you just came out of the dentist office.</li>
    <li> Packaging was good and products were shipped in good condition. Since its a race against time to protect our teeth I bought these tools. The metal they use is stainless steel #4 and are made to last. The tools are sturdy, sharp, and get the job done. Good for cleaning the teeth when the toothbrush and tooth-floss don&#x27;t work. Tartar gone! note that so far i have used them 2 times</li>
    <li> I am still learning how to use these fine instruments on my teeth around the gum line.  They are very sharp!  I have wanted some high quality dental tools for some time now.  Thare very well made with high quality materials.  Would reccomend highly.</li>
    <li> These are very high quality tools. Heavy duty. Sharp, won&#x27;t bend easily and will remove stains and plaque. Comes with mirror tool. 2 scraper tools one is bigger than the other.</li>
    <li> In cleaning teeth for someone who is bed ridden they have been great. I use them on myself too. You have to get close to a mirror to see well.</li>
    <li> Very high quality and very sharp which is what I expected after reading other reviews and the price. I&#x27;m not a dentist so I have issues figuring out exactly which edge to use but it is very sharp and works as advertised. I do go to the dentist but I get aggravated over the tartar that gathers between uneven front teeth...this does remove it.</li>
    <li> There is nothing better for removing the tartar accumulations along my gum lines.  In the months between my semi-annual dentist cleaning, I find that there are times I look at my teeth closely in the mirror and find light accumulations of tartar near the gum line, both on the front and back side of my teeth.  These scraper/remover sets are perfect and easy to use to scrape those loose.  I always used to find other items in the house to do this task, but I finally decided that it was worth having the dedicated tools for that purpose.  The quality of these seems top notch, and I only regret not purchasing sooner.</li>
    <li> Wel made.  Excelent at removin gany tarter build up. You just can&#x27;t buy this at grocery or pharmacy.  This is superior product</li>
    <li> It is too early to report how long these stay sharp but I am impressed by how perfectly they work and there is no comparison to the cheap set I previously purchased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been told I carry more protein than most people in my saliva so I get tartar buildup within a month or two of having my teeth cleaned. My dentist recommended getting a scraper for in between my cleanings. I ordered this set and both picks fit &amp; clean great in between my braces. They are a little pricey but they are nice &amp; sturdy interments. Extremely sharp so be careful around the gum line.</li>
    <li> I am going to keep it very simple.  my mother inlaw was a professional dentist for many years, and i handled the instruments she used, and these are the real deal. they are professional quality, very sharp-so be careful.</li>
    <li> High quality tools! Be careful they are sharp!</li>
    <li> These are high quality tools at an exceptional price.</li>
    <li> the set is made of very good quality stainless. I don&#x27;t have equipment to sterilize it and subject to high temps but from the looks and feel of it, it&#x27;s definitely not some cheap chinese stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because all the tips are too pointy/sharp. It would be nice if at least one of the 3 tools had a bit flatter configuration for more general scraping of larger surfaces. Literally just a tiny flat surface would go a long way. But they are all super fine pointy tips and good for reaching tight gaps and point type stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very good quality, 4 stars for the fact that tips are more or less designed for the same function which makes it difficult to work larger surfaces. The little mirror isn&#x27;t fog proof either which doesn&#x27;t help. Otherwise a good quality set.</li>
    <li> Very nice heft and finish. These are professional tool. Beautifully ground and very sharp!. Make sure you keep the ends away from kids or you finger tips. The do a great job of scraping teeth. I still go to my dentist regularly though!</li>
    <li> The dental tools are made very well.  Stainless steel.  All were packaged appropriately.  They seem like they would last a long time.  Would highly recommend to all my smokers and coffee drinkers!!!</li>
    <li> It took long to come, but it was worth it. The quality is very good and also it does the job very good.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the set that I received. Very well made, and they will last a life time. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s excellent. Be careful it&#x27;s really sharp. I accidentally dropped it into my palms. It has significantly got rid of some of the plague or yellow part of my teeth that I couldn&#x27;t get it out before.</li>
    <li> This is set of very high quality tools.</li>
    <li> Excellent set of dental tools. Sturdy metal and useful for scraping calcium deposits. Great quality.</li>
    <li> I use this about once a month to make sure nothing is getting stuck to my teeth, be sure to watch a video on how to use them properly or you will hurt yourself!</li>
    <li> now i can look deep inside my mouth and see crevices i&#x27;ve never seen before and make scratching sounds on my teeth that will raise the hair on anyone&#x27;s skin. what more could one ask for?</li>
    <li> These are great tools. They do exactly what they are supposed to do. They are very sharp and very strong tools.</li>
    <li> This is serious dental equipment that, now that I own it, I don&#x27;t think it should be sold to the public. It is SHARP and when it arrived, while pleased with the quality, was scared to put it anywhere near my gums in fear that I may hurt myself. I&#x27;m not trained to used these! I also have some concerns about how to properly disinfect them, clearly they should go into an autoclave. My teeth aren&#x27;t that bad. This purchase was fueled by a horrible dream about my teeth falling out. So unless you CLEARLY have plaque buildup, I don&#x27;t recommend digging around for it under the gum line with these instruments unless trained to do so.....you might cause more harm than good!</li>
    <li> Nyah!  These babies are sharp as the dickens, yet well made, mirror too, and will last probably as long as you have teeth to worry about.</li>
    <li> These are great. They are dentist quality. Since they are so sharp, care must be taken when using it, to avoid injury. They do what they are supposed to do very well.</li>
    <li> These are very sharp and actually work very well.  They are not a substitute for regular dental cleanings, but for someone with lots of tarter, they are great for inbetween.  Please be very careful using these, as I said, they are sharp.</li>
    <li> I have braces and plaque accumulates much faster, especially under the under the wire and around brackets. After being recommended professional cleaning on a bi-monthly basis due to my porcelain top brackets highly contrasting my teeth, didn&#x27;t want to add another cost on top of my orthodontia costs.  The scraper is very easy to use and teeth are not yellowing, compared to the white porcelain brackets, as prior to purchase. They are very sharp and high grade, so don&#x27;t waste money buying something at your local grocery store.</li>
    <li> I can clean my own teeth very good now that I have this. It is just like what my dentist use. You have to wash boil them before you use them. I do it before every use.</li>
    <li> For years I was using the cheap scraper you find at the grocery store. It worked ok but very hard to sterilize and would bend. Never thought I could actually buy a professional quality scraper on-line and glad I did. This thing is great, durable, tough, and easy to sterilize and will last me for years to come. I&#x27;ve yet to know how each end of the scraper works so I don&#x27;t poke myself. Last note, this thing is very sharp - almost scary sharp. Overall great product and will buy again if I somehow lose mine. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> The quality of the tartar scraper and remover set is that of the ones you see at the dentist.  So far, so good.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re into self-health, quality tools, and DIY dental hygiene this kit is going to please you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner and I are very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality seems to be excellent. I am someone who appreciates well-machined stainless equipment, and these tools are nice. The mirror and pick is a little light weight, but that&#x27;s just me being picky (no pun intended). The scrapper seems especially nice. I have a friend who is a dentist, and I&#x27;ve spent plenty of time messing around with the tools in his clinic. These tools are comparable to professional dental tools. The mirror is perhaps not quite as on par with the pro tools I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scraper can be used to clear plaque build up from around and slightly under the bum-line. The pick is used to check for dental carries (cavities / holes), on the molars, between teeth, and near on the face of the teeth (especially near the gum-line).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a small flash light, I recommend ordering one. It will make it much easier to see what you are doing. Better yet, install a small magnifying mirror with a light on the bathroom wall. Something like this should do the trick: [[ASIN:B001DKOAHK Jerdon HL1016CL 9.5-Inch LED Lighted Wall Mount Mirror, 5X Magnification, Chrome Finish]]. It will make a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prevent the mirror from fogging up (which it will) I recommend something like this no-fog spray: [[ASIN:B0012Q2S4W Jaws Quick Spit Antifog Spray, 1-Ounce]]. That one is non-toxic, and whilst I have not tried it (will soon), I think it should do the job nicely. Otherwise, the slightly amount of exhalation from the mouth will fog the mirror completely. The alternative is to hold the mirror under warm water until it is heated up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If looked through plenty of much cheaper dental tools on Amazon, and decided it was going to be worth buying these decent ones for $40 ($35 + $5 shipping). I am very pleased I did.</li>
    <li> The scaling tool arrived in two week from the time I ordered, it took longer than expected because I am in Canada Ontario.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the quality of this scaling tool is excellent, it&#x27;s stainless steel and it&#x27;s made in Korea I think.  Never heard OSung, but it&#x27;s an excellent investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that is missing is the instruction to clean the mirror, not sure if the mirror is plastic or actual glass.</li>
    <li> I hate drinking water but love green tea.  However, my teeth get stained.  Also, I&#x27;m prone to plaque build-up despite my best efforts at cleaning my teeth. These tools worked very well at removing visible stains and plaque.  It takes a little practice to feel comfortable using them - especically while you are looking in a mirror, but then it is kind of fun to see the stains disappear.  Great quality.</li>
    <li> I use these dental tools to remove tarter between dentist vists. At my last dental appointment, my dentist was impressed with how clean and healthy my teeth and gums were. This one is a winner!</li>
    <li> Well, they scrape, they prod, they poke, they clear away mouth debris.  These are the same tools your dentist uses.  They are sturdy, sharp, professional pieces.  The mirror is tiny yet clear.  You can clean your choppers with quality instruments like these, or you can waste less money on cheaper brands and hope they don&#x27;t break in your mouth or dull in two weeks.  Very nicely made with metal textured for a sure grip.  You cannot go wrong here.</li>
    <li> These are proper dental tools with surgical quality steel. The dental scaler is really sharp so be careful.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love these tools, Osung even has a video on YouTube showing how to use a scaler: watch?v&#x3D;M9alTi4Rk1w&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend these tools, and I will buy more tools from Osung. You might want to consider getting tools with silicone handles, though these all metal tools work great and gives a very good grip.</li>
    <li> High quality, we as a family of 3 children cannot live without it! This is a MUST for clean teeth!</li>
    <li> Very nice and fast shipping</li>
    <li> I now can keep the tartar building up between cleanings. The tools work very well. Impressed with the quality. Now when I am on the road and not near my dentist I can take care of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Good Product, Good Quality, Work Great. I use them to clean all the crud from between my teeth. The stuff floss cant get, these tools will for sure get it.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I could use them w/o a dentist around but now I&#x27;m definitely positive I will leave it to the professionals. Great quality but I&#x27;m ok letting the dentist do it.</li>
    <li> Awesome quality. With that you&#x27;ll get extremely sharp tools to help remove tarter and I would recommend this over any other set due to full quality steel set.</li>
    <li> Much better than the store bought kinds!  Love the quality stainless steel and how it doesn&#x27;t bend  when using it. Very pleased with it.  The sharpness is  needed to really get in tight places but just be careful.</li>
    <li> These are definitely the dental tools that are being used to clean your teeth when you are at the dentist&#x27;s office.  I gave it only four stars because I felt it was a bit pricey for what you get.  But, i wanted it enough to pay for this so, I can&#x27;t fault the product.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really gets the plaque in hard to reach spots. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This set is durable, not like the cheaper sets you buy at the drugstore. However, you must be careful using these tools as they are as sharp as the ones used in the dental office.</li>
    <li> These are perfect. They are exactly what I needed. I use them all the time. They are wonderful! I recommend</li>
    <li> I am not a dentist or in the dental field, but as far as I can tell just my experience with dentist visits, these tools seem to me just like the professionals use. They are not made of cheap metal, they are heavy enough to be able to tell that they are good quality, and the picks and scrapers are very sharp and work well at getting in between your teeth and scraping off tarter. If you are someone who is anal about your teeth and wants to do a little self-treatment at removing tarter at home and in between dental visits, this is a good choice of dental tools and probably as good as you can find outside the dentists office.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality and I would mirror what everyone else said... this is not a toy. They are sharp and you can seriously hurt yourself if you aren&#x27;t careful. With that said, my teeth are perfect and I can reach everywhere!</li>
    <li> Bought these to keep my teeth clean between dentists visits.  They work great on plaque especially behind the teeth.  Highly recommend but remember to very careful as they are sharp.</li>
    <li> The three pieces are not identical in design, but this does not affect the performance of the tools.  The handle of the scraper is ribbed, I suppose for better grip, but the edges of the ribs are actually rather sharp and a little bit uncomfortable in the hand.  The mirror will fog, but I just hold my breath for the few seconds I&#x27;m using it and have no problem with it. Overall, I am very pleased with the tools and would recommend them to others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these weekly for 9 months now.  The edges are still quite sharp, the grips are easy to hold and the tools get the job done. The angles are perfect for easy access.  I find them easy to clean, so I feel comfortable the next time I need them. Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  Nice quality SS so it should last for years.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to get some tartar off themselves.</li>
    <li> These instruments are great quality. The scaler is very sharp and contours well. I prefer a jaquette end to a sickle end on my scalers so this instrument worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> The quality, design and durability seem to be there. I have used the scraper a few times and it far exceeds the ones that you can buy in drug and food stores.</li>
    <li> These tools are the same/similar to what a dentist uses..... The pick and scaper instruments are good for maintaining clean teeth between dental visits.</li>
    <li> These are top quality, and a big step up from the target picks. Use with care because they are sharp!</li>
    <li> Love them... Superior quality .... Love the use between normal teeth cleanings!</li>
    <li> my dentist said you would not use these tools for scraping tarter away. they are used to explore. remember when you are at the dentist and they push down to see if the explorer sticks in certain parts of your teeth, well that is what these are for. the mirror is fine but that same mirror can be found for less than $5. this is a waste of money. I wanted a tool that can gently scrape tarter away by the gums</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous the first time but after I got the hang of it they did the job.  Love them.</li>
    <li> Just received these scrapers and am amazed at how much tartar and plaque build up they remove, have never experienced doing it myself but after a rough winter where I could not see what was going on with my teeth I recently was awakened to a strong need for these instruments.  Department stores dont carry these and we are blessed that they are available, they are professional grade the best that I can tell and work extremely well.  Like nothing I have seen before.</li>
    <li> I ordered from Brite Sources and it was missing the dental pick!  The quality of the scraper is good, but the pick is missing.  Maybe other retailers ship all (3) items as shown/described.</li>
    <li> They look good and appear to be of high quality;&lt;br /&gt;however, I use them only about twice or thrice a year,&lt;br /&gt;between dental checkups.</li>
    <li> Just like what you see in the dentist office.</li>
    <li> just fine when we need it</li>
    <li> These instruments are professional grade in every respect. Durable, sturdy, good texture to grip well, and can take a beating without damaging.</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with the product, it&#x27;s just harder to clean my own teeth than I thought. It does help keep tartar in check between dentist visits, and the mirror can help find things in hard-to-see places.</li>
    <li> Good set of dental picks but I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to use them properly. Overall, keeps my teeth clean and healthy.</li>
