### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair, but it still shows up on my skin.</li>
      <li>so the SPF is great.</li>
      <li>I bought this after seeing a make-up guru on Youtube using it in one of her videos, and I am happy to say that it is now my go-to product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Looks like I will continue my search for a good PA++++...</li>
      <li>and I loved that it&#x27;s not sticky</li>
      <li>I have oily, fair caucasian skin.</li>
      <li>very light milky texture smell pleasant</li>
      <li>Goes on top of my moisturizer (Cerave or Clinique DDMG) without clumping!</li>
      <li>this will extend things to about 3 hours, which is amazing for me-</li>
      <li>This is amazing for people with oily skin.</li>
      <li>Glides on smooth and feels great all day.</li>
      <li>Still, it feels very good on the skin, is incredibly light, and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>I love the matte finish</li>
      <li>I really love the formula and performance of this product.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>love my Skin</li>
      <li>Easy to apply.</li>
      <li>texture is light and watery, easy to rub</li>
      <li>But sticky feeling, and feel smooth.</li>
      <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;It dries to a fantastic silky texture, like primer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fantastic sunscreen with a fantastic PA+ value.</li>
      <li>For those with oily skin like me, it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Overall a great sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Invisible protection, super cheap and super smooth.</li>
      <li>While I cannot use this around my delicate eye area, it&#x27;s perfect on the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>This is not the kind of sunscreen you want if you are highly sensitive or prone to dryness since it contains alcohol.</li>
      <li>, how well this works encourages/reminds me to use sunscreen every day, not a bad habit at all.</li>
      <li>You have a loyal customer for life.</li>
      <li>weeks worth of use</li>
      <li>The texture is rather runny and milky, so applying the full 1/4th tsp isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly to a powdery finish and is very buildable in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, when you first apply it you can smell it burning like alcohol.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It dries to a velvety finish that keeps my sensitive, combo skin oil free.</li>
      <li>Really like this.</li>
      <li>It has a very velvety application and it&#x27;s not hard at all to build up to the recommended amount.</li>
      <li>Within a few seconds of applying it, my face started burning and turned bright red.</li>
      <li>This really makes my skin feel soft!</li>
      <li>Very small bottle and its to carry around, so handy.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
      <li>If you do notice a slight white cast, wait about 2 more minutes after its matte and rub/pat it in a little more.</li>
      <li>Fabulous powerful sunscreen that leaves very little white residue and feels virtually weightless.</li>
      <li>it gave my eyelids that dreaded crepe-y texture and the skin near my nose</li>
      <li>I do agree with the other reviewers that it tends to leave a  bit of a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34;, but I only notice it while I&#x27;m washing my face; I also have light skin, though, so beware.</li>
      <li>As far as the product, it&#x27;s all right, but I continue to be disappointed that I cannot seem to find a good daily spf that is not goopy and smelly; I am Nordic white with sensitive skin and two first degree relatives with melanoma--anyone have any recommendations?</li>
      <li>Other than that, this has pretty much eliminated the need to use powder, and I actually prefer going out during the day now</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s not a lot of product with Japanese sunscreens, but I highly recommend you look to other websites to import them for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen is definitely not for everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the super expensive sunblocks from Sephora and the Neutrogena Clear Skin Sunblock (which should be called Acne + Intense Burning if you Sweat Sunblock).</li>
      <li>This product was not the same as the image , not in english, old</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely pale, so I don&#x27;t notice a white cast, but I can imagine that most people will have a slight white cast.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and generally very dry.</li>

<li> It&#x27;s also irritation-free and can be applied on/around eye area with little to no problem.</li>
<li> I am a little torn about this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It leaves a little bit of a powdery finish, which can settle into creases and wrinkles around the eye area after a few hours.</li>

<li> There is a faint white cast after application.</li>
<li> My face is usually so oily within an hour of applying makeup-</li>
<li> Goes on like very thin lotion, shake it up before use, and blends in without leaving a white cast.</li>
<li> Delivery was very, very slow and bottle is really, really small.  </li>
<li> I would not recommend  if you are sensitive skin type, my skin turned very very bad after I used it.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird greasy feel or any sort of offensive smell.</li>

    <li> I wanted to like this sunscreen, but the white cast and the alcohol made my skin dry even with my oily skin. I love the matte finish and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. There&#x27;s not a lot of product with Japanese sunscreens, but I highly recommend you look to other websites to import them for much cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several already. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Delivery was very, very slow and bottle is really, really small.  As far as the product, it&#x27;s all right, but I continue to be disappointed that I cannot seem to find a good daily spf that is not goopy and smelly; I am Nordic white with sensitive skin and two first degree relatives with melanoma--anyone have any recommendations?</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a make-up guru on Youtube using it in one of her videos, and I am happy to say that it is now my go-to product. You have a loyal customer for life. I do agree with the other reviewers that it tends to leave a  bit of a &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34;, but I only notice it while I&#x27;m washing my face; I also have light skin, though, so beware. Other than that, this has pretty much eliminated the need to use powder, and I actually prefer going out during the day now so I can use it rather than having to prime and possibly powder my forever shiny/oily face.</li>
    <li> Fabulous powerful sunscreen that leaves very little white residue and feels virtually weightless.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. But sticky feeling, and feel smooth. Very small bottle and its to carry around, so handy. The volume is small, and it&#x27;s reasonable compare to the price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I found out it contains alcohol， so it might not good for person who has sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are some tests online states that this brand&#x27; SPF and PA+++ are not accurate, might not be only 30 instead of 50.</li>
    <li> Really like this. Glides on smooth and feels great all day.</li>
    <li> I would not recommend  if you are sensitive skin type, my skin turned very very bad after I used it.</li>
    <li> The ONLY sunblock that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I&#x27;ve tried the super expensive sunblocks from Sephora and the Neutrogena Clear Skin Sunblock (which should be called Acne + Intense Burning if you Sweat Sunblock). This stuff is legit. It works as a sunblock. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird greasy feel or any sort of offensive smell. The bottle is small and when you first get it you&#x27;re going to feel ripped off, but you barely need any and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Fantastic sunscreen with a fantastic PA+ value. This is not the kind of sunscreen you want if you are highly sensitive or prone to dryness since it contains alcohol. For those with oily skin like me, it is fantastic. It has a very velvety application and it&#x27;s not hard at all to build up to the recommended amount.</li>
    <li> Invisible protection, super cheap and super smooth. I have VERY sensitive skin and this is the one! Goes on top of my moisturizer (Cerave or Clinique DDMG) without clumping! PA++++ is key!</li>
    <li> YAY MATTE!  My face is usually so oily within an hour of applying makeup- this will extend things to about 3 hours, which is amazing for me- and then just blotting paper does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, how well this works encourages/reminds me to use sunscreen every day, not a bad habit at all.</li>
    <li> I am a little torn about this one.&lt;br /&gt;I love my Skin Aqua Moisture Milk White but it&#x27;s only PA+++ so I was hoping I could switch to this.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is light and watery, easy to rub in.&lt;br /&gt;It dries to a fantastic silky texture, like primer.&lt;br /&gt;However, when you first apply it you can smell it burning like alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;A weeks worth of use proved to be too drying to use exclusively- it gave my eyelids that dreaded crepe-y texture and the skin near my nose started peeling. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like I will continue my search for a good PA++++...</li>
    <li> Overall a great sunscreen. The texture is rather runny and milky, so applying the full 1/4th tsp isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle. It takes about 2-3 minutes for it to dry from almost a milk-like mask onto your face into a powdery matte. If you&#x27;re fair-skinned, you&#x27;ll probably notice little to no white cast. If you do notice a slight white cast, wait about 2 more minutes after its matte and rub/pat it in a little more. It&#x27;s also irritation-free and can be applied on/around eye area with little to no problem.</li>
    <li> This really makes my skin feel soft! I have combination skin and this takes care of my dryer sections and doesn&#x27;t make me oily either! I wear it under my makeup daily.</li>
    <li> very light milky texture smell pleasant and I loved that it&#x27;s not sticky</li>
    <li> Love this product. Goes on like very thin lotion, shake it up before use, and blends in without leaving a white cast. Feels like nothing on and since I use moisturizer and foundation, I like that this doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  No redness when I&#x27;m in the sun so the SPF is great.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. While I cannot use this around my delicate eye area, it&#x27;s perfect on the rest of my face. It dries to a velvety finish that keeps my sensitive, combo skin oil free. I really love the formula and performance of this product. I&#x27;m extremely pale, so I don&#x27;t notice a white cast, but I can imagine that most people will have a slight white cast.</li>
    <li> I have oily, fair caucasian skin. This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever found to dry matte on my face, even compared to other Biore products (e.g. Watery Essence). It dries quickly to a powdery finish and is very buildable in layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;1. It slightly dries out my face due to the alcohol content, so I have to use moisturizer beforehand.&lt;br /&gt;2. There is a faint white cast after application. I&#x27;m very fair, but it still shows up on my skin. This sunscreen will probably not work for those with darker skin.</li>
    <li> This product was not the same as the image , not in english, old</li>
    <li> This is amazing for people with oily skin. However, it has a noticeable white cast when you put on 1/4 teaspoon, even though I have an average Chinese skintone. Still, it feels very good on the skin, is incredibly light, and dries quickly. It leaves a little bit of a powdery finish, which can settle into creases and wrinkles around the eye area after a few hours.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is definitely not for everyone with sensitive skin. My skin is very sensitive and generally very dry. Within a few seconds of applying it, my face started burning and turned bright red. I suspect this was from the alcohol. Really unfortunate because this product has such stellar reviews.</li>
