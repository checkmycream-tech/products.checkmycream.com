    <li> I knocked my two front teeth out a few years back and now have a permanent bridge across the front. (They look nicer than my natural teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for cleaning between and around a bridge and are easy to take to-go too just in case something gets stuck when you go out to eat.</li>
    <li> They are small enough to fit in the tight gaps between my teeth.</li>
    <li> Would have liked it a little firmer so the wire wouldn&#x27;t bend so easily.</li>
    <li> These are great for complete dental care, and they are not available at stores in this area in quantity.</li>
    <li> Perfect for keeping implants and crowns clean.  This is a must if you have implants.  I had an infection in the gum around my implant due to the implant being hard to clean.  My insurance refused to pay the $800 the specialist wanted for antibiotic treatments for the gum.  The specialist gave me a bigger brush than this one and recommended that I clean the area better.  I went to the drugstore and found these brushes for tight spaces.  Within a week, my infection was gone.  Be gentle though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a good price here on amazon for these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy and use them.  Will save you lots of pain and money.</li>
    <li> Fits into the tightest spaces between your teeth. I use this product daily!</li>
    <li> These are great for tight spaces.</li>
    <li> Use everyday. Don&#x27;t brush without using last. Much better than flossing and it gets into very tiny spaces. This product is a must if you have any bridges</li>
    <li> My mom is literally addicted to these but the results are obvious when she goes to the dentist. It&#x27;s really helped her teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> These were recommended by my dentist to supplement flossing.  Very good price compared to similar products.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Still a little too big to the tight places in between my teeth. But works well, much better than floss.</li>
    <li> Bought these for the first time at grocery store. They work better than floss in my opinion. My teeth are close together and floss frequently gets stuck and shreds leaving fibers behind. No such problem with these.  They seem to clean very efficiently.  Am buying these from Amazon now.</li>
    <li> Very thin...  Goes in between the smallest space without trouble.</li>
    <li> Arrived early as far as the time. Good product. Especially if you have braces. Gets the job done</li>
    <li> I love these things.  I was having problems with my gums and my dentist recommended them.  I have not had any problems with my gums since I started using them.</li>
    <li> As expected. Very good for between braces or permanent retainers.</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re out at restaurants and can&#x27;t brush or floss, these little brushes are life savers. Who wants to arrive at the next appointment feeling like you&#x27;ve got stuff stuck in your teeth?  It&#x27;s easy to discreetly &amp;#34;DenTek&amp;#34; and you&#x27;re good to go.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> love these!&lt;br /&gt;they clean your teeth and gum so well</li>
    <li> Great for those tight spaces when you have braces.</li>
    <li> they do an adequate job</li>
    <li> These are a great product to add to your dental hygiene system. I hate flossing, so these are a nice alternative.</li>
    <li> The ends are made of wire which bends when you try to use these. The worst dental picks ever! Zero stars.</li>
    <li> I have used Dentek for quite awhile and feel strongly that they are good for one&#x27;s dental health.  However, since I first started using them and now it seems as if wires are getting weaker and weaker with each purchase and you are lucky to get one cleaning out of a brush.  Maybe that is the intention, however, if it is then they are too expensive.</li>
