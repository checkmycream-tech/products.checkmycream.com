    <li> We are a family of fair skinned people.  I started using Bullfrog as a teenager because I spent a lot of time in the son and in rivers.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy like so many other creamy sunscreens.  So far it has been great protecting my 1 year old son who is white as a sheet.  We spend a lot of time outside hiking and he hasn&#x27;t got burned yet.</li>
    <li> Bull frog sunscreen is the best i have used ..I like the way it Blend  right in To your skin without You Rubbing and Rubbing ..  It&#x27;s the Bastttttttttt.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen used to have  really good rating, however, it has no expiration date on it. I contacted the manufacturer only to find out that this was discontinued in 2014 and &amp;#34;may be&amp;#34; good for a year. Disappointed that this was not disclosed br seller</li>
    <li> No girly scents or greasy feeling, easy to apply, 10 secs flat, the tube lasts for months and months. Fantastic price for excellent protection.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product! If it weren&#x27;t for me searching for an anti-mosquito cream, I would have never found this. It&#x27;s a moisturizer, sunblock, and mosquito repellant. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a placebo effect or the fact that this product works as advertised, while my cousins got bit and sunburned, I didn&#x27;t experience those problems.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Sun Screen Protection. I have super sensitive skin and I love it. Also had a hard time finding it at any local stores. So Amazon saved the day for me. I use this always. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I can only bear to use water-based sun blocks, so that leaves a choice between Bullfrog and Neutrogena. They&#x27;re both good choices, but I don&#x27;t mind the Bullfrog aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to use the Bullfrog Instacool spray can (pressurized, not pump) for legs and arms, but this one works best for face, neck, and head. I also use it on my arms when on long road trips since the spray is annoying in a small space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness, I can only go by the label, but it&#x27;s OK with my dermatologist. I&#x27;ll have a better idea by my 90th birthday.</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen because the reviews said it would not stain your golf shirt .  This is good sunscreen but it does leave stains on your golf shirt .  So I won&#x27;t buy it again .</li>
    <li> Great for protection and doesn&#x27;t knock you over with the smell!</li>
    <li> As a fair skin father with fair skin daughters sunblock is something we are always buying. We hate the mineral sunblocks that ewg recommends. This is the safest non mineral available. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Goes on well, no allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..live in Texas Hot summers lots of sun I have fair skin, with hats and this Sheer Bull Frog lotion I stay very protected allowing lots of time to ride my horse and enjoy the outdoors, love having it come to my door, I order this all the time....worth it!</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! It&#x27;s not a heavy, pasty, feel-like-you-need-to-shower-after-applying-it sunscreen like a lot of others on the market. It&#x27;s very lightweight feeling. And I have yet to get burnt while using it.</li>
    <li> easy to apply... no white....</li>
    <li> It works excellent! Especially if you have skin allergies!</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen all-around that my family has every used!</li>
    <li> It absorbs quickly and readily with no greasy after-feeling. Works well but remember to reapply as directed.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and protects, but don&#x27;t get in your eyes. The irritation lasts for several minutes. Does the job of protecting your skin from sun.</li>
    <li> Worked great! No sunburn!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband to use. He has cancer and the chemo he is taking is very sensitive to the sun. He doesn&#x27;t care for it because it isn&#x27;t a clear lotion. I don&#x27;t have an issue with it being white. It still works fabulously. So if you don&#x27;t mind that it is white lotion, then go for it because it is very good sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I see my Dermatologist every six months.  Most of my skin damage was done in the 1940s and 50s.  But I still use sun screen to protect my skin.  The only Product my Dermatologist will let me use is Bullfrog.  I like it because it goes on easily and dries quickly.  It isn&#x27;t visible on your skin and does not feel sticky or greasy as other products do.  It is getting difficult to find Bullfrog products and I am delighted I can get them from Amazon!  Lot&#x27;s of sun screen products make you smell like a fruit stand.  Bullfrog doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable smell.  It is highly rated and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand!</li>
    <li> A++ seller.  Great Product</li>
    <li> Best sunblock ever will never purchase another kind again :)</li>
