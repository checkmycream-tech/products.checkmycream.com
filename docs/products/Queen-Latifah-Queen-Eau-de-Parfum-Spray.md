      <li>I love it thanks.</li>
      <li>Not bad if you like vanilla smell.</li>
      <li>Sexy and classy and not too strong yet lasts through out the day.  </li>
      <li>I like a clean fresh scent.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend to those who love a bit of spice.</li>
      <li>I SMELLED THIS FRAGRANCE RECENTLY AND REALLY LIKED IT.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a more mature scent.</li>
      <li>I bought it last year, I love it, small very good on me.  </li>
      <li>By far one of my favorite celebrity perfumes she really took the time to modify the smell the scent I just really fell in love with this perfume I mean its so good</li>
      <li>I like it, very fast.</li>
      <li>Thank you very much</li>
      <li>This is the second time I brought  this perfume like before I LOVE the smell of this perfume everyone sholud get it.</li>
      <li>i swear for 17 he is really funny about men Cologne</li>
      <li>i bought my first bottle from a mail oder house.....</li>
      <li>This is very heavy and strong, and very sweet.</li>
      <li>When I first tried it was strong during the first 3-4 minutes, then the scent turned into a soft vanilla type of scent and it didn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
      <li>BUT I AM REALLY PICKY ABOUT MY PERFUME/COLOGNE.</li>
      <li>The vanilla note is much stronger in this perfume than the reviews and description led me to believe.</li>
      <li>I would have expected it to cost way more.</li>
      <li>will last a long time::-)!</li>
      <li>My husband and I give each other love notes..</li>
      <li>teh perfume is too sweet and doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>Love this sandalwoodsy smell and it has hints of amber, dark and woodsy.  </li>
      <li>The scent is kinda strong to me and not very youthful.</li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>even my little brother love it...</li>
      <li>Bottle is nice and thick so when I put in my purse</li>
      <li>It smells nothing like Angel and is quite old fashioned, without being classic.</li>
      <li>I love the fragrance and the bottle was much larger than expected.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of its incredibly low price, but I was nicely surprised when I got it.</li>
      <li>Queen eau-de-fumes spray is way too loud for my taste</li>
      <li>I bought it only because of the high ratings</li>
      <li>When first sprayed, the vanilla smell is almost overpowering (to me anyway, I do not like the smell of vanilla), but after a while, the other spices come out and I can smell the sandalwood.</li>
      <li>they should have made it a bit bigger, other than that its worth the money.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my 16 year old niece when I visited my sister out of town last year.</li>
      <li>just right for everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wow!! Such class and elegance! I love this fragrance soooo much! I dress up and only use one spray! will last a long time::-)!</li>
    <li> Love this sandalwoodsy smell and it has hints of amber, dark and woodsy.  I like it.  Still feminine and I wear it when I don&#x27;t use my usual scented body oils.  (Essential oils).</li>
    <li> great perfume  catch everyone smell outstanding. I love it thanks. everyone I pass say what are you wearing smell so good thanks.</li>
    <li> But the scent does not stay long....For me.. My husband and I give each other love notes..When I spray it on my note to him..the scent is gone..and on my body...Not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> How to describe the subjective reason I don&#x27;t care for this scent? It smells nothing like Angel and is quite old fashioned, without being classic. It almost reminds me of body odor. For the price, it is worth trying, as many people seem to like this perfume, however keep in mind there is a reason it is so cheap.</li>
    <li> i was really excited to receive this perfume...i read a lot of reviews and read up on the notes and fragrance build. I was so disappointed. teh perfume is too sweet and doesn&#x27;t last at all. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this perfume for any one over the age of 20.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful and lasts for a long well. they should have made it a bit bigger, other than that its worth the money.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this perfume!!!  It changes smells the longer you wear it. I would have expected it to cost way more. The price was a bonus!!!</li>
    <li> Delightful Not too heavy; not too light... just right for everyday.</li>
    <li> i ordered two of them for a friends birthday party, smell great, and i&#x27;d buy more of them next time.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  It has a great scent that lasts all day long.  I highly recommend to those who love a bit of spice.</li>
    <li> The vanilla note is much stronger in this perfume than the reviews and description led me to believe. I&#x27;ve been looking for a perfume that contained sandalwood, but it is difficult to find that scent in women&#x27;s fragrances. When first sprayed, the vanilla smell is almost overpowering (to me anyway, I do not like the smell of vanilla), but after a while, the other spices come out and I can smell the sandalwood. I don&#x27;t love it like I hoped I would, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I SMELLED THIS FRAGRANCE RECENTLY AND REALLY LIKED IT.  IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT &amp;#34;THE QUEEN&amp;#34; HERSELF IS AWESOME, MS. DANA BUT I AM REALLY PICKY ABOUT MY PERFUME/COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> Exquisite fragrance, sweet, fresh, sensual touches durable, makes you feel like a movie star, I loved it. Totally recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> By far one of my favorite celebrity perfumes she really took the time to modify the smell the scent I just really fell in love with this perfume I mean its so good even my little brother love it...i swear for 17 he is really funny about men Cologne he says women perfume makes the girls go crazy when a man is wearing it.</li>
    <li> This is not one of my favorites and had I tried it in person in the store I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. The scent is kinda strong to me and not very youthful. I may regift it to my grandmother.</li>
    <li> Just awesome...this scent is just so uplifting and happy....i just love to wear it! i bought my first bottle from a mail oder house.....but found it on amazon when i thought id never have the opportunity to own a bottle again! lovvvveeee it...and so does my man!</li>
    <li> The perfume smells nice but got a strong scent. The box that covers the perfume, make sure it doesn&#x27;t slide out on you. I tape it and its on my dresser.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  Sexy and classy and not too strong yet lasts through out the day.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother but the scent is super strong, my mother hate it she joke what I ever do to you lol!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I get so many compliments every time I wear this! Smells great!!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Affordable &amp; it smells delicious.</li>
    <li> This scent stinks so badly in my opinion. I feel bad even using it as an air freshener. Gives me horrid migraines and smells so weird. Can&#x27;t even describe it. I bought it only because of the high ratings but I definitely should have given it a whiff before purchasing. It smells like a thrift store meets a rose garden meets rotten fruit.. Maybe I got a bad batch? I don&#x27;t know. It was horrible!</li>
    <li> A friend wears this on occasion and it smelled so wonderful I just had to have it.... Now I have people asking me \\&quot;What is that perfumed you&#x27;re wearing\\&quot;</li>
    <li> really good and impressive product with less price... it has soft fragrance what i love most... 100 % satisfied. very good</li>
    <li> My wife says that it Smells like the Lady Gaga that I just bought her, Great value, though.</li>
    <li> I like Beyonce&#x27;s Heat Rush and I like this scent.  It&#x27;s my back up scent.  I would definitely purchase it again.  It&#x27;s a more mature scent.</li>
    <li> I bought it last year, I love it, small very good on me.  People around me like it.</li>
    <li> I like it, very fast. Thank you for this product, it&#x27;s amazing and my mother will love it. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I knew, the person whose favorite drink is Tequila will create awesome scent, to satisfy many similar person as me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Queen, Thanks so much for great product!</li>
    <li> As always this is my fragance of choice and I couldnt beat the ptrice! I was happy with my purchase.Love</li>
    <li> This is the second time I brought  this perfume like before I LOVE the smell of this perfume everyone sholud get it.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Smells very sophisticated!</li>
    <li> This perfume doesnt smell good.  My husband hate the smell on me.  Sorry I bought it.  Love Queen, but not her perfume.</li>
    <li> To whom it may concern: I am very satisfied with the perfume I ordered! Queen Latifah&#x27;s perfume line called Queen smells excellent! I will definitely order again. I love the name Queen, because that&#x27;s what my hubby calls me. So the word means a lot to me each time I see it on the bottle of perfume. Take a chance order it today! The price is at a great cost!</li>
    <li> Gave to a friend as a gift she LOVED it. The Price was nice..</li>
    <li> smells great daughter loves it</li>
    <li> this perfume lasts all day long, and does not fade like others do. And for the smell, I cant even begin to to you how good it smells. A little bit goes a long way. I will be buying this again. I knew Queen Latifah would not make anything that smells funky.</li>
    <li> When I first tried it was strong during the first 3-4 minutes, then the scent turned into a soft vanilla type of scent and it didn&#x27;t last longer. Not bad if you like vanilla smell.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance and the bottle was much larger than expected. Would purchase from retailer again. Would also recommend to a friend</li>
    <li> Arrived just as ordered.  Packaged well and was great.  Bottle is nice and thick so when I put in my purse I sure knew it.</li>
    <li> Queen eau-de-fumes spray is way too loud for my taste I gave it to my 16 year old niece when I visited my sister out of town last year.</li>
    <li> was asked by a by stander in a shop about it, just perfect perfume. I love it, amazing smell!</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift to my co-worker last year and she loves it.  Will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this to give it as a present. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of its incredibly low price, but I was nicely surprised when I got it. Really nice sweet scent.</li>
    <li> tthank you very much, i  really love how it came in  the lil box and and i like that it came on time</li>
    <li> I like a clean fresh scent. This is very heavy and strong, and very sweet. It is almost nauseating. It smells cheap.</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t as aromatic as I&#x27;d hoped. It was just ok...</li>
