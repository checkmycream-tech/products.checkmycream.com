      <li>Overall I highly recommend this product - it&#x27;s given me lots of Good Hair Days!</li>
      <li>I bought this as a gift for my wife and made sure to purchase the straightener \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com LLC\\&quot; because I trust Amazon more than 3rd party sellers.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
      <li>I am thrilled with this product and would recommend it to anyone who has always wished she had soft, silky and straight hair!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
      <li>My advice: Do your research &amp; spend the extra money to make sure there&#x27;s a warranty!</li>
      <li>The CHI has ceramic plates and and adjustable temperature for only about 20 dollars more!</li>
      <li>I get frizz free straight style.</li>
      <li>It worth every dollar.</li>
      <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
      <li>This is totally worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>best straighter ive EVER tired .</li>
      <li>Of course I used heat protectant and made sure my hair was clean and deep conditioned before I began, but I am still going to be looking out for any damage that the GHD does to my hair.</li>
      <li>hairdresser was really right with this one.</li>
      <li>It is quick and easy to use and leaves my long frizzy hair sleek and smooth.</li>
      <li>also leaves my hair feeling Very soft &amp; smooth.</li>
      <li>There is a problem in the chord, it makes a funny noise and turns on and off, on and off, over and over again.  </li>
      <li>It was silky, straight, and as shiny as a Pantene ad!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a fake..</li>
      <li>it is 100% real!</li>
      <li>This is really nice, (not quite as hot as the other)  </li>
      <li>My daughter freakin loves this flat iron more than anything..</li>
      <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
      <li>the only problem I have with it is , I wasn&#x27;t able to register it on the offical GHD website, which keeps me wondering if I have the real deal..</li>
      <li>It gets hot really fast and my hair looks like I went to the salon and had it straightened.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely terriffic.</li>
      <li>i really recommend it.</li>
      <li>Ordered it and she registered it at the GHD website and it was a real one..</li>
      <li>bought for a friend a while ago and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints, so i must assume it is so much of the awesomeness.</li>
      <li>We bought this before and it works very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m completely in love with my straightener and would not reccomend any other product.  </li>
      <li>I originally was not going to give this product a review today, as I did not have time to properly use it to straighten my hair.  </li>
      <li>They heat up quickly and cool down well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have average sized hands for a woman and the joint of my thumb sometimes hurts when gripping it but its a small price to pay for a great flat iron.</li>
      <li>I wanted a 2\\&quot; styler because I figured more hair would get done in less time.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m highly irritated that I have to return it.  </li>
      <li>Wow!!</li>
      <li>think a little more explanation needs to be added to this website in order to remove all doubt for people.&lt;br</li>
      <li>They warm up quickly, they straighten efficiently therefore takes less time and causes less heat damage to your hair&lt;</li>
      <li>Without taking the time to properly straighten my hair, the GHD 0215 styler managed to straighten my hair in minutes - and I have VERY difficult-to-straighten hair!  </li>
      <li>I normally go to work every morning and just only take me a minute to straight</li>
      <li>I just purchased this flat iron and used it today for the first time.  </li>
      <li>I bought my first flat iron from a salon and this one looks identical.  </li>
      <li>The only straighteners I find that work and don&#x27;t damage my hair so much are GHDs.  </li>
      <li>After she used it, everyone asked her if she had a professional do it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also completely legit -</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also completely legit -</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly, able to register it, not good for short hair as cant style short ends the iron is too wide but good for medium length and long hair</li>
      <li>I have thick curly hair and it takes me 5mins to do and it looks straight, silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>This is my 2nd Ghd flatiron, the first one last 3 yrs.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it&#x27;s a red flag for any purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>For $200 I expected the straightener to be of higher quality and last MUCH longer, obviously.  </li>
      <li>i was not sure if ghd would work for my hair specially my hair</li>
      <li>My hair is long, wavy and coarse and it straightens mine really well.</li>
      <li>would not risk their name over a fake straightener, and because of my successful registration on the GHD website, I am not fearful of having a fake product anymore.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And yet my hair feels silky smooth, looks lustrous, and there&#x27;s definitely not as much frizz as there has been with any other styler ever!    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was a bit nervous about purchasing this GHD from Amazon, but as soon as it arrived I registered on the GHD site and it is 100% real! Then I got down to business. As I flat ironed small sections of my thick, coarse, african american hair, I began to notice something. The hair just fell through my fingertips. It was silky, straight, and as shiny as a Pantene ad! Of course I used heat protectant and made sure my hair was clean and deep conditioned before I began, but I am still going to be looking out for any damage that the GHD does to my hair. I&#x27;ve heard different things. Some say the GHD makes their hair healthier and some say it damaged theirs. I think that might have something to do with the fact that you can&#x27;t control the heat setting. The temp is from 370 to 380F, so if you have thin or damaged hair this might not be the iron for you. Especially the 2 inch, which is the one I bought. Since my hair is so thick it works really well for me but I can see how a thin haired girl might run into some trouble. Overall I highly recommend this product - it&#x27;s given me lots of Good Hair Days!</li>
    <li> I have wanted GHD&#x27;s for the last seven years and finally got around to buying them and let me tell you these are amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love them. I have Asain Indian hair which is quite thick and curly. These GHD&#x27;s were so awesome that I was done in 20 mins .They heat up within seconds and dont burn as they straighten. Absolutely terriffic.Please look no further. Totally worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I originally was not going to give this product a review today, as I did not have time to properly use it to straighten my hair.  But I was so pleasantly surprised at how it handled my hair even in a half-@$$ed kind of way that I just had to review it now.    Without taking the time to properly straighten my hair, the GHD 0215 styler managed to straighten my hair in minutes - and I have VERY difficult-to-straighten hair!  Imagine thick, stubborn, wavy curls with high frizz factor and a tendency to dry out.  And yet my hair feels silky smooth, looks lustrous, and there&#x27;s definitely not as much frizz as there has been with any other styler ever!    I&#x27;m completely in love with my straightener and would not reccomend any other product.  This is totally worth every penny.  It&#x27;s also completely legit - I registered it on the site last night!</li>
    <li> gave this to my wife.  After she used it, everyone asked her if she had a professional do it.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly, able to register it, not good for short hair as cant style short ends the iron is too wide but good for medium length and long hair</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife and made sure to purchase the straightener \\&quot;Ships from and sold by Amazon.com LLC\\&quot; because I trust Amazon more than 3rd party sellers.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the straightener arrived, I successfully registered it on the GHD website and received a confirmation email from GHD saying \\&quot;thank you for registering your product, your guarantee has now been activated.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Because I trust Amazon would not risk their name over a fake straightener, and because of my successful registration on the GHD website, I am not fearful of having a fake product anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I question why this straightener does not have a hologram sticker/code on the power cord.  The only hologram is on the inside face of the handle, next to the date code.&lt;br /&gt;The box was not sealed shut in any way.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal, but it&#x27;s a red flag for any purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the GHD website says amazon.com is an authorized url in Europe.  It does not mention the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most things check out: the design details of the straightener, the way it operates, the fact that GHD accepted the registration, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But why is the hologram sticker missing from the chord?  Why is amazon.com not listed as an authorized seller in the U.S.?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a little more explanation needs to be added to this website in order to remove all doubt for people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no review of the performance of the product yet, but will update when my wife voices her opinion.</li>
    <li> The product is great and is registered as a genuine GHD.  It heats up and straightens much quicker than previously owned straighteners.  The only thing to note is that you will need a US power plug converter if you are in a country outside the US.  The product arrived a week before the expected delivery time so I was very pleased with that.</li>
    <li> i was not sure if ghd would work for my hair specially my hair kind of wavy i bought it last year and loved the result but it did not last i used it about one to two times a week and after about 4 month stopped working i though of returnig it but i have no clue how to do it my fried just told me i need to contact amazon and see if i can change it please help i just enjoyed that tool for maximum of 4 month i paid $150.00.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product and would recommend it to anyone who has always wished she had soft, silky and straight hair! It&#x27;s also completely legit - I registered it on the GHD site!</li>
    <li> The GHD Salon Styler Ceramic Styling iron 2 in. is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. This iron was recommended to me by my hairdresser at Vidal Sassoon in NYC. I&#x27;ve tried salano, chi and many more, but this iron retains its heat the best. I have long, thick, wavy hair and I only have to swipe my hair with the iron a few times before it&#x27;s completely straight. The heat does not fade. Plus, it has a 30 minute automatic shut off feature if you forget to turn it off. The one complaint I have about it, is it&#x27;s design. I wish it&#x27;s shaft were a little more narrow or thin. I have average sized hands for a woman and the joint of my thumb sometimes hurts when gripping it but its a small price to pay for a great flat iron. Aside from that, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.</li>
    <li> Ordered it and she registered it at the GHD website and it was a real one.. It&#x27;s not a fake.. Maybe some are but this one wasn&#x27;t.. My daughter freakin loves this flat iron more than anything..</li>
    <li> I am unable to register my product...I cant find a code anywhere yet I was told Amazon is an authorized GHD seller...I am worried my GHD is not real</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought. My hair is thick and curly and this iron does the job effortless. I don&#x27;t need to pass the iron through my hair so many times to straighen. I get frizz free straight style. It&#x27;s an amazing product. It worth every dollar.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner!! the only problem I have with it is , I wasn&#x27;t able to register it on the offical GHD website, which keeps me wondering if I have the real deal.. but other then that it works great on my hair! I have real spanish curly hair, and it does the job!</li>
    <li> This styler is a genuine product, as soon as i got it i registered it on the official Ghd website with no problems. As with all Ghd&#x27;s, it is flawless in its stlying abilities. It is quick and easy to use and leaves my long frizzy hair sleek and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love my new hair straightener!! It now takes me a lot less time to straighten my hair and it lasts much longer, recommend this product to anyone that is thinking about getting one. This is a case of bargain price for a fantastic product!!</li>
    <li> The product worked well a couple times and then stopped working all together.  I had it for less than two weeks.  For $200 I expected the straightener to be of higher quality and last MUCH longer, obviously.  I&#x27;m highly irritated that I have to return it.  I&#x27;ll be going with another brand.</li>
    <li> This flat iron has aluminum plates which can damage your hair. There is also NO adjustable heat setting which means that if you desire a lower temperature so as not to damage your hair that is impossible. I tried this product, and the Paul Mitchell flat iron...and I don&#x27;t know why!!! The CHI is the BEST! Don&#x27;t let the hype sway you! It&#x27;s not worth it! The CHI has ceramic plates and and adjustable temperature for only about 20 dollars more!</li>
    <li> I have this item for like a year already. And I have this thick natural curl hair. I love GHD in general but this 2 inches fits better. I normally go to work every morning and just only take me a minute to straight my hair using this. I just love GHD. did not give me any problems at all</li>
    <li> They warm up quickly, they straighten efficiently therefore takes less time and causes less heat damage to your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them</li>
    <li> I just purchased this flat iron and used it today for the first time.  Wow!! It gets hot really fast and my hair looks like I went to the salon and had it straightened.  I think the 2 inch plates make a huge difference.  I have course, curly hair that is usually hard to straighten.  I am not a big review person but I feel like this product deserves praise.</li>
    <li> bought for a friend a while ago and haven&#x27;t heard any complaints, so i must assume it is so much of the awesomeness.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this hair straightener in the past &amp; after about a year it completely stopped working where it would not turn on. I figured it was just old &amp; bought another one less than 2 months ago to replace it. It works great.. as long as it doesn&#x27;t just stop turning on! It happened again so I contacted the original seller as it suggests on Amazon&#x27;s website. I received an e-mail informing me that they only have a 30 day return policy &amp; there was nothing they could do. I contacted Amazon, who told me to contact the manufacturer as there should be a warranty on it. GHD informed me that Amazon is not an authorized retailer &amp;, therefore, GHD does not warranty the straightener. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a broken flat iron &amp; I wasted over $100. Dpn&#x27;t be fooled by the lower price on Amazon. My advice: Do your research &amp; spend the extra money to make sure there&#x27;s a warranty!</li>
    <li> i love this item !! i have VERY thick hair &amp; it straightens it in minutes. also leaves my hair feeling Very soft &amp; smooth. best straighter ive EVER tired .</li>
    <li> We bought this before and it works very well.  But life span is only 1 year.  We use it daily.</li>
    <li> This styler works well on long thick hair. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she took it back to school with her in Australia. She used it and it did a great job.</li>
    <li> I was able to register the product on the ghd website.  The hologram is not on the cord. Not sure where others heard it should be.  I bought my first flat iron from a salon and this one looks identical.  Hologram in same place, between the handle.  Love this flat iron.  I have the 1 inch and decided to try the 2 inch.</li>
    <li> I have crazy frizzy big curly hair.  The only straighteners I find that work and don&#x27;t damage my hair so much are GHDs.  The dual voltage is great for me as I travel so much so I never have to buy another pair.  They heat up quickly and cool down well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Ghd flatiron, the first one last 3 yrs.  It was great.  This is really nice, (not quite as hot as the other)  -but does a nice job and pretty quickly - so overall I think its less damaging.</li>
    <li> Amazing straightner! I have thick curly hair and it takes me 5mins to do and it looks straight, silky and smooth. It&#x27;s a must buy!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Great product - I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> these are the second order i do for my friends as they asked for it, its an amazing, nice and gentle on hair. i really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener when it worked....which was only 3 months.  I have to have my hair in a bun for work, so I only used the straightener for 2 days out of the week (on my days off), this straightener had very little usage before it started malfunctioning.  There is a problem in the chord, it makes a funny noise and turns on and off, on and off, over and over again.  It&#x27;s very frustrating.  The seller said to contact the manufacturer, the manufacturer said Amazon is not an authorized seller for GHD so they won&#x27;t repair or replace the straightener.  I called Amazon and they said they would get a refund for me....then I got an e-mail that the claim was denied.  The manufacturer said I would have to contact my credit card company to dispute the charge, so I guess that&#x27;s my next step.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy another straightener through Amazon since you will be left high and dry if it peters out on you like mine did.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many hair straighteners I have been through. Amazon sends me tons of them to review and they are all junk! I was always told that the best one out there was a CHI, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always used, but I had asked my hairdresser what kind she had, because my hair always comes out so good when she straightens it for me. She told me it was a GHD hair straightener, so I decided to look for it online and I ended up buying this one. I wanted a 2\\&quot; styler because I figured more hair would get done in less time. I can&#x27;t even tell you how much I LOOOOVE this product!!! It works awesome!! It makes my hair super silky smooth in seconds. My hair is long, wavy and coarse and it straightens mine really well. I will never buy anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser was really right with this one. Even the salon owner said after trying a GHD, that&#x27;s all she uses now. It&#x27;s really a great product and worth every penny. You&#x27;re definitely gonna have a \\&quot;Good Hair Day\\&quot; with this one :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, smooth transaction. I would purchase again and would recommend. Also the item was just as described online.</li>
