<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good product! Lives my under eyes moisturized and more alive. Recommended for everyone!</li>
    <li> I just received this item. Amazing packaging fast shipping. Very large size. Should last a long time. I checked out the ingredients, it has so much good stuff in it should do what it says it should do. Nice lightweight texture cream for around the eyes. Not too greasy. I hope it will lighten those nasty dark under eye circles. I think I already see the difference. Very highly rated and recommended. The pricing is great so why not give it a try?!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to reduce the bags under my eyes.  This did nothing for me:( I will keep looking. This might work for circles or some other kind of problem.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  The product feels so silky and smooth going on, but yet it provides just enough moisture that you know it&#x27;s working.  The tube is huge and will last forever.  The smell is great too.  It feels very nice and the price is right too.  I would put this to bat with any super expensive department store brand.  I have tried them all, and I am hooked!  Try it.</li>
    <li> After reading the positive reviews for this product I decided to buy it and try it for my dark circles. After using it for 75 days, I&#x27;m disappointed to say that it hasn&#x27;t brightened my dark circles at all. I have noticed that it makes the light reflect off of my skin more so that my dark circles appear brighter, but at the end of the day they&#x27;re still there. Sad face.</li>
    <li> Purchased in February 2011 and, over six months later, my eyelid skin is smoother, plumper and I even have noticeable eyelashes peeping out from the bottom of my top lid - I had not seen &#x27;em in years.  After about one month of use, in March 2011, I had my regular yearly eye exam and the technician was easily able to take the Optos scan of my retinas since my eyelid skin was no longer so saggy (there was no scan in 2010 for that reason).  Even though the under-eye dark circles didn&#x27;t vanish (these ARE less noticeable, though), I&#x27;m very, very pleased with the entire Sweetsations Therapy line and especially with this little product.  And a very, very small amount is plenty for my eyelid and under-eye area, with a bit left over to pat on my lips as well. The single tube with its nifty applicator lasted for six solid months so is quite a bargain compared with the other eye cream I was using!  Thanks, Sweetsations Therapy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent a LOT of money on eye creams and this was by far the best buy.  This is a fantastic primer as well as an eye cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t even need to use a primer with this moisturizer for my concealer.  It plumps up fine lines all day and the area stays moist but never greasy.  Very impressed and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff so much I actually use it on my entire face! Unfortunately, this makes it very expensive! :( It smells divine and it is just light enough so that my oily skin doesn&#x27;t break out. Trust me, this is the ONLY moisturizer type product I have used that doesn&#x27;t break me out. My skin is SO sensitive. It definitely brightens up my under eye circles and helps a bit with puffiness. I put it on once a day, at night. Between the smell and just the way it goes on...it&#x27;s like a spa treatment to myself, everyday. My skin will be GLOWING in the morning. I will figure out a way to budget this little tube into my life for the long term if it&#x27;s the last thing I do!</li>
    <li> I have finally found a product line that I am thrilled with in every way!  Sweetsation Therapy is a company that values what I value: Organic products, nourishing natural ingredients, recyclable containers, caring customer service and easy to use applicators that are all sealed with tamper proof plastic so that I know the product has arrived intact and ready to use.  I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment helps the area around my eyes continue to look youthful and refreshed.  I can use I*Light, and other products in the Sweetsation line, without any triggering of my severe eczema.  I constantly look for products that not only help me age well and care for my skin, but that do not contain strange chemicals, perfumes, or inorganic ingredients that are likely to cause my eczema to spin out of control.  Rarely do I find a line that is organic AND affordable!  I highly recommend I*Light and the complete Sweetsation Therapy line of products to women of all ages, and even to men. Your skin will love you for it :)</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on all the excellent reviews, and because I am trying to use more natural products with less scary chemicals.  I had been using Stri-Vectin most often, occasionally trying other things.  This product, without any petro or other chemicals, is absolutely amazing and puts everything else I have tried to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only a fraction of a pump, and the pump mechanism is great quality and reacts quickly to stop releasing product when you are satisfied with the amount on your finger.  I loved the recommendation to use the ring finger to apply because it is the weakest finger, it does seem to be much gentler.  It smooths the skin and seems to minimize eye bags (as much as they can really be minimized).  It is a little bit oily, so it should be used as far in advance of using mascara as possible to avoid eyelash clumping.  My skin quality looks like it is actually improved from using this, fine lines are kept hydrated so they do not look as visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will become a regular product for me, and I am looking forward to trying other products from this company.</li>
    <li> I only use organic bath and skin care products because I&#x27;m a mom, a working mom, with dark circles under, on top of and around BOTH my eyes, so when I received this and read about the natural safe ingredients that I could use that wouldn&#x27;t hurt my son (what goes on your skin, goes in it and I&#x27;m still nursing), it was a double blessing. I had to wash my face and try it immediately. It DOES not take the whole bottle to see results unlike some other products which intentionally mislead you into believing that by the end of the bottle your skin problem will be resolved when in fact it will take 2-3 bottles to possibly work. I did have some fine line at the corners of my eyes that aren&#x27;t as visible to me anymore. It lasts a LONG time, after three weeks of  twice daily application, I stopped mindlessly applying the amount I had been using on each eye area every day and didn&#x27;t see any negative changes because of the reduction. I noticed the sunken eye look was near gone about 3 weeks in. Here&#x27;s a tip: if you have a sleep mask with interior eye chambers (spacing carved out in the mask to allow free eye movement esp during REM sleep) put one of them on and you will not have to worry about the product wiping off on your pillow if you happen to put the cream on RIGHT before or while you are in bed (I work fulltime and I have a 11 mo old son, by bedtime, I am downright lazy - don&#x27;t judge!) My husband now uses it too at night. This is a fantastic value for the price.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for natural and preservative( paraben and phalates ) free skin care  products for a while and found Sweetsation and decided to try it.  I have combination skin and fine lines and dark circles around my eyes and loved the \\&quot;I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment\\&quot;. I kept my eye are soft &amp; hydrated, brightenend it, and I also saw a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I like the packaging too as a little bit comes out with one pump which is enough for both eyes. I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is a miracle!  I&#x27;ve tried many creams, but this has been the only one that actually works.  My under eye dark circles and puffiness are complete gone.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other Sweetsation products and I have been just as happy.  I definitely will purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sweetsation products for several years now and will continue to do so because each product performs as advertised and is well-priced.  I use Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye treatment every morning and it is wonderful in eliminating under eye puffiness while brightening the eye area in a gentle treatment.  It soothes this very sensitive area around my eyes and does not cause an allergic reaction, which is a problem I have had with many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; skin products.  I also noticed the darkness under the eyes is eliminated after using the product for several weeks.  I give Advanced Brightening &amp; line Smoothing Eye Treatment five stars!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace an expensive department store line that did not meet my expectations. I have been really pleased with the Sweetsation I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment and have already re-ordered several times. This product applies smoothly and leaves a pleasant, invigorating sensation. Make-up applies easily over this eye treatment - another benefit. Great product! Will continue to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KC</li>
    <li> Any type of facial/eye cream is so hard to rate.  I honestly have no idea if it is helping with lines or wrinkles, but I will continue to buy it.  Why?  Because it works great to put a little on before applying eye concealer.  I have tried many moisturizer type creams to place under eyes before adding a concealer and some were too oily, to thick or just not right.  But, this is great under concealer and it won&#x27;t cake up under your eyes...even when hot.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best product to repair the darkness under the eye I have tried so many products and with this one there is NO NEED to look any further I have tried some products and actually made it worse but this product is the one I&#x27;ve been searching for.HALLELUJAH an eye product that actually works I&#x27;m so happy with this product I&#x27;m telling all my friends and family so they can try it too.</li>
    <li> This is another awesome product from Sweetsation Therapy.  I ordered this along with Lumi Essence Organic Lightening Treatment and literally fell in love with both products.  Where do I begin?  The texture, the lightness, the way it absorbs your skin and the scent are incredible!!  I use it twice a day, in the morning and under Aqua Tica Organic Night Cream (another fave of mine).  After having used it for approx. 2 months, the difference is huge. No dark circles even if I didn&#x27;t have a good night sleep, no puffiness after a night out and definitely less wrinkles.  I also apply it above my upper lip to prevent those ugly vertical lines from forming ;).  My skin never looked so beautiful! Give these amazing products a try, I promise, you will not want to use anything else, because they are that good!!!</li>
    <li> I actually use this on my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had run out of my usual night cream after taking a shower one night and saw I had sample of this stuff so I decided to try it. Sweetsation products are all natural after all, and I figured since it was safe enough for use on the eye area which is delicate, it would be ok on the rest of my face. I put it on. It had a fresh, organic, subtle, earthy scent and the consistency was light but luxurious and spread easily and evenly. I woke up the next morning, I examined my face, washed up &amp; reapplied under my usual makeup routine (examined my face like I usually do after trying a new product.. did it work yet? :p) and didn&#x27;t note anything unusual. However, when I went into work that morning I received a compliment from my co worker. Well it wasn&#x27;t really a compliment at first, but rather, an \\&quot;Oh my god! What do you have on your face?\\&quot; To which I probably gave an odd look because I had no idea what she was on about, \\&quot;Your face, it&#x27;s like glowing, it looks perfect!\\&quot; At first I was confused as I didn&#x27;t think that single or so application was the culprit. I do expect miracles from products sometimes, but seriously? My co-worker, with a look of total disbelief, came up very closely to my face, and she was just in awe. I explained the phenomena to which she went on to say how my face looked like there was nothing wrong with it at all, that I had absolutely not a single flaw on my face. This seemed a bit odd, but it was utterly lovely to hear, and it made a little excited at the thought that I had found a miracle gem of a cream. I was mostly stunned at how big of a reaction she had made to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin; oily t-zone, with dry, enlarged pores on my cheeks and the occasional popped zit mark here and there. The skin under my eye area is thinning out, and is slightly gray and hollow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another co-worker, a male this time, also agreed with her. I continued to use it both A.M. &amp; P.M. and the compliments kept pouring in. The rest of that week I had people that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while saying I was looking good, someone else said that my skin looked very very good, I was asked if I had always had good skin (wow!) and even a patient of mine made it a point to talk on length about the products I was using, and if they were affordable. I explained and said that paying a reasonable amount of money for something that, lo and behold, actually *works* is very much so affordable! Granted, using this nightly would be a little costly so I&#x27;ve decided to just use it on my eyes from now on and sometimes my whole face when my skin needs a little pick me up. It does wonders, and by looking at my face I swear this stuff makes me channel luminous Twilight vampire skin on demand.</li>
    <li> MANY of the  under-eye treatments that I have tried create an allergic reaction or cause my make up to smear(I have tried the gamut of price points).  This product is reasonably priced and did neither of these. Clean,  light, yet moisturizing. I like the pump application. Great  product!</li>
    <li> The delicate skin below my eyes has definitely improved! It is firmer and there are fewer lines that show up when I smile. I still have a little darkness under my eyes, but my concealer does the job just fine. I will continue to use this! Can&#x27;t beat something that is totally natural and effective!</li>
    <li> I like this product as an eye cream. It worked well under make up and did appear to brighten.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It is on the pricey side and was hesitant on buying it initially.  I am so glad I did.  I am a women of color and it is doing a great job in reducing my dark circles.  I hope my skin tone evens out completely after continual use.</li>
    <li> My search for a great eye cream is over. This is a light formula cream with little to no scent that gives my eye area great moisture without feeling greasy. A little is all that you need. The bonus is that it is not loaded with chemicals like other products out there. I am on my 3rd order of this wonderful eye cream. Has made a difference in brightening my delicate eye area. Would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used the I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment and would like to tell you this was probably my favorite product, although they were all equally great. I hate crow&#x27;s feet and the little lines around my mouth so anytime I find something that makes them less visible I am super happy and that is what this product did! A unique blend of natural oils and plant extracts instantly smooth out fine lines and wrinkles and you will see it start to work almost immediately! I can tell you I have tried several rather expensive products that do the same thing but why pay that high price when Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s is only $26.00!! It also helps with under eye shadows and puffiness and after 4 weeks of using you will see visible results. You can use this product in the morning and at night. Just gently apply a small amount on your ring finger and lightly dab all around the eyes.</li>
    <li> Havent seen much of a change but the eye area is well hydrated and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes,and that is a definite plus.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye treatment that really works for me,  after many products this is the one that improves the overall appearance of my eyes !!!  I &#x27;ll purchase again .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle, so I had to write a review. I was looking for an organic, 100% natural cream and when I found the I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment I had to give it a try. I fell in love with it after the first application and it totally exceeded my expectations. I apply it twice a day, in the morning under my concealer and at night before bedtime. It has a very light texture, not greasy at all, and it has a very light, pleasant smell which I love. The package is very nice, allows for a very easy application and the cream lasts for months.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two issues I have around my eyes are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) puffiness - if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, which is most nights as I have a baby, work a job, and also run my own small business.&lt;br /&gt;2) small lines beginning to form - I am about to turn 43&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sweetsation eye treatment helps both of my eye issues! I have used this for over a year, but I noticed a change within a couple of weeks of starting to use it. I put it on before bed, before my moisturizer and also in the morning, and I have virtually no puffiness despite being SOOO tired, and the fine lines around my eyes are greatly reduced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have run out a couple of times and thought maybe I didn&#x27;t need to use it any more, but after about a week, I noticed that the puffiness and lines return...so now I make sure not to run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that I can&#x27;t tell when I am about to run out, because of the way it is packaged. It is packaged in a pump so that you get every last drop, but you can&#x27;t tell when you are about to run out...it is just suddenly gone! So, now I make sure to have 2 on hand at all times, and when one runs out, I buy another.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 products from them about 2 months ago. AquaTica Organic Botanical Night Cream, I Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment, and Q Lumiere Organic Day Cream. My issues are not so much with the quality of the products. I love the creams. They smell divine, and keep my skin moisturized without making my sensitive skin break out or feel oily. I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about the products and recommended it to several friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an issue with the packaging breaking after using it for a month, but they were quick to reply and replace the item and always nice in the emails we exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love their attention to keeping a customer happy and the free samples that come with the order are an extra nice touch.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream!  It&#x27;s not oily or cheap feeling . . I don&#x27;t know how to describe it.  All I know is that it absorbs right into the skin.  Everyone always is shocked at my age when I tell them because they think I&#x27;m much younger.  It&#x27;s due to taking care of yourself and with these organic type products it&#x27;s easy!</li>
    <li> After seeing only high reviews about this item I thought to try this product but was disappointed.  I had switched from another eye cream that slightly lightened my dark circles to this and within a week my dark circles were back darker again.  I also have fine lines under my eyes and this product didn&#x27;t help one bit.  The packaging (label) also looks very cheap like someone printed it out from a home printer.  The product did not do anything for me.</li>
    <li> Have been suffering from long term chronic illness.  I am on just under 20 different meds.  This has taken a toll on my body and skin.  I started using the Sweetsation Therapy Products as I was looking for an organic (didn&#x27;t want anymore chemicals in or on my body).  I also have PCOS so this combined with the pharmacopeia has caused severe skin problems.  I am middle aged but my skin has cleared significantly, my eyes are noticeably less puffy and the dark circles have significantly reduced.  My skin is looking healthy and has a glow for the first time in a long time.  I have tried the cellular nutriserum, triple action anti-cellulite, day cream and have just started the advanced brightening.  I am extremely happy and excited to try other products from this line.  I have tried natural remedies and other organic products without even coming close to the results from Sweetsation.  So glad I found them.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles, puffy eyes and heavy eye creams tend to give me milia.  During this past winter, my under eye area was very irritated and dry.  I tried 3 or 4 other eye creams (without chemicals) and they all irritated my eyes.  This eye cream rated well on EWG and the reviews were good, so I tried it.  This cream diminished lines, circles and puffiness.  My eyes weren&#x27;t irritated, for once, and my milia almost completely went away.  I highly recommend this eye cream, especially if you have sensitive/irritated skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for an eye cream that&#x27;s economical and effective, and I can now say that I&#x27;ve found one!  A small amount of this cream goes a really long way!  A tiny pump is just enough to lather up my crows feet &amp; under-eye region, and still have a bit leftover on my finger to smooth over the laugh lines around my mouth.  After using this cream for just over a month, I was thrilled to already see some of my fine lines diminishing.  This treatment tends to \\&quot;cheer up\\&quot; and lighten the area around my eyes, and I find my morning puffiness to be retreating a lot quicker with its help!  It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT product, and it lasts quite some time.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite eye cream for 2 years. It&#x27;s non-greasy yet very moisturizing, and I saw the lines smoothed out under my eye area after 3 weeks use. The organic ingredients is a big plus. It is better than many brands of eye creams I have used in the past!</li>
    <li> I am writing this review as a return customer. When I got pregnant I wanted to find non-toxic, organic cosmetics and after doing lots of research (and I mean LOTS!), I found Sweetsation Therapy products. The eye cream is light, yet it seems to get the job done: my lower and upper eyelids look smooth and radiant. I used it day and night and the container (with handy pump) lasted for several months.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anybody looking for natural yet effective eye cream.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a high quality eye cream for years til I found this!!  which is made with natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and goes on easily, absorb into your skin like fast, and I already see the result.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this eye cream and I can honestly say it works! I have a medium light complexion and dark around my eyes. This product has really reduced my dark circles and smooths the fine lines. I think $26 for this product is absolutely reasonable, considering that I&#x27;ve paid up to $80 for eye creams in the past that didn&#x27;t work.  My purchase also came with a little free sample of their brightening face lotion and so far Im loving that too! Shipping only took 3 days. I&#x27;ll definitely continue to stick to this product AND I look forward to trying their other products! After many years of searching I think I&#x27;ve finally found a favorite line of products to stick to!</li>
    <li> First of all, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Sweetsation Therapy products. I was looking for a new skin care regimen with products that were not full of chemicals and after reading all the amazing reviews on Amazon, I started ordering some of the Sweetsation Therapy products. And now I can&#x27;t stop!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye Treatment for about 3 months now and it has definitely changed and improved the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes. My skin is super sensitive and finding an eye cream that works and doesn&#x27;t sting or make my eyes red has been a challenge. The area around my eyes look so much brighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try! You will not regret it!!!!</li>
    <li> I started using eye cream since I was in my mid 20s but for this type of products, it just seemed that nobody knew whether they actually work. Until I read all the reviews on Amazon and decided to give this organic eye product a try. To all my surprises, it really worked! My dark circles were not as visible after a couple of days, my entire eye area seemed smoother, brighter and the skin looks supple, like you always look after vacation. The creme itself is a mix of natural extract of fruits and herbs so it is very light and is absorbed super well around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second order now and I am looking forward to putting it on every day : )</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin. This is the only product I&#x27;ve  used that does not irritate my skin or cause blemishes. It has brightened the dark circles that plague me. Some puffiness also gone.</li>
    <li> I just had a few not very deep wrinkles around my eyes, and I used to use different unnatural brands before for my under eye treatments to get rid of them. They worked, but I was not completely satisfied, especially when I could not understand all of the words written on the bottle. Then I decided to start switching for more natural cosmetics, and tried other couple of brands, but I still was not completely happy. I thought it was just due to my age, and I just have to deal with those craw feet. Then I finally found this brand, and I am hooked. I cannot even see my wrinkles any more!!!  I definitely am going to keep using this lotion and getting more of it (and that&#x27;s coming from the person who likes to search for a new staff all the time, I believe those times are over:))</li>
    <li> ok so I ordered this product a week ago and I already can see a difference under my eye it says that it would take 3 weeks to get treated but oh my god its already becoming light under my eye I really recommend this product for fast results use it overnight and in the morning if u can</li>
    <li> I have always had trouble finding an eye cream that didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes - they are very sensitive.  This product is it - no problems and really made a difference with morning puffiness!!!</li>
    <li> I am relatively new to taking good care of my skin (just turned 30, so I figured it was about time). I work some crazy hours and my face really reflects that. Skeptical of eye cream in general, I decided to give this a try. And I am *very* happy I did. I ran out a while back and won&#x27;t be doing that again - it makes a huge overall difference in how I look/feel. This is definitely a staple in my skincare routine!</li>
    <li> First of all, I&#x27;m in my early twenties. I wear sunscreen religiously (I reapply multiple times a day as it wears off), wear sunglasses outside, and drink plenty of water. I bought this eye cream in the hopes of wrinkle prevention and helping to ease my dark circles a little bit/eye brightening. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle or anything, I&#x27;ve tried plenty of other creams for hyper pigmentation on my face for past acne scars, and was totally fine with waiting for results. I had been using a &amp;#34;Say yes to Carrots&amp;#34; eye cream before, the only benefit being hydration. When it ran out I decided to try something new. I came across this cream as it had an overwhelming amount of positive feedback. I did find it fishy that I could not see a review from any other site (Makeupalley, etc) but I decided 91 people couldn&#x27;t be wrong, right?! Besides, I had a similar run in with a &amp;#34;Vitamin C serum&amp;#34; from Amazon that was wonderful yet lacked reviews online. I WAS SO WRONG. I had to stop this this product today as I looked in the mirror this morning and noticed I was developing crows feet!!!! I have been using this product religiously, twice a day (once in morning once at night) as recommended by the positive reviews I saw. I had also used my past eye cream this way. Nothing else has changed in my routine, this is the only new addition.  I had started this upon May 23rd, and have been using this for three weeks. It was greasy, never really dried on my face correctly, and sometimes irritated the skin bellow my eye. This should have been a warning sign but the positive reviews kept me hopeful. I now regret my decision and hope that I can fix the effects this product had on my skin. I don&#x27;t drink a lot or party either and the people in my family age very well (we&#x27;re Asian!) so this is distressing to me. I expected that this product may not work and if anything would hydrate but it didn&#x27;t even do that and now I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
    <li> This is a nice rich cream but it irritate my eyes terribly. I do have sensitive eyes and was probably reacting to something in the cream. If you&#x27;re not allergic, it&#x27;s very nice and creamy and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> I have to say I have very dry skin under my eyes. I have used every type of eye cream from very expensive department store brands to the type you can purchase at a drug store. I do like this cream. It is very moisturizing. My lines and wrinkles seem to be a little less noticeable but of course they are not gone. The only thing that would do that for me would be surgery!!! I like the fact that my skin under my eyes stay hydrated during the day. I use it morning and night. I wait for a few minutes in the am before putting on my concealer. It is a good product. It is pricey but I find a little goes a long way. Also I do not experience any stinging, burning, itching, etc.</li>
    <li> I swear after the first night you see a noticeable difference. My bags got lighter, my eyes looked refreshed. The pump stopped working on the 3rd night but I emailed the company and they got back to me within a half hour saying to just hit the bottom of the tube on a water bottle or something with a top so it&#x27;ll hit the pump back into place. (After that it never broke again). Great customer service, great product. Even though it&#x27;s a little pricy I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Sad to say I did not see a huge mprovement. The product did last me two months, but the packaging is cheap,caused more fine lines around my eye and I will not repurchase. I gave two stars because it made my dark circles less noticeable but that&#x27;s just temporary and the samples they sent with it worked way better. They sent the scrub and the serum. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless eye creams over the years.  I originally tried this product because of its all natural ingredients.  I have continued to use the product because the results are fabulous!  It smells great, it feels great, it is a good value and I have seen the results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a uniformly &#x27;organic&#x27; person, but I love this product as it feels so natural and non-toxic. I loved it at first but then became enamored with another product for a while because I though it would work better. Well, I found that I not only loved the way it felt so natural, but it was helping more than I thought and in a bunch of different ways (reduce puffiness, smooth out lines, provide a soft invigorating boost to the area around the eyes without being toxic like many creams). So I came back to it. I love putting it on.</li>
    <li> My mom has bought me this two birthdays in a row now, and this time now knowing how awesome it is, I was so excited! I&#x27;m a firm believer in not using artificial ingredients and chemicals in body and face care, so I LOVE that the product is filled with healthful natural ingredients and I love how quickly I see results. The first week I used this, I noticed a great improvement in the bags under my eyes (something I wasn&#x27;t used to having, but once I hit 30 and had a big, stressful move across the country I couldn&#x27;t shake). I&#x27;ve also used some of the other products, and they&#x27;re all fabulous.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and goes on easily. A bit of a waxy feel, not much scent which I like. Probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to achieve 3 results: 1) It visibly brightens the area where it is applied. Maybe it contains a light reflecting substance? 2) Seems to tighten up the skin. I feel the tightening effect hours after applying it (it is an agreeable very subtle sensation) 3) It seems to nourish the area where it&#x27;s been applied. My skin is softer PLUS my lashes seem to be thicker! I could not go without this cream w/o feeling eye-naked.</li>
    <li> This product SMELLS DELICIOUS!!, and does a great job at moisturizing and finishing up my eye area after the cellular nutri serum. It&#x27;s made from the best organic ingredients, and quite a variety of them including everything you could want in a daily eye cream. I use it 2-3 times daily.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye treatment that really does what it says. I work 2 jobs and sometimes I don&#x27;t always get enough sleep. Adding this to my skin routine really started to make a difference. Their skin care line is amazing and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants OUTSTANDING quality products!</li>
    <li> This is a good brand but for some reason this product didn&#x27;t impress me as much as the masks and scrub. It feels nice and I like the applicator.</li>
    <li> This eye treatment has been such a find for me I struggle to find one that will help the skin around my eyes look and feel healthier by cutting down on puffiness, making wrinkles less noticeable and  illuminate the area but not make my sensitive eyes water.  I would highly recommend this product and the entire product line!</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this because so many people do, and of course we all want to find something that helps minimize whatever bothers us about our skin. I have dry, sensitive skin. My biggest skin issues are mild hormonal breakouts, milia, broken capailaries and hereditary dark circles &amp; puffiness. My dry skin usually exacerbates the problem by making my 32 yr old skin look wrinkled in my delicate eye folds. I have to say I see nothing significant about this cream. It doesn&#x27;t provide a lot of moisturizing effects for my skin and there has been no change at all in my dark circles. Sad.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I really don&#x27;t write many reviews but this is a product I truly am happy to have found. This cream is not too heavy and it feels very nice after you put it on. I first noticed results a week or two after first use. It doesn&#x27;t totally get rid of wrinkles but it does an excellent job at making them less noticeable. The dark circles under my eyes aren&#x27;t so dark either. I feel much more confident with the area around my eyes. I&#x27;m in my thirties and have more wrinkles than I feel I should have at this age.  This is a product I know for sure I will continue to use. This company&#x27;s Very Berry oxygen mask and Choco Smooth lip and face balm are some other of my favorites!</li>
    <li> i have dark circles and wanted a product that i could use with max effectiveness around the eyes minus any toxic additives and artificial fragrances. Thus fits the bill and starts working immediately</li>
    <li> I have tried many eye creams.  I have a problem with under eye circles.  I was ready to give up until I read the reviews of this product.  My skin is very sensitive which is what led to the dark circles to begin with.  Many of the skin cleansers I used dried my skin out and made the skin under my eyes darken.  Anyway, I tried using natural oils and other creams to rehydrate the sensitive area below my eyes but nothing worked.  The skin would get softer but the discoloration would remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pricey but by the time I discovered it, I would have paid twice as much for a product that works.  I love this product.  It lasts a long time and it is effective. The fact that it is all natural is just icing on the cake.  I highly recommend it and will use it for as long as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on trying some of the manufacturers other prooducts too.</li>
    <li> I am seriously hooked on Sweetsation products. This eye cream made a very noticeable difference in appearance of my always tired eyes. Would recommend to everyone. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because of all the positive reviews and because it is free of harmful chemicals. This was the second time I ordered the eye treatment and I love it. I have seen results! The crows feet around my eyes appear  to have diminished and my dark circles seem lighter. I would recommend this product to everyone. Please make it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> This is my second order. I&#x27;ve been looking a long time and spending a lot of money trying to find a product that makes my wrinkles smoother, reduces puffiness and lightens the under eye area. This product does it all!  Even my eyelids are starting to look better and I&#x27;m not getting millia which happens with creams that are too rich. I&#x27;m 50+ and this works better than the super-expensive creams that are advertised in department stores.  I am very pleased with the results!  Please keep making this product!</li>
    <li> I bought I*Light because I have dark circles under my eyes, my eyelid below my crease is darker than the area above my crease, and my eyelids seemed puffier while my undereye area seemed to be sinking in.  I&#x27;m only in my early 30s so I was a bit horrified at how quickly my eyes were changing. I also noticed that the outer corners of my eyes and the area above my eyelid crease were sagging.  I&#x27;ve never used eye creams before, but I wanted to at least try something before I did something drastic like cosmetic surgery.      I bought I*Light in January 2011 and I&#x27;ve used it twice a day since then.  The first thing that I noticed was that my eyelids stopped being so puffy.  The area underneath my eyes that looked sunken has almost returned to normal.  It&#x27;s not as sunken in as it was before.  My eyes are no longer sagging either.  As for the darkness, my eyelid below the crease is getting lighter.  It&#x27;s almost the same skin tone as my eyelid above the crease.   My undereye circles are still there, but they have faded a lot. I don&#x27;t have to use concealer on them when I wear makeup.  You can&#x27;t see them when I just use my foundation. I can really see a difference in the entire area.  It&#x27;s been about 2 months so far.  I&#x27;m still on the same tube.  I believe this tube will last for a while.  You only need a small amount for both eyes.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my eye area looks by summer.  My goal is to use I*Light for my eyes in addition to my serum http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EJIZK/ref&#x3D;as_li_ss_tl?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;tag&#x3D;dila-20&amp;linkCode&#x3D;as2&amp;camp&#x3D;1789&amp;creative&#x3D;390957&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B0027EJIZK to clear up my skin so that I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this eye cream.  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and many I find lacking--especially for how expensive they are! Not only is this one affordable but it&#x27;s actually got quite a bit in the bottle compared to many eye creams.  And a little goes a long way, I bought this three months ago and it&#x27;s only about half gone--and I use it every day.  It leaves the skin around my eyes taught and moisturized, but not shiny, like a lot of eye creams do.  It absorbs quickly but the effect lasts all day.  I am really self-conscious about the bags under my eyes (they aren&#x27;t that bad, but I am trying to keep them from getting worse) and I have noticed an improvement in the last few months from my daily use of this product.  Plus, it&#x27;s organic, which is so awesome.  Some of the eye creams have some really bazaar ingredients.  It&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m putting healthy ingredients on my skin.  I highly recommend this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I am trying to prevent wrinkles and minimize the beginning of crows feet on my skin. This has definitely helped! The skin around my eyes looks young and fresh after using this product.</li>
    <li> Perfect Eye cream. Light and moisturizing..Help with puffy eyes as well.</li>
    <li> While not miraculous it does a solid job of reducing puffiness and darns under the eyes. The dispenser mechanism is both useful and frustrating. Useful in that it has a nice slant to easily get out a small amount and use. Frustrating in that it often needs repeated priming. Also wish there was an easier way to tell when it is nearly empty. Regardless, it has been the most effective of the eye treatments I have tried.</li>
    <li> This brightning cream is magical.  I highly recommend it.  I am a new mom with lots of activity going on all the time.  Let&#x27;s just say that I am very sleep deprived.  The &amp;#34;I&#x27;Light&amp;#34; eye cream hides my tiredness, makes my eyes stand out and diminishes any darkness that would normally appear if I wasn&#x27;t using a product as good as this one.  I highly recommend it and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> Very good cream in every way.</li>
    <li> I have used many different dark circle and under eye puffiness treatments (cheap and expensive) and I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment is one of the best at quickly lightening the under eye area and reducing puffiness.</li>
    <li> This is my all-time favorite product by Sweetsation Therapy. I have very sensitive skin, especially my eyelids. I always suffered from scaly and raw eye lids. Eye shadow was never an option for me. I had tried many different products, and only Vaseline worked but wasn&#x27;t always comfortable. I was looking for natural products to try and stumbled upon Sweetsation Therapy and ordered some samples. Within a couple days of using iLight, my eyelids looked amazing, they weren&#x27;t raw feeling and didn&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;ve been using the iLight for over a year and have not had any of the problems return. When you have sensitive skin and finally find a product that works, it is exciting. Don&#x27;t let prices turn you away. A little goes a long way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the C*Perfect Skin Organic Foaming Face Cleanser, I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment and the Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment every day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, but it moisturizes the area around my eyes well and the effect lasts all day. Some of the fine lines smoothed out after a few weeks and my eyes don&#x27;t seem so puffy anymore from the lack of sleep. I love the light texture and the scent, and that it&#x27;s very gentle to the eyes. Plus this cream is full of wonderful ingredients that can only be good for the skin!</li>
    <li> After having a baby, my under eye circles looked horrible. I needed to find a good eye cream, so I started reading many reviews on Amazon. Based on the great reviews for the Sweetsation Eye Brightening Treatment I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so, so happy with this product! My dark, puffy under eye circles were much improved after using the cream for only a week or so. You really only need a half a pump like the directions state and I always apply it with my ring fingers, as suggested. When I first got it, I applied it in the morning and night (I would have put it on all day long to get rid of my dark circles!). After a month or so, I started using it only at night and my eyes still look great. Now I&#x27;m just afraid of running out! I think this should be on every new mom&#x27;s baby registry!</li>
    <li> This cream smells amazing, lasts forever and keeps my eyes (and surrounding area) looking bright and feeling moisturized. My eye area is very sensitive to products with fragrance and chemicals and reacts wonderfully to this light, but moisturizing cream. I tell all of my friends about this stuff. This is truly a fabulous product.</li>
    <li> This formula absorbs easily and definitely brightens the eye area and those pararenthesis by mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes lines nicely. Beautiful ingredients for around delicate eye area.&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser works well but use fingers and not tube to spread it.</li>
    <li> The I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment is a wonderful product.  I was searching for an all-natural product that would brighten the skin around my eyes, and this does the trick beautifully!  It is highly rated on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; website, which is where I found out about the product.  It smells like roses, but the scent is very clean and natural smelling, not fake-smelling.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore Sweetsation products. My passion for skincare lead me to become a licensed esthetician, and the search for a perfect product continued.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I came across Sweetsation products on Amazon! From the texture, to the scent, to the ingredients - I couldn&#x27;t find anything I didn&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;The eye cream feels very light, yet effective. Goes on very smooth and just like the rest of their products - smells really nice. I saw results the first morning after using it the night before, I ran to my husband shouting from excitement \\&quot;Look at my face! It&#x27;s glowing!\\&quot; And he smiled at me agreeing that my face really looked beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I do plan on renting a salon booth to do facial services, and I for sure would trust and choose to use their products on my clients!&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE to try it for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;~Love, Gintare.</li>
    <li> I have fair skin with dark circles and fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried many products which all promise amazing results that never seem to come to fruition and/or leave your skin feeling oily. I love that this is a naturally derived product that feels amazing on my skin and under my make up. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks so far but can see that the lines around my eyes have diminished and that the cream seems to reflect the light which makes my dark circles disappear. The packaging is unique and allows for easy application. This is a great product and I happily recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have used many eye treatments over the years, but this one is the best by far.  It does not contain all those toxic ingredients that are in far too many health and beauty products, which is very important to me.  The best thing about it is that it works!  I have very dark circles under my eyes that are hereditary, and getting rid of those is next to impossible.  I have definitely noticed a difference since I began using this product.  It brightens the appearance of my skin, smooths out fine lines, and moisturizes the under eye area very well.  I would recommend it without hesitation.</li>
    <li> This seems like a nice formula, but it is just not very moisturizing and I seem to realize no benefits from it. Also the cap will not stay on, alas, you cannot travel with this. it&#x27;s fine and not irritating, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful cream! I adore it! It really helps me. After one week of using it I saw the result. The skin became very elastic . dark circles are not so noticeable.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product with another purchase from Sweetsation Therapy.  Wow. ! Really hydrating and smooth going on and it really feels great on my skin.  So Happy to have found this company and use All of their organics for my Sweet Skin.  Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Sam Fitz</li>
    <li> I use Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye treatment every morning and night. It is wonderful in eliminating under eye puffiness and dark under-eye circles (which I have struggled with since my teen years). I have very sensitive eyes after LASIK, and have found this is the best product out there: it is incredibly effective and did not irritate my eyes!</li>
    <li> It a very light cream. Love it, after use my skin feels soft and smooth. I like the fact that it made from natural components and without harmful chemicals. And it is much cheaper than other organic creams.</li>
    <li> This is another wonderful product from Sweetstation. It goes on very light (not heavy or greasy, like some other eye creams), but a little goes a long way and it works great! My eyes are firmer, brighter, and more hydrated. I have to use much less under-eye concealer and I generally look perkier, healthier, and more awake. It&#x27;s great for use at both nighttime and during the day. For the natural ingredients and effectiveness, the price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I started using this I*Light Eye Treatment almost 2 years ago. At first, it didn&#x27;t work at all for my dark circles. I almost returned it, but am glad I didn&#x27;t. After about 5 weeks of using this product twice daily, my dark circles started to lighten. It took about 7 weeks for my dark circles to lighten to the point that they are barely visible. Before using this product, I would layer on under-eye concealer. Now, depending on what I&#x27;m doing during the day/night, I use no concealer or just a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I skip a couple applications of this cream, I do notice that my dark circles start to re-emerge, but it usually only takes 1 or 2 applications for them to lighten up again. At one point, I ran out of the Eye Treatment and it took me a week to order and receive more. At the end of that week, my black circles had really come back and it took several weeks for the Eye Treatment to fade them again. Now I make sure to always have an extra tube on hand. As another reviewer indicated, you can&#x27;t tell when the product is going to run out (because the tube is not see-through). I use only a tiny amount of the cream under and around my eyes, twice a day. One tube lasts me a little less than 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any puffiness around my eyes, so I can&#x27;t comment on how this product works for that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works GREAT for my dark circles and I will happily continue to purchase it!!! I just hope it is never discontinued!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s really light. Not greasy! I use it in the morning.... I will put it on before makeup. I&#x27;ve even applied it once my makeup is on....gives a &amp;#34;moist/healthy&amp;#34; look to my skin!.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream, but I can&#x27;t see any improvement with my dark eye circles. Smooth texture, I usually apply it before Concealer.</li>
    <li> I just received my third tube of this product and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed softening of fine lines around my eyes and feel like it also brightens the area under my eyes.  I only use a very small amount and the tube lasts me a couple of months. If you&#x27;re looking for a good eye treatment, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive upper eyelids that would get irritated by most moisturizers. This product has made the sensitive skin very smooth--wrinkles, flakiness and irritation gone.</li>
    <li> i have a very sensitive skin; and this product really works!!!! is excellent; i fell a very difference in my skin!!</li>
    <li> I am very Happy with this brand its the best I&#x27;ve ever used! By far! I would recommend to anybody!&lt;br /&gt;Derek</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and this is so gentile around my eye area.  It relieves my tired looking eyes, makeup goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mom but I also used it is very very good whitening the area under the eyes and reduce dark circles remove enough expression lines around the eyes</li>
    <li> Despite the many good reviews on this product, I had no luck. My dark circles did not change a bit after using it for 2 months 2x/day. It did not cause irritation to the skin or eyes but didn&#x27;t help either. It left a greasy film that didn&#x27;t really absorb into my skin so left under my eyes shiny and still dark/puffy, kind of a disappointment. Overall would not recommend, maybe you may have better luck but I did not see any results, sad to say.</li>
    <li> I purchased this alongside Aqua*Tica Night Cream and the Cucumber Day Cream and all these worked out great. When I decided to switch to organic skincare I was prepared that it will be hard to find something that works as well as the high end products I have been using... These Sweetsation products worked out great - and I have to say even better than many of the high end brand I have tried for the third of the price! I am very happy with these and would highly recommend for people looking for a good organic skincare product.</li>
    <li> Stung/burned eyes....would not purchase again.  Not good for sensitive eyes -- still on the hunt for something more gentle.  :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about a month now to combat a serious case of dark circles caused by particularly stressful episode at work. My dark circles disappeared within a week! I have started using this cream all over my face now and it looks and feels great. Previously I have used Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment cream from this company and loved it, but this cream feels richer and more effective. Its just more expensive than what I am comfortable with, so I just have to keep an eye out for discounts to buy this.</li>
    <li> I got the small sample from the previous merchandise purchase, I felt it was good eye cream, so I just order it after finishing the sample. Not sure if it is the same with the sample, this time with the real product, I feel it is ok .</li>
    <li> Everytime I wash my face I apply this around my eyes. It feels so soothing on my skin and it has a rich consistency. Since becoming a new mom this eye cream has helped so much to minimize my dark circles and puffiness from sleepless nights. I also noticed that this cream has helped reduce my fine lines around my eyes. This eye cream has such a refreshing smell and what makes it  even better, its all natural...</li>
    <li> This is my second time buying this eye treatment. My dark eye circles did seem to improve while I used the last tube. However, my improved work and rest habits might have helped too.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. The best part is that it&#x27;s toxin-free. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few months, and can see that my eyes look brighter and it has smoothed out my fine lines. I love the pump container because it make it easy to pump out just what you need instead of putting your finger in a jar like some of the other eye creams I&#x27;ve used. I also love the smell. It reminds me of roses. I&#x27;m so happy I found Sweetsation Therapy and plan to try some of there other products. nw</li>
    <li> Every time I use I*Light eye treatment on the delicate around eye area, I feel good, because I know that the product I use is made from natural and organic ingredients without artificial fragrances and harsh chemicals. It is very light and is absorbed into the skin very quickly, even though it is made from plant oils. I have allergies and very often I wake up with puffy eyes, and this eye treatment really helps me to deal with that: it minimizes the puffiness in a few minutes. It also de-congests and lightens the eye area. One day I did an experiment and applied the treatment only around one eye and pretty soon I could feel and see the difference, as compared to the other eye that was not treated. I am very glad that I found this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great, moisturizing eye area sufficiently but not greasy, I also like the pump design--it is convenient and avoid contaminating the cream.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews and I&#x27;m so happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;I love this eye treatment, it is light and goes on easily.  I like the tip about using the two ring fingers to apply for the lightest touch.  I have noticed that the fine lines around my eyes are getting less visible.  A big plus is that it&#x27;s organic, can&#x27;t beat that!&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, this is a fantastic bargain for the money!</li>
    <li> My whole adult life I have had under eye bags and dark circles. It sort of runs in my family...so although I have gone thru times where I would randomly try creams and lotions to help with this, I had pretty much resigned to the fact that I was stuck with them. I also have EXTREMELY sensitive eyes - made more so after having Lasik eye surgery for some reason.... This made finding any eye cream that I could use difficult to say the least, because it seems that companies insist on putting heavy perfumes into their products, so the instant I put any of their eye creams around my eyes- they would burn and sting. WHY do they do this I keep wondering??? It is delicate skin and a lot of people have sensitive eyes- but they continue to do it (I mean, who cares if the skin around your eyes smells like flowers anyway!?!?!)....a week ago - after purchasing a VERY expensive high end eye cream from Lancome (a desperate attempt right after my 37th birthday and seeing what time and avoiding using creams was now beginning to do to my under eyes) I had high hopes...I mean, it cost a small fortune, and they are a reputable company...well- after attempting THREE different days to put their cream on- I ended up chucking it in the garbage (the place I bought it from did not accept returns) ...it burned my skin and eyes so badly- that I actually one night had to splash cold water onto my eyes for a few minutes to get it off my skin. Saddened, frustrated - and feeling like a fool for spending the money (yet again) on a product heavy with chemicals and perfumes- I turned to my favorite place Amazon -and did a desperate search for organic eye cream. At this point I didn&#x27;t care if it helped with the puffiness or dark circles- I just wanted something I could put around my eyes that would help the skin stay healthy and didn&#x27;t feel like I had wiped acid on my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my Amazon search brought me to this wonderful product. After reading the great reviews and list of organic ingredients - I decided to make one last attempt. I have only been using it for a few days- but I can say this. I am completely THRILLED and overjoyed by this eye cream. I actually felt like crying after the first time I put it on because it was so amazingly gentle. I am hoping long term it will do what it says and get rid of my puffiness and dark circles - but just in the few days since I started putting it on 2 times a day - I can see miracle type improvements....even my mom, who never notices anything about me really, commented that I looked more awake today when she saw me, and asked if I had been sleeping better....she didn&#x27;t know what the difference was in my face - but that is a strong testament to what this cream has done for my eyes so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle and has no scent - it glides on and is not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a lonnnnng way.....it doesn&#x27;t take very much at all, and compared to other brands out there- this is incredibly affordable; you get a lot of product for the price. I have paid 3 times the money for other eye creams and they all ended up in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes the skin around my eyes softer than they have ever been in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time ever - my make up doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on top of my skin under my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t make the wrinkles look worse or pasty, because my skin is moisturized my make up glides on and stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes did not burn or water when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puffiness and dark circles seem to be fading- they are not there yet...but it has been only a few days, I do feel that with continued use they will keep disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package arrive UBER fast- days before the quoted delivery date- and it had 2 small samples of other products- their day cream that has a wonderful light smell of cucumbers (LOVE) that fades within a few minutes after applying. It did not have that icky heavy perfume scent that other face creams have and to my amazement it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout, which other face creams have done. I am almost thru my sample and will be ordering a full size within the next few days as I am really impressed with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not say enough about how much I love this eye cream -and I am eager to try the rest of their line!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great organic product goes on non greasy and removes dark circles under my eyes. Takes a few weeks to work, overall very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> The product boasts plenty of natural and organic ingredients plus they sent it with a free tiny sample of their brightening cream but I honestly think it&#x27;s mainly water with less than 1% of the other stuff. And their brightening cream leaves an oily residue that dries and gets hard quickly. This eye cream is overpriced for its benefits and the applicator tip is entirely too wide, better to apply with your fingers. You will also lose any remaining product in the cylinder because once the stuff stops coming out of the pump you cannot access the rest and it&#x27;s time to get a new tube. it absorbs easily and provides some moisture but it doesn&#x27;t provide anything else, no lift, no diminishing of lines, no dark circle correction, etc.,  I&#x27;m in my late twenties and there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference when using this cream compared to my everyday moisturizer. Not something I could see myself purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have second thoughts of purchasing this product because of its good review. However after using it for a month I didn&#x27;t see any results at all. Waste of money. The only thing I like about this is the packaging and it really moisturizes my under eye.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading various customer reviews on Amazon website. After only a week applying twice a day on area around my eyes, It was such a pleasant  surprise to see my left eye&#x27;s upper lid was no longer as drooping. Before, my left eye used to look much smaller than the right one due to the drooping upper lid, now they appear to be relatively the same size. Not only that, my girlfriends said my eyes now look bigger and fine lines are diminishing too. That&#x27;s amazing !</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of the eye cream from Sweetsation Therapy, and I only see continue seeing great results.&lt;br /&gt;Dark circles are much much lighter, skin around the eye area is smoother and soft. Love this cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using their eye treatment for six months nightly.  I have reduced puffiness in the morning and the lines on the corners of my eyes are less pronounced.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and is easily to apply.  I like the slim application bottle too.  It&#x27;s fits easily in my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> another success for sweetsations. A great addition to my beauty routine, non greasy and very effective. It definitely keeps me looking bright eyed and bushy tailed even on just a few hours sleep!</li>
    <li> Like this cream! A lot! The best one I had! No irritation, makes the eye lines smother and the under eyes brighter! Good results! I recommend it!</li>
    <li> It made me break out and I hardly break out with any products.  I threw the remainder in trash.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend who has really loved it. This is the second time she orders this product. It has really helped her with her puffy eyes, she has tried other products after but saids this one she loves. As soon as she applies the cream she automatically sees how fast the product works for her. She is so happy with it cause it has really kept the puffy and bags away. Love that the product is organic and natural. She will continue to order more. The product is a bit pricey but ALL worth it she saids. Thank you for making my girlfriend happy Sweetsation!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I think I finally found the right eye cream after spending a lot of time and money on other products!  Definitely will reorder.  Lightens the dark spots around the undereye and also makes the skin on my eyelids much smoother!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a day for four months. I haven&#x27;t noticed even a slight difference in my under eye circles. I  don&#x27;t care about it being a good moisturizer or primer, that&#x27;s not it&#x27;s for and not why I got it ... Haven&#x27;t even finished the tube but it&#x27;s going in the garbage. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a couple of weeks and have seen no difference. It is very soothing to the skin. Fragrance is too strong. It gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Have had a long history of using various eye creams that would work for a little while, then lose their efficacy.  Some were good, for a little while, then for some weird reason would stop working.  Some completely dried out the skin around my eyes, which still boggles my mind.  Others, due to their consistency, would seep into my eyes and irritate them so I looked like a....well....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this cream due to the high reviews &amp; nice comments not expecting this one to be much different.  Well, this one is different.  This one is on the the best eye creams I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s contents are more natural and less toxic than other creams.  I love that it lives up to its promise of brightening the eye area.  I like that it has a pump vs an open container where you would continually stick your finger in and contaminate the product.  I like that it feels light and not like I smeared Crisco all over my eyes.  In short, I like this product.  I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my eyes is very challenging to work with as I have extremely dry/sensitive skin and am an insomniac to boot.  All this would result in the obvious traits you would think:  premature aging, dried out skin, deep wrinkling, loss of skin pigmentation, the whole nine yards of eye skin hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little cream helps to give me a look that is fresh, bright, rested and moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the vendor is very good with shipping items quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone that has struck out on previous eye creams.  I think you&#x27;ll find yourself pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merci!</li>
    <li> Moisturizers the area around my eyes better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t irritate that area. I have tried other products that contain hyaluronic acid and/or other &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; ingredients, and most of them have caused a rash. I&#x27;m sticking with Sweetsation Therapy - it works, it&#x27;s gentle, and it feels good.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this eye cream is natural and doesn&#x27;t have any weird chemicals. That being said, it is a decent moisturizer but really didn&#x27;t do much to brighten or smooth my eye area. I used it for a month straight and really didn&#x27;t see any results. Based on the excellent reviews, I thought it was going to do more. I would have given 3 stars but I feel that the price combined with the lack of results knocked off one star. The search continues for the perfect eye cream...</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought this eye cream by Sweetsation Therapy. What I like about this particular brand is the organic ingredients and the rich, creamy texture. Best of all, it doesn&#x27;t sting! After moving to Las Vegas, I was attacked by allergies to the desert blooming plants. My eyes were constantly watering and the delicate skin around my eyes became red, swollen and very irritated. I never had bags under my eyes and I looked awful. I tried several different eye creams (some expensive) and they stung like crazy! They aggravated the condition! I was already using the Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Skin Brightening / Whitening Repair Treatment, so I decided to invest in their eye cream. After a short time, (and using Zaditor Allergy drops on my eyes twice a day to stop the excessive tearing), the puffiness around my eyes went away and the skin around my eyes was much healthier and smoother. I use this cream twice a day and my eyes look pretty young for my 51 years! I should mention that I sleep on my back, so I think that prevents wrinkles around the eyes (I recommend it to all ladies concerned about aging around the eyes).</li>
    <li> I have been using eye creams for decades and am constantly on the search for the perfect treatment.  I love to search for new products to try on Amazon by reading user reviews.  That&#x27;s how I came to find this product.  I&#x27;m on my third purchase and I have to say this is truly a great product.  I use is mainly for the moisturizing benefits and not so much for dark circles, but I&#x27;ve noticed that after I apply it my eyes are so soft and moist!  It is not the least bit irritating to me and I use it on upper lids and lower eye area.  Even though it makes my eye area extremely moist, I can use it under my makeup with no problems. I also love the applicator.  It&#x27;s so unique and its a generous size for the price.  One applicator lasts me about 6 months and I use it every morning and night.  I am pleased to have finally ended my search and found the perfect eye creme that I plan on using for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tired the spf moisturizer from this brand and it was too white for me. But luckily they sent ILight sample. I Love the texture and it&#x27;s a really good value! It goes on well under my concealer. I&#x27;m really trying to stay away from toxic beauty products. This is a great all around eye-cream at a great price!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for about one year and absolutely love it!  I was alternating using Derma-e at night and I*Light in the morning, but my skin felt so much smoother and silkier with the I*Light so this is the only cream that I use.  I&#x27;m vegan so I appreciate the all natural aspects of the cream and feel good about using it.  It&#x27;s also wonderful when natural products, like I*Light, that are good for the environment and your body produce incredible results.  I*Light is the only eye cream I will use!  It keeps my skin around my eyes smooth, healthy and moisturized.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I started using it when it was sent as a sample with one of my orders placed with Sweetsation.  I ran out of my sample and just had to order the regular size because it has worked so well.  I have always had dark undereye circles and have tried a few other products.  The I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment is one of the only things to actually work.  My undereye area looks so much lighter and smoother!!  I also adore Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s customer service!  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this item or any of their other skincare products.</li>
    <li> I love that&#x27;s all natural and it goes on so smoothly and easily.  I love the way my eye area feels after it&#x27;s appllied.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I use it every day. I only use a half pump, and this is enough to cover both under-eye areas. I had trouble with puffiness and dark circles in the morning, and this product has taken away the sleepy look (even though I wasn&#x27;t sleepy). I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE the way this smells.  I didnt notice any difference in my skin after using this for a month.</li>
    <li> For over a year have used this very effective natural product.  Since eyes are so sensitive it is great that this does the job of reducing puffiness and helps reduce crows feet. A small amount goes along way and the smell is plesasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other have stated it would be nice to know when it is almost empty, so perhaps the packaging can be changed to help with that problem.</li>
    <li> Being using this product for about a year and it has helped a bit to make my eye look less tired.</li>
    <li> Everyone is different.  This product did nothing for me at all.  Would not purchase again. Doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work on others.</li>
    <li> The I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment from Sweetsation Therapy is one of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve ever used. After using it twice a day for over 4 months now, I&#x27;ve noticed a great reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;m all about organic, non-toxic skincare and this eye cream fits the bill!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this a while ago and was very pleased with it. When I use it, it smells great and I use it every night before I go to sleep along with the rest of my products. It may not seem apparent at first on the effects, but after a while (for me it was 2 weeks) when you look in the mirror you can see it fading! I guess it really just matters on the long term benefits it gives you and not the immediate ones. :DD I love it! Just add a little bit on your ring fingers and dab it under your eyes gently. The results will come in time.</li>
    <li> Great product. My third order!</li>
    <li> I love this whole line. This eye cream is really nice. It&#x27;s lightweight and really does instantly brighten as well as lighten over time. The price is right too especially for how long this product will last you. I have rarely need to wear under eye concealer thanks to this product!</li>
    <li> This eye treatment is so unique and has such awesome ingredients in it its very special. I am not a huge fan of eye creams but this one is a total keeper . its works very well and does not give me any problems at all I love it&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I do not like the results I received from using this cream. It smells nice but, I have not seen any lightening effect around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Sweetsation Therapy products for several months, and love the way my skin feels and looks.  I have not used any other products on my face since first trying them.  Most of all, I like the peace-of-mind knowing they are organic and actually good for me. I like not having to worry what chemicals or additives being put on my skin.</li>
    <li> My wife received a sample of this product on a previous order, and when she tried it, she loved the product. She said that the eye cream has a very light feel to it, and it is easy to apply to the eye area with no tugging or pulling to damage the fragile skin around the eyes. She said it is very nourishing, and it absorbs easily and quickly into the skin. She loves the results of this product!</li>
    <li> after comparing numerous reviews, I chose I*light eye treatment, particularly because it&#x27;s organic &amp; i trust sweetsations&#x27; other products. I tried the cream for about a week, didn&#x27;t notice much change. i was kinda hoping for a miracle and decided to experiment with a few other under-eye creams, including one I made by combining organic ingredients. about a month ago, after falling in love with the sweetsation very berry masque and scrub, i decided to give the I*light another go. despite 3 other, lovely eye creams on the shelf, i find myself reaching for the I*light every morning after washing my face and every evening before going to bed. the treatment is light and hydrating and appears to brighten the under-eye area effectively. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin and has a light pleasant smell.  It did nothing for for my fine lines.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was stuck on using department store brands thinking that the more expensive the better.  Now that I have found this, I will not be going back.  This works better than what I was using. I noticed my fine lines were smoother using this than with the other brands.  I did not notice a brightening but definitely a line smoothing. It&#x27;s got a great botanical smell and feels very hydrating when you put it on.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is 2 minor cons: #1, the pump is a little stiff and a sometimes it would squirt out much more than I needed. #2, when the tube ran out and didn&#x27;t pump anymore it still felt heavy as if there was still a good amount of product in there.  I hate the feeling that I&#x27;m wasting it!  It&#x27;s too good to waste!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I broke open the tube and did find a little bit still in there, about another weeks worth of product. Also, I received my new order and the pump on this tube is less stiff than the first one. It must have just been a stiff pump for my first order.  This one is much better. I love this product!</li>
    <li> the first few seconds you think,, oh this works great as the product , as their whole line smells amazing. However once you put any kind of make up over it, even after letting it dry and only padding it in the skin, it&#x27;s like nothing ever happened.&lt;br /&gt;For this price I stick to the less expensive products from Roc and L;oreal that seem to even show for a few hours a bit of a better affect.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles &amp; wrinkles around my eyes. In the evening, I put this stuff on and in the morning I wash it off and after an hour my eyes look less tired and I look more awake! I am excited to try the other products to see if they work as well as this!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive eyes, this cream does not irritate them and feels very&lt;br /&gt;nice on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have had puffy eyes because of allergies as well as living the college life and getting no sleep. This brings it down dramatically. It also lightens up the skin under the eyes. This is the only product i use for my eyes. Thank you sweetsensation!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it all of the time because of the price but other than that it works and seems to be very safe.</li>
    <li> I try to use only natural chemical and artificial ingredient free skin care products. This eye cream delivers everything it says it will and even though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days, I saw instant results in terms of puffiness and a more relaxed, well-rested look. The cream feels very comfortable on with absolutely no side effects. I usually apply once in the morning, a touch up during the day and before bed at night and so far, I love the results. You won&#x27;t be sorry you invested in this great eye cream; runs circles around the high end, pricey, promise-the-world and then some expensive dermatologist-created, scientifically based snake oils out there. I&#x27;m excited to try the other products from this line.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all.  I like that it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients.  Again, it&#x27;s not earth shattering like a lot of people who review this brand&#x27;s products seem to say, but it&#x27;s solid.</li>
